photopolymerization of radical and cationic systems is one strategy to generate polymer network architectures named interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs). In these hybrid systems, phase separation and final polymer morphology are ultimately governed by thermodynamic incompatibility and polymerization kinetics. This behavior is quite complex, as numerous factors can affect polymerization kinetics including monomer\/oligomer viscosity and structure, light intensity, photoinitiator content and absorbance, cross-linking, vitrification, etc. In this work, the impact of photoinitiator concentration and monomer fraction on surface morphologies in a hybrid radical\/cationic phase-separated system was examined. Wrinkles formed on the surface of photopolymerized films depend on the polymerization rate and acrylate\/epoxy ratio. This phenomenon is partially explained by the rapid polymerization rate associated with the development of an epoxy matrix and a smaller acrylate domain. The size and shape of the wrinkles can be controlled by varying formulation parameters (mainly, composition) and photoinitiator content. It was possible to create surface roughness and consequently decrease the gloss by controlling the polymerization kinetics and phase-separated morphology. This study demonstrates that the morphology, polymerization kinetics, and film properties (e.g., gloss, transparency) can be manipulated with the ratio of the acrylate\/epoxy mixture and the photoinitiator content.","1":"The effect of urea and ethanol additives on aqueous solutions of poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS), poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDADMA), and their complexation interactions are examined here via molecular dynamics simulations, interconnected laser Doppler velocimetry, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. It is found that urea and ethanol have significant, yet opposite influences on PSS and PDADMA solvation and interactions. Notably, ethanol is systematically depleted from solvating the charge groups but condenses at the hydrophobic backbone of PSS. As a consequence of the poorer solvation environment for the ionic groups, ethanol significantly increases the extent of counterion condensation. On the other hand, urea readily solvates both polyelectrolytes and replaces water in solvation. For PSS, urea causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding of the PSS headgroup with water. In PSS-PDADMA complexation, these differences influence changes in the binding configurations relative to the case of pure water. Specifically, added ethanol leads to loosening of the complex caused by the enhancement of counterion condensation; added urea pushes polyelectrolyte chains further apart because of the formation of a persistent solvation shell. In total, we find that the effects of urea and ethanol rise from changes in the microscopic-level solvation environment and conformation resulting from solvating water being replaced by the additive. The differences cannot be explained purely via considering relative permittivity and continuum level electrostatic screening. Taken together, the findings could bear significance in tuning polyelectrolyte materials' mechanical and swelling characteristics via solution additives.","2":null,"3":"We perform simulations to compute the effective potential between the centers-of-mass of two polymers with reversible bonds. We investigate the influence of the topology on the potential by employing linear and ring backbones for the precursor (unbonded) polymer, finding that it leads to qualitatively different effective potentials. In the linear and ring cases the potentials can be described by Gaussians and generalized exponentials, respectively. The interactions are more repulsive for the ring topology, in analogy with known results in the absence of bonding. We also investigate the effect of the specific sequence of the reactive groups along the backbone (periodic or with different degrees of randomness), establishing that it has a significant impact on the effective potentials. When the reactive sites of both polymers are chemically orthogonal so that only intramolecular bonds are possible, the interactions become more repulsive the closer to periodic the sequence is. The opposite effect is found if both polymers have the same types of reactive sites and intermolecular bonds can be formed. We test the validity of the effective potentials in solution, in a broad range of concentrations from high dilution to far above the overlap concentration. For this purpose, we compare simulations of the effective fluid and test particle route calculations with simulations of the real all-monomer system. Very good agreement is found for the reversible linear polymers, indicating that unlike in their nonbonding counterparts many-body effects are minor even far above the overlap concentration. The agreement for the reversible rings is less satisfactory, and at high concentration the real system does not show the clustering behavior predicted by the effective potential. Results similar to the former ones are found for the partial self-correlations in ring\/linear mixtures. Finally, we investigate the possibility of creating, at high concentrations, a gel of two interpenetrated reversible networks. For this purpose we simulate a 50\/50 two-component mixture of reversible polymers with orthogonal chemistry for the reactive sites, so that intermolecular bonds are only formed between polymers of the same component. As predicted by both the theoretical phase diagram and the simulations of the effective fluid, the two networks in the all-monomer mixture do not interpenetrate, and phase separation (demixing) is observed instead.","4":null,"5":"Fatty acid epoxies serve as valuable starting materials for the development of bio-based polyesters. Here we present a new and efficient catalytic process that allows for the copolymerization of fatty acid-based epoxides and various cyclic anhydrides under attractive process conditions affording functional polyesters. The degree of functionalization and the nature of the polymer backbone can be modulated via monomer design. Postpolymerization cross-linking processes were examined to create rigid macromolecular networks that build on orthogonal polyester functionality, creating possible entries for materials with switchable thermal and mechanical properties.","6":"Thermoresponsive polymers with the appropriate structure form physical networks upon changes in temperature, and they find utility in formulation science, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. Here, we report a cost-effective biocompatible alternative, namely OEGMA30015-b-BuMA26-b-DEGMA13, which forms gels at low concentrations (as low as 2% w\/w); OEGMA300, BuMA, and DEGMA stand for oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (MM = 300 g mol-1), n-butyl methacrylate, and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, respectively. This polymer is investigated in depth and is compared to its commercially available counterpart, Poloxamer P407 (Pluronic F127). To elucidate the differences in their macroscale gelling behavior, we investigate their nanoscale self-assembly by means of small-angle neutron scattering and simultaneously recording their rheological properties. Two different gelation mechanisms are revealed. The triblock copolymer inherently forms elongated micelles, whose length increases by temperature to form worm-like micelles, thus promoting gelation. In contrast, Pluronic F127's micellization is temperature-driven, and its gelation is attributed to the close packing of the micelles. The gel structure is analyzed through cryogenic scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Ex vivo gelation study upon intracameral injections demonstrates excellent potential for its application to improve drug residence in the eye.","7":null,"8":"The reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) aqueous dispersion polymerization of 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) using a poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) (PGMA) precursor is an important prototypical example of polymerization-induced self-assembly. 4-Hydroxybutyl acrylate (HBA) is a structural isomer of HPMA, but the former monomer exhibits appreciably higher aqueous solubility. For the two corresponding homopolymers, PHBA is more weakly hydrophobic than PHPMA. Moreover, PHBA has a significantly lower glass transition temperature (T g) so it exhibits much higher chain mobility than PHPMA at around ambient temperature. In view of these striking differences, we have examined the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of HBA using a PGMA precursor with the aim of producing a series of PGMA57-300-PHBA100-1580 diblock copolymer nano-objects by systematic variation of the mean degree of polymerization of each block. A pseudo-phase diagram is constructed using transmission electron microscopy to assign the copolymer morphology after employing glutaraldehyde to cross-link the PHBA chains and hence prevent film formation during grid preparation. The thermoresponsive character of the as-synthesized linear nano-objects is explored using dynamic light scattering and temperature-dependent rheological measurements. Comparison with the analogous PGMA x -PHPMA y formulation is made where appropriate. In particular, we demonstrate that replacing the structure-directing PHPMA block with PHBA leads to significantly greater thermoresponsive behavior over a much wider range of diblock copolymer compositions. Given that PGMA-PHPMA worm gels can induce stasis in human stem cells (see Canton et al., ACS Central Science, 2016, 2, 65-74), our findings are likely to have implications for the design of next-generation PGMA-PHBA worm gels for cell biology applications.","9":"We have investigated an all-polymer nanocomposite (NC) consisting of single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) immersed in a matrix of linear chains of their precursors (25\/75% composition in weight). The SCNPs were previously synthesized via \"click\" chemistry, which induces intramolecular cross-links in the individual macromolecules accompanied by a slight shift (5-8 K) of the glass transition temperature toward higher values and a broadening of the dynamic response with respect to the raw precursor material. The selective investigation of the dynamics of the NC components has been possible by using properly isotopically labeled materials and applying quasielastic neutron scattering techniques. Results have been analyzed in the momentum transfer range where the coherent scattering contribution is minimal, as determined by complementary neutron diffraction experiments with polarization analysis. We observe the development of dynamic heterogeneity in the intermediate scattering function of the NC components, which grows with increasing time. Local motions in the precursor matrix of the NC are accelerated with respect to the reference bulk behavior, while the displacements of SCNPs' hydrogens show enhanced deviations from Gaussian and exponential behavior compared with the pure melt of SCNPs. The resulting averaged behavior in the NC coincides with that of the pure precursor, in accordance with the macroscopic observations by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments.","10":"Photocurable polymers are used ubiquitously in 3D printing, coatings, adhesives, and composite fillers. In the present work, the free radical polymerization of photocurable compounds is studied using reactive classical molecular dynamics combined with a dynamical approach of the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD). Different concentrations of radicals and reaction velocities are considered. The mechanical properties of the polymer resulting from 1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate systems are characterized in terms of viscosity, diffusion constant, and activation energy, whereas the topological ones through the number of cycles (polymer loops) and cyclomatic complexity. Effects like volume shrinkage and delaying of the gel point for increasing monomer concentration are also predicted, as well as the stress-strain curve and Young's modulus. Combining ab initio, reactive molecular dynamics, and the D-NEMD method might lead to a novel and powerful tool to describe photopolymerization processes and to original routes to optimize additive manufacturing methods relying on photosensitive macromolecular systems.","11":"We combine small-angle scattering experiments and simulations to investigate the internal structure and interactions of composite poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PNIPAM-PEG) microgels. At low temperatures the experimentally determined form factors and the simulated density profiles indicate a loose internal particle structure with an extended corona that can be modeled as a starlike object. With increasing temperature across the volumetric phase transition, the form factor develops an inflection that, using simulations, is interpreted as arising from a conformation in which PEG chains are incorporated in the interior of the PNIPAM network. This gives rise to a peculiar density profile characterized by two dense, separated regions, at odds with configurations in which the PEG chains reside on the surface of the PNIPAM core. The conformation of the PEG chains also have profound effects on the interparticle interactions: Although chains on the surface reduce the solvophobic attraction typically experienced by PNIPAM particles at high temperatures, PEG chains inside the PNIPAM network shift the onset of attractive interaction at even lower temperatures. Our results show that by tuning the morphology of the composite microgels, we can qualitatively change both their structure and their mutual interactions, opening the way to explore new collective behaviors of these objects.","12":"Highly linear or high-density polyethylenes (HDPEs) have an intrinsically high nucleation density compared to other polyolefins. Enhancing their nucleation density by self-nucleation is therefore difficult, leading to a narrow self-nucleation Domain (i.e., the so-called Domain II or the temperature Domain where self-nuclei can be injected into the material without the occurrence of annealing). In this work, we report that when HDPE is blended (up to 50%) with immiscible matrices, such as atactic polystyrene (PS) or Nylon 6, its self-nucleation capacity can be greatly increased. In addition, temperatures higher than the equilibrium melting temperature of the HDPE phase are needed to erase the significantly enhanced crystalline memory in the blends. Morphological evidence gathered by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopies (SEM and TEM) indicates that these unexpected results can be explained by the modification of the interface between blend components. The filling of the solid HDPE surface asperities by the low viscosity polystyrene during heating to the self-nucleation temperature, or the crystallization of the matrix in the case of Nylon 6, enhances the interface roughness between the two polymers in the blends. Such rougher interfaces can remarkably increase the self-nucleation capacity of the HDPE phase via surface nucleation.","13":"The correlation function for the exit of poloxamer copolymers from equilibrated micelles is found to show up to four regimes depending on the chain flexibility: an initial fast reorganization, a logarithmic intermediate regime, followed by an exponential intermediate regime, and a final exponential decay. The logarithmic intermediate regime has been observed experimentally and attributed to the polydispersity of the polymer samples. However, we present dynamic single-chain mean-field theory simulations with chains of variable flexibility which show the same logarithmic relaxation but with strictly monodisperse systems. In agreement with our previous studies, we propose that this logarithmic response arises from a degeneracy of energy states of the hydrophobic block in the micelle core. For this to occur, a sufficiently large number of degenerate conformational states are required, which depend on the polymer flexibility and therefore should not be present for rigid polymers. Experimental results for monodisperse polymeric samples claiming the absence of such a logarithmic response may also lack a sufficient number of hydrophobic blocks for the required number of configurational states for this type of response to be seen. The insight gained from analyzing the simulation results allows us to propose a modified Eyring equation capable of reproducing the observed dynamic behavior. On scaling experimental results from different sources and systems according to this equation, we find a unique master curve showing a universal nature of the intermediate regimes: the logarithmic regime together with the secondary exponential decay. The terminal exponential regime at long times proposed by the standard Halperin and Alexander model is beyond the range of the data analyzed in this article. The universality observed suggests an entropic origin of the short-time dynamic response of this class of systems rather than the polydispersity.","14":"We study active topological glass under spherical confinement, allowing us to exceed the chain lengths simulated previously and determine the critical exponents of the arrested conformations. We find a previously unresolved \"tank-treading\" dynamic mode of active segments along the ring contour. This mode can enhance active-passive phase separation in the state of active topological glass when both diffusional and conformational relaxation of the rings are significantly suppressed. Within the observational time, we see no systematic trends in the positioning of the separated active domains within the confining sphere. The arrested state exhibits coherent stochastic rotations. We discuss possible connections of the conformational and dynamic features of the system to chromosomes enclosed in the nucleus of a living cell.","15":"Polymeric assemblies, such as micelles, are gaining increasing attention due to their ability to serve as nanoreactors for the execution of organic reactions in aqueous media. The ability to conduct organic transformations, which have been traditionally limited to organic media, in water is essential for the further development of important fields ranging from green catalysis to bioorthogonal chemistry. Considering the recent progress that has been made to expand the range of organometallic reactions conducted using nanoreactors, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the roles of the hydrophobicity of both the core of micellar nanoreactors and the substrates on the reaction rates in water. Toward this goal, we designed a set of five metal-loaded micelles composed of polyethylene glycol-dendron amphiphiles and studied their ability to serve as nanoreactors for a palladium-mediated depropargylation reaction of four substrates with different log P values. Using dendrons as the hydrophobic block, we could precisely tune the lipophilicity of the nanoreactors, which allowed us to reveal linear correlations between the rate constants and the hydrophobicity of the amphiphiles (estimated by the dendron's cLog P). While exponential dependence was obtained for the lipophilicity of the substrates, a similar degree of rate acceleration was observed due to the increase in the hydrophobicity of the amphiphiles regardless of the effect of the substrate's log P. Our results demonstrate that while increasing the hydrophobicity of the substrates may be used to accelerate reaction rates, tuning the hydrophobicity of the micellar nanoreactors can serve as a vital tool for further optimization of the reactivity and selectivity of nanoreactors.","16":"Polymerizations of phenylamines with a disulfide transfer reagent to yield poly[N,N-(phenylamino) disulfides] (poly-NADs) were investigated due to their unique repeat units that resulted in conjugation along the backbone that was perturbed by the aromatic rings and gave different colors for the polymers. These polymers were synthesized from 10 different anilines and sulfur monochloride in a step-growth polymerization. The polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering, and UV-vis spectroscopy. These polymers possessed a polymeric backbone solely consisting of nitrogen and sulfur [-N(R)SS-], which was conjugated and yielded polymers of moderate molecular weight. Most notably, these polymers were an array of colors ranging from pale yellow to a deep purple depending on the substitution of the aromatic ring. The more electron-poor systems produced lighter yellow polymers, while the electron-rich systems gave orange, green, red, and even purple polymers.","17":null,"18":null,"19":"The elastic modulus and hydrophilicity of cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) are tunable via cross-linker concentration and the addition of a simple surfactant, C12E4, before curing. However, the surfactant concentration, [C12E4], reduces the elastic modulus (73% lower for 6.3% w\/w) because it reduces the extent of curing. This is likely because the hygroscopic surfactant results in water poisoning of the catalyst. Three distinct time-dependent hydrophilicity profiles were identified using water contact angle analysis with [C12E4] determining which profile was observed. This indicates the concentration-dependent phase behavior of C12E4 within PDMS films. Changes in phase behavior were identified using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and a compatibility study. No surface excess or surface segregation of surfactant was observed at the PDMS-air interface. However, a surface excess revealed by neutron reflectivity against a D2O interface indicates that the increase in hydrophilicity results from the migration of C12E4 to the film interface when exposed to water.","20":null,"21":null,"22":"The stress response of polymer double networks depends not only on the properties of the constituent networks but also on the interactions arising between them. Here, we demonstrate, via coarse-grained simulations, that both their global stress response and their microscopic fracture mechanics are governed by load sharing through these internetwork interactions. By comparing our results with affine predictions, where stress redistribution is by definition homogeneous, we show that stress redistribution is highly inhomogeneous. In particular, the affine prediction overestimates the fraction of broken chains by almost an order of magnitude. Furthermore, homogeneous stress distribution predicts a single fracture process, while in our simulations, fracture of sacrificial chains takes place in two steps governed by load sharing within a network and between networks, respectively. Our results thus provide a detailed microscopic picture of how inhomogeneous stress redistribution after rupture of chains governs the fracture of polymer double networks.","23":null,"24":"We show experimentally that chemical and mechanical self-oscillations in Belousov-Zhabotinsky hydrogels are inherently asynchronous, that is, there is a detectable delay in swelling-deswelling response after a change in the chemical redox state. This phenomenon is observable in many previous experimental studies and potentially has far-reaching implications for the functionality and response time of the material in future applications; however, so far, it has not been quantified or reported systematically. Here, we provide a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative description of the chemical-to-mechanical delay, and we propose to explain it as a consequence of the slow nonequilibrium swelling-deswelling dynamics of the polymer material. Specifically, standard hydrogel pieces are large enough that transport processes, for example, counterion migration and water diffusion, cannot occur instantaneously throughout the entire gel piece, as opposed to previous theoretical considerations. As a result, the volume response of the polymer to a chemical change may be governed by a characteristic response time, which leads to the emergence of delay in mechanical oscillation. This is supported by our theoretical calculations.","25":"Radical cations of photoredox catalysts used in organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O-ATRP) have been synthesized and investigated to gain insight into deactivation in O-ATRP. The stability and reactivity of these compounds were studied in two solvents, N,N-dimethylacetamide and ethyl acetate, to identify possible side reactions in O-ATRP and to investigate the ability of these radical cations to deactivate alkyl radicals. A number of other factors that could influence deactivation in O-ATRP were also probed, such as ion pairing with the radical cations, radical cation oxidation potential, and halide oxidation potential. Ultimately, these studies enabled radical cations to be employed as reagents during O-ATRP to demonstrate improvements in polymerization control with increasing radical cation concentrations. In the polymerization of acrylates, this approach enabled superior molecular weight control, a decrease in polymer dispersity from 1.90 to 1.44, and an increase in initiator efficiency from 78 to 102%. This work highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism and side reactions of O-ATRP, as well as the importance of catalyst radical cations for successful O-ATRP.","26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":"A scaling model for the structure of coacervates is presented for mixtures of oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes of both symmetric and asymmetric charge-densities for different degrees of electrostatic strength and levels of added salt. At low electrostatic strengths, weak coacervates, with the energy of electrostatic interactions between charges less than the thermal energy, k B T, are liquid. At higher electrostatic strengths, strong coacervates are gels with crosslinks formed by ion pairs of opposite charges bound to each other with energy higher than k B T. Charge-symmetric coacervates are formed for mixtures of oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes with equal and opposite charge-densities. While charge-symmetric weak coacervates form a semidilute polymer solution with a correlation length equal to the electrostatic blob size, charge-symmetric strong coacervates form reversible gels with a correlation length on the order of the distance between bound ion pairs. Charge-asymmetric coacervates are formed from mixtures of oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes with different charge-densities. While charge-asymmetric weak coacervates form double solutions with two correlation lengths and qualitatively different chain conformations of polycations and polyanions, charge-asymmetric strong coacervates form bottlebrush and star-like gels. Unlike liquid coacervates, for which an increase in the concentration of added salt screens electrostatic interactions, causing structural rearrangement and eventually leads to their dissolution, the salt does not affect the structure of strong coacervates until ion pairs dissociate and the gel disperses.","30":"Polymer-tethered nanoparticles (NPs) are commonly added to a polymer matrix to improve material properties. Critical to the fabrication and processing of such composites is the mobility of the tethered NPs. Here we study the motion of tethered-NPs in unentangled polymer melts using molecular dynamics simulations, which offer a precise control of the grafted chain length N g and the number z of grafted chains per particle. As N g increases, there is a crossover from particle-dominated to tethered-chain-dominated terminal diffusion of NPs with the same z. The mean squared displacement of loosely tethered NPs in the case of tethered-chain dominated terminal diffusion exhibits two sub-diffusive regimes at intermediate time scales for small z. The first one at shorter time scales arises from the dynamical coupling of the particle and matrix chains, while the one at longer time scales is due to the participation of the particle in the dynamics of the tethered chains. The friction of loosely grafted chains in unentangled melts scales linearly with the total number of monomers in the chains, as the frictions of individual monomers are additive in the absence of hydrodynamic coupling. As more chains are grafted to a particle, hydrodynamic interactions between grafted chains emerge. As a result, there is a non-draining layer of hydrodynamically coupled chain segments surrounding the bare particle. Outside the non-draining layer is a free-draining layer of grafted chain segments with no hydrodynamic coupling. The boundary of the two layers is the stick surface where the shear stress due to the relative melt flow is balanced by the friction between grafted and melt chains in the interpenetration layer. The stick surface is located further away from the bare surface of the particle with higher grafting density.","31":null,"32":"A robust synthesis of gem-dialkyl acyclic diene monomers has been developed. This route is scalable, flexible, and biorenewable, allowing for the production of a wide range of diene monomers of different lengths and different gem-dialkyl substitution starting from unsaturated esters derived from seed oils. The metathesis polymerization of these monomers and the hydrogenation of the resulting polyolefins leads to telechelic gem-dialkyl polyethylenes, which can be used as elastomers in the synthesis of polyurethanes and other block polymers.","33":"Thermoplastic composites consisting of a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and poly(lactide) (PLA) have the potential to combine good mechanical performance with recyclability and are therefore interesting as strong and sustainable composite materials. The viscoelastic behavior of both the LCP and the PLA is of great importance for the performance of these composites, as they determine the LCP morphology in the composite and play a crucial role in preventing the loss of mechanical performance upon recycling. Though the effect of the matrix viscosity is well-documented in literature, well-controlled systems where the LCP viscosity is tailored are not reported. Therefore, four LCPs, with the same chemical backbone but different molecular weights, are used to produce reinforced LCP-PLA composites. The differences in viscosity of the LCPs and viscosity ratio between the dispersed phase and the matrix of the blends are evident in the resultant composite morphology: in all cases fibrils are formed; however, the diameter increases considerably as the viscosity ratio increases for the higher molar mass LCPs. The fibril diameter ranges from several hundred nanometer to a few micrometer. A typical layered structure in the injection molded composites is observed, where the layer-thickness is influenced by the LCP viscosity. The LCPs are found to effectively reinforce the PLLA matrix, increasing the Young's modulus by 60% and the maximum stress by 40% for the composite containing 30 wt % of the most viscous LCP. Remarkably, this did not result in an increase in brittleness, effectively increasing the toughness of the composite compared to pure PLLA. The feasible reprocessability of this composite is confirmed, by subjecting it to three reprocessing cycles. The relaxation of the LCPs orientation upon heating is measured via in situ WAXD. We compare the relaxation in an amorphous PLA matrix and in a semicrystalline PLLA matrix with that of the pure LCPs. The matrix viscosity is found to strongly influence the relaxation. For example, in a low viscous amorphous matrix relaxation of the LCP fibrils into droplets dominates the process, whereas a semicrystalline matrix helps in maintaining the fibril morphology and intermolecular orientation of the LCP. In the latter case, the LCPs relax via contraction and coalescence of the polydomain texture and maintains a significant degree of orientation until the PLLA crystals melt and the matrix viscosity decreases. The insights gained in this study on the role of the LCP viscosity on the morphology and performance of thermoplastic composites, as well as the relaxation of LCPs in a matrix, will aid progression toward sustainable and reprocessable LCP reinforced thermoplastic composites.","34":null,"35":"Monodisperse, micrometer-sized liquid crystalline (LC) shells are prepared by seeded dispersion polymerization. After polymerizing LC monomer mixtures in the presence of non-crosslinked polymer seeds, hollow LC polymer shells with programmable alignment and shape are prepared by removing the seeds. The LC alignment in the LC polymer shells can be easily manipulated by the polymer seeds, as a radial alignment is observed with amorphous poly(phenyl methacrylate) seeds and a bipolar alignment is observed with bipolar LC polymer seeds. After removal of the seeds, the radially aligned samples give radially aligned shells with small dimples. The resulting bipolar LC polymer shells collapse into a biconcave shape. Polarized optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicate that the collapse occurs at the defect points in the shell. In the case of a lower crosslink density, LC polymer hollow shells with larger dimples are obtained, resulting in cup-shaped polymer particles. Biconcave LC polymer shells based on other LC mixtures have also been prepared, showing the versatility of the seeded dispersion polymerization method.","36":null,"37":null,"38":"In this work, the formation of triple-shape-memory liquid crystalline-interpenetrating polymer network (LC-IPN) actuators based on a hybrid acrylate-oxetane LC mixture is reported. Orthogonal polymerization of the oxetane and acrylate liquid crystals creates polymer films with two distinct glass-transition temperatures. The use of these two transitions for one-way triple-shape-memory actuation and two-way bending actuation with a broad temperature window for actuation is demonstrated. Our results combine shape memory polymers with liquid crystal-based soft actuators having advanced stimuli-responsive properties.","39":"Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is a process by which a lower energy photon can be upconverted to a higher energy state. The incorporation of TTA-UC materials into solid-state hosts has enabled advances in solar energy and many other applications. The choice of host system is, however, far from trivial and often calls for a careful compromise between characteristics such as high molecular mobility, low oxygen diffusion, and high material stability, factors that often contradict one another. Here, we evaluate these challenges in the context of the state-of-the-art of primarily polymer hosts and the advantages they hold in terms of material selection and tunability of their diffusion or mechanical or thermal properties. We encourage more collaborative research between polymer scientists and photophysicists in order to further optimize the current systems and outline our thoughts for the future direction of the field.","40":"Polymers containing sulfur centers with high oxidation states in the main chain, polysulfoxide and polysulfone, display desirable properties such as thermomechanical and chemical stability. To circumvent their challenging direct synthesis, methods based on the oxidation of a parent polysulfide have been developed but are plagued by uncontrolled reactions, leading either to ill-defined mixtures of polysulfoxides and polysulfones or to polysulfones with reduced degrees of polymerization due to overoxidation of the polymer. We developed an alternative method to produce well-defined polysulfoxide and polysulfone in a waterborne colloidal emulsion using different oxidants to control the oxidation state of sulfur in the final materials. The direct oxidation of water-based polysulfide latexes avoided the use of volatile organic solvents and allowed for the control of the oxidation state of the sulfur atoms. Oxidation of parent polysulfides by tert-butyl hydroperoxide led to the production of pure polysulfoxides, even after 70 days of reaction time. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide produced both species through the course of the reaction but yielded fully converted polysulfones after 24 h. By employing mild oxidants, our approach controlled the oxidation state of the sulfur atoms in the final sulfur-containing polymer and prevented any overoxidation, thus ensuring the integrity of the polymer chains and colloidal stability of the system. We also verified the selectivity, versatility, and robustness of the method by applying it to polysulfides of different chemical compositions and structures. The universality demonstrated by this method makes it a powerful yet simple platform for the design of sulfur-containing polymers and nanoparticles.","41":null,"42":null,"43":"We develop a scaling theory that predicts the dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric unentangled liquid coacervates formed by solutions of oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes. Symmetric coacervates made from oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes consist of polycations and polyanions with equal and opposite charge densities along their backbones. These symmetric coacervates can be described as mixtures of polyelectrolytes in the quasi-neutral regime with a single correlation length. Asymmetric coacervates are made from polycations and polyanions with unequal charge densities. The difference in charge densities results in a double semidilute structure of asymmetric coacervates with two correlation lengths, one for the high-charge-density and the other for the low-charge-density polyelectrolytes. We predict that the double-semidilute structure in asymmetric coacervates results in a dynamic coupling which increases the friction of the high-charge-density polyelectrolyte. This dynamic coupling increases the contribution to the zero-shear viscosity of the high-charge-density polyelectrolyte. The diffusion coefficient of the high-charge-density polyelectrolyte is predicted to depend on the concentration and degree of polymerization of the low-charge-density polyelectrolyte in the coacervate if the size of the low-charge-density polymer is smaller than the correlation length of the high-charge-density polymer. We also predict a non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of the zero-shear viscosity of asymmetric coacervates.","44":null,"45":null,"46":"In this work, we calculate Flory-Huggins phase diagrams for correlated random copolymers. We achieve it in two steps. At first, we derive a distribution function of two-letter A, B copolymer chains depending on the fraction of A-segments and AB-duplets. Then, we use the method of moments, which was developed by Sollich and Cates [Phys. Rev. Lett.80, 1998, 1365-1368] for polydisperse systems, to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the computational problem and calculate phase diagrams. We explore how the location of transition points and composition of coexisting phases depends on the fractions of A-segments and AB-duplets in a sequence and the degree of polymerization. The proposed approach allows taking into account fractionation, which was shown to affect the appearance of the phase diagrams of statistical copolymers.","47":"A simulation strategy encompassing different scales was applied to the systematic study of the effects of CO2 uptake on the properties of atactic polystyrene (aPS) melts. The analysis accounted for the influence of temperature between 450 and 550 K, polymer molecular weights (M w) between 2100 and 31000 g\/mol, and CO2 pressures up to 20 MPa on the volumetric, swelling, structural, and dynamic properties of the polymer as well as on the CO2 solubility and diffusivity by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the system in a fully atomistic representation. A hierarchical scheme was used for the generation of the higher M w polymer systems, which consisted of equilibration at a coarse-grained level of representation through efficient connectivity-altering Monte Carlo simulations, and reverse-mapping back to the atomistic representation, obtaining the configurations used for subsequent MD simulations. Sorption isotherms and associated swelling effects were determined by using an iterative procedure that incorporated a series of MD simulations in the NPT ensemble and the Widom test particle insertion method, while CO2 diffusion coefficients were extracted from long MD runs in the NVE ensemble. Solubility and diffusivity compared favorably with experimental results and with predictions of the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state, which was reparametrized to capture the M w dependence of polymer properties with greater accuracy. Structural features of the polymer matrix were correctly reproduced by the simulations, and the effects of gas concentration and M w on structure and local dynamics were thoroughly investigated. In the presence of CO2, a significant acceleration of the segmental dynamics of the polymer occurred, more pronouncedly at low M w. The speed-up effect caused by the swelling agent was not limited to the chain ends but affected the whole chain in a similar fashion.","48":null,"49":null,"50":null,"51":null,"52":null,"53":"Different polymer architectures behave differently regarding their dynamics. We have used a combination of dielectric spectroscopy, and fast field cycling nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to compare the dynamical behavior of two different polymer architectures, with similar overall molecular weight. The systems of interest are a bottlebrush polymer and a linear one, both based on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). To verify the structure of the PDMS-g-PDMS bottlebrush in the melt, small-angle neutron scattering was used, yielding a spherical shape. Information about the segmental dynamics was revealed by dielectric spectroscopy and extended to higher temperatures by fast field cycling NMR. One advantage of fast field cycling NMR is the detection of large-scale chain dynamics, which dielectric spectroscopy cannot probe for PDMS. While segmental relaxation seems to be independent of the architecture, the large-scale chain dynamics show substantial differences, as represented by the mean square displacement. Here, two regions are detected for each polymer. The linear polymer shows the Rouse regime, followed by reptation. In contrast, the bottlebrush polymer performs Rouse dynamics and diffusion in the available time window, and entanglement effects are completely missing.","54":"Enzyme-responsive polymers and their assemblies offer great potential to serve as key materials for the design of drug delivery systems and other biomedical applications. However, the utilization of enzymes to trigger the disassembly of polymeric amphiphiles, such as micelles, also suffers from the limited accessibility of the enzyme to moieties that are hidden inside the assembled structures. In this Perspective, we will discuss examples for the utilization of high molecular precision that dendritic structures offer to study the enzymatic degradation of polymeric amphiphiles with high resolution. Up to date, several different amphiphilic systems based on dendritic blocks have all shown that small changes in the hydrophobicity and amphiphilicity strongly affected the degree and rate of enzymatic degradation. The ability to observe the huge effects due to relatively small variations in the molecular structure of polymers can explain the limited enzymatic degradation that is often observed for many reported polymeric assemblies. The observed trends imply that the enzymes cannot reach the hydrophobic core of the micelles, and instead, they gain access to the amphiphiles by the unimer-micelle equilibrium, making the unimer exchange rate a key parameter in tuning the enzymatic degradation rate. Several approaches that are aimed at overcoming the stability-responsiveness challenge are discussed as they open the way to the design of stable and yet enzymatically responsive polymeric nanocarriers.","55":null,"56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":"Stable doping of indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) structures enables easy color tuning and significant improvement in the charge storage capacity of electrochromic polymers, making use of their full potential as electrochromic supercapacitors and in other emerging hybrid applications. Here, the IDTT structure is copolymerized with four different donor-acceptor-donor (DAD) units, with subtle changes in their electron-donating and electron-withdrawing characters, so as to obtain four different donor-acceptor copolymers. The polymers attain important form factor requirements for electrochromic supercapacitors: desired switching between achromatic black and transparent states (L*a*b* 45.9, -3.1, -4.2\/86.7, -2.2, and -2.7 for PIDTT-TBT), high optical contrast (72% for PIDTT-TBzT), and excellent electrochemical redox stability (Ired\/Iox ca. 1.0 for PIDTT-EBE). Poly[indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,8-diyl-alt-4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-2-(2-hexyldecyl)-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole-7,7'-diyl] (PIDTT-EBzE) stands out as delivering simultaneously a high contrast (69%) and doping level (&gt;100%) and specific capacitance (260 F g-1). This work introduces IDTT-based polymers as bifunctional electro-optical materials for potential use in color-tailored, color-indicating, and self-regulating smart energy systems.","60":null,"61":null,"62":null,"63":"We report a facile method of ordering block copolymer (BCP) morphologies in which the conventional two-step casting and annealing steps are replaced by a single-step process where microphase separation and grain coarsening are seamlessly integrated within the casting protocol. This is achieved by slowing down solvent evaporation during casting by introducing a nonvolatile solvent into the BCP casting solution that effectively prolongs the duration of the grain-growth phase. We demonstrate the utility of this solvent evaporation annealing (SEA) method by producing well-ordered large-molecular-weight BCP thin films in a total processing time shorter than 3 min without resorting to any extra laboratory equipment other than a basic casting device, i.e., spin- or blade-coater. By analyzing the morphologies of the quenched samples, we identify a relatively narrow range of polymer concentration in the wet film, just above the order-disorder concentration, to be critical for obtaining large-grained morphologies. This finding is corroborated by the analysis of the grain-growth kinetics of horizontally oriented cylindrical domains where relatively large growth exponents (1\/2) are observed, indicative of a more rapid defect-annihilation mechanism in the concentrated BCP solution than in thermally annealed BCP melts. Furthermore, the analysis of temperature-resolved kinetics data allows us to calculate the Arrhenius activation energy of the grain coarsening in this one-step BCP ordering process.","64":"Polymer brushes can absorb vapors from the surrounding atmosphere, which is relevant for many applications such as in sensing and separation technologies. In this article, we report on the absorption of binary mixtures of solvent vapors (A and B) with a thermodynamic mean-field model and with grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations. Both methods show that the vapor with the strongest vapor-polymer interaction is favored and absorbs preferentially. In addition, the absorption of one vapor (A) influences the absorption of another (B). If the A-B interaction is stronger than the interaction between vapor B and the polymers, the presence of vapor A in the brush can aid the absorption of B: the vapors absorb collaboratively as friends. In contrast, if the A-polymer interaction is stronger than the B-polymer interaction and the brush has reached its maximum sorption capacity, the presence of A can reduce the absorption of B: the vapors absorb competitively as foes.","65":null,"66":"Many biopolymer hydrogels are environmentally responsive because they are held together by physical associations that depend on pH and temperature. Here, we investigate how the pH and temperature responses of the rheology of hyaluronan hydrogels are connected to the underlying molecular interactions. Hyaluronan is an essential structural biopolymer in the human body with many applications in biomedicine. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we show that hyaluronan chains become connected by hydrogen bonds when the pH is changed from 7.0 to 2.5 and that the bond density at pH 2.5 is independent of temperature. Temperature-dependent rheology measurements show that because of this hydrogen bonding the stress relaxation at pH 2.5 is strongly slowed down in comparison to pH 7.0, consistent with the sticky reptation model of associative polymers. From the flow activation energy, we conclude that each polymer is cross-linked by multiple (5-15) hydrogen bonds to others, causing slow macroscopic stress relaxation, despite the short time scale of breaking and reformation of each individual hydrogen bond. Our findings can aid the design of stimuli-responsive hydrogels with tailored viscoelastic properties for biomedical applications.","67":"Similar to macroscopic ropes and cables, long polymers create knots. We address the fundamental question whether and under which conditions it is possible to describe these intriguing objects with crude models that capture only mesoscale polymer properties. We focus on melts of long polymers which we describe by a model typical for mesoscopic simulations. A worm-like chain model defines the polymer architecture. To describe nonbonded interactions, we deliberately choose a generic \"soft\" repulsive potential that leads to strongly overlapping monomers and coarse local liquid structure. The soft model is parametrized to accurately reproduce mesoscopic structure and conformations of reference polymer melts described by a microscopic model. The microscopically resolved samples retain all generic features affecting polymer topology and provide, therefore, reliable reference data on knots. We compare characteristic knotting properties in mesoscopic and microscopically resolved melts for different cases of chain stiffness. We conclude that mesoscopic models can reliably describe knots in those melts, where the length scale characterizing polymer stiffness is substantially larger than the size of monomer-monomer excluded volume. In this case, simplified local liquid structure influences knotting properties only marginally. In contrast, mesoscopic models perform poorly in melts with flexible chains. We qualitatively explain our findings through a free energy model of simple knots available in the literature.","68":"Block copolymer stars (BCSs) have been demonstrated to constitute versatile, self-assembling building blocks with tunable softness, functionalization, and shape. We investigate the dynamical properties of suspensions of short-arm BCSs under linear shear flow by means of extensive particle-based multiscale simulations. We determine the properties of the system for representative values of monomer packing fraction ranging from semidilute to concentrate regimes. We systematically analyze the formed network structures as a function of both shear rate and packing fraction, the reorganization of solvophobic patches, and the corresponding radial correlation functions. Connecting our findings with rheology, we calculate the viscosity as a function of shear rate and discuss the implications of the found shear thinning behavior.","69":"Chemical feedback between building block synthesis and their subsequent supramolecular self-assembly into nanostructures has profound effects on assembly pathways. Nature harnesses feedback in reaction-assembly networks in a variety of scenarios including virion formation and protein folding. Also in nanomaterial synthesis, reaction-assembly networks have emerged as a promising control strategy to regulate assembly processes. Yet, how chemical feedback affects the fundamental pathways of structure formation remains unclear. Here, we unravel the pathways of a templated reaction-assembly network that couples a covalent polymerization to an electrostatic coassembly process. We show how the supramolecular staging of building blocks at a macromolecular template can accelerate the polymerization reaction and prevent the formation of kinetically trapped structures inherent to the process in the absence of feedback. Finally, we establish a predictive kinetic reaction model that quantitatively describes the pathways underlying these reaction-assembly networks. Our results shed light on the fundamental mechanisms by which chemical feedback can steer self-assembly reactions and can be used to rationally design new nanostructures.","70":null,"71":"Supramolecular block copolymers composed of discrete blocks have promising properties for nanotechnology resulting from their ability to combine well-defined morphologies with good bulk material properties. Here, we present the impact of a well-defined siloxane block in either the main-chain or present as pendant grafts on the properties of supramolecular block copolymers that form ordered nanostructures with sub-5 nm domains. For this, two types of supramolecular block copolymers were synthesized based on the ureidopyrimidinone-urethane (UPy-UT) motif. In the first, oligodimethylsiloxanes (oDMS) of discrete length were end-capped with the UPy-UT motif, affording main-chain UPy-UT-Si n  . In the second, the UPy-UT motif was grafted with discrete oDMS affording grafted UPy-UT- g -Si 7 . For the two systems, the compositions are similar; only the molecular architecture differs. In both cases, crystallization of the UPy-UT block is in synergy with phase segregation of the oDMS, resulting in the formation of lamellar morphologies. The grafted UPy-UT- g -Si 7 can form long-range ordered lamellae, resulting in the formation of micrometer-sized 2D sheets of supramolecular polymers which show brittle properties. In contrast, UPy-UT-Si n  forms a ductile material. As the compositions of both BCOs are similar, the differences in morphology and mechanical properties are a direct consequence of the molecular architecture. These results showcase how molecular design of the building block capable of forming block copolymers translates into controlled nanostructures and material properties as a result of the supramolecular nature of the interactions.","72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":"The electronic properties of conducting polymers are influenced by their micro- and macrostructural orders, which can be tailored by substituent modification. However, while the effect of substituents on conducting polymers is extensively investigated, chiral substituents are far less studied. Furthermore, many chiral conducting polymers have regioirregular structures, which result in polymer films with inferior properties. In this work, we apply electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy to study the morphological changes to the chiral polymers under different polymerization conditions. For this purpose, we investigated 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) derivatives having two stereogenic centers on each monomer and bearing methyl or phenyl side groups (dimethyl-EDOT and diphenyl-EDOT, respectively). Polymerizing the enantiomerically pure monomers produces regioregular and stereoregular dimethyl-PEDOT and diphenyl-PEDOT, respectively. The effect of the electrolyte and solvent on polymer film morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ECD, showing a correlation between the polymer's morphology and the chiroptical properties of its films. We found that, for diphenyl-PEDOT, the combination of perchlorate anion electrolyte and acetonitrile solvent resulted in a unique morphology characterized by significant intermolecular interactions. These interactions were clearly observable in the ECD spectra in the form of exciton couplings, whose presence was supported by TD-DFT calculations. A small enantiomeric excess was sufficient to induce very intense ECD signals, demonstrating chiral amplification in electropolymerized films.","77":"A novel method for facile postpolymerization functionalization of synthetic polymers using terminal norbornadiene (NBD) building blocks is presented. Incorporation of the NBD functionality streamlines the synthesis of a wide array of block polymers utilizing multistep click chemistry strategies. Previously, the use of NBD-functionalized initiators produced polymers that underwent a cascade of Diels-Alder (DA) reactions to unveil a reactive cyclopentadiene (Cp) chain end. When coupled with a maleimide-bearing counterpart, a highly efficient DA cycloaddition with the terminal Cp can occur. To extend this concept to a range of polyacrylates and commercially available poly(ethylene glycol) systems, we developed a novel NBD acid building block for postpolymerization functionalization. Employing this process, we have demonstrated straightforward access to a library of block polymers that leverage this NBD click platform.","78":"Structural and morphological interplay between hard and soft phases determine the bulk properties of thermoplastic polyurethanes. Commonly employed techniques rely on different physical or chemical phenomena for characterizing the organization of domains, but detailed structural information can be difficult to derive. Here, total scattering pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is used to determine atomic-scale insights into the connectivity and molecular ordering and compared to the domain size and morphological characteristics measured by AFM, TEM, SAXS, WAXS, and solid-state NMR 1H-1H spin-diffusion. In particular, density distribution functions are highlighted as a means to bridging the gap from the domain morphology to intradomain structural ordering. High real-space resolution PDFs are shown to provide a sensitive fingerprint for indexing aromatic, aliphatic, and polymerization-induced bonding characteristics, as well as the hard phase structure, and indicate that hard phases coexist in both ordered and disordered states.","79":null,"80":null,"81":"A novel and successful application of ring-closing reactions of aminophenols has been proposed for the formation of a new type of 1,3-benzoxazine ionic derivatives. The optimization of the reaction and detailed computational studies have been reported for the estimation of heterocyclic ring stability and its further transformation, which is crucial in the polymerization process. The molecular structure of the obtained compounds has been fully characterized by applying X-ray analysis and spectroscopic methods. The novel benzoxazines undergo an intriguing thermal reaction leading to classical benzoxazines and chloroalkanes, which is the first step of transformation before polymerization. To gain more insights into the transformation behavior of ionic benzoxazine derivatives, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of gaseous products were recorded in experiments with near simultaneous FT-IR\/TGA measurements. The combination of thermogravimetry with FT-IR spectroscopy enables the quantitative and qualitative characterization of thermal transformation products and clarification of the reaction mechanism. The experimental data have been verified by applying DFT(B3LYP) and DFT(M062x) theoretical studies.","82":"A compressive strain applied to bilayer films (e.g. thin film adhered to a thick substrate) can lead to buckled or wrinkled morphologies, which has many important applications in stretchable electronics, anti-counterfeit technology, and high-precision micro and nano-metrology. A number of buckling-based metrology methods have been developed to quantify the residual stress and viscoelastic properties of polymer thin films. However, in some systems (e.g. solvent-induced swelling or thermal strain), the compressive strain is unknown or difficult to measure. We present a quantitative method of measuring the compressive strain of wrinkled polymer films and coatings with knowledge of the \"skin\" thickness, wrinkle wavelength, and wrinkle amplitude. The derived analytical expression is validated with a well-studied model system, e.g., stiff, thin film (PS) bonded to a thick, compliant substrate (PDMS). After validation, we use our expression to quantify the applied swelling strain of previously reported wrinkled poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) brush surfaces. Finally, the applied strain is used to rationalize the observed persistence length of aligned wrinkles created during atomic force microscopy (AFM) lithography and subsequent solvent exposure.","83":"While polymer brushes in contact with liquids have been researched intensively, the characteristics of brushes in equilibrium with vapors have been largely unexplored, despite their relevance for many applications, including sensors and smart adhesives. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that solvent and polymer density distributions for brushes exposed to vapors are qualitatively different from those of brushes exposed to liquids. Polymer density profiles for vapor-solvated brushes decay more sharply than for liquid-solvated brushes. Moreover, adsorption layers of enhanced solvent density are formed at the brush-vapor interface. Interestingly and despite all of these effects, we find that solvent sorption in the brush is described rather well with a simple mean-field Flory-Huggins model that incorporates an entropic penalty for stretching of the brush polymers, provided that parameters such as the polymer-solvent interaction parameter, grafting density, and relative vapor pressure are varied individually.","84":null,"85":null,"86":null,"87":"Two asymmetric thiophene (T)\/pyridine (Py) flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) polymers with a regiorandom and regioregular conjugated backbone are synthesized via a Stille polycondensation to investigate the effect of regioregularity on their optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance in fullerene-based polymer solar cells. Surprisingly, both polymers possess very similar optical bandgap, energy levels, and photovoltaic performance. These findings, combined with a factor of 19 reactivity difference between the two end groups of the asymmetric DPP monomer, intuitively suggest the formation of regular chain segments in the random polymer. However, by modeling the random polymerization reaction with a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation, evidence is obtained for exclusive formation of a fully random polymer structure. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of three extended DPP chromophores, containing the donor segments (T-T-T, Py-T-Py, and Py-T-T) present in the regiorandom polymer, confirm that regioregularity of the backbone has a negligible influence on the optical properties.","88":"We investigated the effect of cyclic chain topology on the molecular ordering and thermal stability of comb-shaped polypeptoid thin films on silicon (Si) substrates. Cyclic and linear poly(N-decylglycine) (PNDG) bearing long n-decyl side chains were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of N-decylglycine-derived N-carboxyanhydrides. When the spin-coated thin films were subjected to thermal annealing at temperatures above the melting temperature (T &gt; T m), the cyclic PNDG films exhibited significantly enhanced stability against melt-induced dewetting than the linear counterparts (l-PNDG). When recrystallized at temperatures below the crystallization temperature (T &lt; T c), the homogeneous c-PNDG films exhibit enhanced crystalline ordering relative to the macroscopically dewetted l-PNDG films. Both cyclic and linear PNDG molecules adopt cis-amide conformations in the crystalline film, which transition into trans-amide conformations upon melting. A top-down solvent leaching treatment of both l\/c-PNDG films revealed the formation of an irreversibly physisorbed monolayer with similar thickness (ca. 3 nm) on the Si substrate. The physisorbed monolayers are more disordered relative to the respective thicker crystalline films for both cyclic and linear PNDGs. Upon heating above T m, the adsorbed c-PNDG chains adopt trans-amide backbone conformation identical with the free c-PNDG molecules in the molten film. By contrast, the backbone conformations of l-PNDG chains in the adsorbed layers are notably different from those of the free chains in the molten film. We postulate that the conformational disparity between the chains in the physically adsorbed layers versus the free chains in the molten film is an important factor to account for the difference in the thermal stability of PNDG thin films. These findings highlight the use of cyclic chain topology to suppress the melt-induced dewetting in polymer thin films.","89":null,"90":"Grafting polymer chains on the surface of nanoparticles (NPs) is a strategy used to control the interaction between the NPs and their environment. The fate of the resulting particles in a given environment is strongly influenced by the solvent-polymer interaction. The solvent quality affects the behavior, conformation, and dynamics of the grafted polymer chains. However, when this polymer grafting strategy is used to functionalized polymer particles, the influence of solvent quality becomes even more complex; when the grafted polymer chains and the polymer nanoparticles are tethered together, the effect of the solvent quality on the behavior and dynamics of the system depends on the solvent interaction with both polymer components. To explore the relationship between the solvent quality and the dynamics of polymer-functionalized soft polymer NPs, we designed a system based on cross-linked polystyrene (PS) NPs grafted with a canopy of poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA). PS and PMA, two immiscible polymers, can be selectively solvated by using binary mixtures of solvents. NMR spectroscopy was used to address the effect of those selective solvents on the local mobility of the PS-PMA core-canopy NPs and revealed an interplay between the local mobility of the core and the local mobility of the canopy. A selective reduction of the solvent quality for the PMA canopy resulted in the expected reduction of the local mobility of the PMA chains, but also in the slower dynamics of the PS core. Similarly, a selective reduction of the solvent quality for the PS core resulted in a slower dynamics for both the PS core and the PMA canopy.","91":"We study the effect of entanglements on the glass transition of high molecular weight polymers, by the comparison of single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) and equilibrated melts of high-molecular weight polystyrene of identical molecular weight. SCNPs were prepared by electrospraying technique and characterized using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy techniques. Differential scanning calorimetry, Brillouin light spectroscopy, and rheological experiments around the glass transition were compared. In parallel, entangled and disentangled polymer melts were also compared under cooling from molecular dynamics simulations based on a bead-spring polymer model. While experiments suggest a small decrease in the glass transition temperature of films of nanoparticles in comparison to entangled melts, simulations do not observe any significant difference, despite rather different chain conformations.","92":null,"93":null,"94":"Various oxirane monomers including alkyl ether or allyl-substituted ones such as 1-butene oxide, 1-hexene oxide, 1-octene oxide, butyl glycidyl ether, allyl glycidyl ether, and 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether were anionically copolymerized with CO2 into polycarbonates using onium salts as initiator in the presence of triethylborane. All copolymerizations exhibited a \"living\" character, and the monomer consumption was monitored by in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The various polycarbonate samples obtained were characterized by 1H NMR, GPC, and differential scanning calorimetry. In a second step, all-polycarbonate triblock copolymers demonstrating elastomeric behavior were obtained in one pot by sequential copolymerization of CO2 with two different epoxides, using a difunctional initiator. 1-Octene oxide was first copolymerized with CO2 to form the central soft poly(octene carbonate) block which was flanked by two external rigid poly(cyclohexene carbonate) blocks obtained through subsequent copolymerization of cyclohexene oxide with CO2. Upon varying the ratio of 1-octene oxide to cyclohexene oxide and their respective ratios to the initiator, three all-polycarbonate triblock samples were prepared with molar masses of about 350 kg\/mol and 22, 26, and 29 mol % hard block content, respectively. The resulting triblock copolymers were analyzed using 1H NMR, GPC, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and atomic force microscopy. All three samples demonstrated typical elastomeric behavior characterized by a high elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength in the same range as those of other natural and synthetic rubbers, in particular those used in applications such as tissue engineering.","95":null,"96":"Polyproteins are unique constructs, comprised of folded protein domains in tandem and polymeric linkers. These macromolecules perform under biological stresses by modulating their response through partial unfolding and extending. Although these unfolding events are considered independent, a history dependence of forced unfolding within polyproteins was reported. Here we measure the unfolding of single poly(I91) octamers, complemented with Brownian dynamics simulations, displaying increasing hierarchy in unfolding-foces, accompanied by a decrease in the effective stiffness. This counters the existing understanding that relates stiffness with variations in domain size and probe stiffness, which is expected to reduce the unfolding forces with every consecutive unfolding event. We utilize a simple mechanistic viscoelastic model to show that two effects are combined within a sequential forced unfolding process: the viscoelastic properties of the growing linker chain lead to a hierarchy of the unfolding events, and force-rate application governs the unfolding kinetics.","97":null,"98":"Supramolecular block copolymers (PS-DAT-sb-PI-Thy) were synthesized via noncovalent hydrogen bonding between well-defined thymine end-functionalized polyisoprene (PI-Thy) and diaminotriazine (DAT) end-functionalized polystyrene (PS-DAT). Three covalently linked block copolymers were also synthesized for comparison with the noncovalent supramolecular block copolymers. The complementary DAT\/Thy interaction resulted in the microphase separation of the supramolecular block copolymer system. Detailed characterization of all functionalized homopolymers and block copolymers was carried out via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. The self-assembly process of supramolecular block copolymers was evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. Small-angle X-ray scattering was also performed to study the microphase separation of supramolecular and covalently linked block copolymers. Comparison of microphase separation images of supramolecular block copolymers and the corresponding covalently linked analogues reveals differences in d-spacing and microdomain shape.","99":null,"100":null,"101":null,"102":"Transparency and thermal conductivity of ultradrawn, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene films containing different contents of low-molecular-weight polyethylene wax (PEwax) are explored from experimental and theoretical viewpoints. It is shown that the addition of PEwax decreases light scattering in all directions, resulting from a reduction of defects while having little effect on crystallinity or chain orientation of ultradrawn films. In general, upon the addition of PEwax, the thermal conductivity of ultradrawn films increases with the highest conductivity being 47 (W m-1 K-1) and subsequently decreases at higher concentrations. The thermal conductivity also depends on draw ratio and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the films. A model is presented which correlates the thermal conductivity of the films with the draw ratio and Mn, enabling explanation of the experimental results. Hence, the thermal conductivity of ultradrawn polyethylene films can be predicted as a function of Mn and draw ratio.","103":"Recently, disordered blends of semiconducting and insulating polymers have been used to prepare light-emitting diodes with increased luminous efficiency. Because the thermodynamic stability of the disordered phase in blends is limited, equivalent diblock copolymers (BCPs) could be an alternative. However, the choice between disordered blends and BCPs requires understanding structural differences and their effect on charge carrier transport. Using a hybrid mesoscopic model, we simulate blends and equivalent BCPs of two representative semiconducting and insulating polymers: poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and polyacrylate. The immiscibility is varied to mimic annealing at different temperatures. We find stable or metastable disordered morphologies until we reach the mean-field (MF) spinodal. Disordered morphologies are heterogeneous because of thermal fluctuations and local segregation. Near the MF spinodal, segregation is stronger in BCPs than in the blends, even though the immiscibility, normalized by the MF spinodal, is the same. We link the spatial distribution of PPV with electric conductance. We predict that the immiscibility (temperature at which the layer is annealed) affects electrical percolation much stronger in BCPs than in blends. Differences in the local structure and percolation between blends and BCPs are enhanced at a high insulator content.","104":null,"105":"Reducing topological network defects to enhance elasticity in polymeric materials remains a grand challenge. Efforts to control network topology, primarily focused on crosslinking junctions, continue to underperform compared to theoretical estimations from idealized networks using affine and phantom network theories. Here, artificial protein technology was adapted for the design of polymer-network hydrogels with precisely defined coil-like and rod-like strands to observe the impact of strand rigidity on the mechanical properties of polymeric materials. Cytoskeleton-inspired polymer-network hydrogels incorporated with rod-like protein strands nearly tripled the gel shear elastic modulus and relaxation time compared to coil-like protein strands, indicating an enhanced effective crosslinking density. Furthermore, asymmetric rod-coil protein designs in network strands with an optimal rod:coil ratio improved the hydrogel relaxation time, enhancing the stability of physical macromolecular associations by modulating crosslinker mobility. The careful design of strand rigidity presents a new direction to reduce topological defects for optimizing polymeric materials.","106":"A polyethylene-like polymer with an in-chain vitamin C group was synthesized by olefin metathesis polymerization. Here, we describe both the synthesis and a comprehensive physical characterization. Because of the olefin metathesis synthesis, the vitamin C groups are equidistantly arranged in the polyethylene (PE) main chain. Their separation was adjusted to 20 CH2 units. After hydrogenation, a semicrystalline polymer is obtained that is soluble in polar solvents. Because of its size and steric effect, the vitamin C acts as a chain defect, which is expelled from the crystal lattice, yielding a lamellar crystal with a homogeneous thickness corresponding to the interdefect distance. The physical properties were examined by various methods including differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. We show that vitamin C retains its radical scavenger properties despite being incorporated into a polyethylene chain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is degrading in alkaline conditions. To complete its suitability as a biocompatible material, cytotoxicity and cell uptake experiments were performed. We show that the polymer is nontoxic and that it is taken up in nanoparticular form via endocytosis processes into the cytoplasm of cells.","107":"The origin of unique rheological response in supramolecular brush polymers is investigated using different polymer chemistries (poly(methyl acrylate) (PmA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)), topologies (linear or star), and molecular weights. A recently developed hydrogen-bonding moiety (1-(6-isocyanatohexyl)-3-(7-oxo-7,8-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)-urea) (ODIN) was coupled to PmAs and PEGs to form supramolecular brush polymers, the backbone of which is formed by the associated moieties. At low molecular weights of monofunctionalized polymers (both PmA and PEG), the formed brushes are mostly composed of a thick backbone (with very short arms) and are surrounded by other similar brush polymers, which prevent them from diffusing and relaxing. Therefore, the monofunctionalized PmA with a low M n does not show terminal flow even at the highest experimentally studied temperature (or at longest time scales). By increasing the length of the chains, supramolecular brushes with longer arms are obtained. Due to their lower density of thick backbones, these last ones have more space to move and their relaxation is therefore enhanced. In this work, we show that despite similarities between covalent and transient brush polymers, the elastic response in the latter does not originate from the brush entanglements with a large M e (entanglement molecular weight), but it rather stems from the impenetrable rigid backbone and caging effect similar to the one described for hyperstars.","108":"Poly(thiophen-3-ylacetic acid) (PTAA) is a representative of conjugated polyelectrolytes which are used in many optoelectronics devices. The performance of these devices is affected by the polymer conformation, which, among others, depends on the nature of the counterion. In this study, the binding of tetrabutylammonium counterions (TBA+) on PTAA was determined using a combination of nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It was found that TBA+ ions specifically bind on the hydrophobic main chain of PTAA, while, according to MD simulations, alkali counterions predominantly bind in the vicinity of negatively charged carboxylic groups located on side chains. The MD trajectories were used to compute the relaxation matrices and the NOESY spectra. With the help of these latter calculations, the changes of intensities in experimental NOESY spectra upon binding of TBA+ ions to PTAA were interpreted.","109":"The design of surface-modified functional nanoparticles (NPs) is used to control the properties of the NPs and the NP\/environment interactions. The efficient control of the final behavior of the NPs demands a comprehensive understanding of the resulting system. This is particularly challenging for systems with an architecture of the type polymer core-polymer canopy. In such systems, one of the key parameters influencing the behavior of the NPs is the local dynamics of the polymer canopy. However, because the grafting points of the canopy are experiencing their own local dynamics, predicting the final behavior of such systems is difficult. To get a deeper understanding of NPs made of a soft and swollen polymer core and a swollen polymer canopy, we prepared a library of hairy NPs made of a polystyrene (PS) core and a canopy of grafted poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) chains. The softness of the PS core and the thickness of the PMA canopy were controlled, and the behavior and dynamics of the soft and hairy PS-PMA NPs in suspension were measured by 1H NMR relaxation and dynamic light scattering. It was observed that the rigid PS core slowed down the subsegmental dynamics of the PMA chains, while thick PMA canopies accelerated the relaxation of the PS core. The dynamics of the NPs in suspension was the result of the interplay between the PS core and the PMA canopy.","110":"Surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization is a popular technique for the modification of biomaterials with, for example, antifouling polymers. Here, we report on the functionalization of a supramolecular biomaterial with zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) via atom transfer radical polymerization from a macroinitiator additive, which is embedded in the hard phase of the ureido-pyrimidinone-based material. Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) was successfully polymerized from these surfaces, and the polymerized sulfobetaine content, with corresponding antifouling properties, depended on both the macroinitiator additive concentration and polymerization time. Furthermore, the polymerization from the macroinitiator additive was successfully translated to functional electrospun scaffolds, showing the potential for this functionalization strategy in supramolecular material systems.","111":null,"112":null,"113":null,"114":"Silk is one of the most intriguing examples of biomolecular self-assembly, yet little is understood of molecular mechanisms behind the flow behavior generating these complex high-performance fibers.

We show that silk solutions can be approximated as reptating polymers with \"sticky\" calcium bridges whose strength can be controlled through the potassium concentration. This approach provides a new window into critical microstructural parameters, in particular identifying the mechanism by which potassium and calcium ions are recruited as a powerful viscosity control in silk. Our model constitutes a viable starting point to understand not only the \"flow-induced self-assembly\" of silk fibers but also a broader range of phenomena in the emergent field of material-focused synthetic biology.","115":null,"116":"The solvent quality determines the collapsed or the expanded state of a polymer. For example, a polymer dissolved in a poor solvent collapses, whereas in a good solvent it opens up. While this standard understanding is generally valid, there are examples when a polymer collapses even in a mixture of two good solvents. This phenomenon, commonly known as co-non-solvency, is usually associated with a wide range of synthetic (smart) polymers. Moreover, recent experiments have shown that some biopolymers, such as elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that exhibit lower critical solution behavior T l in pure water, show co-non-solvency behavior in aqueous ethanol mixtures. In this study, we investigate the phase behavior of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) in aqueous binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations of all-atom and complementary explicit solvent generic models. The model is parameterized by mapping the solvation free energy obtained from the all-atom simulations onto the generic interaction parameters. For this purpose, we derive segment-based (monomer level) generic parameters for four different peptides, namely proline (P), valine (V), glycine (G), and alanine (A), where the first three constitute the basic building blocks of ELPs. Here, we compare the conformational behavior of two ELP sequences, namely -(VPGGG)- and -(VPGVG)-, in aqueous ethanol and -urea mixtures. Consistent with recent experiments, we find that ELPs show co-non-solvency in aqueous ethanol mixtures. Ethanol molecules have preferential binding with all ELP residues, with an interaction contrast of 6-8 k B T, and thus driving the coil-to-globule transition. On the contrary, ELP conformations show a weak variation in aqueous urea mixtures. Our simulations suggest that the glycine residues dictate the overall behavior of ELPs in aqueous urea, where urea molecules have a rather weak preferential binding with glycine as observed from the all atom simulations, i.e., less than k B T. This weak interaction dilutes the overall effect of other neighboring residues and thus ELPs exhibit a different conformational behavior in aqueous urea in comparison to aqueous ethanol mixtures. While the validation of the latter findings will require a more detailed experimental investigation, the results presented here may provide a new twist to the present understanding of cosolvent interactions with peptides and proteins.","117":"The controlled polymerization of a new biobased monomer, 4-oxocyclopent-2-en-1-yl acrylate (4CPA), was established via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) (co)polymerization to yield polymers bearing pendent cyclopentenone units. 4CPA contains two reactive functionalities, namely, a vinyl group and an internal double bond, and is an unsymmetrical monomer. Therefore, competition between the internal double bond and the vinyl group eventually leads to gel formation. With RAFT polymerization, when aiming for a degree of polymerization (DP) of 100, maximum 4CPA conversions of the vinyl group between 19.0 and 45.2% were obtained without gel formation or extensive broadening of the dispersity. When the same conditions were applied in the copolymerization of 4CPA with lauryl acrylate (LA), methyl acrylate (MA), and isobornyl acrylate, 4CPA conversions of the vinyl group between 63 and 95% were reached. The additional functionality of 4CPA in copolymers was demonstrated by model studies with 4-oxocyclopent-2-en-1-yl acetate (1), which readily dimerized under UV light via [2 + 2] photocyclodimerization. First-principles quantum mechanical simulations supported the experimental observations made in NMR. Based on the calculated energetics and chemical shifts, a mixture of head-to-head and head-to-tail dimers of (1) were identified. Using the dimerization mechanism, solvent-cast LA and MA copolymers containing 30 mol % 4CPA were cross-linked under UV light to obtain thin films. The cross-linked films were characterized by dynamic scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, IR, and swelling experiments. This is the first case where 4CPA is described as a monomer for functional biobased polymers that can undergo additional UV curing via photodimerization.","118":"Increasing the ionic conductivity has for decades been an overriding goal in the development of solid polymer electrolytes. According to fundamental theories on ion transport mechanisms in polymers, the ionic conductivity is strongly correlated to free volume and segmental mobility of the polymer for the conventional transport processes. Therefore, incorporating plasticizing side chains onto the main chain of the polymer host often appears as a clear-cut strategy to improve the ionic conductivity of the system through lowering of the glass transition temperature (T g). This intended correlation between T g and ionic conductivity is, however, not consistently observed in practice. The aim of this study is therefore to elucidate this interplay between segmental mobility and polymer structure in polymer electrolyte systems comprising plasticizing side chains. To this end, we utilize the synthetic versatility of the ion-conductive poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) platform. Two types of host polymers with side chains added to a PTMC backbone are employed, and the resulting electrolytes are investigated together with the side chain-free analogue both by experiment and with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results show that while added side chains do indeed lead to a lower T g, the total ionic conductivity is highest in the host matrix without side chains. It was seen in the MD simulations that while side chains promote ionic mobility associated with the polymer chain, the more efficient interchain hopping transport mechanism occurs with a higher probability in the system without side chains. This is connected to a significantly higher solvation site diversity for the Li+ ions in the side-chain-free system, providing better conduction paths. These results strongly indicate that the side chains in fact restrict the mobility of the Li+ ions in the polymer hosts.","119":null,"120":null,"121":null,"122":"Different types of butyl acrylate (BA)-co-acrylic acid (AA) oligomers were synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and mixed with extruded 200 nm dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide vesicles. The resulting precursor structures form the basis for subsequent vesicle-templated polymerizations. Systematic variations in temperature, pH, oligomer length, and oligomer composition and their effects on precursor morphology were studied. Surprisingly, different morphologies were obtained, including capsules, protruded capsules, solid spheres, and multicompartment structures. For example, capsules and multicompartment structures were found to result from higher AA contents, and protruded capsules and solid particles resulted from lower AA contents. Subsequent chain extension of the RAFT oligomers resulted in polymer nanostructures resembling the precursor morphologies.","123":"Despite the ubiquity of branched and network polymers in biological, electronic, and rheological applications, it remains difficult to predict the network structure arising from polymerization of vinyl and multivinyl monomers. While controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques afford modularity and control in the synthesis of (hyper)branched polymers, a unifying understanding of network formation providing grounded predictive power is still lacking. A current limitation is the inability to predict the number and weight average molecular weights that arise during the synthesis of (hyper)branched polymers using CRP. This study addresses this literature gap through first building intuition via a growth boundary analysis on how certain environmental cues (concentration, monomer choice, and cross-linker choice) affect the cross-link efficiency during network formation through experimental gel point measurements. We then demonstrate, through experimental gel point normalization, universal scaling behavior of molecular weights in the synthesis of branched polymers corroborated by previous literature experiments. Moreover, the normalization employed in this analysis reveals trends in the macroscopic mechanical properties of networks synthesized using CRP techniques. Gel point normalization employed in this analysis both enables a polymer chemist to target specific number and weight average molecular weights of (hyper)branched polymers using CRP and demonstrates the utility of CRP for gel synthesis.","124":"Over the past few years, the concurrent (1) development of polymer synthesis and (2) introduction of new mathematical models for polymer dynamics have evolved the classical framework for polymer dynamics once established by Doi-Edwards\/de Gennes. Although the analysis of supramolecular polymer dynamics based on linear rheology has improved a lot recently, there are a large number of insecurities behind the conclusions, which originate from the complexity of these novel systems. The interdependent effect of supramolecular entities (stickers) and chain dynamics can be overwhelming depending on the type and location of stickers as well as the architecture and chemistry of polymers. This Perspective illustrates these parameters and strives to determine what is still missing and has to be improved in the future works.","125":null,"126":"In this study, the effect of different process conditions on the material properties of a single UV-cured layer of methacrylate resin, typically used in the stereolithography (SLA) process, is assessed. This simplified approach of the SLA process gives the opportunity to study the link between process conditions and mechanical properties without complicated interactions between different layers. Fourier-transform infrared analysis is performed to study the effect of light intensity, curing time, and initiator concentration on the monomer conversion. A model is developed based on the reaction kinetics of photopolymerization that describes and predicts the experimental data. The effect of curing time and light intensity on the glass-transition temperature is studied. A unique relation exists between conversion and glass-transition temperature, independent of the light intensity and curing time. Tensile tests on UV-cured resin show an increase in yield stress with increasing curing time and a linear relation between glass-transition temperature and yield stress. However, a lower light intensity leads to a different network structure characterized by a lower yield stress and glass-transition temperature. The correlations between process conditions and the mechanical properties of UV-cured methacrylate systems are established to better understand the role of the processing parameters involved in the SLA process.","127":null,"128":"Complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms) are promising encapsulators for a wide variety of (bio)molecules. To protect and stabilize their cargo, it is essential to control their exchange dynamics. Yet, to date, little is known about the kinetic stability of C3Ms and the dynamic equilibrium of molecular building blocks with micellar species. Here we study the C3M exchange during the initial micellization by using Langevin dynamics simulations. In this way, we show that charge neutral heterocomplexes consisting of multiple building blocks are the primary mediator for exchange. In addition, we show that the kinetic stability of the C3Ms can be tuned not only by the electrostatic interaction but also by the nonelectrostatic attraction between the polyelectrolytes, the polyelectrolyte length ratio, and the overall polyelectrolyte length. These insights offer new rational design guides to aid the development of new C3M encapsulation strategies.","129":"The production of liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles with a narrow size distribution on a large scale remains a challenge. Here, we report the preparation of monodisperse, cross-linked liquid crystalline particles via precipitation polymerization. This versatile and scalable method yields polymer particles with a smectic liquid crystal order. Although the LC monomers are randomly dissolved in solution, the oligomers self-align and LC order is induced. For the polymerization, a smectic LC monomer mixture consisting of cross-linkers and benzoic acid hydrogen-bonded dimers is used. The average diameter of the particles increases at higher polymerization temperatures and in better solvents, whereas the monomer and initiator concentration have only minor impact on the particle size. After deprotonating of the benzoic acid groups, the particles show rapid absorption of a common cationic dye, methylene blue. The methylene blue in the particles can be subsequently released with the addition of Ca2+, while monovalent ions fail to trigger the release. These results reveal that precipitation polymerization is an attractive method to prepare functional LC polymer particles of a narrow size distribution and on a large scale.","130":"In this work, we propose the use of regular branching of polyurethanes as a way to regulate chain dynamics and govern crystallization in highly dense hydrogen-bonded systems. As a result, robust and healable polyurethanes can be obtained. To this end, we synthesized a range of aliphatic propane diol derivatives with alkyl branches ranging from butyl (C4) to octadecanyl (C18). The series of brush polyurethanes was synthesized by polyaddition of the diols and hexamethylene diisocyanate. Polyurethanes with very short (C &lt; 4) and very long (C = 18) brush lengths did not lead to any significant healing due to crystallization. An intermediate amorphous regime appears for polymers with middle branch lengths (C = 4 to 8) showing a fine control of material toughness. For these systems, the side chain length regulates tube dilation, and significant macroscopic healing of cut samples was observed and studied in detail using melt rheology and tensile testing. Despite the high healing degrees observed immediately after repair, it was found that samples with medium to long length brushes lost their interfacial strength at the healed site after being heated to the healing temperature for some time after the optimal time to reach full healing. Dedicated testing suggests that annealed samples, while keeping initial tackiness, are not able to completely heal the cut interface. We attribute such behavior to annealing-induced interfacial crystallization promoted by the aliphatic branches. Interestingly, no such loss of healing due to annealing was observed for samples synthesized with C4 and C7 diols, which is identified as the optimal healing regime. These results point at the positive effect of branching on healing, provided that a critical chain length is not surpassed, as well as the need to study healing behavior long after the optimal healing times.","131":"From protein science, it is well understood that ordered folding and 3D structure mainly arises from balanced and noncovalent polar and nonpolar interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Similarly, it is understood that single-chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs) will also compact and become more rigid with greater hydrophobicity and intrachain hydrogen bonding. Here, we couple high throughput photoinduced electron\/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization with high throughput small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterize a large combinatorial library (&gt;450) of several homopolymers, random heteropolymers, block copolymers, PEG-conjugated polymers, and other polymer-functionalized polymers. Coupling these two high throughput tools enables us to study the major influence(s) for compactness and flexibility in higher breadth than ever before possible. Not surprisingly, we found that many were either highly disordered in solution, in the case of a highly hydrophilic polymer, or insoluble if too hydrophobic. Remarkably, we also found a small group (9\/457) of PEG-functionalized random heteropolymers and block copolymers that exhibited compactness and flexibility similar to that of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by dynamic light scattering (DLS), NMR, and SAXS. In general, we found that describing a rough association between compactness and flexibility parameters (R g \/R h and Porod Exponent, respectively) with logP, a quantity that describes hydrophobicity, helps to demonstrate and predict material parameters that lead to SCNPs with greater compactness, rigidity, and stability. Future implementation of this combinatorial and high throughput approach for characterizing SCNPs will allow for the creation of detailed design parameters for well-defined macromolecular chemistry.","132":"The huge chemical space potential of synthetic polymers means that in many studies only a small parameter range can be realistically synthesized in a short time and hence the \"best\" formulations may not be optimum. Throughput is traditionally limited by the need for deoxygenation in radical polymerizations, but advances in photopolymerization now provide opportunities for \"in-air\" polymerizations. Here, we have developed a protocol using liquid handling robots (or multichannel pipettes) with blue light photolysis of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer agents and tertiary amine deoxygenation to enable the synthesis of polymer libraries in industry-standard 96-well plates with no specialized infrastructure and no degassing step. The roles of solvents and amine deoxygenators are explored to optimize the polymerization, particularly to look at alternatives to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for hydrophobic monomer (co)polymerization. DMSO is shown to aid the degassing process but is not easy to remove and hence prevents isolation of pure polymers. In contrast, using dioxane in-plate evaporation or precipitation of the tertiary amine allowed isolation of polymers in-plate. This removed all reaction components yielding pure polymers, which is not easily achieved with systems using metal catalysts and secondary reductants, such as ascorbic acid. As an example of the throughput, in just under 40 h, 392 polymers were synthesized and subsequently analyzed direct from plates by a 96-well plate sampling size exclusion chromatography system to demonstrate reproducibility. Due to less efficient degassing in dioxane (compared to DMSO), the molecular weight and dispersity control were limited in some cases (with acrylates giving the lowest dispersities), but the key aim of this system is to access hundreds of polymers quickly and in a format needed to enable testing. This method enables easy exploration of chemical space and development of screening libraries to identify hits for further study using precision polymerization methods.","133":"Thermoresponsive microgels are soft colloids that find widespread use as model systems for soft matter physics. Their complex internal architecture, made of a disordered and heterogeneous polymer network, has been so far a major challenge for computer simulations. In this work, we put forward a coarse-grained model of microgels whose structural properties are in quantitative agreement with results obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering experiments across a wide range of temperatures, encompassing the volume phase transition. These results bridge the gap between experiments and simulations of individual microgel particles, paving the way to theoretically address open questions about their bulk properties with unprecedented nano- and microscale resolution.","134":null,"135":"Elucidating the microstructure of supramolecular copolymers remains challenging, despite the progress in the field of supramolecular polymers. In this work, we present a detailed approach to investigate supramolecular copolymerizations under thermodynamic control. Our approach provides insight into the interactions of different types of monomers and hereby allows elucidating the microstructure of copolymers. We select two monomers that undergo cooperative supramolecular polymerization by way of threefold intermolecular hydrogen bonding in a helical manner, namely, benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) and benzene-1,3,5-tris(carbothioamide) (thioBTA). Two enantiomeric forms and an achiral analogue of BTA and thioBTA are synthesized and their homo- and copolymerizations are studied using light scattering techniques, infrared, ultraviolet, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. After quantifying the thermodynamic parameters describing the homopolymerizations, we outline a method to follow the self-assembly of thioBTA derivatives in the copolymerization with BTA, which involves monitoring a characteristic spectroscopic signature as a function of temperature and relative concentration. Using modified types of sergeants-and-soldiers and majority-rules experiments, we obtain insights into the degree of aggregation and the net helicity. In addition, we apply a theoretical model of supramolecular copolymerization to substantiate the experimental results. We find that the model describes the two-component system well and allows deriving the hetero-interaction energies. The interactions between the same kinds of monomers (BTA-BTA and thioBTA-thioBTA) are slightly more favorable than those between different monomers (BTA-thioBTA), corresponding to a nearly random copolymerization. Finally, to study the interactions of the monomers at the molecular level, we perform density functional theory-based computations. The results corroborate that the two-component system exhibits a random distribution of the two monomer units along the copolymer chain.","136":"Utilizing synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) integrated with a microfluidic device, micellization kinetics of a diblock co-polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) was measured in situ with millisecond temporal and micrometer spatial resolution. The evolutionary regimes of polymer micellization - nucleation, fusion, and insertion were directly observed. The five-inlet microfluidic device provided steady continuous mixing of the polymer solution and the antisolvent. Solvent replacement was mainly dominated by lateral diffusion across the hydrodynamically focused central layer, whose thickness could be precisely designed and manipulated from mass balance of the partitioning streams. Knowing the micellization kinetics of the polymers is essential for design and optimization of self-assembled polymeric nanostructures. The technique of integrating SAXS with microfluidic devices can be translatable to other systems for a breadth of applications.","137":"The number of biomedical applications of hydrogels is increasing rapidly on account of their unique physical, structural, and mechanical properties. The utility of hydrogels as drug delivery systems or tissue engineering scaffolds critically depends on the control of diffusion of solutes through the hydrogel matrix. Predicting or even modeling this diffusion is challenging due to the complex structure of hydrogels. Currently, the diffusivity of solutes in hydrogels is typically modeled by one of three main theories proceeding from distinct diffusion mechanisms: (i) hydrodynamic, (ii) free volume, and (iii) obstruction theory. Yet, a comprehensive predictive model is lacking. Thus, time and capital-intensive trial-and-error procedures are used to test the viability of hydrogel applications. In this work, we have developed a model for the diffusivity of solutes in hydrogels combining the three main theoretical frameworks, which we call the multiscale diffusion model (MSDM). We verified the MSDM by analyzing the diffusivity of dextran of different sizes in a series of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with distinct mesh sizes. We measured the subnanoscopic free volume by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to characterize the physical hierarchy of these materials. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of literature data from previous studies on the diffusion of solutes in hydrogels. The model presented outperforms traditional models in predicting solute diffusivity in hydrogels and provides a practical approach to predicting the transport properties of solutes such as drugs through hydrogels used in many biomedical applications.","138":null,"139":"Mechanisms of the phase separation and remixing of cationic PEG-containing block copolymers have been investigated in aqueous lithium triflate solutions. The polycation was poly(vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium triflate). We have previously reported on one such block copolymer, which upon cooling of a hot clear solution first underwent phase separation into a turbid colloid and, later, partially cleared again with further cooling. To better understand the balance of various interactions in the solutions\/dispersions, a series of polymers with varying DP of the cationic block was synthesized. From one of the polymers, the alkyl end group (a fragment of the chain transfer agent) was removed. The length of the cationic block affected critically the behavior, but the hydrophobic end group had a minimal effect. Polymers with a short cationic block turn cloudy and partially clear again during a temperature decrease, whereas those with a long cationic block phase separate and slowly precipitate and remix only when heated. Phase separation takes place via particle formation, and we suggest different mechanisms for colloidal stabilization of particles composed of short or long chains.","140":null,"141":"Thermoplastic composites based on thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) materials are interesting candidates for reinforced composite application due to their promising mechanical performance and potential for recyclability. In combination with a societal push toward the more sustainable use of materials, these properties warrant new interest in this class of composites. Though numerous studies have been performed in the past, a coherent set of design rules for LCP design for the generation of injection-molded reinforced thermoplastic composites is not yet available, likely due to the complex interplay between LCP and matrix components. In this study, we report on the processing of poly(l-lactide) with two different LCPs, at relatively low processing temperatures. The study focuses on critical parameters for the morphological development and mechanical performance of LCP-reinforced composites. The influence of blend composition and the processing conditions, on the mechanical response of the composites, is investigated using rheology, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, mechanical analysis, and microscopy techniques. The study conclusively demonstrates that both the matrix viscosity and viscosity ratio between the dispersed and matrix phase, determine the deformation and breakup of the dispersed LCP droplets during extrusion. In addition, the thermal dependence of the viscosity ratio appears to be a critical parameter for the composite performance after injection molding. For example, during injection molding, stretching and molecular orientation of the LCP phase into highly oriented fibrils are prevented when the viscosity ratio increases rapidly upon cooling. In contrast, melt drawing proves to be a more effective processing route as the extensional flow field stabilizes elongated droplets, independent of the viscosity ratio. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights in the morphological development of LCP-reinforced blends, highlighting the importance of the development of viscoelastic properties as a function of temperature, and provide guidelines for the design of new LCP polymers and their thermoplastic composites.","142":"Despite a vast body of the literature devoted to the use of phenylene polymers in the fabrication of graphene nanoribbons, the study of the physical properties of these precursors still poses open questions whose answers will certainly contribute to the design of more efficient\/precise synthesis protocols. Particularly, persistence length measurements combined with size exclusion chromatography techniques assign both semiflexible to semirigid structures depending on the molecular weight of the precursor (NaritaNat. Chem.2014, 6, 126-132). Peculiarly, these results suggest an apparent structural change upon increasing the length of the polymers. To address this puzzle, we use single-chain models to study the stiffness of polyphenylene precursors in a theta-like solvent as a function of chain composition and monomer sequence. Steric effects are isolated by considering random walk chains with segment length distributions and the position of monomers determined by the nature of the arene substitution along the backbone. Moreover, two homopolymer limiting cases are defined, that is, meta and para sequences, by associating two types of monomers to each possible substitution pattern. We consider, within these two limiting cases, chains with different compositions and monomer sequences. We compute persistence lengths, mean square end-to-end distances, and gyration and hydrodynamic radii. We find that distinct values of the persistence length for apparently the same chain chemistry are the result of different mixing ratios and the arrangement along the chain of the two positional isomers of the same monomer. Finally, we discuss the relation between two-dimensional density of the number of crossings and the length of polyphenylene segments as they would occur upon strong chain adsorption onto a substrate.","143":"Metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) has attracted significant attention recently due to its multiple applications, such as photocatalysis, energy storage and conversion, and biomaterials, albeit formation of g-CN films is challenging. Herein, a \"grafting to\" route to graft polymer brushes onto g-CN via visible-light irradiation is described. Afterward, g-CN\/polymer films can be obtained through spin coating on glass substrates. As such, the present material provides an improved process toward further application of g-CN in thin films. Moreover, an improved dispersibility in organic solvent was realized after grafting and functional groups (such as epoxides) were introduced to g-CN. Subsequently, the epoxy groups were utilized for further functionalization to adjust the surface polarity.","144":"The macroscopic mechanical response of polymers can be traced down to the microscale physics of the network by using a statistical approach for the description of the configuration state of the polymer chains. In this paper we present a micromechanical model to capture the macroscopic behavior of polymers by tracking the evolution of a distribution function describing chain configurations, more specifically the statistics of the end-to-end distance on the network chains. Damage, manifested in the softening and hysteresis under cyclic loading, is accounted for through the scission of chains, whose occurrence is evaluated on the basis of the probability of failure, also settled in the configuration space. The proposed micromechanical model can easily accommodate also the mechanics of dynamic network with reversible cross-links, thereby providing a general and physics-based approach to the study of polymers and polymer-like materials.","145":"By examining structurally similar halogenated xanthene dyes, this study establishes a guiding principle for resolving structure-property- performance relationships in the photocontrolled PET-RAFT polymerization system (PET-RAFT: photoinduced electron\/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer). We investigated the effect of the halogen substituents on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of the xanthene dyes acting as photocatalysts and their resultant effect on the performance of PET-RAFT polymerization. Consideration of the structure- property-performance relationships allowed design of a new xanthene photocatalyst, where its photocatalytic activity (oxygen tolerance and polymerization rate) was successfully optimized for PET-RAFT polymerization. We expect that this study will serve as a theoretical framework in broadly guiding the design of high performance photocatalysts for organic photocatalysis.","146":"Polymer melts undergoing large deformation by elongation are studied by molecular dynamics simulations of bead-spring chains in melts. By applying a primitive path analysis to strongly deformed polymer melts, the role of topological constraints in highly entangled polymer melts is investigated and quantified. We show that the overall, large scale conformations of the primitive paths (PPs) of stretched chains follow affine deformation while the number and the distribution of entanglement points along the PPs do not. Right after deformation, PPs of chains retract in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the elongation. Upon further relaxation we observe a long-lived clustering of entanglement points. Together with the delayed relaxation time this leads to a metastable inhomogeneous distribution of topological constraints in the melts.","147":"Well-defined dendronized polymers (denpols) bearing high-generation dendron are attractive nano-objects as high persistency provides distinct properties, contrast to the random coiled linear polymers However, their syntheses via graft-through approach have been very challenging due to their structural complexity and steric hindrance retarding polymerization. Here, we report the first example of the synthesis of poly(norbornene) (PNB) containing ester dendrons up to the sixth generation (G6) by ring-opening metathesis polymerization. This is the highest generation ever polymerized among dendronized polymers prepared by graft-through approach, producing denpols with molecular weight up to 1960 kg\/mol. Combination of size-exclusion chromatography, light scattering, and neutron scattering allowed a thorough structural study of these large denpols in dilute solution. A semiflexible cylinder model was successfully applied to represent both the static and dynamic experimental quantities yielding persistent length (l p), cross-sectional radius (R cs), and contour length (L). The denpol persistency seemed to increase with generation, with l p reaching 27 nm (Kuhn length 54 nm) for PNB-G6, demonstrating a rod-like conformation. Poly(endo-tricycle[4.2.2.0]deca-3,9-diene) (PTD) denpols exhibited larger persistency than the PNB analogues of the same generation presumably due to the higher grafting density of the PTD denpols. As the dendritic side chains introduce shape anisotropy into the denpol backbone, future work will entail a study of these systems in the concentrated solutions and melts.","148":null,"149":"The persistence of commodity polymers makes the research for degradable alternatives with similar properties necessary. Degradable polyethylene mimics containing orthoester groups were synthesized by olefin metathesis polymerization for the first time. Ring-opening metathesis copolymerization (ROMP) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene with four different cyclic orthoester monomers gave linear copolymers with molecular weights up to 38000 g mol-1. Hydrogenation of such copolymers produced semicrystalline polyethylene-like materials, which were only soluble in hot organic solvents. The crystallinity and melting points of the materials were controlled by the orthoester content of the copolymers. The polymers crystallized similar to polyethylene, but the relatively bulky orthoester groups were expelled from the crystal lattice. The lamellar thickness of the crystals was dependent on the amount of the orthoester groups. In addition, the orthoester substituents influenced the hydrolysis rate of the polymers in solution. Additionally, we were able to prove that non-hydrogenated copolymers with a high orthoester content were biodegraded by microorganisms from activated sludge from a local sewage plant. In general, all copolymers hydrolyzed under ambient conditions over a period of several months. This study represents the first report of hydrolysis-labile and potentially biodegradable PE mimics based on orthoester linkages. These materials may find use in applications that require the relatively rapid release of cargo, e.g., in biomedicine or nanomaterials.","150":null,"151":"Biodegradable polyethylene mimics have been synthesized by the introduction of pyrophosphate groups into the polymer backbone, allowing not only hydrolysis of the backbone but also further degradation by microorganisms. Because of cost, low weight, and good mechanical properties, the use of polyolefins has increased significantly in the past decades and has created many challenges in terms of disposal and their environmental impact. The durability and resistance to degradation make polyethylene difficult or impossible for nature to assimilate, thus making the degradability of polyolefins an essential topic of research. The biodegradable polypyrophosphate was prepared via acyclic diene metathesis polymerization of a diene monomer. The monomer is accessible via a three-step synthesis, in which the pyrophosphate was formed in the last step by DCC coupling of two phosphoric acid derivatives. This is the first report of a pyrophosphate group localized in an organic polymer backbone. The polypyrophosphate was characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetry. X-ray diffraction was used to compare the crystallization structure in comparison to analogous polyphosphates showing poly(ethylene)-like structures. In spite of their hydrophobicity and water insolubility, the pyrophosphate groups exhibited fast hydrolysis, resulting in polymer degradation when films were immersed in water. Additionally, the hydrolyzed fragments were further biodegraded by microorganisms, rendering these PE mimics potential candidates for fast release of hydrophobic cargo, for example, in drug delivery applications.","152":null,"153":"The ageing kinetics of amorphous atactic (a-PS), isotactic (i-PS), and syndiotactic (s-PS) polystyrene were studied by means of flash-differential scanning calorimetry. The specimens were aged for up to 2 h at six different ageing temperatures: the optimum ageing temperature, that is, the temperature at which the enthalpy overshoot at the glass transition is maximal for the given elapsed time, and five ageing temperatures ranging from 20 to 80 K below the optimum ageing temperature. A logarithmic increase of the enthalpy overshoot with ageing time is observed for specimens at their optimum ageing temperatures. For temperatures significantly lower than the optimum, there is a range where the enthalpy overshoot is constant, but for higher temperatures (still below the optimum), a logarithmic increase is also observed. Moreover, the ageing kinetics appear to depend on tacticity, with s-PS and i-PS exhibiting the slowest and fastest ageing kinetics, respectively, and a-PS exhibiting ageing kinetics between these two extremes.","154":"Despite the growing application of nanostructured polymeric materials, there still remains a large gap in our understanding of polymer mechanics and thermal stability under confinement and near polymer-polymer interfaces. In particular, the knowledge of polymer nanoparticle thermal stability and mechanics is of great importance for their application in drug delivery, phononics, and photonics. Here, we quantified the effects of a polymer shell layer on the modulus and glass-transition temperature (T g) of polymer core-shell nanoparticles via Brillouin light spectroscopy and modulated differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Nanoparticles consisting of a polystyrene (PS) core and shell layers of poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) were characterized as model systems. We found that the high T g of the PS core was largely unaffected by the presence of an outer polymer shell, whereas the lower T g of the PBMA shell layer decreased with increasing PBMA thickness. The surface mobility was revealed at a temperature about 15 K lower than the T g of the PBMA shell layer. Overall, the modulus of the core-shell nanoparticles decreased with increasing PBMA shell layer thickness. These results suggest that the nanoparticle modulus and T g can be tuned independently through the control of nanoparticle composition and architecture.","155":null,"156":"The efficient synthesis of complex functional polymeric nanomaterials is often challenging. Ru-initiated ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of multivalent macromonomers followed by cross-linking to form brush-arm star (BASP) polymers enables access to well-defined nano-structures with diverse functionality. This \"brush-first\" method leaves active Ru in the BASP microgel core, which could potentially be used in a subsequent \"ROMP-out\" (RO) step to introduce further modifications to the BASP structure via the addition of (macro)monomers. Here, we study this RO approach in depth. The efficiency of RO is assessed for a variety of BASP compositions using a combination of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography. To demonstrate the modularity of the RO process, arylboronic acid-functionalized BASPs were prepared; uptake of these RO-BASPs into hypersialylated cancer cells was enhanced relative to non-functionalized BASPs as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the self-assembly of miktoarm BASPs prepared via brush-first and RO with different macromonomers is demonstrated. The combination of brush-first ROMP with RO provides a simple, modular strategy for access to a wide array of functional nanomaterials.","157":null,"158":"Changes in the Curie transition temperature of nanoconfined poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE) copolymers can have a severe impact on the electroactive behavior and the application range of these materials. Therefore, the origin of the change in the Curie transition temperature requires a profound understanding. In this work, block copolymer self-assembly into a spherical morphology proves to be a viable method to effectively confine P(VDF-TrFE) in three dimensions for studying the effect of nanoconfinement on the Curie transition. Using differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray scattering, easily accessible experimental techniques, we follow the crystalline phase transitions, showing that confining P(VDF-TrFE) in a nonpolar polystyrene (PS) or poly(4-tert-butoxystyrene) (PtBOS) matrix results in an increase of the Curie transition upon cooling and heating. However, when a more polar matrix is used to nanoconfine P(VDF-TrFE), the Curie transition temperature is drastically reduced due to surface effects.","159":"Dimple colloids with well-defined cavities were synthesized by a modified dispersion polymerization. The key step in the procedure is the delayed addition of cross-linkers into the reaction mixture. By systematically studying the effect of the delayed addition time and the concentration of the cross-linker on the resulting particle morphology, we identified the dominating driving force that underlies dimple formation. The delayed addition of cross-linkers results in colloids with a core-shell morphology consisting of a core rich in linear polymers and a cross-linked shell. This morphology was confirmed by selectively etching non-cross-linked material using dimethylformamide. With polymerization proceeding, consumption of monomers present in the swollen particles leads to contraction of the particles, which is larger for the core composed of linear polymers compared to the stiffer cross-linked shell. To accommodate this decrease in volume, the outer cross-linked shell has to buckle, resulting in a well-defined dimple. Furthermore, we extended the procedure to incorporate functional monomers, yielding chemically modifiable dimple particles. Subsequently, we showed that by leveraging the core-shell structure, these dimple particles can be used to prepare dumbbell-shaped colloids with one hollow and one solid lobe. These partially hollow anisotropic particles assemble into strings with well-defined orientations in an alternating current electric field.","160":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1021\/acs.macromol.7b01567.].","161":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1021\/acs.macromol.8b00890.].","162":"Three series of well-defined norbornene imide-based polymers with different pendant groups were synthesized to investigate the effect of the pendant group on the polymer conformation in solution and bulk melt properties. Each of these three series was examined by analyzing the polymers' bulk z-average radius of gyration via static light scattering and the polymers' melt viscoelastic properties via oscillatory measurements and differential scanning calorimetry. Sterically bulky pendant wedge groups modestly increase the rodlike conformation of the norbornene-imide polymer, however, the inherent rigidity of the polymer main-chain can still be observed with less bulky substituents. In stark contrast, the different side groups significantly impacted the bulk viscoelastic and thermal properties. By increasing the pendant group size, the chain diameter of the polymer increases and lowers the entanglement modulus. Finally, as the wedge pendant group size increases, the segmental relaxation time and the fragility index of these norbornene-based polymers are decreased.","163":"Multicomponent supramolecular polymers are a versatile platform to prepare functional architectures, but a few studies have been devoted to investigate their noncovalent synthesis. Here, we study supramolecular copolymerizations by examining the mechanism and time scales associated with the incorporation of new monomers in benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA)-based supramolecular polymers. The BTA molecules in this study all contain three tetra(ethylene glycol) chains at the periphery for water solubility but differ in their alkyl chains that feature either 10, 12 or 13 methylene units. C10BTA does not form ordered supramolecular assemblies, whereas C12BTA and C13BTA both form high aspect ratio supramolecular polymers. First, we illustrate that C10BTA can mix into the supramolecular polymers based on either C12BTA or C13BTA by comparing the temperature response of the equilibrated mixtures to the temperature response of the individual components in water. Subsequently, we mix C10BTA with the polymers and follow the copolymerization over time with UV spectroscopy and hydrogen\/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry experiments. Interestingly, the time scales obtained in both experiments reveal significant differences in the rates of copolymerization. Coarse-grained simulations are used to study the incorporation pathway and kinetics of the C10BTA monomers into the different polymers. The results demonstrate that the kinetic stability of the host supramolecular polymer controls the rate at which new monomers can enter the existing supramolecular polymers.","164":"We report on the role of temperature and shear on the melt behavior of iPP in the presence of the organic compound N1,N1'-(propane-1,3-diyl)bis(N2-hexyloxalamide) (OXA3,6). It is demonstrated that OXA3,6 facilitates a viscosity suppression when it resides in the molten state. The viscosity suppression is attributed to the interaction of iPP chains\/subchains with molten OXA3,6 nanoclusters. The exact molecular mechanism has not been identified; nevertheless, a tentative explanation is proposed. The observed viscosity suppression appears similar to that encountered in polymer melts filled with solid nanoparticles, with the difference that the OXA3,6 compound reported in this study facilitates the viscosity suppression in the molten state. Upon cooling, as crystal growth of OXA3,6 progresses, the decrease in viscosity is suppressed. Retrospectively, segmental absorption of iPP chains on the surface of micrometer-sized OXA3,6 crystallites favors the formation of dangling arms, yielding OXA3,6 crystallites decorated with partially absorbed iPP chains. In other words, the resulting OXA3,6 particle morphology resembles that of a hairy particle or a starlike polymer chain. Such hairy particles effectively facilitate a viscosity enhancement, similar to branched polymer chains. This hypothesis and its implications for the shear behavior of iPP are discussed and supported using plate-plate rheometry and slit-flow experiments combined with small-angle X-ray scattering analysis.","165":"Multivalency is an important instrument in the supramolecular chemistry toolkit for the creation of strong specific interactions. In this paper we investigate the multivalency effect in a dendritic host-guest system using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we consider urea-adamantyl decorated poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers that together with compatible mono-, bi-, and tetravalent ureidoacetic acid guests can form dynamic patchy nanoparticles. First, we simulate the self-assembly of these particles into macromolecular nanostructures, showing guest-controlled reduction of dendrimer aggregation. Subsequently, we systematically study guest concentration dependent multivalent binding. At low guest concentrations multivalency of the guests clearly increases relative binding as tethered headgroups bind more often than free guests' headgroups. We find that despite an abundance of binding sites, most of the tethered headgroups bind in close proximity, irrespective of the spacer length; nevertheless, longer spacers do increase binding. At high guest concentrations the dendrimer becomes saturated with bound headgroups, independent of guest valency. However, in direct competition the tetravalent guests prevail over the monovalent ones. This demonstrates the benefit of multivalency at high as well as low concentrations.","166":null,"167":"Hydrogels formed by polyelectrolyte complexation (PEC) of oppositely charged biopolymers, free of any chemical additives, are promising biomaterials. In this work, the mechanical behavior of hydrogels consisting of positively charged chitosan and negatively charged sodium hyaluronate (HA) at balanced charge composition is investigated. These hydrogels exhibit strong tensile strain and strain rate dependence. They are elastic-like, independent of the strain rate at small strain, but exhibit plastic-like behavior above the yield point by showing a monotonous decrease of the stress. The cyclic tensile test demonstrates that these hydrogels exhibit small and quickly recoverable hysteresis in the elastic-like region, but large and partially recoverable hysteresis above the yield point. The stress relaxation experiment shows a plateau in the reduced stress followed by an abrupt fracture, and the time-to-failure decreases exponentially with increasing applied step-strain. Such elastic-to-plastic-like transformation of the biopolymer PEC gels is quite different from the behaviors of PEC hydrogels formed by oppositely charged vinyl-type synthetic polyelectrolytes due to the difference in flexibility, charge density, and ionic bond strength of these polymers.","168":null,"169":"Advances in nanoparticle synthesis, self-assembly, and surface coating or patterning have enabled a diverse array of applications ranging from photonic and phononic crystal fabrication to drug delivery vehicles. One of the key obstacles restricting its potential is structural and thermal stability. The presence of a glass transition can facilitate deformation within nanoparticles, thus resulting in a significant alteration in structure and performance. Recently, we detected a glassy-state transition within individual polystyrene nanoparticles and related its origin to the presence of a surface layer with enhanced dynamics compared to the bulk. The presence of this mobile layer could have a dramatic impact on the thermal stability of polymer nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate how the addition of a shell layer, as thin as a single polymer chain, atop the nanoparticles could completely eliminate any evidence of enhanced mobility at the surface of polystyrene nanoparticles. The ultrathin polymer shell layers were placed atop the nanoparticles via two approaches: (i) covalent bonding or (ii) electrostatic interactions. The temperature dependence of the particle vibrational spectrum, as recorded by Brillouin light scattering, was used to probe the surface mobility of nanoparticles with and without a shell layer. Beyond suppression of the surface mobility, the presence of the ultrathin polymer shell layers impacted the nanoparticle glass transition temperature and shear modulus, albeit to a lesser extent. The implication of this work is that the core-shell architecture allows for tailoring of the nanoparticle elasticity, surface softening, and glass transition temperature.","170":"End-anchoring polymers to a solid surface to form so-called polymer brushes is a versatile method to prepare robust functional coatings. We show, using molecular dynamics simulations, that these coatings display rich wetting behavior. Depending on the interaction between the brushes and the polymeric droplets as well as on the self-affinity of the brush, we can distinguish between three wetting states: mixing, complete wetting, and partial wetting. We find that transitions between these states are largely captured by enthalpic arguments, while deviations to these can be attributed to the negative excess interfacial entropy for the brush droplet system. Interestingly, we observe that the contact angle strongly increases when the softness of the brush is increased, which is opposite to the case of drops on soft elastomers. Hence, the Young to Neumann transition owing to softness is not universal but depends on the nature of the substrate.","171":"We develop a scaling theory and perform molecular dynamic simulations of weakly interacting coacervates with electrostatic interaction energy per charge less than thermal energy kT. Such liquid coacervates formed by oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can be asymmetric in charge density and number of charges per chain. We predict that these coacervates form interpenetrating solutions with two correlation lengths and two qualitatively different types of conformations of polyelectrolytes with lower and higher charge densities, which are analogous to chain conformations in quasi-neutral and in polyelectrolyte solutions, respectively. Weaker charged chains are attracted to and adsorbed on stronger charged chains forming a screening \"coat\" around the stronger charged polyelectrolytes. Salt added at lower concentrations screens the repulsion between stronger charged chains, thereby reducing the thickness of the screening coat and resulting in the non-zero net polymer charge in the coacervate. At higher salt concentrations salt screens the attraction between oppositely charged chains, decreasing the coacervate concentration and its polymeric charge density. Thus, we predict a non-monotonic salt concentration dependence of polymeric charge density for asymmetric coacervates. Phase diagram for a mixture of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes at various compositions is proposed for different salt concentrations.","172":"Discrete length block co-oligomers (BCOs) comprised of a crystalline and an amorphous block are a new class of materials that gives highly ordered lamellar morphologies at small length scales. Here, we show the preparation of discrete, isotactic oligo l- and d-lactic acid (olLA and odLA) homoblocks followed by ligation to oligodimethylsiloxane (oDMS), affording a library of crystalline-amorphous BCOs that vary in molecular weight and composition. Mixing the two enantiomeric BCOs or homoblocks results in the formation of the corresponding stereocomplex. The properties and phase behavior of the isotactic (block co)oligomers and the stereocomplexes thereof are studied using differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. A systematic study of the isotactic homoblock lengths and crystal structure confirmed the formation of a 103 helix with a monomeric rise of 0.3 nm, whereas the stereocomplex adopts a 31 helix. The same type of crystal structure was found for the isotactic and stereocomplex of BCOs giving rise to the formation of lamellar morphologies at room temperature as a result of crystallization of the oLA blocks. Distorted lamellar structures were found in BCOs that preorganize into nonlamellar morphologies prior to crystallization. The stereocomplex BCOs shows more crystal defects and a loss of long-range ordering in the microstructure due to the larger driving force for crystallization. Hence, the balance between chain length, block volume, and the crystallization strength are of major importance for the formation of the final structure with the least defects.","173":"We develop a generic coarse-grained model of soluble conjugated polymers, capable of describing their self-assembly into a lamellar mesophase. Polymer chains are described by a hindered-rotation model, where interaction centers represent entire repeat units, including side chains. We introduce soft anisotropic nonbonded interactions to mimic the potential of mean force between atomistic repeat units. The functional form of this potential reflects the symmetry of the molecular order in a lamellar mesophase. The model can generate both nematic and lamellar (sanidic smectic) molecular arrangements. We parametrize this model for a soluble conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and demonstrate that the simulated lamellar mesophase matches morphologies of low molecular weight P3HT, experimentally observed at elevated temperatures. A qualitative charge-transport model allows us to link local chain conformations and mesoscale order to charge transport. In particular, it shows how coarsening of lamellar domains and chain extension increase the charge carrier mobility. By modeling large systems and long chains, we can capture transport between lamellar layers, which is due to rare, but thermodynamically allowed, backbone bridges between neighboring layers.","174":"Photoinduced organocatalyzed atom-transfer radical polymerization (O-ATRP) is a controlled radical polymerization methodology that can be mediated by organic photoredox catalysts under the influence of light. However, typical O-ATRP systems require relatively high catalyst loadings (1000 ppm) to achieve control over the polymerization. Here, new core-extended diaryl dihydrophenazine photoredox catalysts were developed for O-ATRP and demonstrated to efficiently operate at low catalyst loadings of 5-50 ppm to produce polymers with excellent molecular weight control and low dispersity, while achieving near-quantitative initiator efficiency. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the catalysts were computationally predicted and experimentally measured to correlate these properties with improved catalytic performance. Furthermore, these catalysts were utilized to synthesize materials with complex architectures, such as triblock copolymers and star polymers. To demonstrate their broad utility, polymerizations employing these catalysts were successfully scaled up to 5 g and revealed to efficiently operate under air.","175":"We have synthesized a series of stimuli-responsive brush polymers by grafting azide-terminated side chains onto a self-immolative, alkyne-bearing poly(benzyl ether) backbone, which is prepared by anionic polymerization of quinone methide-based monomers. Upon exposure to a decapping reagent (Pd(0) or F-), these brush polymers undergo an irreversible degradation cascade from head to tail to yield individual side chains. It is observed that several factors affect the depolymerization kinetics, including solvent polarity, type of counterion, the rate of the decapping chemistry, and interestingly, the rigidity of the side chains.","176":null,"177":null,"178":"We present a systematic study of the role of the aromatic dianhydride structure on the self-healing behavior of dimer diamine-based polyimides. By means of solid-state NMR and rheology, we studied the molecular and microscale dynamics of four polyimides comprising the same aliphatic branched diamine yet with variable dianhydride rigidities and correlated these to their macroscopic healing kinetics measured by tensile testing. Following the two-step kinetics of the healing process, we were able to differentiate and quantify the extent of mechanical strength recovery in each of the healing stages separately. Moreover, the detailed rheology and solid-state NMR allowed us to shed light on the role of the aromatic interactions and branches on the mechanical properties and mechanical integrity during macroscopic healing. The study reveals the relevance and interplay of primary and secondary interactions in the development of non-cross-linked strong and healing polymers able to maintain mechanical integrity during healing.","179":null,"180":null,"181":"In this contribution, the temperature-dependent swelling behavior of vapor-deposited smart polymer thin films is shown to depend on cross-linking and deposited film thickness. Smart polymers find application in sensor and actuator setups and are mostly fabricated on delicate substrates with complex nanostructures that need to be conformally coated. As initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) meets these specific requirements, the present work concentrates on temperature-dependent swelling behavior of iCVD poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) thin films. The transition between swollen and shrunken state and the corresponding lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry in water. The films' density in the dry state evaluated from X-ray reflectivity could be successfully correlated to the position of the LCST in water and was found to vary between 1.1 and 1.3 g\/cm3 in the thickness range 30-330 nm. This work emphasizes the importance of insights in both the deposition process and mechanisms during swelling of smart polymeric structures.","182":"We have studied the effect of cross-linking on the tribological behavior of polymer brushes using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Tribological and indentation measurements on poly(glycidyl methacrylate) brushes and gels in the presence of dimethylformamide solvent were obtained by means of atomic force microscopy. To complement experiments, we have performed corresponding molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a generic bead-spring model in the presence of explicit solvent and cross-linkers. Our study shows that cross-linking leads to an increase in friction between polymer brushes and a counter-surface. The coefficient of friction increases with increasing degree of cross-linking and decreases with increasing length of the cross-linker chains. We find that the brush-forming polymer chains in the outer layer play a significant role in reducing friction at the interface.","183":null,"184":"Anfinsen's famous experiment showed that the restoration of catalytic activity of a completely unfolded ribonuclease A is only possible when the correct order of events is followed during the refolding process. Inspired by this work, the effect of structural constraints induced by covalent cross-links on the folding of a synthetic polymer chain via hydrogen-bonding interactions is investigated. Hereto, methacrylate-based monomers comprising either benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA)-based or coumarin-based pendants are copolymerized with n-butyl methacrylate in various ratios via reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization. To assess whether the folding and single-chain polymeric nanoparticle (SCPN) formation depend on the order of events, we compare two folding pathways. In the one case, we first covalently cross-link the coumarin pendants within the polymers in a solvent that prevents hydrogen bonding, after which hydrogen bonding is activated, inducing folding of the polymer. In the other case, we induce hydrogen-bonding interactions between tethered BTAs prior to covalent cross-linking of the coumarin pendants. A combination of circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) is employed to understand the effect of the structural constraints on the folding behavior of these synthetic polymers. The results show that like in ribonuclease A, the order of events matters greatly and determines the outcome. Importantly, a hydrogen-bond-promoting solvent prevents the formation of SCPNs upon covalent cross-linking and results in multichain aggregates. In contrast, covalently cross-linking the polymer when no hydrogen bonds are present followed by inducing hydrogen bonding favors the formation of SCPNs above the UCST of the methacrylate-based polymer. To our surprise, the two systems show a fundamentally different response to changes in temperature, indicating that also in synthetic polymers differences in the folding pathway induce differences in the properties of the resultant nanostructures.","185":null,"186":"The combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been exploited to investigate the influence of temperature and hydration on the water distribution and mobility in poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDADMA) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) complexes. The findings show that the vast majority of the water molecules hydrating the polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) with 18-30 wt % hydration are effectively immobilized due to the strong interactions between the PE charge groups and water. Temperature and hydration were found to decrease similarly the fraction of strongly bound water. Additionally, at low hydration or at low temperatures, water motions become dominantly local vibrations and rotations instead of translational motion; translation dominance is recovered in a similar fashion by increase of both temperature and hydration. DSC experiments corroborate the simulation findings by showing that nonfreezing, bound water dominates in hydrated PECs at comparable hydrations. Our results raise attention to water as an equal variable to temperature in the design and engineering of stimuli-responsive polyelectrolyte materials and provide mechanistic explanation for the similarity.","187":"The synthesis of charged polymers often requires the polymerization of protected monomers, followed by a polymer-analogous reaction to the polyelectrolyte product. We present a mild, facile method to cleave tert-butyl groups from poly(tert-butyl acrylate) blocks that yields poly(acrylic acid) (pAA) blocks free of traces of the ester. The reaction utilizes a slight excess of HCl in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) at room temperature and runs to completion within 4 h. We compare deprotection in HFIP with the common TFA\/DCM method and show that the latter does not yield clean pAA. We show the effect of complete tert-butyl cleavage on a ABA triblock copolymer, where poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) is A and pAA is B, by means of viscosimetry, DLS, and SAXS on solutions above overlap. The pNIPAM blocks dehydrate, and their increased self-affinity above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) results in network formation by the triblocks. This manifests itself as an increase in viscosity and a slowing down of the first-order correlation function in light scattering. However, this stickering effect manifests itself exclusively when the pAA block is tert-butyl-free. Additionally, SAXS shows that the conformational properties of tert-butyl-free pAA copolymers are markedly different from those with residual esters. Thus, we illustrate a surprising effect of hydrophobic impurities that act across blocks and assert the usefulness of HCl\/HFIP in pAA synthesis.","188":null,"189":null,"190":"In the restoration of paintings, solvent diffusion and swelling of polymeric oil paint binding media are important factors to consider. Common cleaning methods with organic solvents or aqueous solutions could lead to undesirable physicochemical changes in the paint in the long term, though the extent of this effect is not yet clear. We used tailored nonporous model systems for aged oil paint to measure paint swelling and solvent diffusion for a wide range of relevant solvents. Using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), the glass transition temperature of our model systems was found to be close to room temperature. Subsequently, with a custom sample cell and time-dependent attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, we were able to accurately track swelling and diffusion processes in the polymer films. To quantify the spectroscopic data, we developed a model that completely describes the solvent migration process, including significant film swelling and non-Fickian solvent diffusion. The relation between solvent properties, the diffusion coefficient, and the swelling capacity proved to be rather complex and could not be explained using a single solvent parameter. However, it was found that strongly swelling solvents generally diffuse faster than weakly swelling solvents and that pigmentation does not significantly influence solvent diffusion. These results contribute to a better understanding of transport phenomena in paintings and support the development of improved paint restoration strategies.","191":"A furan-based synthetic biopolymer composed of a bifuran monomer and ethylene glycol was synthesized through melt polycondensation, and the resulting polyester was found to have promising thermal and mechanical properties. The bifuran monomer, dimethyl 2,2'-bifuran-5,5'-dicarboxylate, was prepared using a palladium-catalyzed, phosphine ligand-free direct coupling protocol. A titanium-catalyzed polycondensation procedure was found effective at polymerizing the bifuran monomer with ethylene glycol. The prepared bifuran polyester exhibited several intriguing properties including high tensile modulus. In addition, the bifuran monomer furnished the polyester with a relatively high glass transition temperature. Films prepared from the new polyester also had excellent oxygen and water barrier properties, which were found to be superior to those of poly(ethylene terephthalate). Moreover, the novel polyester also has good ultraviolet radiation blocking properties.","192":"While the formation of (tri)block copolymer hydrogels has been extensively investigated, such studies mostly focused on equilibrium self-assembling whereas the use of preformed structures as building blocks such as out of equilibrium, quenched, nanofibrillar micelles is still a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that quenched, ultralong polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) micelles can be used as robust precursors of hydrogels. Two cross-linking strategies, (i) thermal fusion of micellar cores and (ii) chemical cross-linking of preformed micellar coronas were studied. The gelation process and the structure of the micellar networks were investigated by in situ rheological measurements, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Direct observation of core fusion of preformed quenched micelles is provided validating this method as a robust gelation route. Using time sweep rheological experiments, it was found for both cross-linking methods that these 3D \"mikado\" gels are formed in three different stages, containing (1) initiation, (2) transition (growth), and (3) stabilization regimes.","193":"We carried out large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the growth of twin lamellar crystals of polyethylene initiated by small crystal seeds. By examining the size distribution of the stems-straight crystalline polymer segments-we show that the crystal edge has a parabolic profile. At the growth front, there is a layer of stems too short to be stable, and new stable stems are formed within this layer, leading to crystal growth. Away from the edge, the lengthening of the stems is limited by a lack of available slack length in the chains. This frustration can be relieved by mobile crystal defects that allow topological relaxation by traversing through the crystal. The results shed light on the process of polymer crystal growth and help explain initial thickness selection and lamellar thickening.","194":null,"195":null,"196":"Chiral conjugated polymers bearing enantiopure side chains offer the possibility to harness the effect of chirality in organic electronic devices. However, its use is hampered by the low degree of circular polarization in absorption (gabs) in most of the conjugated polymer thin-films studied. Here we demonstrate a versatile method to significantly increase the gabs by using a few weight percentages of a commercially available achiral long-chain alcohol as an additive. This additive enhances the chiroptical properties in both absorption and emission by ca. 5-10 times in the thin-films. We envisage that the alcohol additive acts as a plasticizer which enhances the long-range chiral liquid crystalline ordering of the polymer chains, thereby amplifying the chiroptical properties in the thin-film. The application of this methodology to various conjugated polymers has been demonstrated.","197":"Control over thin film growth (e.g., crystallographic orientation and morphology) is of high technological interest as it affects several physicochemical material properties, such as chemical affinity, mechanical stability, and surface morphology. The effect of process parameters on the molecular organization of perfluorinated polymers deposited via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) has been previously reported. We showed that the tendency of poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (pPFDA) to organize in an ordered lamellar structure is a function of the filament and substrate temperatures adopted during the iCVD process. In this contribution, a more thorough investigation of the effect of such parameters is presented, using synchrotron radiation grazing incidence and specular X-ray diffraction (GIXD and XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The parameters influencing the amorphization, mosaicity, and preferential orientation are addressed. Different growth regimes were witnessed, characterized by a different surface structuring and by the presence of particular crystallographic textures. The combination of morphological and crystallographic analyses allowed the identification of pPFDA growth possibilities between island or columnar growth.","198":null,"199":"Supramolecular polymers bearing weak hydrogen bonds (sticker) can express outstanding dynamic properties due to their labile association. Studying the linear viscoelasticity (LVE) of this type of polymer can provide us with sufficient knowledge to design polymeric materials for applications that need dynamic properties such as self-healing. Using different compositions of flexible weak stickers, LVE analysis showed scalings corresponding to a transition from a linear precursor to a cluster. By introducing one sticker per repeating unit of the precursor polymer, the effect of sticker distribution along the chain as well as phase separation is excluded. However, even a fully functionalized polymer could not show any network formation, whereas surprisingly, a stable cluster was formed. This proves that weakly associated networks do not dissociate rapidly and can relax as a cluster at extended time before the dissociation of stickers can lead to the relaxation of linear analogous (slow kinetics similar to strong physical or even chemical bonds.) On the other hand, the absence of a gel even in fully sticker-functionalized polymers shows that the weakness of these polymers can be described as their weakness in complete association (thermodynamically not favored).","200":"We report on the effect of an aliphatic oxalamide based nucleating agent (OXA3,6) on the melt and crystallization behavior of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) under defined shear conditions. Through polarized optical microscopy, we demonstrate that OXA3,6 self-assembles from the iPP melt into rhombic crystals whereas their size and distribution proved highly dependent on the employed cooling rates. The presence of 0.5 wt % of OXA3,6 in iPP results in a significant suppression in iPP melt viscosity, which could not be explained via molecular modeling. A possible cause for the drop in viscosity in the presence of OXA3,6 is attributed to the interaction (absorption) of high molecular weight iPP chains with the nucleating agent, thereby suppressing their contribution to the viscoelastic response of the melt. This proposed mechanism for the suppression in melt viscosity appears similar to that encountered by the homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles such as CNTs, graphene, and silica. Shear experiments, performed using a slit flow device combined with small-angle X-ray diffraction measurements, indicate that crystallization is significantly enhanced in the presence of OXA3,6 at relatively low shear rates despite its lowered sensitivity to shear. This enhancement in crystallization is attributed to the shear alignment of the rhombic OXA3,6 crystals that provide surface for iPP kebab growth upon cooling. Overall, the suppression in melt viscosity in combination with enhanced nucleation efficiency at low as well as high shear rates makes this self-assembling oxalamide based nucleating agent a promising candidate for fast processing.","201":"Physically associated hydrogels based on strong hydrophobic interactions often have attractive mechanical properties that combine processability with elasticity. However, there is a need to study such interactions and understand their relation to the macroscopic hydrogel properties. Therefore, we use the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea as reagents that disrupt hydrophobic interactions. The model hydrogel is based on a segmented copolymer between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and hydrophobic dimer fatty acid (DFA). We show that both agents influence viscoelastic properties, dynamics, and relaxation processes of the model hydrogel. In particular, the relaxation time is significantly reduced by urea, as compared to SDS, whereas the surfactant causes a decrease of the modulus of the hydrogel more efficiently. The reversibility of the effects of SDS and urea can be exploited, for instance, by using an injectable sol that solidifies when the SDS or urea diffuses out of the sample. Surfactant-induced processability may be advantageous in future applications of hydrophobically assembled physical hydrogels.","202":"Various hydrophobic supports have been used for lipase immobilization since the active site of lipase can be opened in a hydrophobic environment. Nevertheless, the increase of lipase activity is still limited. This study demonstrates a hyperactivation-protection strategy of lipase after immobilization on poly(n-butyl acrylate)-polyaldehyde dextran (PBA-PAD) core-shell nanoparticles. The inner hydrophobic PBA domain helps to rearrange lipase conformation to a more active form after immobilization into the PAD shell. More importantly, the outer PAD shell with dense polysaccharide chains prevents the immobilized lipase from contact with outside aqueous medium and revert its conformation back to an inactive form. As a result, under optimal conditions the activity of lipase immobilized in PBA-PAD nanoparticles was enhanced 40 times over the free one, much higher than in any previous report. Furthermore, the immobilized lipase retained more than 80 % of its activity after 10 reaction cycles.","203":"It was recently reported that copper catalysts used in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) can combine with anionic surfactants used in emulsion polymerization to form ion pairs. The ion pairs predominately reside at the surface of the monomer droplets, but they can also migrate inside the droplets and induce a controlled polymerization. This concept was applied to activator regenerated by electron transfer (ARGET) ATRP, with ascorbic acid as reducing agent. ATRP of n-butyl acrylate (BA) and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) was carried out in miniemulsion using CuII\/tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) as catalyst, with several anionic surfactants forming the reactive ion-pair complexes. The amount and structure of surfactant controlled both the polymerization rate and the final particle size. Well-controlled polymers were prepared with catalyst loadings as low as 50 ppm, leaving only 300 ppb of Cu in the precipitated polymer. Efficient chain extension of a poly(BMA)-Br macroinitiator confirmed high retention of chain-end functionality. This procedure was exploited to prepare polymers with complex architectures such as block copolymers, star polymers, and molecular brushes.","204":"An electrochemically mediated reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (eRAFT) of (meth)acrylates was successfully carried out via electroreduction of either benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or 4-bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate (BrPhN2+) which formed aryl radicals, acting as initiators for RAFT polymerization. Direct electroreduction of chain transfer agents was unsuccessful since it resulted in the formation of carbanions by a two-electron transfer process. Reduction of BrPhN2+ under a fixed potential showed acceptable control, but limited conversion due to the generation of a passivating organic layer grafted on the working electrode surface. However, using fixed current conditions, easier to implement than fixed potential conditions, conversions &gt; 80% were achieved. Well-defined homopolymers and block copolymers with a broad range of targeted degrees of polymerization were prepared.","205":"A highly-reactive vinyl ether-functionalized aliphatic polycarbonate and its block copolymer were developed as templates for multiple post-polymerization conjugation chemistries. The vinyl ether-functional six-membered cyclic carbonate monomer was synthesized by a well-established two-step procedure starting from 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid. An organobase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of the synthesized monomer afforded polycarbonates with pendant vinyl ether functionalities (PMVEC). The vinyl ether moieties on the resulting polymers were readily conjugated with hydroxyl- or thiol-containing compounds via three different post-polymerization modification chemistries - acetalization, thio-acetalization, and thiol-ene reaction. Acetal-functionalized polycarbonates were studied in depth to exploit their acid-labile acetal functionalities. Acetalization of the amphiphilic diblock copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) and PMVEC, mPEG113-b-PMVEC13, with the model hydroxyl compound 4- methylbenzyl alcohol resulted in a maximum of 42% acetal and 58% hydroxyl side chain groups. Nonetheless, the amphiphilicity of the block polymer allowed for its self-assembly in water to afford nanostructures, as characterized via dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The kinetics of acetal cleavage within the block polymer micelles were examined in acidic buffered solutions (pH 4 and 5). In addition, mPEG-b-PMVEC and its hydrolyzed polymer mPEG-b-PMHEC (i.e., after full cleavage of acetals) exhibited minimal cytotoxicity to RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages, indicating that this polymer system represents a biologically non-hazardous material with pH-responsive activity.","206":"The equilibrium mechanical properties of a cross-linked gel of telechelic star polymers are studied by rheology and Brownian dynamics simulations. The Brownian dynamics model consists of cores to which Rouse arms are attached. Forces between the cores are obtained from a potential of mean force model developed by Likos and co-workers. Both experimentally and in the simulations, networks were created by attaching sticker groups to the ends of the arms of the polymers, which were next allowed to form bonds among them in a one to one fashion. Simulations were sped up by solving the Rouse dynamics exactly. Moreover, the Rouse model was extended to allow for different frictions on different beads. In order to describe the rheology of the non-cross-linked polymers, it had to be assumed that bead frictions increase with increasing bead number along the arms. This friction model could be transferred to describe the rheology of the network without any adjustments other than an overall increase of the frictions due to the formation of bonds. The slowing down at intermediate times of the network rheology compared to that of the non-cross-linked polymers is well described by the model. The percentage of stickers involved in forming inter-star bonds in the system was determined to be 25%, both from simulations and from an application of the Green-Tobolsky relation to the experimental plateau value of the shear relaxation modulus. Simulations with increasing cross-link percentages revealed that on approaching the gel transition the shear relaxation modulus develops an algebraic tail, which gets frozen at a percentage of maximum cross-linking of about 11%.","207":"In single-site olefin polymerization catalysis, a large excess of cocatalyst is often required for the generation of highly active catalysts, but the reason for this is unclear. In this work, fundamental insight into the multifaceted role of cocatalyst methylaluminoxane (MAO) in the activation, deactivation, and stabilization of group 4 metallocenes in the immobilized single-site olefin polymerization catalyst was gained. Employing probe molecule FT-IR spectroscopy, it was found that weak Lewis acid sites, inherent to the silica-supported MAO cocatalyst, are the main responsible species for the genesis of active metallocenes for olefin polymerization. These weak Lewis acid sites are the origin of AlMe2+ groups. Deactivation of metallocenes is caused by the presence of silanol groups on the silica support. Interaction of the catalyst precursor with these silanol groups leads to the irreversible formation of inactive metallocenes. Importantly, a high concentration of MAO (14 wt% Al) on the silica support is necessary to keep the metallocenes immobilized, hence preventing metallocene leaching and consequent reactor fouling. Increasing the loading of the MAO cocatalyst leads to larger amounts of AlMe2+, fewer silanol groups, and less metallocene leaching, which all result in higher olefin polymerization activity.","208":null,"209":"Polymer-tethered colloidal particles (aka \"particle brush materials\") have attracted interest as a platform for innovative material technologies and as a model system to elucidate glass formation in complex structured media. In this contribution, Brillouin light scattering is used to sequentially evaluate the role of brush architecture on the dynamical properties of brush particles in both the individual and assembled (film) state. In the former state, the analysis reveals that brush-brush interactions as well as global chain relaxation sensitively depend on grafting density; i.e., more polymer-like behavior is observed in sparse brush systems. This is interpreted to be a consequence of more extensive chain entanglement. In contrast, the local relaxation of films does not depend on grafting density. The results highlight that relaxation processes in particle brush-based materials span a wider range of time and length scales as compared to linear chain polymers. Differentiation between relaxation on local and global scale is necessary to reveal the influence of molecular structure and connectivity on the aging behavior of these complex systems.","210":"The mechanism of surface-initiated atom transfer polymerization (SI-ATRP) of methacrylates in confined volumes is systematically investigated by finely tuning the distance between a grafting surface and an inert plane by means of nanosized patterns and micrometer thick foils. The polymers were synthesized from monolayers of photocleavable initiators, which allow the analysis of detached brushes by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Compared to brushes synthesized under \"open\" polymerization mixtures, nearly a 4-fold increase in brush molar mass was recorded when SI-ATRP was performed within highly confined reaction volumes. Correlating the SI-ATRP of methyl methacrylate (MMA), with and without \"sacrificial\" initiator, to that of lauryl methacrylate (LMA) and analyzing the brush growth rates within differently confined volumes, we demonstrate faster grafting kinetics with increasing confinement due to the progressive hindering of CuII-based deactivators from the brush propagating front. This effect is especially noticeable when viscous polymerization mixtures are generated and enables the synthesis of several hundred nanometer thick brushes within relatively short polymerization times. The faster rates of confined SI-ATRP can be additionally used to fabricate, in one pot, precisely structured brush gradients, when volume confinement is continuously varied across a single substrate by spatially tuning the vertical distance between the grafting and the confining surfaces.","211":null,"212":"Despite a huge variety of methodologies having been proposed to produce photonic structures by self-assembly, the lack of an effective fabrication approach has hindered their practical uses. These approaches are typically limited by the poor control in both optical and mechanical properties. Here we report photonic thermosetting polymeric resins obtained through brush block copolymer (BBCP) self-assembly. We demonstrate that the control of the interplay between order and disorder in the obtained photonic structure offers a powerful tool box for designing the optical appearance of the polymer resins in terms of reflected wavelength and scattering properties. The obtained materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties with hardness up to 172 MPa and Young's modulus over 2.9 GPa, indicating great potential for practical uses as photonic coatings on a variety of surfaces.","213":"Next-generation liposome systems for anticancer and therapeutic delivery require the precise insertion of stabilizing polymers and targeting ligands. Many of these functional macromolecules may be lost to micellization as a competing self-assembly landscape. Here, hybrid stealth liposomes, which utilize novel cholesteryl-functionalized block copolymers as the molecular stabilizer, are explored as a scalable platform to address this limitation. The employed block copolymers offer resistance to micellization through multiple liposome insertion moieties per molecule. A combination of thermodynamic and structural investigations for a series of hybrid stealth liposome systems suggests that a critical number of cholesteryl moieties per molecule defines whether the copolymer will or will not insert into the liposome bilayer. Colloidal stability of formed hybrid stealth liposomes further corroborates the critical copolymer architecture value.","214":"Adhesion of nanoparticles to polymer films plays a key role in various polymer technologies. Here we report experiments that reveal how silica nanoparticles adhere to a viscoelastic PMMA film above the glass transition temperature. The polymer was swollen with CO2, closely matching the conditions of nanoparticle-nucleated polymer foaming. It is found that the degree by which the particles sink into the viscoelastic substrate is strongly size dependent and can even lead to complete engulfment for particles of diameter below 12 nm. These findings are explained quantitatively by a thermodynamic analysis, combining elasticity, capillary adhesion, and line tension. We argue that line tension, here proposed for the first time in elastic media, is responsible for the nanoparticle engulfment.","215":null,"216":"We report a simple route to engineer ultrathin polymer brush surfaces with wrinkled morphologies using post-polymerization modification (PPM), where the length scale of the buckled features can be tuned from hundreds of nanometers to one micrometer using PPM reaction time. We show that partial crosslinking of the outer layer of the polymer brush under poor solvent conditions is critical to obtain wrinkled morphologies upon swelling. Characterization of the PPM kinetics and swelling behavior via ellipsometry and the through-thickness composition profile via time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) provided keys insight into parameters influencing the buckling behavior.","217":"We report experimental data on the unfolding of human and E. coli genomic DNA molecules shortly after injection into a 45 nm nanochannel. The unfolding dynamics are deterministic, consistent with previous experiments and modeling in larger channels, and do not depend on the biological origin of the DNA. The measured entropic unfolding force per friction per unit contour length agrees with that predicted by combining the Odijk excluded volume with numerical calculations of the Kirkwood diffusivity of confined DNA. The time scale emerging from our analysis has implications for genome mapping in nanochannels, especially as the technology moves towards longer DNA, by setting a lower bound for the delay time before making a measurement.","218":null,"219":"Hydrophilic and hydrophobic weak polybasic brushes immersed in aqueous solutions of mixed salt counterions are considered using a mean-field numerical self-consistent field approach. On top of the solvent quality of the polymer, the counterion-solvent interactions are accounted for by implementing Flory-Huggins interaction parameters. We show that ion specificity within the brush can bring about large changes in conformation. It is found that the collapse transition of hydrophobic, weak polyelectrolyte brushes features an intermediate two-phase state wherein a subset of chains are collapsed in a dense layer at the substrate, while the remainder of chains are well-solvated and strongly stretched away from the it. Besides pH and ionic strength, solvent quality of counterions and the composition of ions in the solvent are important control parameters for the behavior of polyelectrolyte brushes. Increasingly hydrophobic counterions penetrate deeper within the brush and stabilize the collapsed region, while hydrophilic counterions do the opposite.","220":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1021\/acs.macromol.7b01795.].","221":"Star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain termini were functionalized with alendronate to create transient networks with reversible crosslinks upon addition of calcium ions. The gelation ability of alendronate-functionalized PEG was greatly dependent on the number of arms and arm molecular weight. After mixing polymer and calcium solutions, the formed hydrogels could be cut and then brought back together without any visible interface. After 2 minutes of contact, their connection was strong enough to allow for stretching without tearing through the previous fracture surface. Oscillatory rheology showed that the hydrogels recovered between 70 and 100% of the original storage and loss modulus after rupture. Frequency sweep measurements revealed a liquid-like behavior at lower frequencies and solid-like at high frequencies. Shifting frequency curves obtained at different calcium and polymer concentrations, all data collapsed in a single common master curve. This time-concentration superposition reveals a common relaxation mechanism intrinsically connected to the calcium-bisphosphonate complexation equilibrium.","222":"Nature has long demonstrated the importance of chemical sequence to induce structure and tune physical interactions. Investigating macromolecular structure and dynamics is paramount to understand macromolecular binding and target recognition. To that end, we have synthesized and characterized flexible sulfonated oligothioetheramides (oligo-TEAs) by variable temperature pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR, double electron-electron resonance (DEER), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to capture their room temperature structure and dynamics in water. We have examined the contributions of synthetic length (2-12mer), pendant group charge, and backbone hydrophobicity. We observe significant entropic collapse, driven in part by backbone hydrophobicity. Analysis of individual monomer contributions revealed larger changes due to the backbone compared to pendant groups. We also observe screening of intramolecular electrostatic repulsions. Finally, we comment on the combination of DEER and PFG NMR measurements via Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland diffusion theory. Overall, this sensitive characterization holds promise to enable de novo development of macromolecular structure and sequence-structure-function relationships with flexible, but biologically functional macromolecules.","223":"As a model system to study the elasticity of bottle-brush polymers, we here introduce self-assembled DNA bottle brushes, consisting of a DNA main chain that can be very long and still of precisely defined length, and precisely monodisperse polypeptide side chains that are physically bound to the DNA main chains. Polypeptide side chains have a diblock architecture, where one block is a small archaeal nucleoid protein Sso7d that strongly binds to DNA. The other block is a net neutral, hydrophilic random coil polypeptide with a length of exactly 798 amino acids. Light scattering shows that for saturated brushes the grafting density is one side chain per 5.6 nm of DNA main chain. According to small-angle X-ray scattering, the brush diameter is D = 17 nm. By analyzing configurations of adsorbed DNA bottle brushes using AFM, we find that the effective persistence of the saturated DNA bottle brushes is Peff = 95 nm, but from force-extension curves of single DNA bottle brushes measured using optical tweezers we find Peff = 15 nm. The latter is equal to the value expected for DNA coated by the Sso7d binding block alone. The apparent discrepancy between the two measurements is rationalized in terms of the scale dependence of the bottle-brush elasticity using theory previously developed to analyze the scale-dependent electrostatic stiffening of DNA at low ionic strengths.","224":"A lattice model based on polymer self-consistent field theory is developed to predict the equilibrium statistics of arbitrary polymer networks. For a given network topology, our approach uses moment propagators on a lattice to self-consistently construct the ensemble of polymer conformations and cross-link spatial probability distributions. Remarkably, the calculation can be performed \"in the dark\", without any prior knowledge on preferred chain conformations or cross-link positions. Numerical results from the model for a test network exhibit close agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, including when the network is strongly sheared. Our model captures nonaffine deformation, mean-field monomer interactions, cross-link fluctuations, and finite extensibility of chains, yielding predictions that differ markedly from classical rubber elasticity theory for polymer networks. By examining polymer networks with different degrees of interconnectivity, we gain insight into cross-link entropy, an important quantity in the macroscopic behavior of gels and self-healing materials as they are deformed.","225":"From the beginning of life with the information-containing polymers until the present era of a plethora of water-based materials in health care industry and biotechnology, polyelectrolytes are ubiquitous with a broad range of structural and functional properties. The main attribute of polyelectrolyte solutions is that all molecules are strongly correlated both topologically and electrostatically in their neutralizing background of charged ions in highly polarizable solvent. These strong correlations and the necessary use of numerous variables in experiments on polyelectrolytes have presented immense challenges toward fundamental understanding of the various behaviors of charged polymeric systems. This Perspective presents the author's subjective summary of several conceptual advances and the remaining persistent challenges in the contexts of charge and size of polymers, structures in homogeneous solutions, thermodynamic instability and phase transitions, structural evolution with oppositely charged polymers, dynamics in polyelectrolyte solutions, kinetics of phase separation, mobility of charged macromolecules between compartments, and implications to biological systems.","226":null,"227":null,"228":null,"229":null,"230":null,"231":"Carboxylic acid groups impart hydrophilicity and ionizable moieties to polyamide membranes for desalination, hence influencing water and ion transport through the material. Model polyamide films were synthesized via molecular layer-by-layer deposition on planar substrates to study the formation process of these materials and overcome the chemical and topological inhomogeneity inherent to conventional interfacially polymerized polyamide membranes. The carboxylic acid content in these model films was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy by quantifying the C=O band at 1718 cm-1. The concentration of carboxylic acid groups decreased as the thickness of the membrane increased, suggestive of an increase in crosslink density as the polyamide network develops. For the thinnest molecular layer-by-layer (mLbL) samples, the carboxylic acid concentration for films on gold was 0.35 mmol g-1, whereas analogous films on silicon had an acid content of 0.56 mmol g-1, indicating a clear influence of the substrate on the initial network formation. As the thickness of the membrane increased, the influence of the substrate and initial layer growth became less significant as the carboxylic acid concentration on both substrates reached a value of 0.12 mmol g-1. We demonstrate that FTIR spectroscopy is a practical and accessible way to quantify the carboxylic acid content in these types of extremely thin polyamide membranes to help quantify network formation in these materials.","232":"Star polymers with a cross-linked nanogel core are promising carriers of cargo for therapeutic applications due to the synthetic control of amphiphilicity of arms and stability at infinite dilution. Three nanogel-core star polymers were investigated to understand how the arm-block chemical structure controls loading efficiency of a model drug, ibuprofen, and its spatial distribution. The spatial distribution profiles of hydrophobic core, hydrophilic corona, and encapsulated drug were determined by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). SANS provides the nanometer-scale sensitivity to determine how the arm-block chemistry enhances the sequestering of ibuprofen. Validated molecular dynamics simulations capture the trends in drug profile and polymer segment distribution with further details on drug orientation distribution. This work provides a basis to study structure-function relationships in macromolecular-based carriers of cargo and represents a path toward validated and predictive simulation.","233":null,"234":"Diels-Alder chemistry has been used for the thermoreversible cross-linking of furan-functionalized ethylene\/propylene (EPM) and ethylene\/vinyl acetate (EVM) rubbers. Both furan-functionalized elastomers were successfully cross-linked with bismaleimide to yield products with a similar cross-link density. NMR relaxometry and SAXS measurements both show that the apolar EPM-g-furan precursor contains phase-separated polar clusters and that cross-linking with polar bismaleimide occurs in these clusters. The heterogeneously cross-linked network of EPM-g-furan contrasts with the homogeneous network in the polar EVM-g-furan. The heterogeneous character of the cross-links in EPM-g-furan results in a relatively high Young's modulus, whereas the more uniform cross-linking in EVM-g-furan results in a higher tensile strength and elongation at break.","235":"Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.","236":"A family of amphiphilic, heterograft copolymers containing hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and supramolecular units based on Jeffamine M-1000, dodecylamine, and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) motifs, respectively, was prepared via a postfunctionalization approach. The folding of the copolymers in water into nanometer-sized particles was analyzed by a combination of dynamic and static light scattering, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and small-angle neutron scattering. The sample preparation protocol was crucial for obtaining reproducible and consistent results, showing that only full control over the structure and pathway complexity will afford the desired folded structure, a phenomenon similar to protein folding. The results revealed that relatively small changes in the polymer's graft composition strongly affected the intra- versus intermolecular assembly processes. Depending on the amount of the hydrophobic grafts based on either dodecyl or BTA groups, pronounced behavioral differences were observed for copolymers that comprise similar degrees of hydrophobic content. A high number of BTA grafts (&gt;10%) resulted in the formation of multichain aggregates comprising around six polymer chains. In contrast, for copolymers comprising up to 10% BTA grafts the folding results in nanoparticles that adopt open, sparse conformations and comprise one to two polymer chains. Interestingly, predominantly single-chain polymeric nanoparticles were formed when the copolymer comprised only Jeffamine or Jeffamine and dodecyl grafts. In addition, replacing part of the BTA grafts by hydrophobic dodecyl grafts while keeping the hydrophobic content constant promoted single-chain folding and resulted in the formation of a compact, globular nanoparticle with a more structured interior. Thus, the intra- and intermolecular self-assembly pathways can be directed by carefully tuning the polymer's hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance in combination with the number of supramolecular grafts.","237":"ABC triblock copolymers with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) midblock have attractive properties for biomedical applications because of PEG's favorable properties regarding biocompatibility and hydrophilicity. However, easy strategies to synthesize polymers containing a PEG midblock are limited. In this study, the successful synthesis of a heterofunctional PEG macroinitiator containing both an azoinitiator and an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiator is demonstrated. This novel PEG macroinitiator allows the development of elegant synthesis routes for PEG midblock-containing ABC copolymers that does not require protection of initiating sites or polymer end-group postmodification. Polymers with outer blocks composed of different monomers were synthesized to illustrate the versatility of this macroinitiator. N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was included to obtain thermosensitive polymers, 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) provided pH-sensitive properties, and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) functioned as a noncharged hydrophilic block that also allows for postmodifications reactions. This synthesis approach can further contribute to the design of high-precision polymers with tailorable block compositions and polymer topologies, which is highly attractive for applications in nanotechnology.","238":null,"239":"Biomaterials have been extensively used to leverage beneficial outcomes in various therapeutic applications, such as providing spatial and temporal control over the release of therapeutic agents in drug delivery as well as engineering functional tissues and promoting the healing process in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Contemporary studies of biomaterial design have been reviewed with focus on constructing materials with controlled structure, dynamic functionality, and biological complexity. Examples of these polymeric biomaterials enabled by advanced synthetic methodologies, dynamic chemistry\/assembly strategies, and modulated cell-material interactions have been highlighted. As the field of polymeric biomaterials continues to evolve with increased sophistication, current challenges and future directions for the design and translation of these materials are also summarized.","240":"Molecular p-doping of the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) is a widely studied model system. Underlying structure-property relationships are poorly understood because processing and doping are often carried out simultaneously. Here, we exploit doping from the vapor phase, which allows us to disentangle the influence of processing and doping. Through this approach, we are able to establish how the electrical conductivity varies with regard to a series of predefined structural parameters. We demonstrate that improving the degree of solid-state order, which we control through the choice of processing solvent and regioregularity, strongly increases the electrical conductivity. As a result, we achieve a value of up to 12.7 S cm-1 for P3HT:F4TCNQ. We determine the F4TCNQ anion concentration and find that the number of (bound + mobile) charge carriers of about 10-4 mol cm-3 is not influenced by the degree of solid-state order. Thus, the observed increase in electrical conductivity by almost 2 orders of magnitude can be attributed to an increase in charge-carrier mobility to more than 10-1 cm2 V-1 s-1. Surprisingly, in contrast to charge transport in undoped P3HT, we find that the molecular weight of the polymer does not strongly influence the electrical conductivity, which highlights the need for studies that elucidate structure-property relationships of strongly doped conjugated polymers.","241":"Benzonorbornadiene polymers synthesized by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) are typically prone to oxidation at the benzylic\/allylic position under ambient conditions. Accordingly, the use of benzonorbornadiene polymers in practical applications has remained limited. In this manuscript, we report the synthesis of poly(benzonorbornadiene) polymers using a strategic blend of benzyne chemistry and ROMP. Through a comparative study, we show that substitution at the benzylic\/allylic position prevents oxidative deformation, yet does not inhibit polymerization by common ruthenium catalysts with good control over molecular weight dispersity. We expect the benzyne\/ROMP reaction sequence will allow easy access to air-stable benzonorbornadiene polymers for various applications.","242":"Solution-cast, thin-film polymer composites find a wide range of applications, such as in the photoactive layer of organic solar cells. The performance of this layer crucially relies on its phase-separated morphology. Efficient charge-carrier extraction requires each of the components to preferentially wet one of the two electrodes. It is often presumed that the experimentally observed surface enrichment required for this is caused by specific interactions of the active ingredients with each surface. By applying a generalized diffusion model, we find the dynamics to also play an important role in determining which component accumulates at which surface. We show that for sufficiently fast evaporation the component with the smallest cooperative diffusivity accumulates at the free interface. Counterintuitively, depending on the interactions between the various components, this may be the smaller solute. Our comprehensive numerical and analytical study provides a tool to predict and control phase-separated morphologies in thin-film polymer composites.","243":"Cationic dendrimers are promising vectors for non-viral gene due to their well-defined size and chemistry. We have synthesized a series of succinylated fourth generation (G4) PAMAM dendrimers to control the DNA packaging in dendriplexes, allowing us to probe the role of charge on DNA packaging. The self-assembly of DNA induced by these zwitterionic PAMAM (zPAMAM) was investigated using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). We demonstrate that changing the degree of modification in zPAMAM-DNA significantly alters the packing density of the resulting dendriplexes. Salt sensitivities and pH dependence on the inter-DNA spacing were also examined. The swelling and stability to salt is reduced with increasing degree of PAMAM modification. Lowering the pH leads to significantly tighter hexagonal DNA packaging. In combination, these results show zPAMAM is an effective means to modulate nucleic acid packaging in a deterministic manner.","244":"Organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (O-ATRP) has emerged as a metal-free variant of historically transition-metal reliant atom transfer radical polymerization. Strongly reducing organic photoredox catalysts have proven capable of mediating O-ATRP. To date, operation of photoinduced O-ATRP has been demonstrated in batch reactions. However, continuous flow approaches can provide efficient irradiation reaction conditions and thus enable increased polymerization performance. Herein, the adaptation of O-ATRP to a continuous flow approach has been performed with multiple visible-light absorbing photoredox catalysts. Using continuous flow conditions, improved polymerization results were achieved, consisting of narrow molecular weight distributions as low as 1.05 and quantitative initiator efficiencies. This system demonstrated success with 0.01% photocatalyst loadings and a diverse methacrylate monomer scope. Additionally, successful chain-extension polymerizations using 0.01 mol % photocatalyst loadings reveal continuous flow O-ATRP to be a robust and versatile method of polymerization.","245":"We report a wavelength-selective polymerization process controlled by visible\/UV light, whereby a base is generated for anion-mediated thiol-Michael polymerization reaction upon exposure at one wavelength (400-500 nm), while radicals are subsequently generated for a second stage radical polymerization at a second, independent wavelength (365 nm). Dual wavelength, light controlled sequential polymerization not only provides a relatively soft intermediate polymer that facilitates optimum processing and modification under visible light exposure but also enables a highly cross-linked, rigid final material after the UV-induced second stage radical polymerization. A photobase generator, NPPOC-TMG, and a photo-radical initiator, Irgacure 2959, were selected as the appropriate initiator pair for sequential thiol-Michael polymerization and acrylate homopolymerization. FT-IR and rheological tests were utilized to monitor the dual cure photo-polymerization process, and mechanical performance of the polymer was characterized at each distinct stage by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). By demonstrating complete light control in another sequential polymerization system (thiol-Michael and thiol-ene hybrid polymerization), this initiator pair exhibits great potential to regulate many other coupled anion and radical hybrid polymerizations in both a sequential and controllable manner.","246":null,"247":"Photoinitiated silane-ene chemistry has the potential to pave the way toward spatially resolved organosilicon compounds, which might find application in biomedicine, microelectronics, and other advanced fields. Moreover, this approach could serve as a viable alternative to the popular photoinitiated thiol-ene chemistry, which gives access to defined and functional photopolymer networks. A difunctional bis(trimethylsilyl)silane with abstractable hydrogens (DSiH) was successfully synthesized in a simple one-pot procedure. The radical reactivity of DSiH with various homopolymerizable monomers (i.e., (meth)acrylate, vinyl ester, acrylamide) was assessed via 1H NMR spectroscopic studies. DSiH shows good reactivity with acrylates and vinyl esters. The most promising silane-acrylate system was further investigated in cross-linking formulations toward its reactivity (e.g., heat of polymerization, curing time, occurrence of gelation, double-bond conversion) and compared to state-of-the-art thiol-acrylate resins. The storage stability of prepared resin formulations is greatly improved for silane-acrylate systems vs thiol-ene resins. Double-bond conversion at the gel point (DBCgel) and overall DBC were increased, and polymerization-induced shrinkage stress has been significantly reduced with the introduction of silane-acrylate chemistry. Resulting photopolymer networks exhibit a homogeneous network architecture (indicated by a narrow glass transition) that can be tuned by varying silane concentration, and this confirms the postulated regulation of radical network formation. Similar to thiol-acrylate networks, this leads to more flexible photopolymer networks with increased elongation at break and improved impact resistance. Additionally, swelling tests indicate a high gel fraction for silane-acrylate photopolymers.","248":"A kinetic mechanism and the accompanying mathematical framework are presented for base-mediated thiol-Michael photopolymerization kinetics involving a photobase generator. Here, model kinetic predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with a representative experimental system composed of 2-(2-nitrophenyl)propyloxycarbonyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (NPPOC-TMG) as a photobase generator that is used to initiate thiol-vinyl sulfone Michael addition reactions and polymerizations. Modeling equations derived from a basic mechanistic scheme indicate overall polymerization rates that follow a pseudo-first-order kinetic process in the base and coreactant concentrations, controlled by the ratio of the propagation to chain-transfer kinetic parameters (kp\/kCT) which is dictated by the rate-limiting step and controls the time necessary to reach gelation. Gelation occurs earlier as the kp\/kCT ratio reaches a critical value, wherefrom gel times become nearly independent of kp\/kCT. The theoretical approach allowed determining the effect of induction time on the reaction kinetics due to initial acid-base neutralization for the photogenerated base caused by the presence of protic contaminants. Such inhibition kinetics may be challenging for reaction systems that require high curing rates but are relevant for chemical systems that need to remain kinetically dormant until activated although at the ultimate cost of lower polymerization rates. The pure step-growth character of this living polymerization and the exhibited kinetics provide unique potential for extended dark-cure reactions and uniform material properties. The general kinetic model is applicable to photobase initiators where photolysis follows a unimolecular cleavage process releasing a strong base catalyst without cogeneration of intermediate radical species.","249":null,"250":"Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly is a promising route to manufacture functional nanomaterials for applications from nanolithography to optical metamaterials. Self-assembled cubic morphologies cannot, however, be conveniently optically characterized in the lab due to their structural isotropy. Here, the aligned crystallization behavior of a semicrystalline-amorphous polyisoprene-b-polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (ISO) triblock terpolymer was utilized to visualize the grain structure of the cubic microphase-separated morphology. Upon quenching from a solvent swollen state, ISO first self-assembles into an alternating gyroid morphology, in the confinement of which the PEO crystallizes preferentially along the least tortuous pathways of the single gyroid morphology with grain sizes of hundreds of micrometers. Strikingly, the resulting anisotropic alignment of PEO crystallites gives rise to a unique optical birefringence of the alternating gyroid domains, which allows imaging of the self-assembled grain structure by optical microscopy alone. This study provides insight into polymer crystallization within a tortuous three-dimensional network and establishes a useful method for the optical visualization of cubic BCP morphologies that serve as functional nanomaterial templates.","251":"Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is used for the highly convenient and efficient preparation of ampholytic diblock copolymer nanoparticles directly in acidic aqueous solution. Cationic nanoparticles comprising a protonated polyamine stabilizer block and a hydrophobic polyacid core-forming block are formed at pH 2. Micelle inversion occurs at pH 10 to produce anionic nanoparticles with an ionized polyacid stabilizer block and a hydrophobic polyamine core-forming block. Macroscopic precipitation occurs at around pH 6-7, which lies close to the isoelectric point of this ampholytic diblock copolymer. Incorporation of fluorescein and rhodamine dye labels into the acid and amine blocks, respectively, leads to dual-color bifluorescent self-reporting pH-responsive nanoparticles.","252":null,"253":null,"254":"\"Grafting to\" polymeric nanostructures or surfaces is a simple and versatile approach to achieve functionalization. Herein, we describe the formation of mixed polymer-grafted nanoparticles through a supramolecular \"grafting to\" method that exploits multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between the thymine (T)-containing cores of preformed micelles and the complementary nucleobase adenine (A) of added diblock copolymers. To demonstrate this new \"grafting to\" approach, mixed-corona polymeric nanoparticles with different sizes were prepared by the addition of a series of complementary diblock copolymers containing thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) to a preformed micelle with a different coronal forming block, poly(4-acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM). PNIPAM chains were distributed throughout the corona and facilitated a fast and fully reversible size change of the resulting mixed-corona micelles upon heating. Through the introduction of an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, the reversible changes in nanoparticle size and coronal composition could be easily probed. Furthermore, preparation of mixed-corona micelles also enabled ligands, such as d-mannose, to be concealed and displayed on the micelle surface. This supramolecular \"grafting to\" approach provides a straightforward route to fabricate highly functionalized mixed polymeric nanostructures or surfaces with potential applications in targeted diagnosis or therapy and responsive surfaces.","255":"In contrast with previous accounts, it is reported that a single, strongly hydrophilic Cu complex can control an electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP) in oil-in-water miniemulsion in the presence of anionic surfactants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The anionic surfactant interacted strongly with cationic copper complexes, enabling controlled polymerization by a combination of \"interfacial\" and \"ion-pair\" catalysis, whereby ion pairs transport the catalyst to the monomer droplets. The ion-pair system was assembled in situ by mixing commercially available reagents (NaBr, SDS, and traditional hydrophilic copper complexes). Polymer purification was very facile because after reaction &gt;99% of the hydrophilic copper complexes spontaneously left the hydrophobic polymer particles.","256":null,"257":null,"258":"The motion of nanoparticles (NPs) in entangled melts of linear polymers and nonconcatenated ring polymers are compared by large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The comparison provides a paradigm for the effects of polymer architecture on the dynamical coupling between NPs and polymers in nanocomposites. Strongly suppressed motion of NPs with diameter d larger than the entanglement spacing a is observed in a melt of linear polymers before the onset of Fickian NP diffusion. This strong suppression of NP motion occurs progressively as d exceeds a and is related to the hopping diffusion of NPs in the entanglement network. In contrast to the NP motion in linear polymers, the motion of NPs with d &gt; a in ring polymers is not as strongly suppressed prior to Fickian diffusion. The diffusion coefficient D decreases with increasing d much slower in entangled rings than in entangled linear chains. NP motion in entangled nonconcatenated ring polymers is understood through a scaling analysis of the coupling between NP motion and the self-similar entangled dynamics of ring polymers.","259":null,"260":"A chemiluminescent mechanophore, bis(adamantyl-1,2-dioxetane), is used to investigate the covalent bond scission resulting from the sorption of chloroform by glassy poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) networks. Bis(adamantyl)-1,2-dioxetane units incorporated as cross-linkers underwent mechanoluminescent scission, demonstrating that solvent ingress caused covalent bond scission. At higher cross-linking densities, the light emission took the form of hundreds of discrete bursts, widely varying in intensity, with each burst composed of 107-109 photons. Camera imaging indicated a relatively slow propagation of bursts through the material and permitted analysis of the spatial correlation between the discrete bond-breaking events. The implications of these observations for the mechanism of sorption and fracture are discussed.","261":null,"262":null,"263":"We study the necking and pinch-off dynamics of liquid droplets that contain a semidilute polymer solution of polyacrylamide close to overlap concentration by combining microfluidics and single DNA observation. Polymeric droplets are stretched by passing them through the stagnation point of a T-shaped microfluidic junction. In contrast with the sudden breakup of Newtonian droplets, a stable neck is formed between the separating ends of the droplet which delays the breakup process. Initially, polymeric filaments experience exponential thinning by forming a stable neck with extensional flow within the filament. Later, thin polymeric filaments develop a structure resembling a series of beads-on-a-string along their length and finally rupture during the final stages of the thinning process. To unravel the molecular picture behind these phenomena, we integrate a T-shaped microfluidic device with advanced fluorescence microscopy to visualize stained DNA molecules at the stagnation point within the necking region. We find that the individual polymer molecules suddenly stretch from their coiled conformation at the onset of necking. The extensional flow inside the neck is strong enough to deform and stretch polymer chains; however, the distribution of polymer conformations is broad, and it remains stationary in time during necking. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of single molecules during formation of beads-on-a-string structure. We observe that polymer chains gradually recoil inside beads while polymer chains between beads remain stretched to keep the connection between beads. The present work effectively extends single molecule experiments to free surface flows, which provides a unique opportunity for molecular-scale observation within the polymeric filament during necking and rupture.","264":"RAFT-synthesized polymers are typically colored and malodorous due to the presence of the sulfur-based RAFT end-group(s). In principle, RAFT end-groups can be removed by treating molecularly dissolved copolymer chains with excess free radical initiators, amines, or oxidants. Herein we report a convenient method for the removal of RAFT end-groups from aqueous dispersions of diblock copolymer nano-objects using H2O2. This oxidant is relatively cheap, has minimal impact on the copolymer morphology, and produces benign side products that can be readily removed via dialysis. We investigate the efficiency of end-group removal for various diblock copolymer nano-objects prepared with either dithiobenzoate- or trithiocarbonate-based RAFT chain transfer agents. The advantage of using UV GPC rather than UV spectroscopy is demonstrated for assessing both the kinetics and extent of end-group removal.","265":"The bottom-up prediction of the properties of polymeric materials based on molecular dynamics simulation is a major challenge in soft matter physics. Coarse-grained (CG) models are often employed to access greater spatiotemporal scales required for many applications, but these models normally experience significantly altered thermodynamics and highly accelerated dynamics due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom upon coarse-graining. While CG models can be calibrated to meet certain properties at particular state points, there is unfortunately no temperature transferable and chemically specific coarse-graining method that allows for modeling of polymer dynamics over a wide temperature range. Here, we pragmatically address this problem by \"correcting\" for deviations in activation free energies that occur upon coarse-graining the dynamics of a model polymeric material (polystyrene). In particular, we propose a new strategy based on concepts drawn from the Adam-Gibbs (AG) theory of glass formation. Namely we renormalize the cohesive interaction strength and effective interaction length-scale parameters to modify the activation free energy. We show that this energy-renormalization method for CG modeling allows accurate prediction of atomistic dynamics over the Arrhenius regime, the non-Arrhenius regime of glass formation, and even the non-equilibrium glassy regime, thus allowing for the predictive modeling of dynamic properties of polymer over the entire range of glass formation. Our work provides a practical scheme for establishing temperature transferable coarse-grained models for predicting and designing the properties of polymeric materials.","266":"Organic photoredox catalysts have been shown to operate organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerizations (O-ATRP) using visible light as the driving force. In this work, the effect of light intensity from white LEDs was evaluated as an influential factor in control over the polymerization and the production of well-defined polymers. We posit the irradiation conditions control the concentrations of various catalyst states necessary to mediate a controlled radical polymerization. Systematic dimming of white LEDs allowed for consideration of the role of light intensity on the polymerization performance. The general effects of decreased irradiation intensity in photoinduced O-ATRP were investigated through comparing two different organic photoredox catalysts: perylene and an 3,7-di(4-biphenyl) 1-naphthalene-10-phenoxazine. Previous computational efforts have investigated catalyst photophysical and electrochemical characteristics, but the broad and complex effects of varied irradiation intensity as an experimental variable on the mechanism of O-ATRP have not been explored. This work revealed that perylene requires more stringent irradiation conditions to achieve controlled polymer molecular weight growth and produce polymers with dispersities &lt;1.50. In contrast, the 3,7-di(4-biphenyl) 1-naphthalene-10-phenoxazine is more robust, achieving linear polymer molecular weight growth under relative irradiation intensity as low as 25%, to produce polymers with dispersities &lt;1.50. This finding is significant, as the discovery of highly robust catalysts is necessary to allow for the adoption of successful O-ATRP in a wide scope of conditions, including those which necessitate low light intensity irradiation.","267":null,"268":null,"269":"An electrochemical approach was used to control atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of n-butyl acrylate (BA) in miniemulsion. Electropolymerization required a dual catalytic system, composed of an aqueous phase catalyst and an organic phase catalyst. This allowed shuttling the electrochemical stimulus from the working electrode (WE) to the continuous aqueous phase and to the dispersed monomer droplets. As aqueous phase catalysts, the hydrophilic Cu complexes with the ligands N,N-bis( 2-pyridylmethyl)-2-hydroxyethylamine (BPMEA), 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), and tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) were tested. As organic phase catalysts, the hydrophobic complexes with the ligands bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-octadecylamine (BPMODA) and bis[2-(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl)-pyridylmethyl]octadecylamine (BPMODA*) were evaluated. Highest rates and best control of BA electropolymerization were obtained with the water-soluble Cu\/BPMEA used in combination with the oil-soluble Cu\/BPMODA*. The polymerization rate could be further enhanced by changing the potential applied at the WE. Differently from traditional ATRP systems, reactivity of the dual catalytic system did not depend on the redox potential of the catalysts but instead depended on the hydrophobicity and partition coefficient of the aqueous phase catalyst.","270":"A light-mediated method for the facile removal of polymer end groups that are common to controlled radical polymerization techniques is presented. This metal-free strategy is general, being effective for chlorine, bromine, and thiocarbonylthio moieties as well as a number of different polymer families (styrenic, acrylic, and methacrylic). In addition to solution reactions, this process is readily translated to thin films, where light mediation allows the straightforward fabrication of hierarchically patterned polymer brushes.","271":"Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is used to prepare linear poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)-poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)-poly(benzyl methacrylate) [PGMA-PHPMA-PBzMA] triblock copolymer nano-objects in the form of a concentrated aqueous dispersion via a three-step synthesis based on reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. First, GMA is polymerized via RAFT solution polymerization in ethanol, then HPMA is polymerized via RAFT aqueous solution polymerization, and finally BzMA is polymerized via \"seeded\" RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization. For certain block compositions, highly anisotropic worm-like particles are obtained, which are characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The design rules for accessing higher order morphologies (i.e., worms or vesicles) are briefly explored. Surprisingly, vesicular morphologies cannot be accessed by targeting longer PBzMA blocks-instead, only spherical nanoparticles are formed. SAXS is used to rationalize these counterintuitive observations, which are best explained by considering subtle changes in the relative enthalpic incompatibilities between the three blocks during the growth of the PBzMA block. Finally, the PGMA-PHPMA-PBzMA worms are evaluated as Pickering emulsifiers for the stabilization of oil-in-water emulsions. Millimeter-sized oil droplets can be obtained using low-shear homogenization (hand-shaking) in the presence of 20 vol % n-dodecane. In contrast, control experiments performed using PGMA-PHPMA diblock copolymer worms indicate that these more delicate nanostructures do not survive even these mild conditions.","272":null,"273":null,"274":"We present a versatile synthetic route leading toward generating surface-attached polyacrylamide gels, in which the cross-link density varies continuously and gradually across the substrate in two orthogonal directions.

The presence of MABP and SSAz in the copolymer facilitates control over the cross-link density of the gel in an orthogonal manner using photoactivated and thermally activated cross-linking chemistries, respectively. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is employed to determine the degree of swelling of the gel in water and methanol as a function of position on the substrate. Network swelling varies continuously and gradually across the substrate and is high in regions of low gel fractions and low in regions of high gel fractions.","275":"A strategy to construct different stimuli responsive polymers from post polymerization modifications of a single polymer scaffold via thiol-disulfide exchange has been developed. Here, we report on a random copolymer that enables the design and syntheses of a series of dual or multi-stimuli responsive nanoassemblies using a simple post-polymerization modification step. The reactive functional group involves a side chain monopyridyl disulfide unit, which rapidly and quantitatively reacts with various thiols under mild conditions. Independent and concurrent incorporation of physical, chemical or biologically responsive properties have been demonstrated. We envision that this strategy may open up opportunities to simplify the synthesis of multi-functional polymers with broad implications in a variety of biological applications.","276":"The controlled organization of nanoparticle (NP) constituents into superstructures of well-defined shape, composition and connectivity represents a continuing challenge in the development of novel hybrid materials for many technological applications. We show that the phase separation of polymer-tethered nanoparticles immersed in a chemically different polymer matrix provides an effective and scalable method for fabricating defined submicron-sized amorphous NP domains in melt polymer thin films. We investigate this phenomenon with a view towards understanding and controlling the phase separation process through directed nanoparticle assembly. In particular, we consider isothermally annealed thin films of polystyrene-grafted gold nanoparticles (AuPS) dispersed in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Classic binary polymer blend phase separation related morphology transitions, from discrete AuPS domains to bicontinuous to inverse domain structure with increasing nanoparticle composition is observed, yet the kinetics of the AuPS\/PMMA polymer blends system exhibit unique features compared to the parent PS\/PMMA homopolymer blend. We further illustrate how to pattern-align the phase-separated AuPS nanoparticle domain shape, size and location through the imposition of a simple and novel external symmetry-breaking perturbation via soft-lithography. Specifically, submicron-sized topographically patterned elastomer confinement is introduced to direct the nanoparticles into kinetically controlled long-range ordered domains, having a dense yet well-dispersed distribution of non-crystallizing nanoparticles. The simplicity, versatility and roll-to-roll adaptability of this novel method for controlled nanoparticle assembly should make it useful in creating desirable patterned nanoparticle domains for a variety of functional materials and applications.","277":"A series of model sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles has been designed to aid the development of analytical protocols in order to determine two key parameters: the effective particle density and the steric stabilizer layer thickness. The former parameter is essential for high resolution particle size analysis based on analytical (ultra)centrifugation techniques (e.g., disk centrifuge photosedimentometry, DCP), whereas the latter parameter is of fundamental importance in determining the effectiveness of steric stabilization as a colloid stability mechanism. The diblock copolymer nanoparticles were prepared via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) using RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization: this approach affords relatively narrow particle size distributions and enables the mean particle diameter and the stabilizer layer thickness to be adjusted independently via systematic variation of the mean degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks, respectively. The hydrophobic core-forming block was poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) [PTFEMA], which was selected for its relatively high density. The hydrophilic stabilizer block was poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) [PGMA], which is a well-known non-ionic polymer that remains water-soluble over a wide range of temperatures. Four series of PGMA x -PTFEMA y nanoparticles were prepared (x = 28, 43, 63, and 98, y = 100-1400) and characterized via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It was found that the degree of polymerization of both the PGMA stabilizer and core-forming PTFEMA had a strong influence on the mean particle diameter, which ranged from 20 to 250 nm. Furthermore, SAXS was used to determine radii of gyration of 1.46 to 2.69 nm for the solvated PGMA stabilizer blocks. Thus, the mean effective density of these sterically stabilized particles was calculated and determined to lie between 1.19 g cm-3 for the smaller particles and 1.41 g cm-3 for the larger particles; these values are significantly lower than the solid-state density of PTFEMA (1.47 g cm-3). Since analytical centrifugation requires the density difference between the particles and the aqueous phase, determining the effective particle density is clearly vital for obtaining reliable particle size distributions. Furthermore, selected DCP data were recalculated by taking into account the inherent density distribution superimposed on the particle size distribution. Consequently, the true particle size distributions were found to be somewhat narrower than those calculated using an erroneous single density value, with smaller particles being particularly sensitive to this artifact.","278":"The synthesis of poly(lactic acid), PLA, is facile in the presence of the cyclic, organic amidine catalyst 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU. Since DBU's catalytic capability was first reported by Lohmeijer and colleagues in 2006 for ring-opening polymerizations (ROP), there have been numerous studies conducted by a variety of groups on the catalytic functioning of DBU in the ROPs of cyclic esters resulting in a large body of un-unified material from a mechanistic standpoint. This lack of clarity will hamper engineering polymers with desired characteristics from cyclic ester and lactone monomers. The work outlined in this paper seeks to propose a unified picture of the mechanisms in the DBU catalyzed ROP of lactide. In providing this unified picture of the ROP our work encompassed: (i) proposing a detailed reaction network scheme, (ii) conducting syntheses of lactide and DBU over a range of initial concentrations, and (iii) kinetic modeling to further support the proposed reaction network. As a result, our work has produced: (i) kinetic data, (ii) a consistent, viable reaction scheme verified through kinetic modeling, (iii) deduced and quantified the interplay between polymerization routes facilitated by the presence of DBU, thus demonstrating the need for detailed kinetic studies to deconstruct complex reaction networks, (iv) the first experimental evidence in support of the combination of ketene aminal-ended chains with alcohol-ended chains, and (v) analyzed the robustness of the catalyst to acid contamination.","279":null,"280":"The synthesis of functional polymers encoded with biomolecules has been an extensive area of research for decades.

This H-bond mediated ROP of L-lactide constitutes a rare, clear example of rate acceleration with bis(thiourea) H-bond donors versus monothioureas, and the bis(thiourea) is shown to remain highly active for ROP at fractional percent catalyst loadings. Activation at a single monomer ester by both thiourea moieties is implicated as the source of rate acceleration.","283":null,"284":"The synthesis of cyclic amphiphilic graft copolymers with a hydrophobic polycarbonate backbone and hydrophilic poly(N-acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM) side arms via a combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP), cyclization via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported. The ability of these cyclic graft copolymers to form unimolecular micelles in water is explored using a combination of light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM) analyses, where particle size was found to increase with increasing PNAM arm length. Further analysis revealed differences in the solution conformations, loading capabilities, and morphologies of the cyclic graft copolymers in comparison to equivalent linear graft copolymer unimolecular micelle analogues. Furthermore, the cyclic and linear graft copolymers were found to exhibit significantly different cloud point temperatures. This study highlights how subtle changes in polymer architecture (linear graft copolymer versus cyclic graft copolymer) can dramatically influence a polymer's nanostructure and its properties.","285":null,"286":"A poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) (PGMA) chain transfer agent is chain-extended by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) statistical copolymerization of 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) with glycidyl methacrylate (GlyMA) in concentrated aqueous solution via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). A series of five free-standing worm gels is prepared by fixing the overall degree of polymerization of the core-forming block at 144 while varying its GlyMA content from 0 to 20 mol %. 1H NMR kinetics indicated that GlyMA is consumed much faster than HPMA, producing a GlyMA-rich sequence close to the PGMA stabilizer block. Temperature-dependent oscillatory rheological studies indicate that increasing the GlyMA content leads to progressively less thermoresponsive worm gels, with no degelation on cooling being observed for worms containing 20 mol % GlyMA. The epoxy groups in the GlyMA residues can be ring-opened using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in order to prepare core cross-linked worms via hydrolysis-condensation with the siloxane groups and\/or hydroxyl groups on the HPMA residues. Perhaps surprisingly, 1H NMR analysis indicates that the epoxy-amine reaction and the intermolecular cross-linking occur on similar time scales. Cross-linking leads to stiffer worm gels that do not undergo degelation upon cooling. Dynamic light scattering studies and TEM analyses conducted on linear worms exposed to either methanol (a good solvent for both blocks) or anionic surfactant result in immediate worm dissociation. In contrast, cross-linked worms remain intact under such conditions, provided that the worm cores comprise at least 10 mol % GlyMA.","287":null,"288":null,"289":"The self-assembly of synthetic diblock copolymers has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically. In contrast, self-assembly of polypeptide diblock copolymers has so far been mostly studied experimentally. We discovered that the theory developed for synthetic diblock copolymer does not fully explain the self-assembly of elastin-like polypeptide diblock copolymers, leading us to generalize the theory to make it applicable for these polypeptides. We demonstrated that elastin-like polypeptide diblocks self-assemble into weak micelles with dense cores and almost unstretched coronas, a state not previously observed for synthetic diblock copolymers. Weak micelles form if the surface tension at the core-corona interface is low compared to that expected of a micelle with a dense core. The predictions of the theory of weak micelles for the critical micelle temperature, hydrodynamic radius, and aggregation number of elastin-like polypeptide diblocks are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured values. The unique and unprecedented control of amphiphilicity in these recombinant peptide polymers reveals a new micellar state that has not been previously observed in synthetic diblock copolymer systems.","290":null,"291":null,"292":"The synthesis of a water-soluble polyglycerol dendrimer with two orthogonal functional groups at the core is reported.

The orthogonal functionalization of the azide- and amine-cored dendrimer can be accomplished in a stepwise or a one-pot synthetic protocol. All resulting bifunctional dendrimers are fully soluble in water as the water-soluble dendritic scaffold decorated with 48 hydroxyl groups on the surface successfully solubilizes both the hydrophobic fluorophore and targeting group.","293":"Recently, polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) has become widely recognized as a robust and efficient route to produce block copolymer nanoparticles of controlled size, morphology, and surface chemistry.

Active waveguides with optical losses coefficients lowered by 10 times with respect to fibers spun in air are demonstrated through this method. These findings make the process very promising for the highly controlled production of active polymer nanostructures for photonics, electronics and sensing.","300":"The equilibrium structure of supramolecular magnetic filament brushes is analyzed at two different scales. First, we study the density and height distributions for brushes with various grafting densities and chain lengths. We use Langevin dynamics simulations with a bead-spring model that takes into account the cross-links between the surface of the ferromagnetic particles, whose magnetization is characterized by a point dipole. Magnetic filament brushes are shown to be more compact near the substrate than nonmagnetic ones, with a bimodal height distribution for large grafting densities. This latter feature makes them also different from brushes with electric dipoles. Next, in order to explain the observed behavior at the filament scale, we introduce a graph theory analysis to elucidate for the first time the structure of the brush at the scale of individual beads. It turns out that, in contrast to nonmagnetic brushes, in which the internal structure is determined by random density fluctuations, magnetic forces introduce a certain order in the system. Because of their highly directional nature, magnetic dipolar interactions prevent some of the random connections to be formed. On the other hand, they favor a higher connectivity of the chains' free and grafted ends. We show that this complex dipolar brush microstructure has a strong impact on the magnetic response of the brush, as any weak applied field has to compete with the dipole-dipole interactions within the crowded environment.","301":null,"302":null,"303":"We derive and introduce anisotropic effective pair potentials to coarse-grain solutions of semiflexible ring polymers of various lengths.

Our new coarse-graining strategy is to picture each ring as a soft, penetrable disk. We demonstrate that for the short- and intermediate-length rings the new model is quite capable of capturing the physics in a quantitative fashion, whereas for the largest rings, which resemble flexible ones, it fails at high densities. Our work opens the way for the physical justification of general, anisotropic penetrable interaction potentials.","304":"We compute the axial diffusivity of asymptotically long semiflexible polymers confined in square channels. Our calculations employ the Kirkwood approximation of the mobility tensor by combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations of the hydrodynamic tensor in channel confinement with pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) simulations of a discrete wormlike chain model. Three key results emerge from our study. First, for the classic de Gennes regime, we confirm that Brochard and de Gennes' blob theory correctly predicts the scaling of the axial diffusivity, contrary to the conclusions of previous analyses. Second, for the extended de Gennes regime, we show that a modified blob theory, which has been used to incorporate the effect of local stiffness on DNA diffusion in nanoslits, explains the deviation from the prediction of classic blob theory for diffusion in nanochannels. Third, we provide a calculation similar to the modified blob theory to explain the relative insensitivity of the diffusivity to channel size for channels between the extended de Gennes regime and the Odijk regime, which is the most relevant regime for experiments and technological applications of DNA confinement in nanochannels. Our results are not only relevant to the dynamics of confined semiflexible polymers such as DNA, but also reveal interesting analogies between confinement in channels and slits.","305":null,"306":null,"307":"To systematically investigate the relationship among surface charge, PEG chain length, and nano-bio interactions of dendron-based micelles (DMs), a series of PEGylated DMs with various end groups (-NH2, -Ac, and -COOH) and PEG chain lengths (600 and 2000 g\/mol) are prepared and tested in vitro. The DMs with longer PEG chains (DM2K) do not interact with cells despite their positively charged surfaces. In sharp contrast, the DMs with shorter PEG chains (DM600) exhibit charge-dependent cellular interactions, as observed in both in vitro and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results. Furthermore, all DMs with different charges display enhanced stability for hydrophobic dye encapsulation compared to conventional linear-block copolymer-based micelles, by allowing only a minimal leakage of the dye in vitro.

Probe particles with size larger than the mesh size ax of unentangled polymer networks or tube diameter ae of entangled polymer liquids are trapped by the network or entanglement cells. At long time scales, however, these particles can diffuse by overcoming free energy barrier between neighboring confinement cells. The terminal particle diffusion coefficient dominated by this hopping diffusion is appreciable for particles with size moderately larger than the network mesh size ax or tube diameter ae . Much larger particles in polymer solids will be permanently trapped by local network cells, whereas they can still move in polymer liquids by waiting for entanglement cells to rearrange on the relaxation time scales of these liquids. Hopping diffusion in entangled polymer liquids and networks has a weaker dependence on particle size than that in unentangled networks as entanglements can slide along chains under polymer deformation. The proposed novel hopping model enables understanding the motion of large nanoparticles in polymeric nanocomposites and the transport of nano drug carriers in complex biological gels such as mucus.","309":"Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most extensively investigated conjugated polymers and has been employed as the active material in many devices including field-effect transistors, organic photovoltaics and sensors. As a result, methods to further tune the properties of P3HT are desirable for specific applications. Herein, we report a facile postpolymerization modification strategy to functionalize the 4-position of commercially available P3HT in two simple steps-bromination of the 4-position of P3HT (Br-P3HT) followed by lithium-bromine exchange and quenching with an electrophile. We achieved near quantitative lithium-bromine exchange with Br-P3HT, which requires over 100 thienyl lithiates to be present on a single polymer chain. The lithiated-P3HT is readily combined with functional electrophiles, resulting in P3HT derivatives with ketones, secondary alcohols, trimethylsilyl (TMS) group, fluorine, or an azide at the 4-position. We demonstrated that the azide-modified P3HT could undergo Cu-catalyzed or Cu-free click chemistry, significantly expanding the complexity of the structures that can be appended to P3HT using this method.","310":null,"311":"The synthetic design and thermomechanical characterization of shape memory polymers (SMPs) built from a new polyurethane chemistry that enables facile, bulk and tunable cross-linking of low-molecular weight thermoplastics by electron beam irradiation is reported in this study. SMPs exhibit stimuli-induced geometry changes and are being proposed for applications in numerous fields. We have previously reported a polyurethane SMP system that exhibits the complex processing capabilities of thermoplastic polymers and the mechanical robustness and tunability of thermomechanical properties that are often characteristic of thermoset materials. These previously reported polyurethanes suffer practically because the thermoplastic molecular weights needed to achieve target cross-link densities severely limit high-throughput thermoplastic processing and because thermally unstable radiation-sensitizing additives must be used to achieve high enough cross-link densities to enable desired tunable shape memory behavior. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate cross-link density in low-molecular weight aliphatic thermoplastic polyurethane SMPs (Mw as low as ~1.5 kDa) without radiation-sensitizing additives by incorporating specific structural motifs into the thermoplastic polymer side chains that we hypothesized would significantly enhance susceptibility to e-beam cross-linking. A custom diol monomer was first synthesized and then implemented in the synthesis of neat thermoplastic polyurethane SMPs that were irradiated at doses ranging from 1 to 500 kGy. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated rubbery moduli to be tailorable between 0.1 and 55 MPa, and both DMA and sol\/gel analysis results provided fundamental insight into our hypothesized mechanism of electron beam cross-linking, which enables controllable bulk cross-linking to be achieved in highly processable, low-molecular weight thermoplastic shape memory polymers without sensitizing additives.","312":"Multivalent polymers are macromolecules containing multiple chemical moieties designed to bind to complementary moieties on a target; for example, a protein with multiple ligands that have affinity for receptors on a cell surface. Though the individual ligand-receptor bonds are often weak, the combinatorial entropy associated with the different possible ligand-receptor pairs leads to a binding transition that can be very sharp with respect to control parameters, such as temperature or surface receptor concentration. We use mean-field self-consistent field theory to study the binding selectivity of multivalent polymers to receptor-coated surfaces. Polymers that have their ligands clustered into a contiguous domain, either located at the chain end or chain midsection, exhibit cooperative surface adsorption and superselectivity when the polymer concentration is low. On the other hand, when the ligands are uniformly spaced along the chain backbone, selectivity is substantially reduced due to the lack of binding cooperativity and due to crowding of the surface by the inert polymer segments in the chain backbone.","313":"Thiourea (TU)\/amine base cocatalysts are commonly employed for well-controlled, highly active \"living\" organocatalytic ring-opening polymerizations (ROPs) of cyclic esters and carbonates. In this work, several of the most active cocatalyst pairs are shown by 1H NMR binding studies to be highly associated in solution, dominating all other known noncovalent catalyst\/reagent interactions during ROP. One strongly binding catalyst pair behaves kinetically as a unimolecular catalyst species. The high selectivity and activity exhibited by these ROP organocatalysts are attributed to the strong binding between the two cocatalysts, and the predictive utility of these binding parameters is applied for the discovery of a new, highly active cocatalyst pair.","314":"The photophysical and mechanical properties of novel poly(carbonate-amide)s derived from two biorenewable resources, ferulic acid (FA) and l-tyrosine ethyl ester, were evaluated in detail. From these two bio-based precursors, a series of four monomers were generated (having amide and\/or carbonate coupling units with remaining functionalities to allow for carbonate formation) and transformed to a series of four poly(carbonate-amide)s. The simplest monomer, which was biphenolic and was obtained in a single amidation synthetic step, displayed bright, visible fluorescence that was twice brighter than FA. Multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy of the polymers in solution highlighted the strong influence that regioselectivity and the degree of polymerization have on their photophysical properties. The regiochemistry of the system had little effect on the wettability, surface free energy, and Young's modulus (ca. 2.5 GPa) in the solid state. Confocal imaging of solvent-cast films of each polymer revealed microscopically flat surfaces with fluorescent emission deep into the visible region. Fortuitously, one of the two regiorandom polymers (obtainable from the biphenolic monomer in only an overall two synthetic steps from FA and l-tyrosine ethyl ester) displayed the most promising fluorescent properties both in the solid state and in solution, allowing for the possibility of translating this system as a self-reporting or imaging agent in future applications. To further evaluate the potential of this polymer as a biodegradable material, hydrolytic degradation studies at different pH values and temperatures were investigated. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of the degradation products of this polymer were compared with its biphenolic monomer and FA.","315":"We use molecular dynamics simulations of the Kremer-Grest (KG) bead-spring model of polymer chains of length between 10 and 500, and a closely related analogue that allows for chain crossing, to clearly delineate the effects of entanglements on the length-scale-dependent chain relaxation in polymer melts. We analyze the resulting trajectories using the Rouse modes of the chains and find that entanglements strongly affect these modes. The relaxation rates of the chains show two limiting effective monomeric frictions, with the local modes experiencing much lower effective friction than the longer modes. The monomeric relaxation rates of longer modes vary approximately inversely with chain length due to kinetic confinement effects. The time-dependent relaxation of Rouse modes has a stretched exponential character with a minimum of stretching exponent in the vicinity of the entanglement chain length. None of these trends are found in models that allow for chain crossing. These facts, in combination, argue for the confined motion of chains for time scales between the entanglement time and their ultimate free diffusion.","316":"Strained bicyclic carbomethoxy olefins were utilized as substrates in alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization and found to provide low-dispersity polymers with novel backbones. The polymerization of methyl bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxylate with cyclohexene in the presence of the fast-initiating Grubbs catalyst (H2IMes)(3-Br-Pyr)2Cl2Ru=CHPh leads to a completely linear as well as alternating copolymer, as demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy, isotopic labeling, and gel permeation chromatography. In contrast, intramolecular chain-transfer reactions were observed with [5.2.0] and [3.2.0] bicyclic carbomethoxy olefins, although to a lesser extent than with the previously reported monocyclic cyclobutenecarboxylic ester monomers [Song A.; Parker K. A.; Sampson N. S.J. Am. Chem. Soc.2009, 131, 3444]. Inclusion of cyclohexyl rings fused to the copolymer backbone minimizes intramolecular chain-transfer reactions and provides a framework for creating alternating functionality in a one-step polymerization.","317":"Photochemical processes enable spatial and temporal control of reactions, which can be implemented as an accurate external control approach in both polymer synthesis and materials applications. \"Click\" reactions have also been employed as efficient tools in the same field. Herein, we combined photochemical processes and thiol-Michael \"click\" reactions to achieve a \"photo-click\" reaction that can be used in surface patterning and controlled polymer network formation, owing to the ease of spatial and temporal control through use of photolabile amines as appropriate catalysts.","318":null,"319":"We develop a scaling model relating the friction forces between two polyelectrolyte brushes sliding over each other to the separation between grafted surfaces, number of monomers and charges per chain, grafting density of chains, and solvent quality. We demonstrate that the lateral force between brushes increases upon compression, but to a lesser extent than the normal force. The shear stress at larger separations is due to solvent slip layer friction. The thickness of this slip layer sharply decreases at distances on the order of undeformed brush thickness. The corresponding effective viscosity of the layer sharply increases from the solvent viscosity to a much higher value, but this increase is smaller than the jump of the normal force resulting in the drop of the friction coefficient. At stronger compression we predict the second sharp increase of the shear stress corresponding to interpenetration of the chains from the opposite brushes. In this regime the velocity-dependent friction coefficient between two partially interpenetrating polyelectrolyte brushes does not depend on the distance between substrates because both normal and shear forces are reciprocally proportional to the plate separation. Although lateral forces between polyelectrolyte brushes are larger than between bare surfaces, the enhancement of normal forces between opposing polyelectrolyte brushes with respect to normal forces between bare charged surfaces is much stronger resulting in lower friction coefficient. The model quantitatively demonstrates how polyelectrolyte brushes provide more effective lubrication than bare charged surfaces or neutral brushes.","320":"Polymer fibers are currently exploited in tremendously important technologies. Their innovative properties are mainly determined by the behavior of the polymer macromolecules under the elongation induced by external mechanical or electrostatic forces, characterizing the fiber drawing process. Although enhanced physical properties were observed in polymer fibers produced under strong stretching conditions, studies of the process-induced nanoscale organization of the polymer molecules are not available, and most of fiber properties are still obtained on an empirical basis. Here we reveal the orientational properties of semiflexible polymers in electrospun nanofibers, which allow the polarization properties of active fibers to be finely controlled. Modeling and simulations of the conformational evolution of the polymer chains during electrostatic elongation of semidilute solutions demonstrate that the molecules stretch almost fully within less than 1 mm from jet start, increasing polymer axial orientation at the jet center. The nanoscale mapping of the local dichroism of individual fibers by polarized near-field optical microscopy unveils for the first time the presence of an internal spatial variation of the molecular order, namely the presence of a core with axially aligned molecules and a sheath with almost radially oriented molecules. These results allow important and specific fiber properties to be manipulated and tailored, as here demonstrated for the polarization of emitted light.","321":null,"322":"Engineering artificial protein hydrogels for medical applications requires precise control over their mechanical properties, including stiffness, toughness, extensibility and stability in the physiological environment. Here we demonstrate topological entanglement as an effective strategy to robustly increase the mechanical tunability of a transient hydrogel network based on coiled-coil interactions. Chain extension and entanglement are achieved by coupling the cysteine residues near the N- and C- termini, and the resulting chain distribution is found to agree with the Jacobson-Stockmayer theory. By exploiting the reversible nature of the disulfide bonds, the entanglement effect can be switched on and off by redox stimuli. With the presence of entanglements, hydrogels exhibit a 7.2-fold enhanced creep resistance and a suppressed erosion rate by a factor of 5.8, making the gels more mechanically stable in a physiologically relevant open system. While hardly affecting material stiffness (only resulting in a 1.5-fold increase in the plateau modulus), the entanglements remarkably lead to hydrogels with a toughness of 65,000 J m-3 and extensibility to approximately 3,000% engineering strain, which enables the preparation of tough yet soft tissue simulants. This improvement in mechanical properties resembles that from double-network hydrogels, but is achieved with the use of a single associating network and topological entanglement. Therefore, redox-triggered chain entanglement offers an effective approach for constructing mechanically enhanced and responsive injectable hydrogels.","323":null,"324":"Nitrile groups in the polymer of intrinsic microporosity PIM-1 were reduced to primary amines using borane complexes. In adsorption experiments, the novel amine-PIM-1 showed higher CO2 uptake and higher CO2\/N2 sorption selectivity than the parent polymer, with very evident dual-mode sorption behavior. In gas permeation with six light gases, the individual contributions of solubility and diffusion to the overall permeability was determined via time-lag analysis. The high CO2 affinity drastically restricts diffusion at low pressures and lowers CO2 permeability compared to the parent PIM-1. Furthermore, the size-sieving properties of the polymer are increased, which can be attributed to a higher stiffness of the system arising from hydrogen bonding of the amine groups. Thus, for the H2\/CO2 gas pair, whereas PIM-1 favors CO2, amine-PIM-1 shows permselectivity toward H2, breaking the Robeson 2008 upper bound.","325":null,"326":"By application of optical coherence tomography (OCT), an interferometric noncontact imaging technique, the crystallization of a supercooled poly(propylene) melt in a slit die is monitored. Both the quiescent and the sheared melt are investigated, with a focus on experiments where solidification and flow occur simultaneously. OCT is found to be an excellent tool for that purpose since the resultant structures are strongly scattering, which is a prerequisite for application of that method. The resulting images enable for the first time to directly monitor structure development throughout the whole experiment, including final cooling to room temperature. By rendering the setup polarization-sensitive, information on the birefringence of the pertinent structures is obtained.","327":"The analysis of very large DNA molecules intrinsically supports long-range, phased sequence information, but requires new approaches for their effective presentation as part of any genome analysis platform. Using a multi-pronged approach that marshaled molecular confinement, ionic environment, and DNA elastic properties-but tressed by molecular simulations-we have developed an efficient and scalable approach for presentation of large DNA molecules within nanoscale slits. Our approach relies on the formation of DNA dumbbells, where large segments of the molecules remain outside the nanoslits used to confine them. The low ionic environment, synergizing other features of our approach, enables DNA molecules to adopt a fully stretched conformation, comparable to the contour length, thereby facilitating analysis by optical microscopy. Accordingly, a molecular model is proposed to describe the conformation and dynamics of the DNA molecules within the nanoslits; a Langevin description of the polymer dynamics is adopted in which hydrodynamic effects are included through a Green's function formalism. Our simulations reveal that a delicate balance between electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions is responsible for the observed molecular conformations. We demonstrate and further confirm that the \"Odijk regime\" does indeed start when the confinement dimensions size are of the same order of magnitude as the persistence length of the molecule. We also summarize current theories concerning dumbbell dynamics.","328":"We report here a synthetic route to oxime, azide and nitrone-bearing copolymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization of 4-vinylbenzaldehyde and 1-(chloromethyl)-4-vinylbenzene with styrene. The azide and nitrone moieties could be employed in strain-promoted 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with various functionalized dibenzocyclooctynols (DIBO) for metal-free post-functionalization of the polymers. In situ oxidation of the oximes with hypervalent iodine gave nitrile oxides, which could also be employed as 1,3-dipoles for facile cycloadditions with DIBO derivatives. Kinetic measurements demonstrated that the pendant nitrile oxides reacted approximately twenty times faster compared to similar cycloadditions with azides. A block copolymer, containing azide and oxime groups in segregated blocks, served as a scaffold for attachment of hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties by sequential strain-promoted alkyne-azide and strain-promoted alkyne-nitrile oxide cycloadditions. This sequential bi-functionalization approach made it possible to prepare in a controlled manner multi-functional polymers that could self-assemble into well-defined nanostructures.","329":"The relationship between polymeric hydrogel microstructure and macroscopic properties is of specific interest to the materials science and polymer science communities for the rational design of materials for targeted applications. Specifically, research has focused on elucidating the role of network formation and connectivity on mechanical integrity and degradation behavior. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of chain and step polymerized, photodegradable hydrogels. Increased ductility, tensile toughness, shear strain to yield were observed in step polymerized hydrogels, as compared to the chain polymerized gels, indicating that increased homogeneity and network cooperativity in the gel backbone improves mechanical integrity. Furthermore, the ability to degrade the hydrogels in a controlled fashion with light was exploited to explore how hydrogel microstructure influences photodegradation and erosion. Here, the decreased network connectivity at the junction points in the step polymerized gels resulted in more rapid erosion. Finally, a relationship between the reverse gelation threshold and erosion rate was developed for the general class of photodegradable hydrogels. In all, these studies further elucidate the relationship between hydrogel formation and microarchitecture with macroscale behavior to facilitate the future design of polymer networks, degradable hydrogels, as well as photoresponsive materials as cell culture templates, drug delivery vehicles, responsive coatings, and anisotropic materials.","330":"Derivatives of thymine have been extensively used to promote supramolecular materials assembly. Such derivatives can be synthetically challenging to access and may be susceptible to degradation. The current article uses a conformer-independent acceptor-donor-acceptor array (ureidopyrimidine) which forms moderate affinity interactions with diamidopyridine derivatives to effect supramolecular blend formation between polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) polymers obtained by RAFT which have been functionalized with the hydrogen bonding motifs.","331":"We investigate, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the role of ring architecture and topology on the relative sizes of two interacting polymers as a function of the distance between their centers-of-mass. As a general rule, polymers swell as they approach each other, irrespectively of their topologies. For each mutual separation, two identical linear polymers adopt the same average size. However, unknotted rings at close separations adopt different sizes, with the small one being \"nested\" within the large one over long time intervals, exchanging their roles in the course of the simulation. For two rings of different architectures and identical polymerization degree, the knotted one is always smaller, penetrating the unknotted one. On the basis of these observations, we propose a phenomenological theory for the effective interactions between rings, modeling them as unequal-sized penetrable spheres. This simple approximation provides a good description of the simulation results. In particular, it rationalizes the non-Gaussian shape and the short-distance plateau observed in the effective potential between unknotted ring polymers and pairs of unequal-sized unknotted\/knotted ones. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of the architecture on both the effective interactions and the molecular size for strongly interpenetrating polymers.","332":null,"333":"Self-healing polymeric materials are systems that after damage can revert to their original state with full or partial recovery of mechanical strength. Using scaling theory we study a simple model of autonomic self-healing of unentangled polymer networks. In this model one of the two end monomers of each polymer chain is fixed in space mimicking dangling chains attachment to a polymer network, while the sticky monomer at the other end of each chain can form pairwise reversible bond with the sticky end of another chain. We study the reaction kinetics of reversible bonds in this simple model and analyze the different stages in the self-repair process. The formation of bridges and the recovery of the material strength across the fractured interface during the healing period occur appreciably faster after shorter waiting time, during which the fractured surfaces are kept apart. We observe the slowest formation of bridges for self-adhesion after bringing into contact two bare surfaces with equilibrium (very low) density of open stickers in comparison with self-healing. The primary role of anomalous diffusion in material self-repair for short waiting times is established, while at long waiting times the recovery of bonds across fractured interface is due to hopping diffusion of stickers between different bonded partners. Acceleration in bridge formation for self-healing compared to self-adhesion is due to excess non-equilibrium concentration of open stickers. Full recovery of reversible bonds across fractured interface (formation of bridges) occurs after appreciably longer time than the equilibration time of the concentration of reversible bonds in the bulk.","334":"Since the 1960's, stimuli-responsive polymers have been utilized as functional soft materials for biological applications such as the triggered-release delivery of biologically active cargos. Over the same period, liposomes have been explored as an alternative drug delivery system with potentials to decrease the toxic side effects often associated with conventional small-molecule drugs. However, the lack of drug-release triggers and the instability of bare liposomes often limit their practical applications, causing short circulation time and low therapeutic efficacy. This perspective article highlights recent work in integrating these two materials together to achieve a targetable, triggerable nanoscale platform that fulfills all the characteristics of a near-ideal drug delivery system. Through a drop-in, post-synthesis modification strategy, a network of stimuli-responsive polymers can be integrated onto the surface of liposomes to form polymer-caged nanobins, a multifunctional nanoscale delivery platform that allows for multi-drug loading, targeted delivery, triggered drug-release, and theranostic capabilities.","335":null,"336":"The photophysical properties of insoluble porous pyrene networks, which are central to their function, differ strongly from those of analogous soluble linear and branched polymers and dendrimers. This can be rationalized by the presence of strained closed rings in the networks. A combined experimental and computational approach was used to obtain atomic scale insight into the structure of amorphous conjugated microporous polymers. The optical absorption and fluorescence spectra of a series of pyrene-based materials were compared with theoretical time-dependent density functional theory predictions for model clusters. Comparison of computation and experiment sheds light on the probable structural chromophores in the various materials.","337":null,"338":"We report the aqueous solution self-assembly of a series of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymers end-functionalized with a hydrophobic sulfur-carbon-sulfur (SCS) pincer ligand. Although the hydrophobic ligand accounted for &lt;5 wt% of the overall homopolymer mass, the polymers self-assembled into well-defined spherical micelles in aqueous solution, and these micelles are potential precursors to solution-assembled nanoreactors for small molecule catalysis applications. The micelle structural details were investigated using light scattering, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Radial density profiles extracted from the cryo-TEM micrographs suggested that the PNIPAM chains formed a diffuse corona with a radially decreasing corona density profile and provided valuable a priori information about the micelle structure for SANS data modeling. SANS analysis indicated a similar profile in which the corona surrounded a small hydrophobic core containing the pincer ligand. The similarity between the SANS and cryo-TEM results demonstrated that detailed information about the micelle density profile can be obtained directly from cryo-TEM and highlighted the complementary use of scattering and cryo-TEM in the structural characterization of solution-assemblies, such as the SCS pincer-functionalized homopolymers described here.","339":"The direct synthesis of an acid-labile polyphosphoramidate by organobase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization and an overall two-step preparation of polyphosphodiester ionomers (PPEI) by acid-assisted cleavage of the phosphoramidate bonds along the backbone of the polyphosphoramidate were developed in this study. The ultrafast organobase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic phospholane methoxyethyl amidate monomer initiated by benzyl alcohol allowed for the preparation of well-defined polyphosphoramidates (PPA) with predictable molecular weights, narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI&lt;1.10), and well-defined chain ends. Cleavage of the acid-labile phosphoramidate bonds on the polyphosphoramidate repeat units was evaluated under acidic conditions over a pH range of 1-5, and the complete hydrolysis produced polyphosphodiesters. The thermal properties of the resulting polyphosphoester ionomer acid and polyphosphoester ionomer sodium salt exhibited significant thermal stability. The parent PPA and both forms of the PPEIs showed low cytotoxicities toward HeLa cells and RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. The synthetic methodology developed here has enriched the family of water-soluble polymers prepared by rapid and convenient organobase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerizations and straightforward chemical medication reactions, which are designed to be hydrolytically degradable and have promise for numerous biomedical and other applications.","340":"Light-emitting electrospun nanofibers of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-( N,N '-diphenyl)- N,N '-di(p-butyl-oxy-phenyl)-1,4-diaminobenzene)] (PFO-PBAB) are produced by electrospinning under different experimental conditions. In particular, uniform fibers with average diameter of 180 nm are obtained by adding an organic salt to the electrospinning solution. The spectroscopic investigation assesses that the presence of the organic salt does not alter the optical properties of the active material, therefore providing an alternative approach for the fabrication of highly emissive conjugated polymer nanofibers. The produced nanofibers display self-waveguiding of light, and polarized photoluminescence, which is especially promising for embedding active electrospun fibers in sensing and nanophotonic devices.","341":"The outstanding elastomeric properties of natural resilin, an insect protein, have motivated the engineering of resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) as a potential material for cardiovascular tissue engineering. The RLPs, which incorporate biofunctional domains for cell-matrix interactions, are cross-linked into RLP-PEG hybrid hydrogels via a Michael-type addition of cysteine residues on the RLP with vinyl sulfones of an end-functionalized multi-arm star PEG. Oscillatory rheology indicated the useful mechanical properties of these materials. Assessments of cell viability via con-focal microscopy clearly show the successful encapsulation of human aortic adventitial fibroblasts in the three-dimensional matrices and the adoption of a spread morphology following 7 days of culture.","342":"A tri(ethylene glycol)-containing lactide analogue was synthesized via thiol-ene chemistry between a bi-functional triethylene glycol and allyl lactide. Subsequent tin-octoate-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization yielded well-defined poly(lactide)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers with molecular weights of 6000 g\/mol and polydispersity indices of 1.6. The tri(ethylene glycol) chains along the copolymers contain azide termini that are capable of 'click'-type postpolymerization functionalization. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated via successful Staudinger ligation to install the Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptide.","343":"Three bis-benzoxazine monomers based on the aniline derivatives of bisphenol A (BA-a), bisphenol F (BF-a), and 3,3'-thiodiphenol (BT-a) are examined using a variety of spectroscopic, chromatographic, and thermomechanical techniques. The effect on the polymerization of the monomers is compared using two common compounds, 3,3'-thiodiphenol (TDP) and 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid (TDA), at a variety of loadings. It is found that the diacid has a greater effect on reducing the onset of polymerization and increasing cross-link density and Tg for a given benzoxazine. However, the addition of &gt;5 wt % of the diacid had a detrimental effect on the cross-link density, Tg, and thermal stability of the polymer. The kinetics of the polymerization of BA-a were found to be well described using an autocatalytic model for which values of n = 1.64 and m = 2.31 were obtained for the early and later stages of reaction (activation energy = 81 kJ\/mol). Following recrystallization the same monomer yielded values n = 1.89, m = 0.89, and Ea = 94 kJ\/mol (confirming the influence of higher oligomers on reactivity). The choice of additive (in particular the magnitude of its pKa) appears to influence the nature of the network formation from a linear toward a more clusterlike growth mechanism.","344":null,"345":"Polymeric synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs) have recently demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity as natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from innate immunity. This is surprising, since polymeric SMAMPs are heterogeneous in terms of chemical structure (random sequence) and conformation (random coil), in contrast to defined amino acid sequence and intrinsic secondary structure. To understand this better, we compare AMPs with a 'minimal' mimic, a well characterized family of polydisperse cationic methacrylate-based random copolymer SMAMPs. Specifically, we focus on a comparison between the quantifiable membrane curvature generating capacity, charge density, and hydrophobicity of the polymeric SMAMPs and AMPs. Synchrotron small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) results indicate that typical AMPs and these methacrylate SMAMPs generate similar amounts of membrane negative Gaussian curvature (NGC), which is topologically necessary for a variety of membrane-destabilizing processes. Moreover, the curvature generating ability of SMAMPs is more tolerant of changes in the lipid composition than that of natural AMPs with similar chemical groups, consistent with the lower specificity of SMAMPs. We find that, although the amount of NGC generated by these SMAMPs and AMPs are similar, the SMAMPs require significantly higher levels of hydrophobicity and cationic charge to achieve the same level of membrane deformation. We propose an explanation for these differences, which has implications for new synthetic strategies aimed at improved mimesis of AMPs.","346":null,"347":"Quantitative analysis of single molecule experiments show that adding either of two natural polyamines, spermine or spermidine, produced more compact plectonemes in DNA in physiological concentrations of monovalent salt. They also promoted plectoneme formation at lower values of torsion in measurements of extension versus twist. Quantifying changes in the plectonemic DNA using some results from simple rod models suggested that exposure to polyamines reduced the radii and increased the densities of plectonemes. Thus, polyamines may limit the twist density by favoring writhe which maintains the B-form. Although polymerases may significantly stretch the double helix, denature DNA, and produce twist instead of writhe, natural polyamines stabilize base-pairing, limit twist to maintain the B-form, and promote supercoiling, which is conducive to replication and transcription and essential for DNA packaging.","348":"We developed a new synthetic approach to high molecular weight poly(p-phenylenebutadiynylene) s (PPBs) by increasing backbone flexibility.

All clinically-approved T1 contrast agents are small molecule chelates of gadolinium [Gd(III)] that affect bound water proton relaxivity. Both the small size and monomeric nature of these agents ultimately limits the image resolution enhancement that can be achieved for both contrast enhancement and pharmacokinetic\/biodistribution reasons. The multimeric nature of macromolecules, such as polymers, dendrimers, and noncovalent complexes of small molecule agents with proteins, have been shown to significantly increase the image contrast and resolution due to their large size and ability to incorporate multiple Gd(III) chlelation sites. Also, macromolecular agents are advantageous as they have the ability to be designed to be nontoxic, hydrophilic, easily purified, aggregation-resistant, and have controllable three-dimensional macromolecular structure housing the multiple lanthanide chelation sites. For these reasons, large molecule diagnostics have the ability to significantly increase the relaxivity of water protons within the targeted tissues and thus the image resolution for many diagnostic applications. The FDA approval of a contrast agent that consists of a reversible, non-covalent coupling of a small Gd(III) chelate with serum albumin for blood pool imaging (marketed under the trade names of Vasovist and Ablivar) proved to be one of the first diagnostic agent to capitalize on these benefits from macromolecular association in humans. However, much research and development is necessary to optimize the safety of these unique agents for in vivo use and potential clinical development. To this end, recent work in the field of polymer, dendrimer, and noncovalent complex-based imaging agents are reviewed herein and the future outlook of this field is discussed.","350":"Transient network hydrogels cross-linked through histidine-divalent cation coordination bonds were studied by conventional rheologic methods using histidine-modified star poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymers. These materials were inspired by the mussel, which is thought to use histidine-metal coordination bonds to impart self-healing properties in the mussel byssal thread. Hydrogel viscoelastic mechanical properties were studied as a function of metal, pH, concentration, and ionic strength. The equilibrium metal-binding constants were determined by dilute solution potentiometric titration of monofunctional histidine-modified methoxy-PEG and were found to be consistent with binding constants of small molecule analogs previously studied. pH-dependent speciation curves were then calculated using the equilibrium constants determined by potentiometric titration, providing insight into the pH dependence of histidine-metal ion coordination and guiding the design of metal coordination hydrogels. Gel relaxation dynamics were found to be uncorrelated with the equilibrium constants measured, but were correlated to the expected coordination bond dissociation rate constants.","351":null,"352":"Typical bimolecular photoinitiators (PIs) for radical polymerization of acrylates show only poor photoreactivity because of the undesired effect of back electron transfer.

The core of the photoinduced reactivity was established by laser flash photolysis, photo-CIDNP, and EPR experiments at short time scales. According to these results, the primarily formed iminyl radicals are not particularly active. The polymerization is predominantly initiated by C-centered radicals.

This method was successfully applied to atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), with weight-average molecular weights given by this method closely correlated to those obtained from GPC measurement.","355":"Oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) exhibit several desirable properties including biocompatibility and resistance to fouling by protein adsorption. Still needed are surgical glues and orthopedic cements, among several other materials, that display similar traits. However the very lack of interactions with other molecules that prevents toxicity and fouling also makes adhesion elusive. In work described here the cross-linking chemistry of marine mussel adhesive is combined with OEG to make a family of terpolymers. The effect of polymer composition upon bulk adhesion was examined. High strength bonding was found with a subset of the polymers containing appreciable OEG content. These structure-property insights may help the design of new materials for which the properties of OEG and high strength adhesion are both being sought.","356":"A new methacrylate monomer with a reactive ketone side-chain, 2-(4-oxo-pentanoate) ethyl methacrylate (PAEMA), was synthesized and subsequently polymerized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to give a polymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution (PDI = 1.25). The polymer was chain extended with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether acrylate) (PEGMA) to yield a block copolymer. Aminooxy containing small molecules and oligoethylene glycol were conjugated to the ketone functionality of the side chain in high yields. Cytotoxicity of the oxime-linked tetra(ethylene glycol) polymer to mouse fibroblast cells was investigated; the polymer was found to be non-cytotoxic up to 1 mg\/mL. The ease with which this polymer is functionalized, suggests that it may be useful in forming tailored polymeric medicines.","357":null,"358":"Advances in clinical diagnostic instrumentation have enabled some imaging modalities to be run concurrently.

The paramagnetic and near Infra-red (NIR) properties of Dy(III) and Yb(III) are interesting candidates for the development of bimodal NIR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. To enhance their intrinsic bimodal properties, these lanthanides were chelated using the hexadentate-all-oxygen-donor-ligand TREN-bis-(1-Me)-3,2-HOPO-TAM-NX (NX, where X = 1, 2 or 3) and subsequently conjugated to the esteramide dendrimer (EA), to improve bioavailability, solubility, and relaxivity. Of these new complexes synthesized and evaluated, DyN1-EA had the largest ionic T(1) relaxivity, 7.60 mM(-1) s(-1), while YbN3-EA had the largest ionic T(2) relaxivity with a NIR quantum yield of 0.17 % when evaluated in mouse serum. This is the first Yb(III) bimodal NIR\/T(2) MRI contrast agent of its kind evaluated.","359":"We investigate polymer partitioning from polymer mixtures into nanometer size cavities by formulating an equation of state for a binary polymer mixture assuming that only one (smaller) of the two polymer components can penetrate the cavity. Deriving the partitioning equilibrium equations and solving them numerically allows us to introduce the concept of \"polymers-pushing-polymers\" for the action of non-penetrating polymers on the partitioning of the penetrating polymers. Polymer partitioning into a pore even within a very simple model of a binary polymer mixture is shown to depend in a complicated way on the composition of the polymer mixture and\/or the pore-penetration penalty. This can lead to enhanced as well as diminished partitioning, due to two separate energy scales that we analyse in detail.","360":"Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer are branched polymers with low degrees of heterogeneity. Current synthesis methods, however, result in substantial batch variability. We present our optimized procedure for post-synthesis (and post-market) purification of a generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer by membrane dialysis and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations using a representative lot of biomedical grade dendrimer. This method successfully removes trailing generation defect structures, thereby reducing the heterogeneity of the material (PDI reduced from 1.04 to 1.02). Optimized analytical techniques to characterize the unpurified and purified dendrimer are also detailed. The efficiency of the purification method is successfully monitored by these analytics and dendrimer parameters that are critical for subsequent modification reactions and biological evaluation (M(n), M(w), PDI, average number of end groups) obtained. To provide better definition of the variability that should be expected between lots of synthesized material, HPLC traces for three additional commercial lots of dendrimer are also presented.","361":null,"362":null,"363":"This study examined the compression of solvated polymer brushes on bioengineered surfaces during the initial stages of Staphylococcus Aureus (S. aureus) adhesion from gentle flow. A series of PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)] brushes, 7 to 17 nm in height and completely non-adhesive to proteins and bacteria, were modified by the incorporation of sparse isolated ~10 nm cationic polymer \"patches\" at their bases. These nanoscale regions, which lacked PEG tethers, were electrostatically attractive towards negative bacteria or proteins. S. aureus drawn to the interface by multiple adhesive patches compressed the PEG brush in the remaining contact region. The observed onset of bacterial or fibrinogen capture with increases in patch content was compared with calculations. Balancing the attraction energy (proportional to the number of patches engaging a bacterium during capture) against steric forces (calculated using the Alexander-DeGennes treatment) provided perspective on the brush compression. The results were consistent with a bacteria-surface gap on the order of the Debye length in these studies. In this limit of strong brush compression, structural features (height, persistence length) of the brush were unimportant so that osmotic pressure dominated the steric repulsion. Thus, the dominant factor for bacterial repulsion was the mass of PEG in the brush. This result explains empirical reports in the literature that identify the total PEG content of a brush as a criteria for prevention of bioadhesion, independent of tether length and spacing, within a reasonable range for those parameters. Bacterial capture was also compared to that of protein capture. It was found, surprisingly, that the patchy brushes were more protein-than bacteria-resistant. S. aureus adhesion driven by patches within otherwise protein-resistant PEG brushes was explained by the bacteria's greater tendency to compress large areas of brush to interact with many patches. By contrast, proteins are thought to penetrate the brush at a few sites of PEO-free patches. The finding provides a mechanism for the literature reports that in-vitro protein resistance is a poor predictor of in-vitro implant failure related to cell-surface adhesion.","364":null,"365":null,"366":null,"367":"Two distinct preparations of amphiphilic diblock copolymer vesicles (i.e. polymersomes), composed of (poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(butadiene)) (PEO-PBD), with molecular weights of 1.8 kDa and 10.4 kDa, offering different hydrophobic membrane thicknesses, were used to encapsulate the oxygen (O(2)) storage and transport protein hemoglobin (Hb) for possible application as a red blood cell (RBC) substitute. Key biophysical properties as well as the kinetics of polymersome encapsulated Hb (PEH) interaction with physiologically important gaseous ligands (O(2), carbon monoxide and nitric oxide) were measured as a function of the hydrophobic membrane thickness of the PEH particle. Taken together, the results of this work show that PEHs exhibit biophysical properties and retarded ligand binding\/release kinetics (compared to cell-free Hb), which are similar to the behavior of RBCs. Therefore, PEHs have the potential to serve as safe and efficacious RBC substitutes for use in transfusion medicine.","368":"An efficient method to synthesize telechelic, bio-reactive polymers is described. Homotelechelic polymers were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in one step by employing bifunctional chain transfer agents (CTAs). A bis-carboxylic acid CTA was coupled to N-BOC-aminooxy ethanol or pyridyl disulfide ethanol resulting in a bis-N-BOC-aminooxy CTA and a bis-pyridyl disulfide CTA, respectively. RAFT polymerization of polyethylene glycol (PEG) acrylate in the presence of both CTAs resulted in a series of polymers over a range of molecular weights (~8.4 kDa to 35.2 kDa; polydispersity indices, PDIs of 1.11 to 1.44) with retention of end-groups post-polymerization. The polymers were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Conjugations of small molecules and peptides resulted in homotelechelic polymer conjugates.","369":"The effect of hydration on the molecular structure of amorphous poly (D, L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) with 50:50 L-to-D ratio has been studied by combining experiments with molecular simulations. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed significant changes upon hydration in the structure functions of the copolymer. Large changes in the structure functions at ~ 10 days of incubation coincided with the large increase in the water uptake from ~1 to ~40% and the formation of voids in the film. Computer modeling based on the recently developed TIGER2\/TIGER3 mixed sampling scheme was used to interpret these changes by efficiently equilibrating both dry and hydrated models of PDLLA. Realistic models of bulk amorphous PDLLA structure were generated as demonstrated by close agreement between the calculated and the experimental structure functions. These molecular simulations were used to identify the interactions between water and the polymer at the atomic level including the change of positional order between atoms in the polymer due to hydration. Changes in the partial O-O structure functions, about 95% of which were due to water-polymer interactions, were apparent in the radial distribution functions. These changes, and somewhat smaller changes in the C-C and C-O partial structure functions, clearly demonstrated the ability of the model to capture the hydrogen bonding interactions between water and the polymer, with the probability of water forming hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group being about four times higher than with its ether oxygen.","370":"The use of ionic interactions to direct both protein templating and block copolymer self-assembly into nanopatterned films with only aqueous processing conditions is demonstrated using block copolymers containing both thermally responsive and pH responsive blocks. Controlled reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization is employed to synthesize poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-b-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate) (PNIPAM-b-PDMAEA) diblock copolymers. The pH-dependent ionic complexation between the fluorescent protein, mCherry, and the ionic PDMAEA block is established using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. DLS shows that the size of the resulting coacervate micelles depends strongly on pH, while UV-Vis spectroscopy shows a correlation between the protein's absorption maximum and the ionic microenvironment. Zeta potential measurements clearly indicate the ionic nature of the complex-forming interactions. Spin casting was used to prepare nanostructured films from the protein-block copolymer coacervates. After film formation, the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the PNIPAM blocks allows the nanomaterial to be effectively immobilized in aqueous environments at physiological temperatures, enabling potential use as a controlled protein release material or polymer matrix for protein immobilization. At pH 9.2 and 7.8, the release rates are at least 10 times faster than that at pH 6.4 due to weaker interaction between protein and PNIPAM-b-PDMAEA (PND) diblock copolymer. Due to the ionic environment in which protein is confined, the majority of the protein (80%) remains active, independent of pH, even after having been dehydrated in vacuum and confined in the films.","371":"Although numerous small molecules have been synthesized with sulfenamide bonds (R(2)N-SR), this is the first report of the synthesis of polysulfenamides. These polymers are readily synthesized at room temperature using secondary diamines and dithiosuccinimides. The dithiosuccinimides were readily synthesized in one step by the reaction of dithiols such as HS(CH(2))(6)SH with N-chlorosuccinimide. The resulting dithiosuccinimides were either recrystallized or readily purified by chromatography on silica gel and required no special handling. The conversions of polymerization ranged from 95 to 98%, and the molecular weights of the polymer reached as high as 6,300 g mol(-1). The sulfenamide bond was very stable in organic solvents, and no degradation was observed under atmospheric conditions in C(6)D(6) for 30 days. In contrast, the sulfenamide bond readily decomposed in less than 12 h in D(2)O. Polysulfenamides were fabricated into micron-sized particles loaded with dye and endocytosed into JAWSII immature dendritic and HEK293 cells. Polysulfenamides represent a new class of polymers that are readily synthesized, stable in aprotic solvents, and readily degrade in water.","372":null,"373":null,"374":"A polystyrenylphosphonium polymer was synthesized and complexed with various carboxylic acid derivatives to form new solid-state polyelectrolyte-surfactant assemblies. The properties of these ionic materials were highly dependent on the nature of the anion and included a brittle material, a rubbery ball that bounces, or a sticky fiber. The values for the equilibrium modulus, storage modulus, and loss modulus were dependent on the composition of the carboxylic acid and the number of electrostatic interactions. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies on the supramolecular assemblies confirmed a bilayer structure for two of the assemblies.","375":"This paper reports the first examples of poly(diaminosulfide)s that were synthesized by the reaction of a sulfur transfer reagent and several secondary diamines. The diaminosulfide group has the general structure of R(2)N-S-NR(2) and, although it has been used in the synthesis of small molecules, it has never been utilized in the synthesis of macromolecules until this report. A series of poly(diaminosulfide)s were synthesized at elevated temperatures, and the molecular weights of the polymers were as high as 12,400 g mol(-1) with conversions for the polymerization reaction up to 99%. The rate constants for the transamination reactions that lead to the polymers were measured in several solvents to provide an understanding the reaction conditions necessary to polymerize the monomers. The degradation of diaminosulfides were studied in D(2)O, C(6)D(6), CD(3)OD, CDCl(3), and DMSO-d(6)\/D(2)O to demonstrate that they were very stable in organic solvents but degraded within hours under aqueous conditions. These results clearly demonstrated that diaminosulfides are very stable in organic solvents under ambient conditions. Poly(diaminosulfide)s have sufficient stabilities to be useful for many applications. The ability of these polymers to function as drug delivery vehicles were studied by the fabrication of nanoparticles of a water-insoluble poly(diaminosulfide) with a dye. The microparticles were readily absorbed into human embryonic 293 cells and possessed no measureable toxicity towards these same cells.","376":"Conventional synthesis of polymers by ATRP is relatively low throughput, involving iterative optimization of conditions in an inert atmosphere. Automated, high-throughput controlled radical polymerization was developed to accelerate catalyst optimization and production of disulfide-functionalized polymers without the need of an inert gas. Using ARGET ATRP, polymerization conditions were rapidly identified for eight different monomers, including the first ARGET ATRP of 2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate and di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. In addition, butyl acrylate, oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate 300 and 475, 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, styrene, and methyl methacrylate were polymerized using bis(2-hydroxyethyl) disulfide bis(2-bromo-2-methylpropionate) as the initiator, tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine as the ligand, and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate as the reducing agent. The catalyst and reducing agent concentration was optimized specifically for each monomer, and then a library of polymers was synthesized systematically using the optimized conditions. The disulfide-functionalized chains could be cleaved to two thiol-terminated chains upon exposure to dithiothreitol, which may have utility for the synthesis of polymer bioconjugates. Finally, we demonstrated that these new conditions translated perfectly to conventional batch polymerization. We believe the methods developed here may prove generally useful to accelerate the systematic optimization of a variety of chemical reactions and polymerizations.","377":null,"378":"Thermoresponsive hydrogel nanoparticles composed of poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) (pNIPMAm) and the disulfide-based cross-linker N,N'-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC) have been prepared using a redox-initiated, aqueous precipitation polymerization approach, leading to improved stability of the disulfide bond compared to traditional thermally-initiated methods. The resultant particles demonstrate complete erosion in response to reducing conditions or thiol competition. This stands in contrast to the behavior of thermally-initiated particles, which retain a cross-linked network following disulfide cleavage due to uncontrolled chain-branching and self-cross-linking side reactions. The synthetic strategy has also been combined with the non-degradable cross-linker N,N-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) to generate \"co-cross-linked\" pNIPMAm-BAC-BIS microgels. These particles are redox-responsive, swell upon BAC cross-link scission and present reactive thiols. This pendant thiol functionality was demonstrated to be useful for conjugation of thiol-reactive probes and in reversible network formation by assembling particles cross-linked by disulfide linkages.","379":"Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is a biodegradable copolymer that is also acceptable for use in a variety of biomedical applications. Typically, a random PLGA polymer is synthesized in a bulk batch polymerization using a tin-based catalyst at high temperatures. This methodology results in relatively broad polydispersity indexes (PDIs) due to transesterification, and the polymer product is often discolored. We report here the use of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU), a known, effective, and convenient organocatalyst for the ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters, to synthesize random copolymers of lactide and glycolide. The polymerization kinetics of the homo- and copolymerizations of lactide and glycolide were explored via NMR spectroscopy. A novel strategy that employs a controlled addition of the more reactive glycolide monomer to a solution containing the lactide monomer, the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macroinitiator, and DBU catalyst was developed. Using this tactic (semi-batch polymerization), we synthesized a series of block copolymers that exhibited excellent correlation of the expected and observed molecular weights and possessed narrow PDIs. We also measured the thermal properties of these block copolymers and observed trends based on the composition of the block copolymer. We also explored the need for experimental rigor in several aspects of the preparations and have identified a set of convenient reaction conditions that provide polymer products that retain the aforementioned desirable characteristics. These polymerizations proceed rapidly at room temperature and without the need for tin-based catalysts to provide PEG-b-PLGAs suitable for use in biomedical investigations.","380":"Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side-chain functionalized lactide analogues have been synthesized in four steps from commercially available L-lactide. The key step in the synthesis is the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between PEG-azides and a highly strained spirolactide-heptene monomer, which proceeds in high conversions. The PEG-grafted lactides analogues were polymerized via ring-opening polymerization using triazacyclodecene as organocatalyst to give well-defined tri- and hepta-(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide)s (PLA) with molecular weights above 10 kDa and polydispersity indices between 1.6 and 2.1. PEG-poly(lactide) (PLA) with PEG chain M(n) 2000 was also prepared but GPC analysis showed a bimodal profile indicating the presence of starting macromonomer. Cell adhesion assays were performed using MC3T3 E-1 osteoblast-like cells demonstrating that PEG-containing PLA reduces cell adhesion significantly when compared to unfunctionalized PLA.","381":null,"382":null,"383":null,"384":"Near infrared (NIR) irradiation can penetrate up to 10 cm deep into tissues and be remotely applied with high spatial and temporal precision. Despite its potential for various medical and biological applications, there is a dearth of biomaterials that are responsive at this wavelength region. Herein we report a polymeric material that is able to disassemble in response to biologically benign levels of NIR irradiation upon two-photon absorption. The design relies on the photolysis of the multiple pendant 4-bromo7-hydroxycoumarin protecting groups to trigger a cascade of cyclization and rearrangement reactions leading to the degradation of the polymer backbone. The new material undergoes a 50% Mw loss after 25 sec of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation by single photon absorption and 21 min of NIR irradiation via two-photon absorption. Most importantly, even NIR irradiation at biologically benign laser power is sufficient to cause significant polymer disassembly. Furthermore, this material is well tolerated by cells both before and after degradation. These results demonstrate for the first time a NIR sensitive material with potential to be used for in vivo applications.","385":null,"386":null,"387":"We have prepared a range of well-defined copolymers of styrene and L-proline functionalized styrene (5-11 kDa) using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization techniques and explored their use in supported catalysis. Upon deprotection of the L-proline functionalities, the solution self-assembly of these copolymers was investigated in mixed solvent systems. The resulting assemblies were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (on graphene oxide substrates, along with cryo-TEM and tomography), and scanning electron microscopy. The application of these functional assemblies as supported catalysts for the aldol condensation reaction was explored using cyclohexanone and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. The rate and selectivity of solution catalysis in our self-assembled system were comparable to those of L-proline, and a significant advantage of our system was that the polymer support could be utilized at lower catalyst loadings with comparable activity and also could be recycled a number of times while maintaining activity and selectivity.","388":null,"389":null,"390":"The thiol-ene reaction serves as a more oxygen tolerant alternative to traditional (meth)acrylate chemistry for forming photopolymerized networks with numerous desirable attributes including energy absorption, optical clarity, and reduced shrinkage stress. However, when utilizing commercially available monomers, many thiol-ene networks also exhibit decreases in properties such as glass transition temperature (T(g)) and crosslink density. In this study, hybrid organic\/inorganic thiol-ene resins incorporating silsesquioxane (SSQ) species into the photopolymerized networks were investigated as a route to improve these properties. Thiol- and ene-functionalized SSQs (SH-SSQ and allyl-SSQ, respectively) were synthesized via alkoxysilane hydrolysis\/condensation chemistry, using a photopolymerizable monomer [either pentaerythriol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) or 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (TATATO)] as the reaction solvent. The resulting SSQ-containing solutions (SSQ-PETMP and SSQ-TATATO) were characterized, and their incorporation into photopolymerized networks was evaluated.","391":"We use discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) computer simulation to investigate the encapsulation efficiency and micellar structure of solute-carrying block copolymer nanoparticles as a function of packing fraction, polymer volume fraction, solute mole fraction, and the interaction parameters between the hydrophobic head blocks and between the head and the solute. The encapsulation efficiency increases with increasing polymer volume fraction and packing fraction but decreases with increasing head-head interaction strength. The latter is due to an increased tendency for the solute to remain on the micelle surface. We compared two different nanoparticle assembly methods, one in which the solute and copolymer co-associate and the other in which the copolymer micelle is formed before the introduction of solute. The assembly method does not affect the encapsulation efficiency but does affect the solute uptake kinetics. Both head-solute interaction strength and head-head interaction strength affect the density profile of the micelles; increases in the former cause the solute to distribute more evenly throughout the micelle, while increases in the latter cause the solute to concentrate further from the center of the micelle. We explain our results in the context of a model of drug insertion into micelles formulated by Kumar and Prud'homme; as conditions become more conducive to micelle formation, a stronger energy barrier to solute insertion forms which in turn decreases the encapsulation efficiency of the system.","392":"We have used a realistic model for double stranded DNA and Monte Carlo simulations to compute the extension (mean span) of a DNA molecule confined in a nanochannel over the full range of confinement in a high ionic strength buffer. The simulation data for square nanochannels resolve the apparent contradiction between prior simulation studies and the predictions from Flory theory, demonstrating the existence of two transition regimes between weak confinement (the de Gennes regime) and strong confinement (the Odijk regime). The simulation data for rectangular nanochannels support the use of the geometric mean for mapping data obtained in rectangular channels onto models developed for cylinders. The comparison of our results with experimental data illuminates the challenges in applying models for confined, neutral polymers to polyelectrolytes. Using a Flory-type approach, we also provide an improved scaling result for the relaxation time in the transition regime close to that found in experiments.","393":null,"394":null,"395":"Four systems 1a - d were prepared to investigate the optical properties of copolymers comprised of polyfluorene doped with BODIPY-based fluors.

Optimization of the polymerization process as a function of the mol % of BODIPY, indicated that the brightest polymers were formed when approximately 4 fluorene units were co-polymerized with every BODIPY precursor.

A self-consistent field approximation for strongly stretched polymer chains is used in combination with a lattice model of the interaction energy in helix-coil mixtures. Crowding-induced chain stretching stabilizes helix formation at moderate tethering densities while high tethering density causes sufficiently strong stretching to unravel segments of the helix, resulting in distinct layers of monomer density and helical content. Compared to a random-coil brush at low-to-moderate tethering density, a helicogenic brush is less resistant to compression in the direction perpendicular to stretching due to easy alignment of helices and fewer unfavorable interactions between helical segments. At higher tethering density, the abovementioned stretch-induced decrease in helical content resists further compression. The proposed model is useful for understanding an emerging class of biomaterials that utilize helix-forming polymer brushes to induce shape changes or to stabilize biofunctional helical peptide sequences.","398":"A new interfacial nano and molecular imprinting approach is developed to prepare spherical molecularly imprinted polymers with well-controlled hierarchical structures. This method is based on Pickering emulsion polymerization using template-modified colloidal particles. The interfacial imprinting is carried out in particle-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions, where the molecular template is presented on the surface of silica nanoparticles during the polymerization of the monomer phase. After polymerization, the template-modified silica nanoparticles are removed from the new spherical particles to leave tiny indentations decorated with molecularly imprinted sites. The imprinted microspheres prepared using the new interfacial nano and molecular imprinting have very interesting features: a well-controlled hierarchical structure composed of large pores decorated with easily accessible molecular binding sites, group selectivity toward a series of chemicals having a common structural moiety (epitopes), and a hydrophilic surface that enables the MIPs to be used under aqueous conditions.","399":"A new empirical sampling method termed \"temperature intervals with global exchange of replicas and reduced radii\" (TIGER3) is presented and demonstrated to efficiently equilibrate entangled long-chain molecular systems such as amorphous polymers. The TIGER3 algorithm is a replica exchange method in which simulations are run in parallel over a range of temperature levels at and above a designated baseline temperature. The replicas sampled at temperature levels above the baseline are run through a series of cycles with each cycle containing four stages - heating, sampling, quenching, and temperature level reassignment. The method allows chain segments to pass through one another at elevated temperature levels during the sampling stage by reducing the van der Waals radii of the atoms, thus eliminating chain entanglement problems. Atomic radii are then returned to their regular values and re-equilibrated at elevated temperature prior to quenching to the baseline temperature. Following quenching, replicas are compared using a Metropolis Monte Carlo exchange process for the construction of an approximate Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of states and then reassigned to the elevated temperature levels for additional sampling. Further system equilibration is performed by periodic implementation of the previously developed TIGER2 algorithm between cycles of TIGER3, which applies thermal cycling without radii reduction. When coupled with a coarse-grained modeling approach, the combined TIGER2\/TIGER3 algorithm yields fast equilibration of bulk-phase models of amorphous polymer, even for polymers with complex, highly branched structures. The developed method was tested by modeling the polyethylene melt. The calculated properties of chain conformation and chain segment packing agreed well with published data. The method was also applied to generate equilibrated structural models of three increasingly complex amorphous polymer systems: poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate), and DTB-succinate copolymer. Calculated glass transition temperature (T(g)) and structural parameter profile (S(q)) for each resulting polymer model were found to be in close agreement with experimental T(g) values and structural measurements obtained by x-ray diffraction, thus validating that the developed methods provide realistic models of amorphous polymer structure.","400":null,"401":null,"402":"We synthesized and characterized a new family of di-block copolymers based on the amino acid sequences of Nephila clavipes major ampulate dragline spider silk, having the form HABn and HBAn (n=1-3), comprising an alanine-rich hydrophobic block, A, a glycine-rich hydrophilic block, B, and a histidine tag, H. The reversing heat capacities, Cp(T), for temperatures below and above the glass transition, Tg, were measured by temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry. For the solid state, we then calculated the heat capacities of our novel block copolymers based on the vibrational motions of the constituent poly(amino acid)s, whose heat capacities are known or can be estimated from the ATHAS Data Bank. For the liquid state, the heat capacity was estimated by using the rotational and translational motions in the polymer chain. Excellent agreement was found between the measured and calculated values of the heat capacity, showing that this method can serve as a standard by which to assess the Cp for other biologically inspired block copolymers. The fraction of beta sheet crystallinity of spider silk block copolymers was also determined by using the predicted Cp, and was verified by wide angle X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The glass transition temperatures of spider silk block copolymer were fitted by Kwei's equation and the results indicate that attractive interaction exists between the A-block and B-block.","403":"Rylene dyes functionalized with varying numbers of phenyl trifluorovinylether (TFVE) moieties were subjected to a thermal emulsion polymerization to yield shape-persistent, water-soluble chromophore nanoparticles. Perylene and terrylene diimide derivatives containing either two or four phenyl TFVE functional groups were synthesized and subjected to thermal emulsion polymerization in tetraglyme. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that particles with sizes ranging from 70 - 100 nm were obtained in tetraglyme, depending on monomer concentration. The photophysical properties of individual monomers were preserved in the nanoemulsions and emission colors could be tuned between yellow, orange, red, and deep red.

Our tapered diblock copolymers with overall poly(styrene) volume fractions of 0.65 (normal-tapered) and 0.67 (inverse-tapered), and tapered regions comprising 30 volume percent of the total polymer, were shown to self-assemble into the double-gyroid network morphology through a combination of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The block copolymers were synthesized by anionic polymerization, where the tapered region between the pure poly(isoprene) and poly(styrene) blocks was generated using a semi-batch feed with programmed syringe pumps. The overall composition of these tapered copolymers lies within the expected network-forming region for conventional poly(isoprene-b-styrene) [P(I-S)] diblock copolymers. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) clearly demonstrated that the order-disorder transition temperatures (T(ODT)'s) of the network-forming tapered block copolymers were depressed when compared to the T(ODT) of their non-tapered counterpart, with the P(I-SI-S) showing the greater drop in T(ODT). These results indicate that it is possible to manipulate the copolymer composition profile between blocks in a diblock copolymer, allowing significant control over the T(ODT), while maintaining the ability to form complex network structures.","405":"Despite the increasing demands for functional degradable biomaterials, strategies for generating materials with modular compositions and well-defined functionalities from common building blocks are still lacking.

Homopolymerization of AzDXO and copolymerization of AzDXO with lactide resulted in polycarbonate and poly(ester-carbonates) with well-defined composition and narrow polydispersity. Further side-chain functionalizations of these polymers were accomplished under facile conditions via copper-catalyzed or copper-free strain-promoted azido-alkyne cyclcoaddition.

Anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CT) were attached to a norbornene-alkyne-PEG MM via a photocleavable linker. ROMP of either or both drug-loaded MMs generated brush homo- and co-polymers with low polydispersities and defined molecular weights. Release of free DOX and CT from these materials was initiated by exposure to 365 nm light. All of the CT and DOX polymers were at least 10-fold more toxic to human cancer cells after photoinitiated drug release while a copolymer carrying both CT and DOX displayed 30-fold increased toxicity upon irradiation.

Such techniques and materials include polyelectrolyte gels that swell and deswell with changes in pH, thermosensitive gels that contract at physiological temperatures, and peptide cross-linked hydrogels that degrade upon peptidolysis by cell-secreted enzymes. Herein we report a unique approach to photochemically deform and degrade disulfide cross-linked hydrogels, mitigating the challenges of light attenuation and low quantum yield, permitting the degradation of hydrogels up to 2 mm thick within 120 s at low light intensities (10 mW\/cm(2) at 365 nm). Hydrogels were formed by the oxidation of thiol-functionalized 4-armed poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecules. These disulfide cross-linked hydrogels were then swollen in a lithium acylphosphinate photoinitiator solution. Upon exposure to light, photogenerated radicals initiate multiple fragmentation and disulfide exchange reactions, permitting and promoting photodeformation, photowelding, and photodegradation. This novel, but simple, approach to generate photoadaptable hydrogels portends the study of cellular response to mechanically and topographically dynamic substrates as well as novel encapsulations by the welding of solid substrates. The principles and techniques described herein hold implications for more than hydrogel materials but also for photoadaptable polymers more generally.","414":"We present two novel allyl-based terminating agents that can be used to end-functionalize living polymer chains obtained by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) using Grubbs' third generation catalyst. Both terminating agents can be easily synthesized and yield ROMP polymers with stable, storable activated ester groups at the chain-end. These end-functionalized ROMP polymers are attractive building blocks for advanced polymeric materials, especially in the biomedical field. Dye-labeling and surface-coupling of antimicrobially active polymers using these end-groups were demonstrated.","415":null,"416":null,"417":"Hollow polymer nanocapsules are produced by the polymerization within hydrophobic interior of lipid bilayers that act as temporary self-assembled scaffolds. Pore-forming templates are co-dissolved with monomers in the bilayers to create pores with controlled size and chemical environment.

The effectiveness of mass transport during the partial acetylation reaction was found to have a major effect on subsequent distributions of dendrimer-ligand components and to be a major source of inconsistency between batches. This study has broad implications for a wide range of nanoparticle-ligand systems because it demonstrates that conjugates with the same mean ligand-particle ratios can have completely different distribution profiles.","420":"Due to the biocompatibility of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), PEG-based hydrogels have attracted considerable interest for use as biomaterials in tissue engineering applications. In this work, we show that PEG-based hydrogels prepared by photopolymerization of PEG macromonomers functionalized with either acrylate or acrylamide end-groups generate networks with crosslink junctions of high functionality. Although the crosslink functionality is not well controlled, the resultant networks are sufficiently well ordered to generate a distinct correlation peak in the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) related to the distance between crosslink junctions within the PEG network. The crosslink spacing is a useful probe of the PEG chain conformation within the hydrogel and ranges from approximately 6 to 16 nm, dependent upon both the volume fraction of polymer and the molecular weight of the PEG macromonomers. The presence of a peak in the scattering of photopolymerized PEG networks is also correlated with an enhanced compressive modulus in comparison to PEG networks reported in the literature with much lower crosslink functionality that exhibit no scattering peak. This comparison demonstrates that the method used to link together PEG macromonomers has a critical impact on both the nanoscale structure and the macroscopic properties of the resultant hydrogel network.","421":"Two RAFT-capable PEO macro-CTAs, 2 and 5 kDa, were prepared and used for the polymerization of isoprene which yielded well-defined block copolymers of varied lengths and compositions. GPC analysis of the PEO macro-CTAs and block copolymers showed remaining unreacted PEO macro-CTA. Mathematical deconvolution of the GPC chromatograms allowed for the estimation of the blocking efficiency, about 50% for the 5 kDa PEO macro-CTA and 64% for the 2 kDa CTA. Self assembly of the block copolymers in both water and decane was investigated and the resulting regular and inverse assemblies, respectively, were analyzed with DLS, AFM, and TEM to ascertain their dimensions and properties. Assembly of PEO-b-PIp block copolymers in aqueous solution resulted in well-defined micelles of varying sizes while the assembly in hydrophobic, organic solvent resulted in the formation of different morphologies including large aggregates and well-defined cylindrical and spherical structures.","422":"We experimentally investigate the influence of slit-like confinement on the coil-stretch transition of single DNA molecules in a homogeneous planar elongational electric field. We observe a more gradual coil-stretch transition characterized by two distinct critical strain rates for DNA in confinement, different from the unconfined case where a single critical strain rate exists. We postulate that the change in the coil-stretch transition is due to a modified spring law in confinement. We develop a dumbbell model to extract an effective spring law by following the relaxation of an initially stretched DNA. We then use this spring law and kinetic theory modeling to predict the extension and fluctuations of DNA in planar elongational fields. The model predicts that a two-stage coil-stretch transition emerges in confinement, in accord with experimental observations.","423":"Injectable hydrogels show substantial promise for use in minimally invasive tissue engineering and drug delivery procedures.1,2 A new injectable hydrogel material, developed from recombinant telechelic proteins expressed in E. coli, demonstrates shear thinning by three orders of magnitude at large strains. Large amplitude oscillatory shear illustrates that shear thinning is due to yielding within the bulk of the gel, and the rheological response and flow profiles are consistent with a shear-banding mechanism for yielding. The sharp yielding transition and large magnitude of the apparent shear thinning allow gels to be injected through narrow gauge needles with only gentle hand pressure. After injection the gels reset to full elastic strength in seconds due to rapid reformation of the physical network junctions, allowing self-supporting structures to be formed. The shear thinning and recovery behavior is largely independent of the midblock length, enabling genetic engineering to be used to control the equilibrium modulus of the gel without loss of the characteristic yielding behavior. The shear-banding mechanism localizes deformation during flow into narrow regions of the gels, allowing more than 95% of seeded cells to survive the injection process.","424":"","425":"Complexes of sodium poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (NaPSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) were formed on mixing equimolar solutions in high salt concentration. Under ultracentrifugal fields, the complex precipitates were transformed into compact polyelectrolyte complexes (CoPECs), which showed extensive porosity. The mechanical properties of CoPECS make them attractive for bioimplants and tissue engineering applications. Free NaPSS chains in the closed pores of CoPECs create excess osmotic pressure, which controls the pore size and contributes to the mechanical resistance of the material. The mechanical properties of CoPECs, modulated by the ionic strength of the doping medium, were studied by uniaxial tensile testing and the stress-strain data were fit to a three-element Maxwell model which revealed at least two regimes of stress relaxation.","426":null,"427":"Considering the adsorption of counterions on an isolated polyelectrolyte (PE) chain and using a variational theory, phase boundaries and the critical point for the first-order coil-globule transition are calculated. The transition is induced cooperatively by counterion adsorption and chain conformations and the calculation is done self-consistently. The size of the PE chain is a single-valued function of charge. The discontinuous transition of the coil size is accompanied by a discontinuous transition of the charge. Phase boundaries for the coil-globule transitions induced by both Coulomb strength (inverse temperature or dielectric constant) and ionic strength (salt) show that the PE chain collapses at a substantially lower Coulomb strength in the presence of salt. In the expanded state of the coil, an analytical formula is derived for the effective charge of the chain for conditions where the coupling between chain conformations and counterion adsorption is weak. In general, the dielectric heterogeneity of the solvent close to the polymer backbone is found to play a crucial role in the charge regularization and the chain collapse.","428":null,"429":"Two different methodologies for the synthesis of monotelechelic poly(oxa)norbornenes prepared by living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) are presented. The first method, termed direct end-capping, is carried out by adding an internal cis-olefin terminating agent (TA) to the reaction mixture immediately after the completion of the living ROMP reaction. The second method relies on cross metathesis (CM) between a methylene-terminated poly(oxa)norbornene and a cis-olefin TA mediated by the ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst (H(2)IMes)(Cl)(2)Ru(CH-o-OiPrC(6)H(4)) (H(2)IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazolidine-2-ylidene). TAs containing various functional groups, including alcohols, acetates, bromides, a-bromoesters, thioacetates, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters and Boc-amines, as well as fluorescein and biotin groups, were synthesized and tested. The direct end-capping method typically resulted in &gt;90% end-functionalization efficiency, while the CM method was nearly as effective for TAs without polar functional groups or significant steric bulk. End-functionalization efficiency values were determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy.","430":null,"431":null,"432":"Two strategies are applied to mimic the ampholytic nature of the surfaces of half-generation PAMAM dendrimers and yet retain the very narrow dispersity inherent of triazine dendrimers. Both strategies start with a monodisperse, single-chemical entity, generation two triazine dendrimer presenting twelve surface amines that is available at the kilogram scale. The first method relies on reaction with methyl bromoacetate. Complete conversion of the surface primary amines to tertiary amines occurs to provide 24 surface esters. Extended reaction times lead to quarternization of the amines while other unidentified species are also present. The resulting polyester can be quantitatively hydrolyzed using 4M aqueous HCl to yield a dendrimer with 12 tertiary amines and 24 carboxylic acids about a hydrophobic triazine core. The second method utilizes Michael additions of methyl acrylate to yield 24 surface esters. This reaction proceeds more rapidly and more cleanly than the former strategy. Hydrolysis of this material proceeds quantitatively using 4M aqueous HCl to yield desired dendrimer. In both cases, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provides compelling evidence of reaction progress. Electrophoretic analysis confirms the ampholytic nature of these materials with the former targets having a pI value in the 1.8 &lt; pI &lt; 3.4 range, and the latter having a pI value in the 4.7 &lt; pI &lt; 5.9. These ranges bookend the pH range within which PAMAM dendrimers become zwitterionic, 3.4 &lt; pI &lt; 4.7. The strategy of using monodisperse amine-terminated dendrimer constructs as core offers significant advantage over PAMAM homopolymers including dispersity, ease of characterization and batch-to-batch reproducibility. These triazine dendrimers could ultimately be adopted into materials with applications wherein the demands of purity have hitherto remained unsatisfied.","433":"A novel method for synthesizing nanoscale polymer networks that swell in acidic media is described here using photoinitiated emulsion polymerization. These nanomatrices consist of a crosslinked core of poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] surface grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PDGP) with an average diameter of 50-150 nm. Control over mesh size, surface charge, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro biocompatibility was obtained by varying crosslinking density. The ability to image nanomatrices in their dry state using conventional scanning electron microscopy was made possible by increasing crosslinking density. Theoretical calculations of matrix mesh sizes were supported by the encapsulation of both insulin and colloidal gold 2-5 nm in diameter. The ability to sequester and control the aggregation of an inorganic phase confirmed their use as a nanocomposite matrix material. These networks could be used as imaging agents, drug delivery devices or as components of sensing devices.","434":"","435":"We report here the nonlinear rheological properties of metallo-supramolecular networks formed by the reversible cross-linking of semi-dilute unentangled solutions of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The reversible cross-linkers are bis-Pd(II) or bis-Pt(II) complexes that coordinate to the pyridine functional groups on the PVP. Under steady shear, shear thickening is observed above a critical shear rate, and that critical shear rate is experimentally correlated with the lifetime of the metal-ligand bond. The onset and magnitude of the shear thickening depend on the amount of cross-linkers added. In contrast to the behavior observed in most transient networks, the time scale of network relaxation is found to increase during shear thickening. The primary mechanism of shear thickening is ascribed to the shear-induced transformation of intrachain cross-linking to interchain cross-linking, rather than nonlinear high tension along polymer chains that are stretched beyond the Gaussian range.","436":null,"437":"Polymer networks possessing reversible covalent crosslinks constitute a novel material class with the capacity for adapting to an externally applied stimulus. These covalent adaptable networks (CANs) represent a trend in polymer network fabrication towards the rational design of structural materials possessing dynamic characteristics for specialty applications. Herein, we discuss the unique attributes of CANs that must be considered when designing, fabricating, and characterizing these smart materials that respond to either thermal or photochemical stimuli. While there are many reversible reactions which to consider as possible crosslink candidates in CANs, there are very few that are readily and repeatedly reversible. Furthermore, characterization of the mechanical properties of CANs requires special consideration owing to their unique attributes. Ultimately, these attributes are what lead to the advantageous properties displayed by CANs, such as recyclability, healability, tunability, shape changes, and low polymerization stress. Throughout this perspective, we identify several trends and future directions in the emerging field of CANs that demonstrate the progress to date as well as the essential elements that are needed for further advancement.","438":"We have investigated the structural changes in thin films of lamellar poly(styrene-b-butadiene) diblock copolymers during treatment with saturated cyclohexane vapor, a solvent slightly selective for polybutadiene. Using real-time, in-situ grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS), the swelling and the rearrangement of the lamellae were investigated with a time resolution of a few seconds, and the underlying processes on the molecular level were identified. After a few minutes in vapor, a transient state with a more well-defined and more long-range ordered lamellar orientation was encountered. Additional parallel lamellae formed which we attribute to the increased degree of coiling of the polymers in the swollen state. Eventually, the film became disordered. These changes are attributed to the increased mobility of the swollen polymers and the gradually decreasing segment-segment interaction parameter in the film as solvent is absorbed.","439":"","440":null,"441":"A new strategy is presented for the synthesis of graft copolymers using only the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). From a ROMP-derived main chain, pendant maleimide functional groups are converted into norbornene moieties via a Diels-Alder reaction with cyclopentadiene. The norbornene groups serve as sites of initiation, and subsequent ROMP from the main chain yields graft copolymers with both main and side chains derived from ROMP. This strategy offers ready access to defined graft copolymers.","442":"","443":null,"444":"Allyl sulfide addition-fragmentation chain transfer was employed concurrently with the radical-mediated formation of a thiol-ene network to enable network adaptation and mitigation of polymerization-induced shrinkage stress. This result represents the first demonstration of simultaneous polymerization and network adaptation in covalently crosslinked networks with significant implications for the fabrication of low stress polymer networks. For comparison, analogous networks incorporating propyl sulfide moieties, incapable of addition-fragmentation, were synthesized and evaluated in parallel. At the highest irradiation intensity, the allyl sulfide-containing material demonstrated a more than 75% reduction in the final stress when compared with the propyl sulfide-containing material. Analysis of the conversion evolution revealed that allyl sulfide addition-fragmentation decreased the polymerization rate owing to thiyl radical sequestration. Slow consumption of the allyl sulfide functional group suggests that intramolecular homolytic substitution occurs by a step-wise, rather than concerted, mechanism. Simultaneous stress and conversion measurements demonstrated that the initial stress evolution was identical for both the allyl and propyl sulfide-containing materials but diverged after gelation. While addition-fragmentation chain transfer was found to occur throughout the polymerization, its effect on the stress evolution was concentrated towards the end of polymerization when network rearrangement becomes the dominant mechanism for stress relaxation. Even after the polymerization reaction was completed, the polymerization-induced shrinkage stress in the allyl sulfide-containing material continued to decrease, exhibiting a maximum in the stress evolution and demonstrating the potential for continuing, longer term stress relaxation.","445":null,"446":"As part of an ongoing effort to develop biocompatible, biodegradable conducting polymers, we report here the synthesis and characterization of a novel copolymer, 5,5\"'bishydroxymethyl-3,3\"'-dimethyl-2,2':5',2\":5\",2\"'-quaterthiophene-co-adipic acid polyester (QAPE). This system was designed so as to incorporate alternating electroactive quaterthiophene units and biodegradable ester units into one macromolecular framework, while allowing for facile preparation of the polymer via a polycondensation reaction. In agreement with the design expectations, the ester groups were found to be incorporated into the polymer between the quaterthiophene subunits, as inferred from standard chemical and spectroscopic analyses. QAPE exhibited redox activity as detected by cyclic voltammetry and a new red-shifted absorption peak upon doping, providing support for the notion that the quaterthiophene units maintain electroactivity after incorporation into the QAPE polymer framework. The degradation, likely through surface erosion, of this polymer in the presence of cholesterol esterase was confirmed by the detection of a fluorescence signal at wavelengths corresponding to the quaterthiophene subunit and comparisons to appropriate controls. In vitro cytocompatability studies, carried out over 48 h, indicate that the QAPE polymer is nontoxic to Schwann cells.","447":null,"448":"The tremendous diversity of materials properties available with polymers is due in large part to the ability to design structures from the monomeric state. The ease of use of comonomer mixtures only expands this versatility. While final polymer properties are obviously important in the selection or development of a material for a given purpose, for a number of applications, such as optical fiber coatings, photolithography and microelectronics, the additional requirement of a very rapid polymerization process may be equally critical. A class of unusually reactive mono-(meth)acrylate monomers bearing secondary functionality that includes carbonates, carbamates and oxazolidones, has been demonstrated but not fully explained. Here, the influence of an integral cyclic carbonate functional group on (meth)acrylate photopolymerization kinetics is examined in detail with respect to monomers with a wide variety of alternative secondary functionality structure as well as in comparison to conventional mono- and di-(meth)acrylates. The kinetic results from full cure studies of several cyclic carbonate-containing monomers clearly highlight specific structural variations that effectively promote monomer reactivity. Copolymerizations with tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate reflect similar dramatic kinetic effects associated with the novel monomers while partial cure homopolymerization studies reveal exceptional dark cure behavior linked to observations of uncommonly low ratios of termination to propagation rates throughout the conversion profile. Temperature effects on reaction kinetics, including both reaction rate and the individual kinetic parameters, as well as the temperature dependence of hydrogen bonding interactions specifically involving the secondary functional groups are probed as a means to understand better the fundamentally interesting and practically important behavior of these monomers.","449":"Protein-polymer conjugates exhibit superior properties to unmodified proteins, generating a high demand for these materials in the fields of medicine, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Multimeric conjugates are predicted to surpass the activity of monomeric conjugates. Herein, we report a straightforward method to synthesize multimeric polymer-conjugates. Four armed poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) was synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in the presence of a tetra-functionalized trithiocarbonate chain transfer agent (CTA). The polymer molecular weight, architecture and polydispersity index (PDI) were verified by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), dynamic light scattering gel permeation chromatography (DLS-GPC), and matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. This approach afforded well-defined polymers (PDI's &lt; 1.06) and the ability to target various molecular weights. Maleimide functional groups were introduced at the chain ends by heating the polymers in the presence of a furan-protected azo-initiator. This allowed for site-specific conjugation of V131C T4 lysozyme to the polymers to generate multimeric protein-polymer conjugates. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization gas-phase electrophoretic-mobility macromolecule analysis (ESI-GEMMA), gel electrophoresis, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) of the trypsin digests demonstrated that multimeric protein-polymer conjugates had formed. This simple strategy provides ready access to star protein-polymer conjugates for application in the fields of drug discovery, drug delivery, and nanotechnology.","450":"Herein we report the synthesis of vinyl sulfone end functionalized PEGylated polymers by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization for conjugation to proteins. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA) was polymerized in the presence of 1-phenylethyl dithiobenzoate with 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) as the initiator to generate well-defined polyPEGAs with number-average molecular weights (M(n)) by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of 6.7 kDa, 11.8 kDa and 16.1 kDa. Post-polymerization, the majority of polymer chains contained the dithioester functional group at the omega chain end, and the polydispersity indexes (PDI) of the polymers ranged from 1.08 to 1.24. The dithioester was subsequently reduced via aminolysis, and the resulting thiol was trapped with a divinyl sulfone in situ to produce semi-telechelic, vinyl sulfone polyPEGAs with efficiencies ranging between 85% and 99%. It was determined that the retention of vinyl sulfone was directly related to reaction time, with the maximum dithioester being transformed into a vinyl sulfone within 30 minutes. Longer reaction times resulted in slow decomposition of the vinyl sulfone end group. The resulting semi-telechelic vinyl sulfone polymers were then conjugated to a protein containing a free cysteine, bovine serum albumin (BSA). Gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the reaction was highly efficient and that conjugates of increasing size were readily prepared. After polymer attachment, the activity of the BSA was 92% of the unmodified biomolecule.","451":null,"452":"We have studied the diffusion of small solvent molecules (octane) and larger hydrophobic dye probes in octane-swollen poly(dimethyl siloxane) linear-chain solutions and end-linked model networks, using pulsed-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), respectively, focusing on diffusion in the bulk polymer up to the equilibrium degree of swelling of the networks, that is, 4.8 at most. The combination of these results allows for new conclusions on the feasibility of different theories describing probe diffusion in concentrated polymer systems. While octane diffusion shows no cross-link dependence, the larger dyes are increasingly restricted by fixed chemical meshes. The simple Fujita free-volume theory proved most feasible to describe probe diffusion in linear long-chain solutions with realistic parameters, while better fits were obtained assuming a stretched exponential dependence on concentration. Importantly, we have analyzed the cross-link specific effect on probe diffusion independently of any specific model by comparing the best-fit interpolation of the solution data with the diffusion in the networks. The most reasonable description is obtained by assuming that the cross-link effect is additive in the effective friction coefficient of the probes. The concentration dependences as well as the data compared at the equilibrium degrees of swelling indicate that swelling heterogeneities and diffusant shape have a substantial influence on small-molecule diffusion in networks.","453":"The network structure of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels obtained by freezing-thawing cycles was investigated by solid-state (1)H low-field NMR spectroscopy. By the application of multiple-quantum NMR experiments, we obtain information about the segmental order parameter, which is directly related to the restrictions on chain motion (cross-links) formed upon gelation. These measurements indicate that the network mesh size as well as the relative amount of nonelastic defects (i.e., non-cross-linked chains, dangling chains, loops) decrease with the number of freezing-thawing cycles but are independent of the polymer concentration. The formation of the PVA network is accompanied by an increasing fraction of polymer with fast magnetization decay ( approximately 20 mus). The quantitative study of this rigid phase with a specific refocusing pulse sequence shows that it is composed of a primary crystalline polymer phase ( approximately 5%), which constitutes the main support of the network structure and determines the mesh size, and a secondary population of more imperfect crystallites, which increase the number of elastic chain segments in the polymer gel but do not affect the average network mesh size appreciably. Correspondingly, progressive melting of the secondary crystallites with increasing temperature does not affect the network mesh size but only the amount of network defects, and melting of the main PVA crystallites at approximately 80 degrees C leads to the destruction of the network gel and the formation of an isotropic PVA solution.","454":null,"455":null,"456":"A new synthetic approach to the preparation of intramolecularly collapsed nanoparticles under mild, room temperature conditions has been developed from commercially available vinyl monomers. Reaction of isocyanate functionalized linear copolymers with a diamine in dilute solution leads to the efficient formation of nanoparticles where the diameter of the nanoparticle can be varied by controlling both the molecular weight and mole percentage of isocyanate repeat units. Physical properties for the intramolecularly collapsed nanoparticles were fully consistent with a three-dimensional structure and analysis of the collapse reaction revealed that approximately 75% of the isocyanate groups along the backbone underwent crosslinking with 25% being available for further reaction with mono-functional amines. This stepwise consumption of the isocyanates allows the chemical and physical properties of the nanoparticles to be further tuned and significantly opens up the range of nanoparticles that can be prepared using this mild and highly efficient chemistry.","457":"Radical-mediated thiol-yne step-growth photopolymerizations are utilized to form highly cross-linked polymer networks. This reaction mechanism is shown to be analogous to the thiol-ene photopolymerization; however, each alkyne functional group is capable of consecutive reaction with two thiol functional groups. The thiol-yne reaction involves the sequential propagation of a thiyl radical with either an alkyne or a vinyl functional group followed by chain transfer of the radical to another thiol. The rate of thiyl radical addition to the alkyne was determined to be approximately one-third of that to the vinyl. Chain-growth polymerization of alkyne and vinyl functionalities was only observed for reactions in which the alkyne was originally in excess. Analysis of initial polymerization rates demonstrated a near first-order dependence on thiol concentration, indicating that chain transfer is the rate-determining step. Further analysis revealed that the polymerization rate scaled with the initiation rate to an exponent of 0.65, deviating from classical square root dependence predicted for termination occurring exclusively by bimolecular reactions. A tetrafunctional thiol was photopolymerized with a difunctional alkyne, forming an inherently higher cross-link density than an analogous thiol-ene resin, displaying a higher glass transition temperature (48.9 vs -22.3 degrees C) and rubbery modulus (80 vs 13 MPa). Additionally, the versatile nature of this chemistry facilitates postpolymerization modification of residual reactive groups to produce materials with unique physical and chemical properties.","458":null,"459":"The synthesis and characterization of second- and third-generation triazine dendrimers bearing carboxylic acid groups on the periphery are reported.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirms the presence of the desired material. These materials display pH-dependent solubility in water. Capillary electrophoresis proves to be valuable in multiple elements of this work, and general protocols emerge that appear to be useful for the characterization of lower-generation anionic dendrimers. Specifically, capillary electrophoresis provides a convenient method for monitoring the removal of excess succinic anhydride\/succinic acid and offers additional clues to the chemical nature of the impurities in these samples. Optimization of the background electrolyte and instrumental parameters allows for the assessment of the purity of these triazine targets as well as comparison with two sets of commercially available anionic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Corroborative information from the different orthogonal analytical techniques employed supports the hypothesis that triazine dendrimers exist as very narrowly disperse mixtures of macromolecules approaching, in some cases, single chemical entities.","460":"Electrostatic interactions between the imidazole-based cationic homopolymer, polyvinylimidazole (PVIm), and anionic polysaccharide, sodium alginate, lead to the formation of colloidal aggregates known as complex coacervates in the pH range 4-6.5. PVIm was labeled with the fluorescent reporter pyrene to investigate the coacervation-induced changes in and around PVIm chains. While the pyrene-tagged PVIm had blue fluorescence in water, the coacervate phase exhibited an additional broad band around 492 nm (green) due to formation of pyrene excimers. Fluorescence spectroscopic investigations point toward aggregation of PVIm chains and desolvation upon coacervation. Highly anisotropic fluorescence emission indicates tight packing of the polymer chains in the coacervate. Confocal microscopy of fluorescein-labeled alginate and rhodamine-labeled PVIm shows coacervates as dense aggregates with uniform distribution of the polymers. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers sensitive and easy investigation into polyelectrolyte interactions.","461":"A cyclic acetal-functionalized urethane acrylate monomer is synthesized here and polymerized in a crystalline state without the polymerization kinetics being deleteriously affected by the solid state. Depending on the processing conditions, the cyclic acetal urethane acrylate monomer exists in either a metastable liquid state or a crystalline state at ambient conditions. Due to mobility restrictions, extremely poor polymerization kinetics and functional group conversions are typically achieved in solid state polymerizations. However, the solid-state photopolymerization of a cyclic acetal urethane acrylate results in nearly identical polymerization rates and ultimately higher conversion in the crystalline state than in the liquid state under otherwise identical conditions. We conclude that the crystallization process occurs in such a manner as to template the acrylic double bonds in a structure that facilitates rapid, minimally activated propagation.","462":null,"463":null,"464":null,"465":"Triggered hydrogelation of MAX1 peptide, (VK)(4)-V(D)PPT-(KV)(4)-NH(2), proceeds through peptide intramolecular folding into beta-hairpins and concomitant self-assembly into branched clusters of well-defined (uniform, 3 nm cross section), semiflexible, beta-sheet-rich nanofibrils. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy indicates that dangling fibrils extend from one growing cluster to another and lead to early, intercluster communication in solution. At the apparent percolation threshold, the dynamic shear modulus measured by oscillatory rheology (G'(omega), G''(omega) proportional, variant omega(n)) and the field-intensity autocorrelation function measured by dynamic light scattering (g(1)(tau) proportional, variant tau(-beta')) show power-law behavior with comparable critical dynamic exponents (n approximately 0.47 and beta' approximately 0.45).

The data shows that the elastic modulus does not vary significantly with the blend composition as the weight percentage of p(I(2)-DTE carbonate) increases for films of uniform thickness in the range of 67 to 200 nm. As a function of film thickness, the observed elastic moduli of p(DTE carbonate), p(I(2)-DTE carbonate) and their 50:50 by mass blend show little variation over the range 30 to 200 nm.","467":"Polymeric materials have been applied in therapeutic applications, such as drug delivery and tissue regeneration, for decades owing to their biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. In addition, select polymer-drug conjugates have been used as bioactive pharmaceuticals owing to their increased drug efficacy, solubility, and target specificity compared with small-molecule drugs. Increased synthetic control of polymer properties has permitted the production of polymer assemblies for the targeted and controlled delivery of drugs, and polymeric sequestrants take advantage of their lack of solubility for the sequestration of target molecules in vivo. In more recent studies reviewed in greater detail here, the properties of polymers that distinguish them from small-molecule drugs, such as their high molecular weight and their ability to display multiple pendant moieties, have been specifically exploited for activating cellular targets or inhibiting the binding of pathogens. The elucidation of relevant structure-function relationships in investigations of this kind has relied on the combination of living polymerization methods with chemical conjugation methods, and protein engineering methods have shown increasing potential in the manipulation of architectural features of such polymer therapeutics.

Hydrolysis and ammonolysis of these copolymers resulted in amphiphilic diblock fluorocopolymers with alkene-functionalized hydrophobic segments, which were shown to form internally-functionalized micelles in THF-water.","476":"The conformation and dynamics of a single DNA molecule undergoing oscillatory pressure-driven flow in microfluidic channels is studied using Brownian dynamics simulations, accounting for hydrodynamic interactions between segments in the bulk and between the chain and the walls. Oscillatory flow provides a scenario under which the polymers may remain in the channel for an indefinite amount of time as they are stretched and migrate away from the channel walls. We show that by controlling the chain length, flow rate and oscillatory flow frequency, we are able to manipulate the chain extension and the chain migration from the channel walls. The chain stretch and the chain depletion layer thickness near the wall are found to increase as the Weissenberg number increases and as the oscillatory frequency decreases.","477":null,"478":"This investigation sought to develop methods that permit broad and tunable control over the erosion of multilayered polyelectrolyte assemblies and the release of anionic polymers in physiologically relevant media. We report the fabrication and characterization of multilayered films ~60 nm thick using sodium poly(styrene sulfonate) (SPS) and different combinations of three different hydrolytically degradable polyamines (1-3). We investigated two different approaches to film fabrication: 1) fabrication using solutions comprised of defined mixtures of two different polyamines, and 2) fabrication of films composed of different numbers of layers of two different polyamines. In general, films fabricated using polyamine solutions composed of defined mixtures of two different polyamines had erosion and release profiles that were dictated almost entirely by the most hydrophobic polyamine used to fabricate the films. In contrast, the fabrication of films having different numbers of layers of different polyamines permitted broad and tunable control over film erosion and the release of SPS. For example, films having the architecture (1\/SPS)(n)(2\/SPS)(m) released SPS with profiles that were intermediate to those of films fabricated exclusively from polymer 1 or polymer 2. Further, we demonstrated that it is possible to exert systematic control over the release of SPS by varying the relative numbers of layers of (1\/SPS) or (2\/SPS) incorporated into the films. The approaches reported here provide tunable control over the rate of the release of anionic polymers from surfaces coated with ultrathin multilayered films. This work could, with further development, contribute to the design of ultrathin films that permit tunable control over the release and delivery of therapeutically relevant macromolecules, such as proteins or DNA, from surfaces.","479":"Hydrogel networks crosslinked with polymer-bound phenylboronic acid (PBA) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) demonstrate pH-reversible gel behavior due to the pH-dependent equilibrium of the crosslinking moieties that form the gel network. Furthermore, the pH at which gels behave dynamically can be controlled by use of a polyelectrolyte backbone. Here we report on the frequency-dependent chemorheological characterization of PBA-SHA crosslinked hydrogel networks with a sulfonated polymer backbone. Our results suggest that the anionic nature of the polymers allows reversible crosslinking at neutral pH that an otherwise neutral-backboned PBA-SHA crosslinked network cannot, and that these charge-induced dynamics can be effectively screened by ions in solution. Moreover, moduli-frequency data can effectively be reduced into a single master curve with a neutral-backboned PBA-SHA gel data set as the reference condition.","480":"Recently developed multifunctional cancer therapeutic nano-device production is based on poly(amidoamine) PAMAM generation 5 (G5) dendrimer as a carrier 1-5. Scale up synthesis of this nano-device is limited because of long reaction sequence (12 reaction steps) and long and not easy work up of the products after each reaction step. Combination of poly(propyle-imine) and poly(amidoamine) synthesis can improve the production of the drug carrier.In this paper we give a general overview of the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel hybrid dendrimers which we coined as novel POMAM hybrid dendrimers, constructed from poly(propylene-imine) (PPI or POPAM) core and poly(amidoamine) PAMAM shells. The synthesis was accomplished by a divergent reiterating method involving repeating subsequent Michael addition and amidation reactions. Each generation of the newly synthesized dendrimer was characterized by using HPLC, GPC, NMR and AFM.","481":"Degradation experiments and model studies suggested that the longer lived green fluorescence from an aggregated poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) was due to the presence of highly emissive, low-energy, anthryl defect sites rather than the emissive conjugated polymer excimers proposed in a previous report. After elucidating the origin of the green fluorescence, additional anthryl units were purposely incorporated into the polymer to enhance the blue-to-green fluorescence color change that accompanied polymer aggregation. The improved color contrast from this anthryl-doped conjugated polymer led to the development of crude solution-state and solid-state sensors, which, upon exposure to water, exhibited a visually noticeable blue-to-green fluorescence color change.","482":"Dendronized polymers based on a poly(L-lysine) backbone have been synthesized up to the fourth generation. The hydroxyl-terminated polymers are completely water-soluble, which makes them good candidates for drug delivery applications. The dendronized polypeptide backbones are helical at lower generations, but undergo a dramatic conformational change from alpha-helical to disordered upon increasing the dendron size to the third generation. This conformational change, attributed to steric repulsions between dendrons, is supported by spectroscopic measurements while chain extension upon dendronization is confirmed by scanning force microscopy.","483":"Hollow nanoparticles represent an emerging area of development for the encapsulation of active ingredients. Expanding the capabilities of these nanomaterials will require continued efforts to infill properties such as size control, biodegradability, and environmental responsiveness. Acid-labile poly(N-vinylformamide) (PNVF) nanocapsules were synthesized by free radical polymerization of N-vinylformamide on the surface of silica nanoparticles. Polymerization in the presence of a novel crosslinker that contains an acid-labile ketal facilitated stable etching of silica nanoparticle templates using sodium hydroxide and recovery of degradable PNVF nanocapsules. The formamido side group of PNVF was then hydrolyzed by extended exposure to sodium hydroxide to produce polyvinylamine (PVAm) micro- and nanocapsules. Both capsule types demonstrated an increasing dissolution rate as pH decreased. In addition, PVAm nanocapsules exhibited swelling in proportion to the relative charge density of the PVAm network (a function of the degree of formamide hydrolysis and pH), presumably due to the repulsion of positively charged amino groups within the elastic shell network. The synthetic approaches reported provide methods to endow nanocapsules with key attributes such as size control, pH sensitive degradation, swelling in response to pH, and amine functionality.","484":null,"485":null,"486":"Radiolabeling studies were employed to investigate the influence of structure on the efficiency of surface functionalization for poly(acrylic acid)-coated shell crosslinked nanoparticles (SCKs) with two types of amine-terminated DOTA chelators. An intricate interplay between the chemical and physical properties of both the DOTA derivative and the SCK nanostructures was revealed, demonstrating the importance of structural control.","487":null,"488":"Uniform nylon 6 nanofibers with diameters around 200 nm were prepared by electrospinning. Polymorphic phase transitions and crystal orientation of nylon 6 in unconfined (i.e., as-electrospun) and a high T(g) (340 degrees C) polyimide confined nanofibers were studied. Similar to melt-spun nylon 6 fibers, electrospun nylon 6 nanofibers also exhibited predominant, meta-stable gamma crystalline form, and the gamma-crystal (chain) axes preferentially oriented parallel to the fiber axis. Upon annealing above 150 degrees C, gamma-form crystals gradually melted and recrystallized into the thermodynamically stable alpha-form crystals, which ultimately melted at 220 degrees C. Release of surface tension accompanied this melt-recrystallization process, as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry. For confined nanofibers, both the melt-recrystallization and surface tension release processes were substantially depressed; gamma-form crystals did not melt and recrystallize into alpha-form crystals until 210 degrees C, only 10 degrees C below the T(m) at 220 degrees C. After complete melting of nano-confined crystals at 240 degrees C and recrystallization at 100 degrees C, only alpha-form crystals oriented perpendicular to the nanofiber axis were obtained. In the polyimide-confined nanofibers, the Brill transition (from the monoclinic alpha-form to a high temperature monoclinic form) was observed at 180-190 degrees C, which was at least 20 degrees C higher than that in unconfined nylon 6 at approximately 160 degrees C. This, again, was attributed to the confinement effect.","489":"One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR studies are used to probe the conformation of a melamine dendrimer bearing unique NMR signals from the core to the periphery. Four conceptual anchors for dendrimer conformation emerge from these experiments. First, changes in isomer populations observed by (1)H NMR reveal the onset of globular structure. Second, NOE complexity emerges with globular structure: variable temperature NOESY studies show that the peripheral groups, BOC-protected aliphatic amines, fold back into the globular core of the macromolecule at 75 degrees C in DMSO-d(6). Third, variable temperature coefficients measured for NH protons suggest that solvent is largely excluded from the interior of the dendrimer: the carbamate NH groups of the periphery are most sensitive to temperature while the NHs nearest the core show little temperature dependence. Conformation is influenced by solvent choice: backfolding is observed in DMSO-d(6), but not in either CDCl(3) or CD(3)OD. Finally, relaxation studies show that peripheral groups are more dynamic than groups at the core. These anchors consolidate observations made by many groups on disparate systems within a common architecture.","490":"We have investigated the adsorption of asymmetric poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) block copolymers (PS-PMMA) from a selective solvent onto alumina (Al(2)O(3)) particles having variable and controllable radii. The solvent used was a bad solvent for the PS block (block A) and a good solvent for the PMMA block (block B), which has a higher affinity of the surface. Such a case represents a new class of adsorption, where both blocks compete for the adsorption sites of the metallic surface. Two theoretical models, the modified drops model and the perforated film model, have been evaluated as appropriate representation of such an adsorption scenario. The experimental results indicated that the adsorption of the PS-PMMA block copolymer generated a patterned surface comprised of a homogeneous melt layer of the PS block perforated with holes having a variable PMMA structure, depending on the distance from the bottom of the hole (alumina surface) and the distance from walls of the hole. The density gradient of the PMMA moiety in the hole reverted to the classical brush morphology at a critical distance from the surface of the hole.","491":null,"492":"Many recognition events important in biology are mediated via multivalent interactions between relevant oligosaccharides and multiple saccharide receptors present on lectins, viruses, toxins, and cell surfaces. Because of the important role played by protein-carbohydrate interactions in these pathogenic recognition events and in other human diseases, considerable effort has been devoted toward the development of multivalent polymeric ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins. In this work, we report the synthesis of new polypeptide-based glycopolymers produced via a combination of protein engineering and chemical methods. These methodologies permit control over the number and the spacing of saccharides on the scaffold, as well as the conformation of the polymer backbone, and allow a more purposeful design of polymers for manipulation of multivalent binding events. Two families of galactose-bearing glycopolypeptides with random coil conformations, [(AG)(3)PEG](y) (y = 10 and 16) and {[(AG)(2)PSG](2)[(AG)(2)PEG][(AG)(2)PSG](2)}(y) (y = 6), have been synthesized. The carboxylic acid functionality of the glutamic acid residues allowed subsequent modification with amino-saccharides to yield the desired glycopolypeptides; selective placement of the glutamic acid group permitted investigation of the effects of multivalency and saccharide spacing on toxin inhibition. In addition, a family of galactose-functionalized PGA-based glycopolymers of varying molecular weights was also synthesized to compare the effects of backbone flexibility and hydrodynamic volume, relative to the recombinant glycopolypeptides, on toxin inhibition. Glycopolypeptides were characterized via (1)H NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE analysis, and spectrophotometric assays. They were tested as inhibitors of the binding of the cholera toxin B subunit via direct enzyme-linked assays. The data from these experiments confirm the relevance of appropriate saccharide spacing on controlling the binding event and also indicate the influence of chain extension in improving inhibition.","493":null,"494":"Efficient photopolymerization of a potentially expandable monomer is of practical importance for a variety of polymeric applications demanding dimensional stability, particularly if the polymerization process is well controlled based on a detailed investigation of the reaction. In the current study, photoinitiated polymerization kinetics of 2-methylene-7-phenyl-1,4,6,9-tetraoxaspiro[4.4]nonane (MPN) either with cationic initiation alone or with combined cationic\/free radical initiation was examined using real-time FT-IR. A proposed mechanism based on the simplified propagation steps of the cationic double ring-opening polymerization of MPN was confirmed by both computer modeling and NMR spectroscopic analysis of resulting polymers as well as the experimentally observed apparent activation energy. According to this mechanism, alpha-position attack is the predominant mode for the second ring opening during cationic polymerization of MPN. Further, cationic photopolymerization was performed along with a free radical co-initiator or with exposure to moisture to get an improved understanding of the complex cationic double ring-opening polymerization. As a result, free radical-promoted cationic polymerization helps increase the polymerization rate of MPN while even a trace amount of moisture was found to significantly impact both the reaction kinetics and the polymerization course.","495":null,"496":null,"497":"","498":"Fluctuations in the bending angles at internal irregularities of DNA and RNA (such as symmetric loops, bulges, and nicks\/gaps) have been observed from various experiments. However, little effort has been made to computationally predict and explain the statistical behavior of semi-flexible chains with internal defects. In this paper, we describe the general structure of these macromolecular chains as inextensible elastic chains with one or more internal joints which have limited ranges of rotation, and propose a method to compute the probability density functions of the end-to-end pose of these macromolecular chains. Our method takes advantage of the operational properties of the non-commutative Fourier transform for the group of rigid-body motions in three-dimensional space, SE(3). Two representative types of joints, the hinge for planar rotation and the ball joint for spatial rotation, are discussed in detail. The proposed method applies to various stiffness models of semi-flexible chain-like macromolecules. Examples are calculated using the Kratky-Porod model with specified stiffness, angular fluctuation, and joint locations. Entropic effects associated with internal angular fluctuations of semi-flexible macromolecular chains with internal joints can be computed using this formulation. Our method also provides a potential tool to detect the existence of internal irregularities.","499":"We describe a series of fluorocarbon surfactant polymers designed for modifying fluorocarbon surfaces such as poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Novel fluorocarbon surfactant polymers poly(N-vinyldextranaldonamide-co-N-vinylperfluoroundecanamide), in which hydrophilic dextran oligosaccharides and hydrophobic perfluoroundecanoyl groups were incorporated sequentially onto a poly(vinylamine) backbone, were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and XPS spectroscopy. By adjusting the feed ratio of dextran to fluorocarbon branches, surfactant polymers with different hydrophilic\/hydrophobic balances were prepared. The surface activity of the surfactants at the air\/water interface was demonstrated by significant reductions in water surface tension. Surfactant adsorption and adhesion at the solid PTFE\/aqueous interface were examined under well-defined dynamic flow conditions, using a rotating disk system. The surface activity at the air\/water interface and adhesion stability on PTFE under an applied shear stress both increase with increasing density of fluorocarbon branches on the polymer backbone. The results show that stable surfactant adhesion on PTFE can be achieved by adjusting the hydrophilic dextran to hydrophobic fluorocarbon branch ratio.","500":"Protein engineering strategies have proven valuable for the production of a variety of well-defined macromolecular materials with controlled properties that have enabled their use in a range of materials and biological applications. In this work, such biosynthetic strategies have been employed in the production of monodisperse alanine-rich, helical protein polymers with the sequences [AAAQEAAAAQAAAQAEAAQAAQ](3) and [AAAQAAQAQAAAEAAAQAAQAQ](6). The composition of these protein polymers is similar to that of a previously reported family of alanine-rich protein polymers, but the density and placement of chemically reactive residues has been varied to facilitate the future use of these macromolecules in elucidating polymeric structure-function relationships in biological recognition events. Both protein polymers are readily expressed from E. coli and purified to homogeneity; characterization of their conformational behavior via circular dichroic spectroscopy (CD) indicates that they adopt highly helical conformations under a range of solution conditions. Differential scanning calorimetry, in concert with CD, demonstrates that the conformational transition from helix to coil in these macromolecules can be well-defined, with helicity, conformational transitions, T(m) values, and calorimetric enthalpies that vary with the molecular weight of the protein polymers. A combination of infrared spectroscopy and CD also reveals that the macromolecules can adopt beta-sheet structures at elevated temperatures and concentrations and that the existence and kinetics of this conformational transition appear to be related to the density of charged groups on the protein polymer.","501":null,"502":"","503":"","504":"","505":"","506":"","507":"","508":"","509":"","510":"","511":"","512":"","513":"We study theoretically the interaction of a polyampholyte chain with charged planes, cylinders, and spheres. Due to the random character of the charge distribution along the chain, a polyampholyte possesses a spontaneous dipole moment, which can interact favorably with charged objects. Depending on the charge strength of the object and the polyampholyte length and fraction of charged monomers, this attractive interaction can be strong enough to induce adsorption. The addition of salt weakens the trend to adsorption, but proves necessary to adsorb polyampholytes of the same net charge as the charged object in the case of planes and cylinders. Long polyampholytes form globules, for which the number of uncompensated charges and thus the spontaneous dipole moment is reduced. Nevertheless, globules can adsorb on charged objects via two pathways: they either adsorb as a whole, (intact globule), or they are dissolved into a coil state prior to adsorption. Applications to the complexation behavior of polyampholytes with stiff, rodlike polyelectrolytes and with charged microspheres or charged spherical micelles are given.","514":"We consider planar brushes formed by end-grafted polymers with moderate to strong excluded-volume interactions. We first rederive the mean-field theory and solve the resulting self-consistent equations numerically. In the continuum limit, the results depend sensitively on a single parameter, beta, whose square is the ratio of the scaling prediction for the brush height to the unperturbed polymer radius of gyration, and which measures therefore the degree to which the polymers are stretched. For large values of beta, the density profile is close to parabolic, as predicted by the infinite-stretching theory of Zhulina et al. and of Milner et al. As beta decreases, the profile deviates strongly from a parabolic one. By calculating the most probable paths and comparing their contribution to various properties with those obtained from the full self-consistent theory, we determine the effect of the fluctuations about such paths. At large values of beta, these effects are very small everywhere. As beta decreases, fluctuation effects on the density profile become increasingly important near the grafting surface, but remain small far from it. For all values of beta, we find that polymer paths which begin far from the grafting surface are strongly, and almost uniformly, stretched throughout their length, including their free end points. Paths which begin close to the grafting surface are also stretched, but they initially move away from the grafting surface before reaching a maximum height and then returning to it. The classical theory is then derived from the self-consistent field equations by retaining, for each end point location, only that single trajectory which minimizes the free energy of the system. This free energy contains an entropy, of relative weight beta-1, which arises from the distribution of end points. Even for brushes which are only moderately stretched, the results of the classical theory for the brush profile and polymer end point distribution agree well with those of the full self-consistent theory except near the grafting surface itself. There the density profile as calculated in the self-consistent theory shows a characteristic decrease which is not captured by the classical theory. However it does capture the fact that the individual polymer paths are stretched in general throughout their length, including the end points, and yields nonmonotonic paths for polymers whose end points are close to the grafting surface. In addition, it reproduces extremely well the form of the density distribution far from the grafting surface, which is essentially Gaussian. This results from the fact that the stretching energy dominates the interaction energy of those polymers which extend far from the grafting surface, so that their behavior is nearly ideal. In the limit of infinite stretching, beta --&gt; infinity, the theory reduces to that of Zhulina et al. and of Milner et al.","515":"The lattice cluster theory (LCT) is used to study the microscopic molecular factors affecting the miscibilities of AxB1-x\/C binary mixtures (where the homopolymer C is either different or identical to the AxB1-x random copolymer species). A prime goal of this study lies in describing gross departures of LCT predictions from the prevailing random copolymer Flory-Huggins (FH) theory. These departures are illustrated by analyzing computed constant pressure spinodal (and binodal) curves, and some computations are compared with experimental data. Different miscibilities are predicted for several AxB1-x\/A and AxB1-x\/B systems with x = 1\/2, departing considerably from predictions of FH random copolymer theory. These differences are partially explained in terms of the entropic structural parameter that provides one measure of blend structural asymmetry. The computed phase diagrams of AxB1-x\/C not equal A,B blends exhibit richer miscibility patterns than those derived from FH random copolymer theory. The illustrations focus on the influence of monomer structure, interaction energies, and pressure on the phase behavior of random copolymer\/homopolymer systems. Applications to polyolefins employ a model for interaction energies based on Lennard-Jones parameters for these olefins.","516":null,"517":"We report on the adsorption of a series of poly(ethylene oxide)-polytetrahydrofuran-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers, EOn\/2THFmEOn\/2, at hydrophilic silica surfaces and relate our findings to the corresponding behavior at hydrophobic surfaces. The adsorption of these copolymers is similar to that of poly(ethylene oxide) homopolymers at low bulk concentrations. However, the copolymer adsorption increases strongly above a certain threshold concentration. This increase, which begins more than 1 order of magnitude below the critical micellar concentration (cmc), is related to the concomitant formation of micellar-like structures at the hydrophilic surfaces. We show in this work that a commercial (ethylene oxide-propylene oxide-ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer, Pluronic F127, exhibits a similar behavior at silica. Due to surface aggregation, much thicker layers are measured on silica than at the hydrophobic surface, where the adsorption results in the formation of a monolayer structure. The adsorbed amount and layer thickness measured on bare silica tend to decrease when the bulk concentration is raised above the cmc. We infer that this is due to changes of the molecular weight distribution and relative block sizes of the copolymers in the surface aggregates, i.e., a polydispersity effect. This study also covers some aspects of the adsorption and desorption kinetics exhibited by the copolymers at silica. As is common for adsorbing polymers, the concentration dependent adsorption process is generally observed to be much faster than the desorption process. The adsorption process is in parts diffusion controlled but overall to a complex to be fully analyzed. During adsorption from solutions with bulk concentrations exceeding the cmc, a clear overshoot of the surface excess is observed after intermediate adsorption times. Again, this is interpreted as being due to polydispersity. Finally, after an initial rapid desorption regime, the surface excess exhibits a logarithmic decay with time during desorption.","518":null,"519":"Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) polymer, in linear and star form, was covalently grafted to silicon surfaces, and the surfaces were tested for their ability to adsorb proteins. Linear PEG of molecular weight 3400, 10 000, and 20 000 g\/mol and star PEO molecules were coupled via their terminal hydroxyl groups activated by tresyl chloride to aminosilane-treated silicon wafers. The amount of PEO coupled to the surface was varied by changing the concentration of the tresyl-PEO solution. The dry PEO thickness on the surface was measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometry, from which the grafting density was calculated. The PEO surfaces were exposed to solutions of each of three proteins: cytochrome-c, albumin, and fibronectin. The degree of adsorption of each protein was determined by XPS and ellipsometry and recorded as a function of PEO grafting density. All three proteins were found to reach zero adsorption at the highest grafting densities on all three PEG surfaces, which for all three PEG surfaces was a PEO content of 100 +\/- 10 ng\/cm2. On both star PEO surfaces, albumin and fibronectin decreased to zero adsorption at intermediate values of grafting density, whereas cytochrome-c continued to adsorb at all grafting densities, although with a decreasing trend. A physical model of the surface helped explain these protein adsorption results in terms of the spacing and degree of overlap of grafted PEO chains.","520":"Using experimentally established sequence of extractions, we were able to fractionate regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (R-P3HT) into four fractions differing significantly in their molecular weight (Mn) and exhibiting low polydispersity coefficients. 1H NMR analysis of low molecular fractions enabled us to propose the dominant chain termination mechanisms and identify the sources of regioregularity defects. In particular, it turned out that the presence of small amounts of undesired isomer of 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene, namely, 2-bromo-4-hexylthiophene, strongly influences the molecular weight and to a much lesser extent the regioregularity of the polymer obtained via Grignard type polycondensation. In the reaction with the growing chain, 2-bromo-4-hexylthiophene either causes its termination, lowering in this manner the molecular weight of the resulting polymer, or introduces regioregularity defects of TT-HH (TT = tail to tail; HH = head to head) type. The average conjugation length in R-P3HT increases with the increase of Mn as manifested by a bathochromic shift of the lambdamax and the appearance of the vibrational structure in the UV-vis-near-IR spectra of the fractions of higher molecular weight. This conclusion is supported by FTIR data. The onset of the oxidative doping of R-P3HT shifts to lower potentials with the increase of the molecular weight as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis-near-IR spectroelectrochemistry.","521":"The zero shear melt viscosity, eta0, for a variety of dendritic poly(benzyl ether) macromolecules has been measured. The viscosity of low generation dendrimers exhibits a strong molecular mass, M, dependence, yet, direct proportionality between eta0 and M is observed at higher generations. The viscosity scales with M for mono- and tridendrons rather than generation number. Hypercore dendrimers continue this scaling although the viscosity is slightly greater. A large deviation from the master curve for the mono- and tridendrons is found for an end-substituted monodendron. The viscosity for the end-substituted monodendron is also much more temperature dependent than virgin dendrimers, and it is concluded that end groups have a much larger effect on the viscosity than the core. Reexamination of literature data for intrinsic viscosity and glass transition temperature is performed, and these quantities also scale with molecular mass. Comparison with free volume theory indicates that the theory is extremely robust although some question of its validity is made when applied to dendrimers.","522":"Crystals were grown of the 5-amide, 9-amide, and 17-amide nylon 6 monodisperse oligoamides and investigated using electron microscopy (real space and diffraction) and X-ray diffraction. Analyses of the data allowed us to determine the crystalline structures and relate them to the morphology. Under our crystallization conditions, the 5-amide chains are unfolded and crystallize in the usual nylon 6 alpha-structure, i.e., an apolar arrangement of chains, directed parallel to the layer normal, within hydrogen-bonded sheets which stack via van der Waals interactions. In chain-folded nylon polymers such as nylon 6, the length of the straight stems is approximately 5 to 7 nm; this is equivalent to about six to eight amide units. Therefore it is not too surprising that the 5-amide molecule, of length 4.6 nm, remains unfolded. If the 9-amide molecules (length 8 nm) fold, we would expect them to create hairpin-like structures with four, or close to four, amide units in adjacent straight stems. Our results show that, depending on the crystallization conditions, both unfolded and once-folded conformations can occur for this 9-amide oligomer. In the unfolded conformation, the straight-stem chains crystallize in the nylon 6 gamma-phase structure as opposed to the usual alpha-phase structure. The once-folded structure for the 9-amide chain represents the onset of folding in these nylon 6 monodisperse oligoamides and the lamellar stacking periodicity (LSP) is 4.60 nm. This once-folded conformation is similar to the usual nylon 6 alpha-phase structure. The 17-amide chains crystallize in a twice-folded conformation, also with the nylon 6 alpha-phase structure, reinforcing the notion that once the chains are long enough to start folding, the pattern of behavior approaches that of the nylon 6 polymer. In this case, the LSP value is 5.36 nm.","523":"Polymorphism is a well-established phenomenon in crystalline materials and is important for pharmaceutical and polymeric materials. In our study concerning the processability of polymers, we came across an unusual observation related to polymorphism induced by pressure. The experimental observation is that polyethylene crystals transform from the stable orthorhombic crystal into a transient hexagonal phase. The occurrence of a transient hexagonal phase is shown to be dependent on the polymer crystal size; smaller crystals transform into the transient hexagonal phase at temperatures and pressures much below the thermodynamic critical point Qo, which is located at P = 3.6 kbar and T = 230 degreesC. The crystal size dependence in the phase transition was investigated by in situ X-ray studies in the unirradiated and irradiated solution-crystallized films. Since the chain mobility is rather high in the hexagonal phase, sintering has been attempted via this transient phase using ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) as a model system. UHMW-PE is an intractable polymer due to its high molar mass but possesses excellent abrasion resistance properties. For this reason it is used as an inlay in demanding applications such as artificial hip and knee joints. The service life of UHMW-PE in these artificial joints, however, is limited due to the poor processing characteristics notably during sintering, and often a second operation is needed to replace the UHMW-PE interface. Sintering via the transient hexagonal phase could provide a solution for this important problem which concerns an increasing number of people.","524":"Several commercial and noncommercial, high- and low-density and ultraoriented polyethylene samples, as well as polyethylene samples with inorganic fillers, have been investigated by inversion-recovery cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In all these samples two types of all-trans chains in orthorhombic crystalline domains are detected, which give two overlapping carbon-13 lines with different line widths and different relaxation times. From the NMR relaxation parameters we conclude that one type of the crystalline chains, which composes 60-90% of the crystalline fraction in all samples, can execute at room temperature 180 degrees flips with a frequency in the kilohertz domain. The other crystalline chains are more rigid and probably are found in more perfect structures in which such chain flips do not occur or occur on a much slower time scale. Adding kaoline filler particles to polyethylene enhances the contribution of the more mobile crystalline chains. The presence of the two distinctly different types of crystalline environments is found in all polyethylene samples investigated so far (more than 25 samples).","525":"The phase separation and dewetting of thin films of blends of deuterated polystyrene (dPS) and poly(p-methylstyrene) (PpMS) were investigated during annealing. The surface morphology, obtained from atomic force microscopy and phase measurement interference microscopy, the density profile, determined by X-ray reflectivity in the region of total external reflection, and the surface composition obtained from static secondary ion mass spectroscopy, are reported. This system is only weakly incompatible. The interaction of the components with substrate and air during phase separation leads to a bilayer formation with a broad polymer-polymer interface. PpMS segregates to the air interface. The bilayer structure is unstable and defines the starting point for the dewetting of PpMS on top of the dPS layer. In the final dewetting state a homogeneous layer of dPS on top of the substrate is covered with an ultrathin layer of PpMS as well as with quite thick mesoscopic drops of PpMS.","526":"Water solutions of ethyl(hydroxyethyl)cellulose have been investigated with the PFG NMR technique and by means of 1H NMR relaxation measurements. The echo decays in PFG experiments have been recorded for EHEC with concentrations ranging from the dilute (c &lt; c) to the semidilute (c &gt; c). In addition, the temperature dependence of the echo decay was investigated. It is shown that the echo decays deviate substantially from Gaussian diffusion behavior. We discuss this in terms of polydispersity, aggregation, and scaling effects. It is argued that the observed deviations are too large to be caused by polydispersity effects alone. We base this conclusion on the observation that the molar mass scaling of the polymer diffusion coefficient goes roughly as M-4. We focus on using a log-normal distribution of diffusion coefficients in the evaluation procedure of the PFG data. It is found that by comparing the diffusion coefficients extracted from this type of procedure with \"Dmean\" as extracted from a \"stretched exponential\" approach, there is a difference in the evaluated diffusion constant by up to 1 order of magnitude. The difference depends on the degree of deviation from linear behavior in the echo decay when represented in a logarithmic plot vs the relevant experimental parameter.","527":"Using a home-built Couette-type shear cell we studied the behavior of a concentrated solution of polystyrene in benzene-d6 under shear. Deuterium NMR revealed a shear-dependent splitting of the benzene-d6 signal, indicating partial orientation of the polystyrene due to shear forces. Our preliminary results show a linear relationship between the order parameter Szz of the benzene molecule and the shear rate gamma for the interval 0 s-1 &lt;\/= gamma &lt; 400 s-1.","528":"Addition of a relatively low-molecular-weight parent homopolymer to a lamellar AB diblock copolymer constitutes a reliable means by which to induce, in controllable fashion, transitions to other morphologies. In this study, we examine the effect of interfacial modification on such transitions in \"extended\" A(A\/B)B copolymer\/homopolymer blends in which (i) the A\/B midblock fraction (relative to the copolymer molecular weight) is varied from 0.0 to 0.4 in 0.1 increments and (ii) the overall concentration of A ranges from 0.50 to 0.95. As this A\/B fraction is increased at constant blend composition, the extent of homopolymer-induced lamellar swelling becomes measurably less pronounced, indicating that the A\/B midblock serves to delocalize repulsion along the interphase separating adjacent lamellae. At higher homopolymer concentrations, an increase in the A\/B fraction results in the formation of either unilamellar vesicles or a randomly connected bilayered membrane, rather than micelles. These membranes become unstable and transform to micelles at high copolymer dilution. The results presented here are discussed in terms of the complex morphologies observed in, and predicted for, low-molar-mass (co)surfactant systems.","529":"The properties of nanostructured plastics are determined by complex relationships between the type and size of the nanoreinforcement, the interface, and the chemical interaction between the nanoreinforcement and the polymeric chain, along with macroscopic processing and microstructural effects. Recently, families of mono- and difunctionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) macromers bearing epoxide groups have been developed. This paper presents an investigation of the thermal and viscoelastic property enhancements in commonly used model epoxy resins reinforced with monofunctional POSS-epoxy macromers. The glass transitions of these POSS-epoxy nanocomposites were studied using differential scanning calorimetry. Small-strain stress relaxations under uniaxial deformation were examined to provide insight into the time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of these nanocomposites. The POSS-epoxy macromers utilized in this study were monofunctional and hence occupied chain terminus points within the network. Nevertheless, they were effective at hindering the molecular motion of the epoxy network junctions. Thus the glass transition temperature, Tg, was observed to increase with increasing weight fraction of the monofunctional POSS-epoxy. The viscoelastic response at temperatures below Tg was examined and was found to correlate to a stretched exponential relaxation function. Time-aging time-superposition was found to be applicable to the data under all test conditions and for all of the materials used in this study. Surprisingly, the instantaneous modulus was not observed to be affected by incorporation of the POSS nanoreinforcement. This suggests that while POSS cages influence polymer chain motions, including the motion of the molecular junctions, these nanoreinforcements did not participate in the overall deformation of the chains. Experiments performed under identical thermodynamic states, revealed that the molecular level reinforcement provided by the POSS cages also retarded the physical aging process in the glassy state. Therefore, the time required to reach structural equilibrium was longer for samples reinforced with POSS-epoxy than for those of the neat resins.","530":null,"531":"X-ray photoelectron emission microscopy (X-PEEM) was used to study the surface orientation of stylized and rubbed polyimide thin films. Using soft X-rays produced by a synchrotron light source, this technique combines high spatial resolution imaging with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy to yield information on the surface orientation of the films. Stylizing is an ideal model of the rubbing process since the local stress acting on the polyimide to orient the molecules can be calculated. The minimum normal stress necessary to orient the surface of BPDA-PDA films was found to be 45 MPa much lower than the bulk yield stress of 200-300 MPa. Studies of the polyimide films oriented by the conventional rubbing method showed lateral inhomogeneities in the orientation of the polymer at the surface.","532":"A range of low-molecular-weight linear poly(ethylene oxide) chains with LiCF3SO3 have been examined via the transverse proton NMR relaxation. From the measured relaxation functions it is shown that the chains obey Rouse dynamics. This analysis gives the molecular weight of a Rouse statistical subunit and the fundamental Rouse relaxation time. It was found that varying the temperature and salt concentration had no effect on the size of a Rouse statistical segment and therefore none on the conformation of the chains. The temperature dependence of the fundamental Rouse relaxation time was found to be well modeled by the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher equation. The NMR-measured correlation times were then successfully used to predict the glass transition temperature as measured by DSC. The main conclusion of this paper is that under the addition of salt the ideal glass transition temperature T0 is found to remain constant or indeed to slightly decrease.","533":null,"534":null,"535":"We explore the interdiffusion of oppositely labeled triblock polystyrene chains, HDH\/DHD, during welding in the melt using dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy (DSIMS) and specular neutron reflectivity (SNR). The HDH chains have the central portion of the chain deuterated (D) approximately 50% while the two ends (H) each have approximately 25% protonation; the DHD is oppositely labeled, but each set of chains contains about 50% deuteration. During welding, the deuterium depth profile exhibits \"ripples\" whose characteristic features, such as the time and molecular weight dependent shape, amplitude, and position, are very sensitive to the microscopic details of the polymer dynamics. The ripple experiment is especially sensitive to the presence, or absence, of topological constraints and anisotropic motion of chains. The current work significantly extends the molecular weight range up to 400 000. This allows greater separation of the six key ripple features used in deciphering the correct polymer dynamics model at the polymer-polymer interface. The DSIMS and SNR experimental results are compared to theoretical predictions and ripple simulations for Rouse, polymer mode-coupling, reptation (with and without tube broadening), and other phenomenological dynamics models. The six ripple characteristics were found to be perfectly correlated and convincingly consistent with the predictions of the reptation dynamics model. The ripple results are in significant disagreement with the polymer mode-coupling model proposed by Schweizer and other tubeless models. We conclude that the reptation model, proposed by DeGennes in 1971 with parallel developments by Edwards, is the correct model to describe the dynamics of polymer interdiffusion.","536":"Compositional variation in blends of triblock and diblock copolymer films can be used to adjust the film response to a selective solvent. We investigated the relationship between blend composition and film structure in ordered films containing poly(styrene-b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-P2VP) diblocks and PS-P2VP-PS triblocks. The study focuses on films possessing a lamellar morphology. Methanol, a strongly selective solvent for P2VP, is used to swell the films. Since methanol solvates P2VP but not PS, periodic multilayer structures result in which solvent-rich P2VP domains are separated by undissolved PS domains. The film structure is characterized in the dry and swollen states with neutron reflectivity. Although the dry state morphology dimensions are practically identical for all samples, in the swollen state films richer in triblock swell less due to higher density of bridges interconnecting the PS domains. Furthermore, in swollen triblock-containing samples, polymer concentration variations in P2VP domains are suppressed and the PS domains are better aligned with respect to the substrate.","537":"Soluble, crystallizable cyano-substituted poly(2,5-dialkoxy-p-phenylene vinylene)s (RO-CNPPV)s having the alkoxy groups hexyloxy, octyloxy, and decyloxy were synthesized by use of the Knoevenagel-type condensation method and characterized by use of X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and UV-vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements. In the ordered phase, the polymers have a two-layer structure with side chain aligned in the all-trans conformation lying on the same plane of the coplanar main chains. However, the presence of the bulky cyano group on the vinylene segment leads to a deviation from coplanarity and poor stacking of the main chains and therefore the absence of vibronic transitions in the UV-vis and PL spectra (which usually appear in the PPV and RO-PPVs). In addition, as temperature increases, the extent of aromatic ring distortion increases gradually, causing a continuous increase in the d-spacing between two neighboring stacking subchains (dm), which increases up to 16% at the end of melting, but the side chain retains the same orientation and the d-spacing between two successive layers (ds) expands by only about 3%. This is opposite to that of poly(3-dodecylthiophene) having a vibronic transition, for which dm remains constant and ds increases by 22% mainly in the melting region. In the melting range, although the aromatic rings distort to a higher extent, and in the meantime the side chains become more coil-like and randomly oriented, both can recover to their original alignments after cooling down to below the melting region. In the entire thermal process, a significant thermochromism occurs with the optical absorption maximum shifting by 81 nm compared to that of poly(3-dodecylthiophene), 100 nm, while the emission maximum blue-shifts by 94 nm. As temperature rises well above Tm (by more than 40 degreesC), the aromatic rings distort to a high extent such that the side chains intermingle with each other, causing a strongly hindered relaxational motion of the main chains after the cooling. They can recover to their original state only by redissolving and then recasting. No liquid crystalline state in the RO-CNPPVs is observed.","538":"The orientation of the crystal stems in diblock copolymers, where crystallization occurs within the cylindrical microdomains present in the melt mesophase, is investigated via X-ray scattering on flow-aligned specimens. A series of ethylene-b-(3-methyl-1-butene) diblocks (E\/MB) is compared with an ethylene-b-(vinylcyclohexane) diblock (E\/VCH), where MB is rubbery (Tg &lt; Troom) and VCH is vitreous (Tg = 134 degreesC) at the freezing point of the E block. All of the diblocks contain 26-28 wt % E, leading to a morphology of hexagonally-packed E cylinders. Crystallization in all of these materials can be confined to the cylindrical microdomains. Not only do the crystals align preferentially within the semicrystalline cylinders, but this orientation varies depending on the ability of chains to diffuse during the crystallization process. When chain diffusion is most rapid, alignment is observed with the chain axis in the crystals perpendicular to the cylinder axis and the b axis (fast growth axis) coincident with the cylinder axis. However, when the chain mobility is limited, the crystal stems tilt with respect to a plane which is normal to the cylinder axis, allowing better accommodation of amorphous material at the crystallite surface.","539":"The phase behavior of blends of polymers and smectic-A liquid crystals (LCs) is investigated using Flory-Huggins and Maier-Saupe-McMillan theories. Various examples are considered to depict the effects of the architecture and the size of the polymer together with the nature of anisotropic ordering forces on the phase diagram. The strength of these forces is characterized by a parameter alpha which is directly related to the temperature of the smectic-nematic transition. Three cases are considered depending on the value of alpha, and the corresponding phase diagrams are constructed. Substantial differences are observed in these diagrams, and the reasons for these differences are discussed. A comparative study is performed between mixtures of polymers and LCs, where the polymer is made of linear and crosslinked chains. The LC consists either of molecules with nematic ordering only or of molecules presenting both nematic and smectic-A ordering. Blends where polymer matrices are cross-linked networks are also examined. Remarkable properties are found in the nature of the phase diagrams for such mixtures. In general, it is observed that the ordering forces favor unmixing with a stronger effect for the higher smectic-A ordering. Spinodal curves are also reported for these mixtures. The effects of fluctuations near the transition temperatures are briefly discussed.","540":"The evolution of polymolecular micelles formed by two different poly(2-vinylpyridine)-polystyrene (PVP-PS) block copolymers dissolved in toluene is studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The two PVP-PS diblock copolymers differ in composition, namely in the length of PVP block. Upon dissolution, a rapid formation of mixed polymolecular micelles takes place. As a result, the micellar size distribution observed is rather broad already at this initial stage. Due to the presence of two different diblock copolymers, the process of micellar growth involves not only the fusion of micelles but also the chain exchange between polymolecular micelles of different composition, which may slow the equilibration process. After a considerable aging time, the block copolymers seem to reach the equilibrium state, and an almost perfect bimodal size distribution is observed. According to the theoretical analysis given, both \"pure\" and \"mixed\" micelles constitute the micellar size distribution.","541":"We have studied the behavior of a liquid crystalline elastomer undergoing a polydomain-monodomain transition. The textures emerging under increasing extensional load have been examined with a combination of optical microscopy, X-ray, and small-angle polarized light scattering. The experimental data are interpreted in terms of reorientation of the local director with increasing extension. The results of this combination of techniques at low extensions are consistent with a two-dimensionally periodic director texture. The amplitude of this modulation decreases continuously as the mesogens are pulled into the extensional direction at high loads. In this manner the samples which are polydomain under no load become essentially monodomain with increasing extension.","542":"The segmental dynamics of solid-state poly(methylphenylsilane) were probed with deuterium solid-echo and two-dimensional exchange (2D-X) NMR via a methyl-d3 label. Between 25 and 50 degreesC, the spectra indicated that the polymer consisted of two fractions-a fast fraction with correlation times (tauc) below 10(-5) s and one with tauc's above 10 s. Above 50 degreesC, motion with tauc's around 10(-3) s was also detected. A minimization routine was developed to fit the 2D-X spectra to a model of isotropic rotational diffusion with a distribution of tauc's. The best fits were obtained with trimodal stretched-exponential distributions. The trimodal distributions consisted of a fast mode with tauc's around 10(-5) s, an intermediate mode with tauc's between 10(-4) and 0.3 s, and a slow mode with tauc's generally above 10 s. As the temperature increased from 56 to 90 degreesC, the fast fraction steadily increased from 21% to 50% while its average tauc remained around 10(-5) s; the intermediate fraction remained relatively constant at 23% while its average tauc decreased from 125 to 8 ms, and the rigid fraction decreased from 55% to 32% with an average tauc around 40 s. The fast fraction was attributed to amorphous segments, the rigid fraction to crystalline segments, and the intermediate fraction to segments that formed an interphase between the two.","543":null,"544":"In this paper we present the synthesis and characterization of a new light-emitting copolymer constituted of regularly alternating segments of 3,3'-didecyl-2,2'-bithiophene and 2,6-bis(1,3,4-oxadiazolyl)toluene, which are p-dopable and n-dopable, respectively. The new polymer emits intense green light under the irradiation of UV light in its film states and shows strong solvatochromism both on absorption and on emission. The n-doping potential of the polymer is measured to be similar with that of 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) and other reported oxadiazole-containing polymers, the currently excellent electron-transporting materials, while its p-doping potential is much lower than those of other oxadiazole-containing light-emitting polymers and is comparable with that of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) and polythiophenes (PT), the typical p-dope type materials. The presented synthesis reveals a possible approach to balance the rates of injection of electrons and holes from opposite contacts into an emissive layer in polymer light-emitting diodes by controlling the intrinsic properties of light-emitting materials.","545":"The self-assembly of ionically end-capped, symmetric polystyrene-polyisoprene diblock copolymers (PS-b-PI) has been studied. Structural data obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were correlated with the aggregation behavior of charged chain ends as evidenced by a spin probe using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The resulting mesomorphic structures were shown to be determined by the chain end topology, i.e., the site where the ionic chain end has been introduced chemically: For omega-functionalized diblock copolymers (monofunctional species) microphase separation is significantly stabilized due to the presence of ionic aggregates within the respective phase separated homopolymer domains. In contrast, for salt-free alpha,omega-macrozwitterionic diblock copolymers a marked perturbation of the block copolymer superstructure was found. In this case, the formation of a network of mixed ionic aggregates creates an additional microdomain interface by joining the chemically distinct blocks at their chain ends. The alteration of the degree of microphase separation as observed for the different functionalities can be attributed to conformational changes of the copolymer chain. Chain end association in the present system is reminiscent of certain covalently joined star and graft copolymers.","546":"Fluorescence techniques, including quenching and anisotropy measurements, have been used to study the photophysical behavior of the carbazole-based oligoethers poly{9-(2,3-epoxypropyl)carbazole}, PEPCz, and poly{1,2-epoxy-6-(9-carbazolyl)-4-oxahexane}, PECzOH, and their model compounds, in dilute fluid solutions in THF. These compounds show no evidence of excimer formation under these conditions and their fluorescences exhibit first-order decay behavior regardless of the degree of polymerization of the oligomer. Both steady-state and time-resolved anisotropy measurements upon dilute, glassy solutions show that intramolecular energy migration occurs in the oligomers. Fluorescence quenching experiments, using both dimethylterephthalate and oxygen as quenchers, produced evidence which supports the supposition that in the absence of excimer trapping sites, intramolecular energy migration will be encouraged in dilute fluid solutions of the oligoethers. Unfortunately, the fluorescence quenching data did not permit evaluation of the extents of energy migration in the various polymers or the relative efficiencies with which migration occurs in the two different types of oligoether. This limitation would appear to be a general feature of fluorescence quenching measurements, despite their frequent adoption, in the past, in studies of energy migration in polymers.","547":"The heterogeneous free-radical grafting of maleic anhydride (MAH) onto poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP) was studied using supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent\/swellant. The anhydride content in the product can be controlled by using variations in time and temperature to achieve maleations as high as 7 mol % at 125 degreesC after a 5 h reaction period. A comparison between benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) initiators indicates that DCP is the more effective initiator. The effect of reactant concentrations on the degree of grafting is also examined, yielding an optimum MAH:DCP molar ratio of 3:2. Competitive cross-linking of the substrate is the major drawback to this means of polymer modification.","548":"Poly(arylazophosphonate)s are synthesized from bifunctional diazonium salts and bifunctional phosphoric diesters by interfacial polycondensation at the interface water\/organic solvent. The azo unit is formed via N-P coupling during the polycondensation reaction in satisfying yield and selectivity. Fifteen new polymers were synthesized and characterized by common methods such as 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR, FTIR, UV\/visible spectroscopy, and DSC and GPC measurements. According to first laser ablation experiments as well as film forming properties and thermal and photochemical behavior, poly(arylazophosphonate)s seem to be suitable materials for ablation with XeCl excimer lasers.","549":"A commercially available spin-on-glass material, hydrogen silsesquioxane, has been rendered photopatternable to micrometer dimensions by the introduction of a photobase generator at concentrations of &lt;5 wt %. The cure process proceeds via hydrolysis of the silyl hydride linkage by residual water in the film, as activated by a photogenerated base catalyst. Subsequent reaction of the generated silanol with neighboring silyl hydride groups yields a thermally stable siloxane cross-link. The photochemical cross-linking of hydrogen silsesquioxane shows high sensitivity (&lt;40 mJ\/cm2) and is not inhibited by molecular oxygen. The resultant oxide films can be further cured at elevated temperature either under an inert atmosphere to minimize the dielectric constant or heated in an air atmosphere to complete the conversion to silica glass. The oxidative nature of both the photo and thermal cure processes and the release of only traces of hydrogen as byproduct results in minimal weight loss in the film during processing.","550":"Supercritical fluid (SCF) carbon dioxide processing has been studied as a new route to polymer surface modification. Three fluoropolymer substrates were studied: poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PCTFE) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP) using a two-step modification procedure. In the first step, blends or semiinterpenetrating networks were prepared by carrying out a free radical polymerization of styrene (or styrene with divinylbenzene or triallyl cyanurate) within the SCF-swollen polymer substrate. The second step involved sulfonating the polystyrene using heterogeneous (solution-solid) sulfonation conditions. Composition of the surfaces was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and wettability was assessed using water contact angle measurements. Depressed advancing and receding contact angles indicate increased wettability of all of the fluoropolymer samples.","551":"Preparation of cyclic oligomeric alkylene phthalates via pseudo-high dilution condensation of alkylene diols with iso- and terephthaloyl chlorides and conversion to high molecular weight polyesters via ring-opening polymerization is described. Sterically unhindered amines such as quinuclidine or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) catalyze the condensation significantly faster than other tertiary amines and are useful for carrying out this conversion in high yield, in the first direct reaction of diol and diacid chloride to form cyclic polyesters. The mixtures of oligomeric cyclics melt at 150-200 degrees C, providing liquids of low viscosity. Ring-opening polymerization using tin or titanate catalysts affords high molecular weight polymers within minutes. Complete polymerization of PBT oligomeric cyclics can be achieved at 180-200 degreesC, significantly below the polymer's melting point of 225 degreesC, and with molecular weights as high as 445 x 10(3). Polymers formed via such a process are more crystalline than conventionally prepared polyesters.","552":"5,5'-Bis(4-aminophenyl)-2,2'-bifuryl (PFDA) with a well-defined conjugation length was synthesized, and its soluble poly(amic acid) was prepared by polycondensation with pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA). The PMDA-PFDA polyimide films were obtained from the poly(amic acid) solution through a conventional spin-casting, baking, and thermal imidization process. The PFDA monomer exhibits intense blue photoluminescence with a maximum at 442 nm in a high quantum yield of 0.92, whereas its polyimide film also emits intense blue photoluminescence with double peak maxima at 419 and 436 nm. The polyimide is insoluble in common organic solvents and thermally stable up to 370 degreesC. Overall, the PMDA-PFDA polyimide can be considered to be a potential candidate material for fabricating optoelectronic devices that emit blue light.","553":"The reactivities of cis and trans isomers of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1,2-DCH)\/epoxy resin were studied separately. We found that the primary amine hydrogen disappears in both isomers at a similar rate when they react with an epoxy resin. However, the formation of tertiary amines differs considerably. The reactivity of the second amine hydrogen for the trans isomer is greater than that for the cis isomer, and this difference is observed as the reaction proceeds. The main reason for the slower disappearance of the cis secondary amine is steric hindrance and this fact is observed in the preexponential factors, glass transition temperatures (Tg), and ratio of rate constants of secondary to primary amine (R). The reaction was followed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the near-infrared range. The values of Tg were obtained by differential scanning calorimetry.","554":"Regioselective introduction of alpha-mannoside branches at C-6 of chitin and chitosan has been accomplished by a series of regioselective modification reactions starting from N-phthaloyl-chitosan as a key precursor. Glycosylation of the derived acceptor with reactive groups only at C-6 with an ortho ester of d-mannose proceeded smoothly in dichloromethane in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, and the degree of branching was up to 0.6. Full deprotection gave chitosans with alpha-mannoside branches, which were subsequently transformed into the corresponding branched chitins by N-acetylation. The resulting branched polysaccharides showed a remarkable solubility in neutral water in sharp contrast to the insoluble linear chitin and chitosan. Concanavalin A exhibited a specific affinity for these products, which was ascribable to the presence of alpha-mannoside groups. Though nonnatural, the branched chitins were susceptible to lysozyme, and the enzymatic degradation was heavily dependent on the extent of branching. Furthermore, the branched chitosan exhibited considerable antimicrobial activity.","555":"Production of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates), PHAs, by Pseudomonas oleovorans (P. oleovorans) and Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) grown with mixtures of nonanoic acid, NA, and 10-undecynoic acid, 10-UND( identical with), were investigated. Both microorganisms produced PHAs containing carbon-carbon triple bonds in fractions from 0 to 100%, depending on the composition of the carbon substrate mixture. The amounts of unsaturated repeating units in PHAs produced by P. oleovorans were higher than those in PHAs produced by P. putida grown with the same carbon substrates. The repeating units containing carbon-carbon triple bonds were 3-hydroxy-8-nonynoate, 3HN(&amp;tbd1;), and 3-hydroxy-10-undecynoate, 3HUD(&amp;tbd1;). 3HN(&amp;tbd1;) was the major repeating unit formed from 10-UND(&amp;tbd1;). The relative amounts of 3HN(&amp;tbd1;) and 3HUD(&amp;tbd1;) in PHAs produced by P. putida were slightly different from those in PHAs produced by P. oleovorans. The number average molecular weights of PHAs produced in this study were approximately 50 000, and polydispersity indices were approximately 2.5 as determined by gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight distribution and the relative amounts of 3HN(&amp;tbd1;) and 3HUD(&amp;tbd1;) were not affected by either growth time or the composition of the carbon substrate. PHAs bearing triple bonds were soft and differential scanning calorimetry thermograms of these polymers showed very small melting endotherms at approximately 60 degreesC. The glass transition temperatures were in the range of -33 to -21 degreesC.","556":"A tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of the living poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (poly(GMA)) was prepared by the living anionic polymerization of GMA, using 1,1-diphenylhexyllithium (DPHL) as initiator, in the presence of LiCl ([LiCl]\/[DPHL]0 = 3), at -45 degreesC. Upon introduction of a benzene solution of living polystyrene (poly(St)) into the above system at -30 degreesC, a very rapid coupling reaction between the epoxy groups of the living poly(GMA) and the propagating sites of the living poly(St) generated a graft copolymer containing a polar backbone and nonpolar side chains. When benzene solutions of living poly(St) and polyisoprene were sequentially transferred to the THF solution of living poly(GMA), a graft copolymer possessing two different nonpolar side chains was obtained. Further, a THF solution of the living block copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and GMA was prepared by the sequential anionic polymerization of the two monomers, at low temperatures. A block-graft copolymer having a poly(MMA-b-GMA) block backbone and poly(St) side chains was synthesized by reacting the living poly(St) with the epoxy groups of the above living block copolymer. In addition, when the poly(GMA) segment in poly(MMA-b-GMA) was short, a star-shaped copolymer containing a poly(MMA) arm and several poly(St) arms was obtained. GPC and 1H NMR measurements indicated that all the above copolymers possess high purity, designed molecular architectures, controlled molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw\/Mn = 1.10-1.23).","557":"Poly(ester-alt-sulfide) (polymer 1) was synthesized by the alternating copolymerization of glycidyl phenyl ether (GPE) with gamma-thiobutyrolactone (TBL) catalyzed by either quaternary onium salts or crown ether complexes. The copolymerization proceeded to produce polymer 1 with good yields in neat or in various organic solvents at 30-120 degreesC, in which quaternary onium salts having Cl- as a counteranion such as tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) had higher activity than quaternary onium salts such as tetrabutylammonium bromide having Br- as a counteranion. It was also found that the alternate copolymer (polymer 1) of GPE with TBL was obtained selectively under different feed ratios of GPE and TBL, although ring-opening homopolymerizations of GPE and TBL did not proceed. Copolymerizations of various oxiranes such as butyl glycidyl ether, styrene oxide, and 1,2-hexene oxide with TBL catalyzed by TBAC also proceeded, and the corresponding poly(ester-alt-sulfide)s (polymers 2, 3, and 4) were obtained under the same conditions as for the synthesis of polymer 1.","558":"Water soluble copolypeptides containing l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and l-lysine were prepared by ring-opening polymerization of alpha-amino acid N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. We have prepared a range of different copolymers to probe the effects of functional group composition on adhesive and cross-linking behavior. Aqueous solutions of these copolymers, when mixed with a suitable oxidizing agent (e.g., O2, mushroom tyrosinase, Fe3+, H2O2, or IO4-), formed cross-linked networks that were found to form moisture-resistant adhesive bonds to a variety of substrates (e.g., aluminum, steel, glass, and plastics). It was found that successful adhesive formation was dependent on oxidation conditions, with chemical oxidants giving the best results. Optimized systems were found to form adhesive bonds that rival in strength those formed by natural marine adhesive proteins. Our synthetic systems are readily prepared in large quantities and require no enzymes or other biological components.","559":"The effect of magnetic fields on the orientation and properties of 4,4'-bis(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-alpha-methylstilbene cured with sulfanilamide has been studied. This epoxy system is initially isotropic and forms a smectic A phase upon curing. A magnetic field was applied during the cure reaction, resulting in alignment of the molecules along the direction of the applied field. Measurement of the orientation parameter of the fully cured material by wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) showed that orientation improved with an increase in field strength. The orientation parameters of the smectic layer normals calculated from the inner reflection of the WAXS pattern attained a maximum level of approximately 0.8 at a field strength of approximately 12 T. The orientation parameters calculated from the outer reflection of the WAXS pattern were considerably lower, possibly due to the presence of amorphous regions associated with domain boundaries or the loss of molecular alignment within the smectic layers due to topological restrictions of the cross-linking sites. Orientation resulted in an anisotropic linear thermal expansion coefficient after curing, although the overall volumetric expansion was constant. The elastic tensile modulus increased with the square of the orientation parameter, attaining a maximum value of 8.1 GPa, compared to 3.1 GPa for the unoriented material. The change in modulus with orientation could be fit with a simple model for the modulus of anisotropic materials.","560":"A new effective constrained geometry catalyst precursor for the ethylene\/1-octene copolymerization, namely 2-methylbenz[e]indenylamido complex [eta5:eta1-(2-MeBenzInd)SiMe2NtBu]TiCl2 (4), was synthesized. Activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO), the complex 4 showed (a) an improved copolymerization activity and stability, (b) an enhanced comonomer incorporation in the copolymer, and (c) most importantly, an increased copolymer molecular weight, when compared with the previously employed catalysts. The polymerization conditions were found to have a significant effect on the catalyst activity, 1-octene incorporation, molecular weight, and even copolymer microstructure. For the copolymerization parameters, the values rE approximately 2.20 for ethylene and rO approximately 0.55 for 1-octene with rE.rO approximately 1.21 were obtained, reflecting a pronounced tendency for the random distribution of the comonomers in the copolymer chain. The 13C NMR analysis revealed that the E-O copolymer generated by the MAO-activated complex 4 has a regioirregular arrangement of the 1-octene repeat units as a result of some tail-to-tail incorporation of the 1-octene comonomer.","561":"The effects of copper(I) and copper(II) metal centers on the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene and methyl acrylate were investigated. The free-radical polymerizations were initiated by AIBN in the presence of copper(I) and copper(II) complexes. For methyl acrylate, the rate of the polymerization was reduced in the presence of CuIBr\/dNbpy and CuIOTf\/dTbpy but was unaffected by the presence of CuII(OTf)2\/dTbpy. For styrene, under conditions which yield relatively low molecular weight polymer (16 000), no effect was observed in the presence of CuII(OTf)2\/dNbpy; however, under conditions which yield high molecular weight polystyrene (50 000-100 000), the polymerization was limited in the molecular weight attainable and stopped at partial conversion. No effect was observed for the free-radical polymerization of styrene in the presence of copper(I) complexes. These results indicate that control in ATRP does not originate in interactions of growing radicals with copper complexes but in the reversible halogen atom transfer.","562":"Copper-catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is one of the most robust and precise techniques for controlling radical polymerization. The very good control of molecular weights, polydispersities, functionalities, chain composition, and topologies unusual for radical systems combined with the application of transition metals as catalysts requires more detailed mechanistic studies and proof of the radical nature of active species. The following results are in agreement with the radical nature of ATRP: reverse ATRP, chemoselectivities similar to those for conventional radical polymerization (effect of additives and inhibitors\/scavengers, reactivity ratios, transfer coefficients), regioselectivities similar to those for conventional radical polymerization (low proportion of head-to-head units and expected structure of both tail and head end groups), stereoselectivities (tacticities) similar to that in conventional radical polymerization, EPR detection of X-Mtn+1 species resulting from the persistent radical effect, and confirmation of the termination by doubling molecular weights as well as cross-linking with multifunctional initiators and inimers. In addition, it seems that, in most ATRP systems, the contribution of degenerative transfer and reversible formation of organometallic intermediates is small and a halogen atom is transferred in the concerted process rather than in a two-step process with the involvement of radical anions.","563":"119Sn NMR spectroscopy was employed for analysis of the interaction and reaction of SnCl4 with the HCl-IBVE adduct [1; CH3CHCl(OiBu)] in the presence of nBu4NCl in CH2Cl2 solution at -78 degreesC, which are model reactions for the living cationic polymerization of isobutyl vinyl ether (IBVE). The addition of 1 to an SnCl4 solution led to upfield shifts of the tin nucleus as the 1\/SnCl4 mole ratio (&lt;1) increases, which indicates the formation of SnCl5-, via the interaction between SnCl4 and the chlorine atom in 1. On further addition of 1, the pentacoordinated anion is converted into the hexacoordinated SnCl62-. These tin species are in fast equilibrium among each other, and the 119Sn NMR analyses support the formation of a carbocation [2; CH3CH+(OiBu)] from 1 and the dynamic equilibrium between 1 and 2. More effective chloride-anion donors such as nBu4NCl and Ph3CCl can quantitatively convert SnCl4 into SnCl5-, and then into SnCl62-. Thus under the conditions where living cationic IBVE polymerization proceeds (1 &lt; nBu4NCl\/SnCl4 &lt; 2), SnCl4 is fully converted into a weaker Lewis acid, SnCl5-, with the aid of added nBu4NCl. The suppression of the carbocationic species in the living system has thus been found due to the interaction between the added salt and SnCl4.","564":"Copolymers containing acrylonitrile (A) and glycidyl methacrylate (G) units of different compositions were synthesized by free radical solution polymerization. The reactivity ratios were estimated by Kelen Tudos and nonlinear error in variable methods. The triad sequence distributions in terms of A- and G-centered triads have been obtained from 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. The complete spectral assignments in terms of compositional and configurational sequences of the overlapping carbon and proton spectra of these copolymers were done with the help of distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT), two-dimensional proton-detected heteronuclear correlation (inverse-HETCOR), and total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments. The Monte Carlo simulation was used to study the effect of the fractional conversion on the triad fractions.","565":"The n-butyllithium (n-BuLi)\/N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) system (with the molar ratio of TMEDA to n-BuLi higher than 4\/4) has been found to polymerize 1,3-cyclohexadiene to produce \"living\" polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution with well-controlled polymer chain length. The rate of polymerization and polymer yield increased with increasing of the ratio of TMEDA to n-BuLi. The molecular weight distribution of obtained polymers became narrower with the ratio of TMEDA to n-BuLi. The formation of benzene generated by termination reaction was found to decrease with the ratio of TMEDA to n-BuLi. In contrast to 1,3-cyclohexadiene, low yield and broad molecular weight distribution were observed in the polymerization of 1,3-hexadiene and 2,4-hexadiene initiated by the n-BuLi\/TMEDA (4\/5) system. The microstructure of poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) was determined by 2D-NMR. A high content of 1,2-units was found in the polymerization initiated by the alkyllithium\/TMEDA system, while the high content of 1,4-units was observed in the cases of alkyllithium or alkyllithium\/1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane system. The 7Li NMR signals of the n-BuLi\/TMEDA systems and poly(1,3-cyclohexadienyl)lithium \/TMEDA were in higher magnetic field than the signals of n-BuLi and poly(1,3-cyclohexadienyl)lithium, respectively, indicating the disaggregation of the lithium species.","566":"The molecular weights of ethene-norbornene copolymers, produced with various metallocene- and amidocyclopentadienyl-methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalysts, have been determined by high-temperature gel-permeation chromatography: with one exception, increasing molecular weights were found with an increasing norbornene content in the copolymer. This observation is due to the fact that the beta-hydride elimination process is not possible in the case of norbornene, because of special steric conditions of the cis-2,3-exo inserted norbornene; other possible termination reactions are discussed, considering the specialties of the norbornene. The effect of the catalyst structure on the molecular weights is discussed in terms of steric and electronic factors of the different ligands: sterically less hindered ligands produce ethene-norbornene copolymers with relatively low molecular weights; ligands with a larger extension and electron-pushing effect such as the fluorenyl ligand, induced the formation of high molecular weights. Additional alkyl groups at the indenyl or fluorenyl ligand increased the molecular weights additionally.","567":"The copolymerization parameters of the ethene-norbornene copolymerization using various metallocene and half-sandwich catalysts were determined on the basis of composition data with linear graphical methods: Aside from r1 and r2, values for r11 and r21 could be determined in the case of alternating copolymerizations. In this connection, r21 differs significantly from catalyst to catalyst and reflects the different tendency of each catalyst to produce copolymers with an alternating monomer sequence. The maximum norbornene contents in the copolymer could be achieved by use of sterically less hindered metallocene catalysts. As an exception to this, the half-sandwich catalysts produced copolymers with surprisingly low norbornene contents.","568":"The kinetics of ethene-norbornene copolymerizations using the metallocenes iPr[(3-R-Cp)Ind]ZrCl2 (with R = methyl or tert-butyl), MeCH[Cp]2ZrCl2, iPr[(3-R-Cp)Flu]ZrCl2 (with R = H, methyl, isopropyl, or tert-butyl), and Me2Si[(3-tert-butyl-Cp)Flu]ZrCl2 and half-sandwich catalysts Me2Si[Me4CpNtBu]TiCl2, Me2Si[Me4CpNtBu]ZrCl2, Me2Si[FluNtBu]ZrCl2, R-(+)-Me2Si[Me4CpNCH(CH3)-1-naphthyl]TiCl2, and C2H4[Me4CpNMe2]Cr(eta1,eta1-C4H8) together with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst, have been investigated at 70 degreesC in a concentrated solution of norbornene in toluene and under an ethene pressure ranging from 4 to 60 bar (58-870 psi). The ethene reaction rates were measured during the copolymerization process at various ethene concentrations and the ethene reaction orders were determined. In some cases fractional ethene reaction orders higher than 1 were found, indicating a complex mechanism. The microstructure of the copolymers were analyzed by 13C NMR spectroscopy. The highest norbornene contents were achieved using metallocenes with sterically less demanding ligands such as MeCH[Cp]2ZrCl2. Unexpectedly, low norbornene contents (&lt;50 mol %) were achieved with the half-sandwich catalysts. Depending on the catalyst structure, the microstructure of the copolymers consists of mainly isolated norbornene units, alternating monomer sequences or short norbornene microblocks with a maximum length of two or three. Additionally, the tacticity of the norbornene microblocks could be controlled by the catalyst structure. A mechanistic model, based on chain migratory insertion, is presented to explain the different copolymer structures through nonbonding steric interactions between monomer, growing polymer chain, and ligand system. On the basis of this model, penultimate effects (Markov statistic second order) caused by the last two inserted monomer units can be assumed.","569":"The kinetics of the ethene-norbornene copolymerization using the [(isopropylidene)(eta5-inden-1-ylidene-eta5-cyclopentadienyl)]zirconium dichloride (iPr[IndCp]ZrCl2)\/methylaluminoxane catalyst has been investigated at 70 degreesC in a concentrated solution of norbornene in toluene and an ethene pressure ranging from 4 to 60 bar (58-870 psi). The ethene reaction rate has been measured during the copolymerization process at varying reactant concentrations. The reaction orders and rate constants were determined and compared to the corresponding values of the ethene and norbornene homopolymerizations. It was found that kEhomo &gt; kEco and kNhomo &lt; kNco. The copolymerization parameters are r1 = 0.9 and r2 = 0.05.","570":null,"571":"Mucus plays an exceptionally wide range of important biological roles.  It operates as a protective, exchange, and transport medium in the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems of humans and other vertebrates.  Mucus is a polymer hydrogel.  It is secreted as discrete packages (secretory granules) by specialized secretory cells.  Mucus hydrogel is stored in a condensed state inside the secretory granules.  Depending upon the architecture of their constituent macromolecules and on the composition of the solvent, polymer gels can form liquid crystalline microstructures, with orientational order being exhibited over optically resolvable distances.  Individual mucin molecules consist of alternating rigid segments (heavily glycosylated; hydrophilic) and flexible segments (nonglycosylated; hydrophobic).  Polymer molecules consisting of rigid units linked by flexible spacers are frequently associated with liquid crystalline behavior, which again raises the possibility that mucus could form anisotropic fluid phases.  Suggestions that mucins may be self-associating in dilute solution have previously been challenged on the basis of sedimentation-equilibrium studies performed on mucus in which potential sites of association were competitively blocked with inhibitors.  However, the formation of stable liquid crystalline phases does not depend on the existence of inter- or intramolecular associations; these phases can form on the basis of steric considerations alone.","572":"The x-ray structures of 20 proteins have been examined and each of the residues in these proteins was assigned to the inside or outside of the molecules and to a conformational state. The data obtained confirm that polar groups are generally found on the outside of proteins and nonpolar residues are generally found on the inside. Seven of the amino acids (Ala, Arg, Cys, His, Pro, Ser, Tyr) have inside\/outside preferences which are not consistent with their usual assignment as either polar or nonpolar residues; explanations are given for these apparent inconsistencies. Of the three types of backbone structure considered here (extended, alpha helix, and nonregular), extended structures have the greatest preference for the inside of proteins, and nonregular structures have the greatest preference for the outside. It is suggested that differences in entropy play an important part in the inside\/outside preferences of backbone structures. There are generally significant changes in the conformational preferences of the residues in going from the inside to the outside of proteins; environmental (rather than local) solute-solvent interactions seem to be the predominant cause of these changes in conformational preferences.","573":"In agreement with earlier observations that the angular dependence of light scattering by fibrin gels obeys the theory for light scattering by very long and thin rigid rodlike particles (intensity proportional to the square of half the scattering angle), we find that the turbidity, tau, of the less opaque gels varies as the inverse third power of the wavelength, lambda. Mass-length ratios of the fibers calculated from these two measurements closely agree. For fibrin gels containing fibers with a very high mass-length ratio (of which we had not been able to obtain interpretable scattering data), the turbidity is found not quite to vary as 1\/lambda3. For these opaque gels, the fiber diameter is no longer negligible with respect to the wavelength. It is shown how the radius of gyration of the fiber cross section (and therefore the radius of cylindrical fibers) can be obtained from the ratio of slope and intercept of a plot of 1\/tau lambda3 vs. 1\/lambra2. The square of the radius of the fibers is found to be proportional to the mass-length ratio. The density of the fibers is calculated to be 0.28. This corresponds to a ratio of fiber volume to volume of protein contained in the fiber of 5.0.","574":"Four series of model molecules, each of which contains a coil section and one or two sections of fixed ordered backbone structure, have been examined to locate their low-energy conformations in water. The four series are: helix-coil, helix-coil-helix, extended-coil, and extended-coil-extended. In each series, the length of the coil is allowed to vary from four to ten residues, while the nuclei (ordered backbone structures) are held fixed at six residues. By comparing these molecules, it is observed that the low-energy conformations of those containing two nuclei can be regarded as being derived from low-energy conformations of molecules containing one nucleus. This suggests that folding of proteins containing preformed nuclei proceeds through interactions between the nuclei and adjacent non-regular sections of the chain rather than between nuclei. It is also observed that helices are better promoters of globularity than extended strands. These results are compared with those from recent studies of various aspects of protein folding.","575":"The title flavin rapidly oxidizes NADH, the observed enhancement being of 460--4650-fold compared with 3-methyltetra-O-acetylriboflavin. Analysis of the kinetic data at 30 degrees C established that the reaction proceeds according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low ionic strength (mu = 0.02: Km = ca. 10(-5) M, kact. = 0.06-0.37 s-1) and according to the simple second-order kinetics at high ionic strength (mu = 0.3), the largest rate difference being 342-fold. On the other hand, the oxidation of 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide, a NADH model compound, was not accelerated by the use of the title flavin. It is concluded, therefore, that the formation of the polymeric flavin-NADH complexes due to the electrostatic interaction is responsible for the marked rate enhancement. This is the first example that the oxidation of NADH is facilitated in the nonenzymatic system.","576":"","577":"The occurrence of the oxy analogue in the trans-II 4 leads to 1 intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded nonhelical peptide conformation, recently proposed for t-BOC-L-Pro-Gly-OH in the solid state on the basis of infrared absorption evidence, has been disproved by x-ray diffraction analysis. This type of folding is also absent in polar solvents. However, in solvents of low polarity the presence of this folded form cannot be excluded.","578":"","579":"Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were studied for monodisperse L-alanine oligopeptides (the dimer, trimer, tetramer, and nonamer) containing an n-butylamide group at the C-terminal residue and for the random and block copolymers of D- and L-alanines having sharp molecular weight distributions in dichloroacetic acid (DCA). It was found that the NH signals of poly(L-alanine)s and some copoly(D,L-alanine)s were split into three peaks in DCA, suggesting that these NH peaks reflect the conformation of the polymers. These NH peaks were assigned to the terminal helix (helix-coil junction) and the random-coil and the inner helix, respectively, from the lowest field. On the basis of the above assignment, the microconformations of polycalanine)s in DCA were examined quantitatively. Moreover, it was concluded from the specific nature of the solvent that both the effects of the hydrophobic side chains of the polymers and the acidity of the solvent are most important for the formation of the helical conformation of poly(L-alanine).","580":"Carbon-13 NMR spectra of alpha single-helical and pipiDL double-helical conformations of alternating poly (gamma-benzyl D-L-glutamate) are presented. In both cases, the existence of doublet for the backbone carbon atoms is consistent with D and L residues being in different conformational states when engaged in the same helix. The resonances of the Calpha atoms in both helices, which are found at identical chemical shifts, and comparison with the 1H NMR observation, favor the hypotheses that solvent molecules are located inside the helical core of the double helices.","581":"Conformational energy calculations are reported for a number of possible helical structures of poly(D-L-peptides): the alpha helix, two single-stranded piDL, and five double-stranded pipiDL helices. For a poly(D-alanine-L-alanine) sequence, the energies of the various helices are found to differ by less than 1 kcal\/(mol residue). For some helices (especially the piDL ones) two structural variants are predicted. These variants, called \"goniomers\", are characterized by reversed sequences of conformational angles but have the same screw sense and similar helical parameters. A biological implication of these goniomers is suggested, and their usefulness as a critical test for energy calculations is considered.","582":"The synthesis and characterization of water-soluble random copolymers containing L-aspartic acid with N5-(4-hydroxybutyl)-l-glutamine, and the thermally induced helix-coil transitions of these copolymers in water and in 0.1 N KCl, are described. The incorporation of L-aspartic acid was found to decrease the helix content of the polymer at both high and low pH, in water and also in 0.1 N KCl. The Zimm-Bragg parameters sigma and s for the helix-coil transition in poly(L-aspartic acid) in water and in 0.1 N KCl were deduced from an analysis of the melting curves of the copolymers in the manner described in earlier papers. Corrections were made for the presence of a small amount of racemized aspartic acid, using data from random copolymers containing D-aspartic acid as the guest residue. The computed values of s indicate that L-aspartic acid destabilizes helical sequences at all temperatures in the range of 0-70 degrees C. Titrations of the copolymers and of N-acetyl-N'-methyl-L-aspartic acid amide in 0.1 N KCl are described.","583":"Water-soluble copolymers containing L-arginine and N5-(4-hydroxybutyl)-L-glutamine were prepared by copolymerization of the N-carboxy-alpha-amino acid anhydrides of Ndelta-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-ornithine and gamma-benzyl L-glutamate, followed by aminolysis with 4-amino-1-butanol, by removal of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group, and by treatment with O-methylisourea. The copolymers were fractionated and characterized, and the thermally induced helix-coil transitions of these copolymers were studied in water at neutral pH in the presence and in the absence of KCl. The Zimm-Bragg parameters sigma and s for the helix-coil transition in poly(L-arginine) in aqueous solution were deduced from an analysis of the melting curves of the copolymers in the manner described in earlier papers. The computed values of s indicate that L-arginine is a weak helix-making residue at low temperature and a weak helix-breaking residue at high temperature in aqueous solution. The results were found to be in good agreement with those obtained earlier in conformational analyses of arginyl residues in proteins.","584":"The storage and loss shear moduli, G' and G'', have been measured for dilute solutions of paramyosin from the clam Mercenaria mercenaria in water and glycerol--water mixtures containing potassium chloride and phosphate buffer. The Birnboim--Schrag multiple-lumped resonator was used in the frequency range from 150 to 8100 Hz; the concentration range was 0.7 to 2 X 10(-3) g\/mL and the temperature range was 0.0 to 6.0 degrees C. The intrinsic moduli were obtained by extrapolation to infinite dilution. When compared with predictions of Yamakawa for a rigid cylindrical molecule, they agreed at low frequencies but diverged at high frequencies. Excellent agreement was obtained with calculations for a hybrid model whose relaxation times are attributed to rigid-body end-over-end rotation together with some internal modes of motion, probably flexural. The rotational relaxation time agreed rather well with that determined by DeLaney and Krause from electrical birefringence measurements. From the ratio of the rotational to the longest flexural relaxation time, the flexural rigidity and Young's modulus of the paramyosin molecule were estimated by relations derived by Wada and collaborators; the modulus was 1.2 X 10(10) dyn\/cm2.","585":"Known structural principles (close packing, maximum hydrogen bonding, the tendency of like groups to be surrounded in like manner, and the approximate constancy of interatomic distances and bond angles) are used, with meridional and equatorial x-ray data, to deduce and check the structure pattern for alpha-keratin. Internally hydrogen-bonded polypeptide helices are grouped into \"3-stacks\", in which each chain is rotated and shifted vertically a distance equal to the helix pitch (5.15 A, average), relative to the other two. This shift accounts simply for the meridional x-ray reflection at this spacing. The 3-stack structure repeats after three turns, except for differences in the R groups and a slight twist, required to give satisfaction of both intrachain and interchain forces. The 3-stacks are grouped into 9-stacks and these into 27-stacks (all twisting), giving a crystallographic unit containing 81 chains, with the chain axes spaced approximately like those of close-packed cylinders. When the twisting reaches the limit of stability for good interchain contacting and cross-linking, the residue\/turn ratio in each chain helix shifts to another, with twisting in the opposite direction. The twisting reversal mechanism keeps all the helix axes approximately straight, parallel, and in a close-packed arrangement. Interchain distances and orientations are suitable for cystine cross-linking. The dimensions of the 27-stacks agree well with estimates of the \"effective radius\" of microfibrils. X-ray measurements of spacing changes during fiber extension are explained as due to alternation of zones with much cross-linking and zones with few cross-links.","586":"Starting with a force field transferred from our earlier studies on beta-polypeptides, we have calculated the optically active normal vibration frequencies of alpha-helical poly(L-alanine) and poly(L-alanine-N-d). The 47\/13 helical structure was used, and all atoms were included. Only small modifications to the force field were required, and most of these could be justified. The analysis indicates that amide II' is in Fermi resonance with one component of CH3 asymmetric bend, thus leading to a small modification of C-N and C=O stretching force constants. The agreement between calculated and observed Raman and infrared bands is quite good. This has encouraged ls to calculate the influence of small structural changes on the spectrum as a means of explaining the observed effects of temperature changes.","587":"Helix--coil transitions of an alternating copolypeptide poly(gamma-benzyl epsilon-carbobenzoxy-L-lysyl-L-glutamate) (poly[Lys(Z)-Glu(OBzl)]) in binary mixtures of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) and ethylene dichloride (EDC) were investigated by optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). The ORD data obtained were analyzed to evaluate the equilibrium constant s for helix formation and the cooperativity parameter sigma. The values of sigma1\/2 are substantially independent of temperature and solvent composition, yielding 0.4 X 10(-2) on the average. The transition enthalpy deltaHc at the transition point decreases from 291 to 154 cal mol-1 as the DCA content is increased from 56 to 64 vol%. At about 20 degrees C and at 58 vol% DCA, poly[Lys(Z)-Glu(OBzl)] in binary mixtures of DCA and EDC undergoes a solvent-induced transition. This DCA content is intermediate between those for poly(gamma-benzyl L-glutamate) and poly(epsilon-carbobenzoxy-L-lysine) in the same binary solvent and close to that of an equimolar random copolymer of the two peptides. However, the s of poly[Lys(Z)-Glu(OBzl)] is not a geometrical mean of those of the parent homopolypeptides. This fact suggests that the helical conformation of the copolypeptide is stabilized by a conformational induction operative between adjacent residues.","588":"","589":"Models for active transport are prepared by the covalent bonding of molecules containing a catalytic site to the membrane asymmetrically with respect to its thickness. The membrane separates two compartments of unequal volume, both initially containing reactant at the same concentration. We observed the time dependence of the reactant and product concentrations, and of the osmotic pressure, and these results are compared with theoretical predictions. The two reactions studied are the hydrolysis of ethyl N-acetyl-L-tyrosinate catalyzed by alpha-chymotrypsin and the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of triethoxymethane. The asymmetric membrane consumes reactant, and discharges product, at different rates through its two faces. The concentration of products, and of non-rate determining reactants, may exhibit maxima or minima with time, and computer simulation indicates that oscillatory behavior could be expected under appropriate conditions. Due to the different exit path lengths, the osmotic response (determined by the solute concentrations at the two membrane surfaces) may be opposite in sign to that expected from the concentrations in the external compartments.","590":"The conformational properties of cupric complexes of poly(L-lysine), poly(L-ornithine), and poly(L-diaminobutyric acid) have been investigated by potentiometric, visible and UV absorption, and circular dichroism (CD) techniques. The three polymers form two kinds of complexes stable at pH less than 8.5 (type I complexes) and at pH less than 8.5 (type II complexes). It has been found that in the low pH complexes of poly(L-diaminobutyric acid) at least one deprotonated amido nitrogen is coordinated to cupric ions. Type II complexes involve always amide nitrogens in the coordination sphere of Cu(II). Evidence is presented that the structure of such complexes is not compatible with the alpha-helical conformation of the peptide backbone.","591":"","592":"","593":"","594":"Quasi-elastic laser light scattering studies have shown that large multimolecular aggregates are formed on mixing dilute aqueous solutions of poly(L-lysine) and chondroitin 6-sulfate. For the two components in equimolar residue proportions at a total concentration of 0.178 mg\/mL, the aggregates have hydrodynamic radii of 1200 A. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that the polypeptide conformation changes from a coil to the alpha-helix on cooling the solution. This change can be reversed by increasing the temperature; the midpoint for the transition is 47 degrees C. Throughout these changes the size of the aggregates remains approximately constant, and thus the conformational transition detected by circular dichroism occurs within the aggregates, which otherwise remain intact. In addition, changes in ratio of the two components, pH, and ionic strength, affect the size of the aggregates.","595":"NMR spectra (270MHz) are presented of strictly alternating poly(gamma-benzyl D-L-glutamate) in dioxane, chloroform, and methylene chloride solutions from which cast films have been demonstrated to have a molecular conformation in the pi pi DL 9.0 and pi pi DL 7.2 double-helical forms. Unusually low chemical shift values are observed for the alpha-CH (approximately 5.5 ppm) and NH (approximately 9.0 ppm) resonances, well separated from those of the alpha and pi DL single helices. The aromatic protons and benzyl-CH2 resonances are found slightly upfield of those of the single helices. It is proposed that these shift values are characteristic of the double helices and that the conformation of the PBD-LG sample in these solvents is the same as in the film obtained therefrom. This conclusion is supported by NMR spectra of a solvent-induced pi pi DL 7.2 leads to pi pi DL 9.0 double helical transconformation and a similar TFA-induced double helix leads to single helix conformational transition.","596":"Mean-square unperturbed radii of gyration, (s2)0, have been calculated for several proteins cross-linked via an interchain disulfide bond. Thirty different polypeptide chains were used. Characteristic ratios tend to be smaller for cross-linked proteins than for the uncross-linked chains, although exceptions to this generalization do exist. Random flight statistics tend to overestimate the value of g, defined as the ratio of (s2)0 for the cross-linked protein to (s2)0 for analogous linear polypeptide chain containing the same number of amino acid residues. The parameter fi, defined as the ratio of the (s2)0 for the ith uncross-linked polypeptide chain and the cross-linked protein, is usually more accurately estimated by random flight statistics than is g. When the cross-link connects two chains of identical amino acid sequence, the values of fi obtained via random flight statistics are within 6% of those provided by rotational isomeric state theory.","597":"Rotational isomeric state theory, in the form appropriate for branched molecules, has been used to calculate the mean-square unperturbed radius of gyration, (s2)0, for cross-linked polyglycine, poly(L-alanine), poly(L-proline), poly(L-alanyl-D-alanine), poly(L-propyl-L-prolylglycine), poly(L-prolyl-L-alanylglycine, poly(glycyl-L-alanyl-L-proline), and poly(L-alanyl-L-alanylglycine). The central amino acid residue in each polypeptide chain is replaced by the L-cysteinyl residue involved in cross-link formation. Each cross-linked molecular is considered to contain two trifunctional branch points, the alpha-carbon atoms of the two L-cysteinyl residues. Random flight statistics provide a poor estimate for g, defined as the ratio of (s2)0 for branched and linear polypeptides containing the same number of amino acid residues, for molecules of moderate molecular weight. The values of g obtained by random flight statistics and rotational isomeric state theory merge as the molecular weight becomes infinite. Deviations of g from its random flight value correlate with the size of the characteristic ratio, (s2)0\/nplp2, for the linear polypeptides. The number of peptide bonds is np, and lp denotes the distance between neighboring alpha carbon atoms. Random flight statistics perform better in estimating the change in (s2)0 accompanying the cross-linking of the two polypeptide chains than it does in the estimation of g.","598":"The double-stranded helical conformations of alternating PBD-LG found in the solid state have been studied in infrared, circular dichroism, and NMR techniques in solution in methylene chloride, chloroform dioxane, and collidine. The infrared and CD properties of the solutions, transconformations between single- and double-stranded helices and transconformations within the family of double helices, support the hypothesis that the conformation in solution is the same as that found after evaporation of the solvent, namely the pi pi DL 7.2, pI pI DL 9.0, and pi pi DL 10.8 helices, depending on the solvent. An attempt to identify the conformation of linear gramicidin is made on the basis of the CD spectra and the infrared frequencies conformation relationship established for PBD-LG. However, owing to the great number of different conformations observed for the antibiotic, no firm conclusion can yet be drawn, except for the probable existence of the double antiparallel helical structure.","599":"Preferential adsorption to poly[N5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-L-glutamine] (PHPG) in water\/2-chloroethanol solvent mixtures has been determined by measuring density increments at constant concentration and at constant chemical potential. At low alcohol concentrations, decreasing preferential adsorption of 2-chloroethanol is observed. When the organic solvent content is increased, an inversion of preferential adsorption occurs, water being preferentially adsorbed. The inversion zone parallels the conformational transition curve. As an explanation it is proposed that a competition occurs between noninteracting helicogenic 2-chloroethanol, which stabilizes hydrophobic interactions, and the hydrophilic interactions of water with  PHPG. The former retains a helical structure, whereas the latter induces a helix-to-coil transition.","600":"Intrinsic viscosities and sedimentation coefficients have been measured as a function of molecular weight for poly(gamma-hydroxy-L-proline) in water.

High molecular weight poly(gamma-hydroxy-L-proline) in water has the hydrodynamic behavior of a random coil immersed in a good solvent, as judged by d ln [eta]\/d ln M, d ln so\/d ln M, dbeta\/dM, and the size of beta[= nu rho (-1)]\/1\/3etaM-2\/3(1 - nurho)-1]. The characteristic ratio, ((r2)o\/nplp2) infinity, is found to be 15.9 +\/- 1.6, which is not significantly different from the result of 13.7 +\/- 0.9 obtained for poly(L-proline) by Mattice and Mandelkern under the same conditions. This observation casts doubt on the importance of intrachain hydrogen bonded bridges from the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl oxygen via a water molecule. The characteristic ratios and the effects of calcium chloride on the hydroynamic properties suggest that poly(L-proline) and poly(gamma-hydroxy-L-proline) possess a similar source of flexibility which is often overlooked. Two possibilities for this flexibility are a second energy minimum about the Calpha-C' bond and cis-trans isomerization about the peptide bond.","601":"A stochastic model of the kinetics of the helix--coil transition based on the equilibrium statistical mechanical theory of Lifson and Roig is presented. A Monte Carlo simulation of the kinetics based on the stochastic model was used to study the kinetics of the helix--coil transition. Kinetics simulations were conducted from several initial values of the fractional hydrogen bonding parameter theta to each equilibrium value of theta. A spectrum of relaxation times and characteristic weighting constants is reported for each kinetics simulation. The chain lengths used in this study were 15, 34, and 85 residues. It was found that at each chain length the relaxation times depend only on the equilibrium value of 0 while the characteristic weighting constants depend on both the initial and equilibrium values of theta. The mean relaxation time was calculated for several relaxations at chain lengths 15, 34, and 85. It was found that the mean relaxation time does not reflect the correct order of magnitude of the slowest relaxation process. In addition, it was found that pure random coil species do not survive long enough to be measured by nmr spectroscopy and therefore values of t greater than or equal to 10(-1)s do not reflect a relaxation time of the helix--coil transition.","602":"One-dimensional short-range interaction models for specific-sequence copolymers of amino acids have been developed in this series of papers. In this paper, a general method for predicting protein conformation (that is based on a one-dimensional short-range interaction model, and eliminates the need for the empirical rules introduced in papers III and IV) is described. The present method involves the use of conformational (or conformational-sequence) probabilities of higher order than the first- or second-order probabilities used in papers IV and V, i.e., it treats a sequence of any number of residues; it thus alters the predictive methods that involved empirical rules in papers III and IV, and low-order (first- or second-order) probabilities in papers IV and V. The general method is applied here to the prediction of the backbone conformations of proteins, using the three-state model [helical (h), extended (epilson), and other coil (c) states] proposed in the theoretical formulation of paper II. The statistical weights in the three-state model are evaluated from the atomic coordinates of the x-ray structures of 26 proteins. The conformational-sequence probabilities (taken for three consecutive residues for numerical computation in this paper) are calculated for all possible triads (i.e., for all possible combinations of the three states, h, epilson, and c for each residue) for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and clostridial flavodoxin, in order to select the most probable conformations of these proteins. The predicted results for these proteins are compared to those predicted in paper III and to those observed experimentally. The method is applied further to the prediction of the backbone structures of homologous neurotoxin proteins whose amino acid sequences are known but whose x-ray structures are not. The effects of variation in the amino acid sequence on the conformations of the backbones are discussed from the point of view of the homologies in the amino acid sequences of 19 neurotoxins. Application of the present general predictive method to a four- and a multistate model is also described.","603":"The heats of dissociation of stacked side-chain benzyl groups in mixtures of various proportions of poly(gamma-benzyl L- and D-glutamate) have been measured by a differential scanning calorimeter. In order to obtain further information about the dissociation, the heats of solution of poly(gamma-benzyl L- and D-glutamate) were also measured by a twin micro calorimeter at 303 K. The agreement between the heat of dissociation obtained by DSC and that determined by the heat of dissolution is good. The average value of the heat of dissociation of stacking estimated by both methods is about 5 kJ\/(mol of pairs of residue.","604":"The solid state structure of block copolypeptides of gamma-benzyl L-glutamate (G) and L-leucine (L) case from preferential solvents for G has been investigated by dynamic mechanical and wide angle x-ray diffraction techniques. The WAXD patterns show overlapping reflections characteristic of the individual homopolymers. Further evidence for a phase separated morphology is provided by the viscoelastic behavior. Representation of the dynamic elastic modulus in terms of the equivalent mechanical model suggests that phase separation of GLG-type polymers occurs with G as the matrix phase. In the reverse case, LGL-type polymers, it appears that some phase inversion has taken place.","605":"Triblock copolypeptides of gamma-benzyl L-glutamate (G) and L-leucine or L-valine of high molecular weight have been prepared. The solubilites and solution conformation were determined and compared with random copolymers of similar composition as well as the appropriate homopolypeptides. Characterization of the secondary structure in the solid state was undertaken as part of an investigation into the solid state properties of this new class of materials. Infrared and solid state measurements indicate that the G and L-leucine blocks assume an alpha-helical conformation and L-valine blocks a beta-sheet structure. Polarized infrared measurements showed the chain axis in oriented films to be parallel to the orientation direction. Further solid state characterization of the tertiary structure and mechanical properties of the block copolypeptides will be reported in succeeding papers.","606":"A three-step mechanism of protein folding, proposed in our previous paper, is applied here to postulate the nature of the intermediates in the folding of rubredoxin, ferricytochrome c, and lysozyme. Contact maps are calculated for these three proteins, and it is shown that they contain much information (such as the polarity of residues in contact regions) about the structure of the native protein. Elementary processes are described for the formation of contact regions. Based on these concepts, details of the pathways of folding these three proteins from the unfolded to the native structure are postulated, focusing on the formation of ordered backbone structures (such as alpha-helical, extended, and chain-reversal conformations) in step A of the three-step mechanism and on the formation of contact regions in response to medium-and long-range interactions in steps B and C. It was found that chain reversals can often play an important role in forming contact regions in step A (short-range interactions) and in step B (medium-range interactions) but not in step C.","607":"A statistical method for the calculation of conformation is applied to the small protein, basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The polypeptide geometry, energies, rotational isomers, and technique of conformation generation are discussed in detail. The calculations indicate that (i) under denaturing conditions, reduced trypsin inhibitor when oxidized should form initially 14 of the 15 possible single disulfide bridge intermediates in roughly equal proportions, and (ii) under renaturing conditions (pH 8.7, room temperature, aqueous solution) the single disulfide bridge intermediate with cys 30 and cys 51 connected is present in higher concentration than that with cys 30 and cys 55 linked. The two calculations are in agreement with experiment.","608":"A quantitative theory is presented for calculating the folding of a polymer, especially as applied to the renaturation of globular proteins. The theory applies to both thermodynamically and kinetically determined processes, so that not only can the equilibrium result be calculated but also the time course of folding. Since it is not automatically assumed that the folding will result in a single \"native\" conformation, it is possible to conclude that the polymer will exist as a random coil under appropriate conditions. A Monte Carlo method for applications is discussed in detail, and a very simple example is presented.","609":"Energy transfer in the singlet state was studied in solution at 25 degrees C for poly(beta-1-naphthylmethyl L-aspartate) and copolymers of beta-1-naphthylmethyl L-aspartate and gamma-benzyl L-glutamate. Transfer efficiencies, migration coefficients, migration lengths, and interaction radii were determined from the quenching studies using biacetyl as a quencher. The migration coefficient increases with increasing naphthyl groups in the copolymers. This means that singlet energy migrates among more naphthyl groups with increasing naphthyl groups in the polymer chain. Interaction radius for the fluorescence quenching by biacetyl was estimated to be in the range of 5.8 to 8.9 A irrespective of whether energy donor is monomer or excimer. Moreover, it was shown that energy migration via excimer does not take place and energy of the excimer is localized.","610":"Polysarcosine having a terminal p-dimethylaminoanilide group and a terminal 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl group was synthesized. The number-average degree of polymerization n was varied from 6 to 25. In chloroform solution this polymer showed a distinct absorption band around 455 nm, which was attributed mostly to intramolecular charge-transfer interactions. The extinction coefficient of the charge-transfer complex was determined for low molecular weight model compounds. Using the same extinction coefficient, the fraction of polymers forming intrachain charge-transfer complex was evaluated at infinite dilution. The fraction was about 0.15 for n = 6 and decreased asymptotically with increasing n finally to 0.03 for n = 25. These values are almost 20-100 times as large as those estimated from the Monte Carlo calculation and on the basis of the intramolecularly catalyzed hydrolysis of polysarcosine chain. This indicates that the cyclized conformations of polysarcosine chain are greatly stabilized by the formation of intrachain charge-transfer complex. The fraction of the cyclized polymer was decreased with increasing temperature for short chains. The thermodynamic parameters characterizing the conformational change required for cyclization in chloroform were obtained and compared with those for the same reaction in ethanol solution, as well as those for the intramolecularly catalyzed hydrolysis on polysarcosine chain in aqueous solution.","611":"Conformational energy calculations using ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energy Program for Peptides) were carried out on the N-acetyl-N'-methylamides of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Minimum-energy conformations were located, and the relative conformational energy, librational entropy, and free energy each minimum were calculated. The effects of intrinsic torsional potentials, intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and librational entropy on relative conformational energies and locations of minima are discussed. The results are categorized most easily by use of a new conformational letter code that is introduced here.","612":"One-dimensional short-range interaction models for specific-sequence copolymers of amino acids have been developed in this series of papers. In the present paper, a multistate model (involving right-handed helical (hR), extended (epsilon), chain-reversal (R and S), left-handed helical (hL), right-handed bridge-region (zota R), left-handed bridge-region (zota L), and coil (or other) (c) states) is developed for the prediction of protein backbone conformation. This model involves ten parameters (WhR, UPSILONHR, V epsilon, VR, VS, WhL, VhL, U zota R, U zota L, and Uc) and requires a 10X10 statistical weight matrix. Assuming that the left-handed helical sequence cannot occur in proteins, this 10X10 matrix can be reduced to a 9X9 matrix with nine parameters (WhR, VhR, V epsilon, VR, VS, VhL, U zota R, U zota L, and Uc). A nearest neighbor approximation of this multistate model is also formulated; with the omission of left-handed helical sequences, and the inclusion of the left-handed bridge region in the c state, this approximate model requires a 7X7 matrix with statistical weights WhR, VhR, VS, VhL, U zota R, and Uc, expressed as values relative to the statistical weight of the epsilon state. The statistical weights for the multistate model are evaluated from the atomic coordinates of the X-ray structures of 26 native proteins. These statistical weights and the multistate model are applied in the prediction of the backbone conformations of proteins. The conformational probabilities of finding a residue in hR, epsilon, R, S, hL, zota R, or c states, defined as relative values with respect to their average values over the whole molecule, are calculated for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and clostridial flavodoxin, in order to select the most probable conformation for each residue of these proteins. The predicted results are compared to experimental observations and are discussed together with the reliability of the statistical weights. In the Appendix, the property of asymmetric nucleation of helical sequences is introduced into the (nearest neighbor) multistate model.","613":"In a previous paper, a hypothesis for protein folding was proposed in which the native structure is formed by a three-step mechanism: (A) formation of ordered backbone structures by short-range interactions, (B) formation of small contact regions by medium-range interactions, and (C) association of the small contact regions into the native structure by long-range interactions. In this paper the empirical interaction parameters, used as a measure of the medium- and long-range interactions (the standard free energy, deltaGdegrees k,l, of formation of a contact between amino acids of species k and l) that include the role of the solvent (water) and determine the conformation of a protein in steps B and C, are evaluated from the frequency of contacts in the x-ray structures of native proteins. The numerical values of deltaG degrees k,l for all possible pairs of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids are presented. Contacts between highly nonpolar side chains of amino acids such as Ile, Phe, Trp, and Leu are shown quantitatively to be stable. On the contrary, contacts involving polar side chains of amino acids such as Ser, Asp, Lys, and Glu are significantly less stable. While this implies, in a quantitative manner, that it is generally more favorable for nonpolar groups to lie in the interior of the protein molecule and for the polar side chains to be exposed to the solvent (water) rather than to form contacts with other amino acids, many exceptions to this generalization are observed.","614":"We have examined the disordered-to-beat transition of two samples of high molecular wieght poly(L-tyrosine), a polypeptide with an ionizing side chain, by potentiometric titration of solutions of this polymer in aqueous buffer. The degree of ionization was determined spectrophotometrically from the absorption of the tyrosinate anion at 293.5 nm. By using polymer solutions of high dilution the region of the conformational transition was separated from that of aggregation. As a consequence it was possible to obtain titration data for the intramolecular transition which we believe are free of interference from aggregation. For this transition we found that deltaHO=-1330 cal\/mol of residue. The two samples gave values of -3.42+\/-0.14 and -3.85+\/-0.10 u for the change in entropy. Possible artifactual origins for this distinction have been examined and may be dicounted. Rather, it probably reflects a difference in the beta structures formed which depends on molecular weight.","615":"One-dimensional short-range interaction models for specific-sequence copolymers of amino acids are being developed in this series of papers. In this paper, our earlier three-state model [involving helical (h), extended (epsilon), and coil (or other) (c) states] is extended to a four-state model by preserving the h and epsilon states, introducing the chain-reversal state (R and S), and redefining the c state. This model involves six parameters (wh, vh, vepsilon, vR, vS, and uc) and requires a 6 X 6 statistical weight matrix. A nearest-neighbor approximation of the four-state model is also formulated; it requires a 5 X 5 matrix, involving the same six parameters. By expressing the statistical weights relative to that of the epsilon state, only five parameters (wh, vh, vR, vS, and uc) are required in both the 6 X 6 and 5 X 5 matrices. The statistical weights for the four-state model are evaluated from the atomic coordinates of the x-ray structures of 26 native proteins. These statistical weights, and the four-state model, are used to develop a procedure to predict the backbone conformations of proteins. Since the prediction of helical and extended conformations is carried out by the procedure described in papers 1-3 of this series, we focus particular attention on chain-reversal conformations in this paper. The conformational-sequence probabilities of finding a residue in h, epsilon, R, S, or c states, and of finding two consecutive residues in a chain-reversal conformation, defined as relative values with respect to their average values over the whole molecule, are calculated for 23 proteins. By comparing these conformational-sequence probabilities to experimental X-ray observations, it was found that, in addition to the prediction of helical and extended conformations (reported in paper 3), 219 chain-reversal regions out of 372 observed by x-ray diffraction studies of 23 proteins were predicted correctly. These results suggest that the assumption of the dominance of short-range interactions in determining chain-reversal (as well as helical or extended) conformations in proteins, on which the predictive scheme is based, is a reasonable one. Finally, in the Appendix, the property of asymmetric nucleation of helical sequences is introduced into the (nearest-neighbor) four-state model.","616":"In this paper we report an experimental conformational analysis of the depsipeptide model compounds acetyl-L-alanine methyl ester, acetyl-L-lactic acid N-methylamide, and acetyl-L-alanyl-L-lactic acid N-methylamide and of the sequential polydepsipeptide poly(L-alanyl-L-lactic acid). The model depsipeptides were examined in dilute organic solutions by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Neither acetyl-L-alanine methyl ester nor acetyl-L-lactic acid N-methylamide assumes an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded conformation. Acetyl-L-alanyl-L-lactic acid N-methylamide, on the other hand, in dilute chloroform or dilute carbon tetrachloride solutions, strongly favors a conformation with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the N-H hydrogen atom of its N-methylamide group and the carbonyl oxygen atom of its acetyl group. Comparison of theoretical and experimental circular dichroism suggests that poly(L-alanyl-L-lactic acid) is partially ordered in chloroform solution with approximately 50% of its repeat units in the R10 helix, an ordered conformation found by our previous theoretical analysis to have a low intramolecular conformational energy.","617":"The synthesis and characterization of water-soluble random copolymers containing L-lysine with N5-(4-hydroxybutyl)-L-glutamine, and the thermally induced helix-coil transitions of these copolymers in water, are described. The incorporation of L-lysine was found to decrease the helix content of the polymers at neutral pH. The Zimm-Bragg parameters sigma and s for the helix-coil transition in poly(L-lysine) in water were deduced from an analysis of the melting curves in the manner described in earlier papers. The computed values of s indicate that, in the temperature range of 0-60 degrees C, lysine has a tendency to destabilize helical sequences, this tendency being minimal at approximately 25 degrees C and increasing at lower and higher temperatures.","618":"","619":"A Monte Carlo statistical mechanical study of the helix-coil transition for a hard-sphere model of poly(L-alanine) has been conducted base on the theory of Lifson and Roig but including the effects of long-range interactions. A stochastic model of the kinetics of the helix-coil transition is presented, and a Monte Carlo stimulation of the kinetics based on this model was used to generate equilibrium chain samples, each chain of which consisted of Lifson-Roig weighted sequences of helix and coil residues. Each of the chains in this sample was then used many times by assigning at random specific sterically allowed coil states from a hard-sphere Ramachandran dipeptide map. Unperturbed properties were then calculated using this sample and perturbed properties by using only the non-self-conflicting subset. The properties calculated were the average degree of hydrogen bonding, the average length of a helical sequence, the mean-square end-to-end distance, the mean-square radius of gyration, and the distribution functions for the end-to-end distance and radius of gyration. This study was conducted at chain lengths 10, 34, and 85 residues. Helix-coil transition theory was fit to the perturbed transition curves in an attempt to ascertain if theory could then predict the perturbed values of the dimensions. For the hard-sphere model used in these calculations, it was found that current helix-coil transition theory does not predict the correct perturbed dimensions.","620":"Phase diagrams for conformational transitions of polypeptides in ternary organic solvent systems containing two active and one inert component are calculated for a model which takes into account possible interaction of the two active components with each other as well as with the polypeptide backbone. The results of experimental determinations of conformational transitions and isothermal phase boundaries for poly(beta-benzyl L-asparate) (PBA) in three-model solvent systems are in generally good accord with the theory. The solvent systems are: (a) 1-chloropropionic acid-dichloroacetic acid (DCA)-1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE), (b) monochloroacetic acid-DCA-TCE, and (c) dimethyl sulfoxide-DCA-TCE.","621":"","622":"Ultracentrifugation measurements made by the Archibald method on solutions of amylose-iodine-iodide (AI) complexes, containing 0.003% amylose of weight average molecular weight 4.0 X 10(5) at 3.6 X 10(-3) M KI, yield an apparent molecular weight at the meniscus of 8 X 10(5) when measurements are extrapolated to 1200 rpm. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements at 1200 rpm yield apparent molecular weight at the meniscus of 6 X 10(5) and at the cell bottom of 2.4 X 10(6). Heterogeneity and aggreagation are major features of AI complex solution behavior. Apparent molecular weights increase as a function of increasing potassium iodide concentration and with time. This behavior directly correlates with AI complex sedimentation coefficient behavior previously reported. Molecular weight estimates are of the same order for AI complex solutions saturated and 65-70% saturated with respect to the iodine-binding capacity of amylose. Qualitative estimates of net macroion charge effects upon apparent molecular weights are presented.","623":"Sedimentation measurements are reported on solutions of blue amylose-iodine complexes in the range of 0.001 to 0.007% amylose. Amylose fractions B and F2, of weight average molecular weight average molecular weight 4.0 X 10(5) and 3.4 X 10(4), respectively, were used in this study. Iodine complexes of these fractions formed polydisperse solutions of limited solubility and stability. Sedimentation coefficients increased as a function of potassium iodide concentration. Values for fraction B complexes varied from (16.3 +\/- 1.0) X 10(-13) at 1.2 X 10(-3) M KI to (57.2 +\/- 7.5) X 10(-13) at 8.3 X 10(-3) M KI; values for fraction F2 complexes varied from (10.0 +\/- 1.2) X 10(-13) at 1.2 X 10(-13) M KI to (24.8 +\/- 3.9) X 10(-13) at 9.5 X 10(-3) M KI. At constant potassium iodide concentration, sedimentation coefficients, within our experimental error of 10 to 15% standard deviation, are independent of amylose concentration. Time dependence of sedimentation coefficient values was observed for solutions either saturated or unsaturated with respect to the iodine-binding capacity of amylose. For iodine-saturated complex solutions, sedimentation coefficients extrapolated to zero potassium iodide concentration were two to three times greater than for the parent amylose. Measurements are evaluated in terms of possible polyelectrolytic charge effects and aggregation. Under conditions used in these experiments, aggregation of amylose-iodide complexes appears to be the mechanism responsible for the large increase in sedimentation coefficients.","624":"The possible occurrence of the oxy analogues to the 3 leads to 1 intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded peptide conformations (main feature of the gamma turn), recently proposed in solution by several authors, has been investigated in a number of N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-alpha-amino acids by x-ray diffraction, infrared absorption, proton magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism techniques. These folded conformations are absent in the solid state in all cases so far examined; however, they seem to be present in solution, the extent of the population of these forms in the conformational equilibrium mixtures being solvent, temperature, and structure dependent. In the solid state N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-D-valine has the urethane-CONH-group in the cis configuration; this is the first time such a configuration has been found in the solid-state for a secondary amide group in a linear compound.","625":"The occurrence of the oxy analogue to the type II' 4 leads to 1 intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded nonhelical peptide conformation, recently proposed for t-BOC-Gly-L-Pro-OH in the solid state by Deber on the basis of infrared absorption evidence, has been disproved by x-ray diffraction analysis. This type of folding is also absent in solvents of moderate or high polarity. The latter conclusion is in agreement with Deber's results. However, in solvents of low polarity this intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded form could account for the strong negative Cotton effect near 230 nm observed in the circular dichroism spectrum.","626":"Conformational energy calculations using ECEPP (Empirical Conformational Energy Program for Peptides) were performed on the molecular fragment Calpha1C'ONHCalpha2, on N-methylacetamide, and on several peptide molecules including N-acetyl-N'-methylglycineamide (Gly single residue), N-acetyl-N',N'-dimethylglycine-amide, and N-acetyl-N'-methylamide dipeptides of Gly-Gly and Gly-Pro. Energy minimization was carried out with peptide groups taken in both the cis and trans conformations, and the librational entropy and conformational free energy were determined at each minimum. It was found that the instability of cis in Gly-Gly comes primarily from interactions of the Calpha1 and HCalpha1 atoms with the Calpha2 and HCalpha2 atoms, and also from avorable interactions present in the trans form which are disallowed in the cis form, and from conformational entropy. The instability of cis in Gly-Pro is much less than in Gly-Gly because unfavorable interactions of the type CalphaH-CalphaH present in the cis conformation of Gly-Gly are present in both the cis and trans forms of Gly-Pro. The instability of cis in Gly-Pro arises mainly from the change in electrostatic energy caused by the restricted rotation about the N-Calpha bond of Pro. Entropy accounts for about 0.5 kcal\/mol of the instability of cis in Gly-Pro compared with about 1.5 kcal\/mol in Gly-Gly. The calculated fraction (4%) of cis in Gly-pro is in good agreement with the experimental value (5%) for related peptides in nonpolar solvents. When the dihedral angle omega of the central peptide bond in these dipeptides is allowed to vary during energy minimization, the deviations from planarity are only 1-3 degrees in low-energy minima of Gly-Gly but as much as 10 degrees in Gly-Pro. A comparison of these results with calculations in which the peptide bond was held fixed in the planar trans conformation shows that conformation-dependent properties of blocked dipeptides can be represented adequately without allowing omega to vary.","627":"Crick's general formulas describing a coiled coil are expressed in a different form to combine the parameters of a coiled coil with the backbone dihedral angles of a polypeptide chain, assuming that the bond lengths and bond angles of the chain are fixed. While the existence of a low-energy coiled-coil conformation depends on energetic considerations, these formulas, which pertain to single-stranded structures and, by application of symmetry operations, to multistranded structures, provide the geometrical criteria for the existence of coiled coils. The concept of \"the averaged structure of the minor helix\", introduced here, makes it possible to relate the shape of the major helix to that of the minor helix. It is shown, in the analysis of a simple model of a single-stranded coiled-coil beta structure, that strong geometrical restrictions exist for the formation of coiled-coil structures from a given minor helix conformation of a polypeptide chain; these restrictions are expressed in a general form that is applicable to any coiled-coil of any number of residues in a repeat unit. As an application, the possible existence of a two-stranded coiled-coil antiparallel beta structure is considered, both geometrically and energetically, and discussed in relation to the observed twisted beta structures in globular proteins. The proposed coiled-coil models of alpha-helical proteins are also examined briefly.","628":"Monte Carolo calculations were made on unperturbed trans-polysarcosine chain, non-self-intersecting trans-polysarcosine chain, and also non-self-intersecting trans\/cis-polysarcosine chain by using a hard-sphere model. In the last case, an attempt was first made to introduce cis amide bond into the Monte Carlo calculation of polypeptide chain. Dipeptide energy maps for four different trans\/cis dyad sequences were calculated. The allowed regions were consistent with the pairs of dihedral angles observed in cyclo-pentasarcosyl and cyclo-octasarcosyl. The mean-square end-to-end distance and higher even moments were obtained. The distribution function of the end-to-end distance was calculated from the even moments by using Nagai's equation and compared with the direct Monte Carlo data. The best agreement was obtained by cutting off the terms containing much higher order even moments than a critical order. The fractions of cis amide bond and of the four different trans\/cis dyad sequences in polysarcosine were calculated. The results of calculation were compared with the 220-MHz NMR spectra of polysarcosine in three different solvents. Qualitative agreement was stained for longer chains.","629":"","630":"Paramyosin samples obtained from the chowder clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, by different extraction techniques were studied using transient electric birefringence techniques. The protein remain monomeric (unaggregated) in 1 mM buffer solution at pH 3.1 to 3.8 and near pH 10. At pH 3.2, the molecules obtained by different extraction techniques exhibit rotational diffusion constants that indicate a 5% difference in length between them, with the probable native form of paramyosin being the longer species. This difference in rotational diffusion constant disappears at higher pH, and, in addition, a large difference in dipole moment between the molecules observed at pH 3.2 also disappears at high pH. These results are used to hypothesize that the rodlike native paramyosin molecules have one or two partly flexible portions on their ends; at one end of each molecule this portion probably contains excess basic amino acids which are charged at low pH to account for the higher dipole moment of this form of paramyosin at these low pH values. At pH 3.2, these portions of the macromolecule are not flexible and act as stiff parts of the rodlike molecules, but they gradually become flexible at higher pH. Possible mechanisms for this change in flexibility are discussed.","631":"Monte Carlo calculation was performed to evaluate the ring-closure probability of short polysarcosine chains. Calculations were made for unperturbed trans- non-self-intersecting trans-, and non-self-intersecting trans- and non-self-intersecting trans\/cis-polysarcosine chains. In the latter case, the main chain amide bond was allowed to take cis as well as trans conformations. The ring-closure probability for unperturbed trans-polysarcosine chains was found to be substantially greater than for non-self-intersecting trans chains. Virtually no difference was observed between the ring-closure probability was used to estimate the cyclization constant, i.e., the ratio of rate constant for the intramolecular reaction of the two groups attached to the polymer ends to that of the intermolecular one. The results were compared with the experimental data for the intrachain reaction proceeding on polysarcosine chain reported in the first paper of this series. The Monte Carlo results roughly reproduced the experimental data and the calculated chain length dependence was consistent with the observed one for longer chains.","632":"The structure of regenerated cellulose is shown by x-ray diffraction to be comprised of an array of antiparallel chain molecules. The determination was based on the intensity data from rayon fibers and utilized rigid-body least-squares refinement techniques. The unit cell is monoclinic with space group P2(1) and dimensions a = 8.01 A, b = 9.04 A, c = 10.36 A (fiber axis), and gamma = 117.1 degrees. Models containing chains with the same sense (parallel) or alternating sense (antiparallel) were refined against the intensity data. The only acceptable model contains antiparallel chains. The -CH2OH groups of the corner chain are oriented near to the gt position while those of the center chain are near to the tg position. Both chains possess an O3-H-O5' intramolecular hydrogen bond, and the center chain also has an O2'-H-O6 intramolecular bond. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding occurs along the 020 planes (o6-h-o2 bonds for the corner chains and O6-H-O3 bonds for the center chains) and also along the 110 planes with a hydrogen bond between the O2-H of the corner chain and the O2' of the center chain. This center-corner chain hydrogen bonding is a major difference between the native and regenerated structures and may account for the stability of the latter form.","633":"A new method for calculating average molecular weights is presented for nonlinear polymers. In contrast to the previous methods of Flory and Stockmayer which first calculate the distribution of all species and then use the distributions to calculate average properties, the new method calculates these properties directly. In contrast to the method of Gordon, probability generating functions are not required. Starting with elementary probability and utilizing the recursive nature of network polymers property relations can be developed more simply. We illustrate the method for calculations of Mw Mz, and the gel point for a wide variety of polyfunctional polymerizations.","634":"Co gamma irradiation of 2-hydroxethyl methacrylate in the presence or in the absence of other acrylic monomers was found to constitute an effective technique for the synthesis of hydrophilic functional microspheres in the size range of approxumately 0.3 to 3 mu in diameter. The effect of monomer concentration, steric stabilization, and electrostatic interaction on the particle size was investigated. Experimental conditions were determined to obtain desired particle sizes of relatively narrow distribution. It was shown that particles may be formed without intermediate micelles, i.e., by homogeneous nucleation, and the rate of particle formation is affected primarily by the rate of particle coalescence in the initial stages of the reaction. When covalently bound to antibodies these microspheres were successfully used to label murine and human lymphocytes.","635":"An equation for the translational diffusion coefficient of block copolymers in dilute solution has been obtained by modifying Zimm's equation for homopolymers to take into account the existence of dissimilar segments in block copolymers. Illustrative calculations for homopolymers and block copolymers have been made and the results for homopolymers have been compared with experiments and with the calculations of Yamakawa and Fujii. A procedure has been proposed to determine the molecular weight of a block copolymer from measurements of its limiting viscosity number and its sedimentation coefficient or translational diffusion coefficient.","636":"The synthetic cyclic tetrapeptide (L-Leu-L-Tyr-delta-Avaler-delta-Avaler) is an effective inhibitor of chymotrypsin, competitive with linear peptides like Ac-L-Leu-L-Tyr-OMe. An x-ray diffraction analysis of the crystal structure of the cyclic peptide shows that the conformation of the 18-membered ring is very similar to that of one of the four conformers of cyclic hexaglycyl. There is no internal hydrogen bonding. Side chains are located on two \"corners\" of the approximately rectangular ring. The chii1 angles for Leu and Tyr are -74 and -48 degrees, respectively. The Leu side chain is extended away from the polypeptide ring while the Tyr side chain is folded under an adjacent carbonyl bond. The cell parameters for the space group P2U are: a = 9.361 (3 A, b = 19.039 (10) A, c = 9.603 (3), A, and beta = 116.54 (3) degrees. A molecule of (CH3)2SO (disordered) and a molecule of H2O cocrystallized with the cyclic peptide.","637":"Statistical mechanical averages of vectors and tensors characterizing the configurations of polypeptides have been calculated for poly-L-alanines (PLA) of xu = 2-400 peptide units. These quantities are expressed in the reference frame of the first peptide unit, the X axis being situated along the virtual bond, the Y axis in the plane of the peptide unit. The persistence vector a identical to (r) converges rapidly with chain length to its limit a infinity which lies virtually in the XZ plane. Configurational averages of Cartesian tensors up to the sixth rank formed from the displacement vector p = r-a have been computed. For xu greater than 50 the even moments of fourth and sixth rank formed from the reduced vector p for the real chain are well repreented by the freely jointed chain with 21.7 virtual bonds equivalent to one of the model. The moments of p display assymmetry for xu less than 50. Density distribution functions Wa(p), evaluated from the three-dimensional Hermite series truncated at the term in the polynomial involving the tensors of p of sixth rank, display no obvious symmetry for xu less than 50. Approximate spherical symmetry of the distribution of p about a is observed only for xu greater than or equal to 100.","638":"The synthesis and characterization of water-soluble random copolymers containing L-tyrosine with N2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-L-glutamine are described, and the thermally induced helix--coil transitions of these copolymers in water have been studied. The incorporation of L-tyrosine was found to increase the helix content of the polymers at all temperatures. The Zimm-Bragg parameters sigma and sigma for the helix--coil transition in poly(L-tyrosine) in water were deduced from an analysis of the melting curves of the copolymers in the manner described in earlier papers. The large value of sigma indicates that, in water, tyrosine has a tendency to promote helix--coil boundaries at all temperatures; the values of sigma indicate that this residue enhances helix growth at low temperature and reduces it at high temperature.","639":"Some criticisms of our theoretical treatment of the partial exclusion of flexible-chain polymers in solution from cavities of macromolecular size and its application to gel permeation chromatography are examined. In other discussion, it is confirmed by simple reasoning that the identification, explicit or implicit in various studies, of the mean projection of a polymer molecule onto a line as a characteristic dimension governing the extent of permeation of simple pores does not depend on specific molecular models. Our previous calculation of permeation by certain random-flight branched-chain species is shown to lead, incidentally, to the mean projection for these structures. From relations between the mean projection and the hydrodynamic volume of a molecule, it appears that the product of intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight is not a common calibration factor for elution of all molecular species from a gel chromatographic column, but theory and experience do support the validity of this correlation among solutes with similar molecular architecture.","640":"The method proposed for the evaluation of statistical weights in paper I, and the three-state model [alpha-helical (alpha), extended (epsilon), and other (c) states] formulated in paper II, have been used to develop a procedure to predict the backbone conformations of proteins, based on the concept of the predominant role played by shortrange interactions in determining protein conformation. Conformational probability profiles, in which the probabilities of formation of three consecutive alpha-helical conformations (triad) and of four consecutive extended conformations (tetrad) have been defined relative to their average values over the whole molecule, are calculated for 19 proteins, of which 16 had been used in paper I to evaluate the set of statistical weights of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. By comparing these conformational probability profiles to experimental x-ray observations, the following results have been obtained: 80% of the alpha-helical regions and 72% of the extended conformational regions have been predicted correctly for the 19 proteins. The percentage of residues predicted correctly is in the range of 53 to 90% for the alpha-helical conformation and in the range of 63 to 88% for the extended conformation for the 19 proteins in the two-state models [alpha-helical (alpha) and other (c) states, and extended (epsilon) and other (c) states]. In the three-state model, the percentage of residues predicted correctly is in the range of 47% to 77 for 19 proteins. These results suggest that the assumption of the dominance of short-range interactions, on which the predictive scheme is based, is a reasonable one. The present predictive method is compared with that of other authors.","641":"A one-dimensional three-state Ising model [involving alpha-helical (alpha), extended (epsilon), and coil (or other) (c) states] for specific-sequence copolymers of amino acids ahs been formulated in order to treat the conformational states of proteins. This model involves four parameters (wh,iota, vh, iota, v episilon, iota, and uc, iota), and requires a 4 X 4 matrix for generating statistical weights. Some problems in applying this model to a specific-sequence copolymer of amino acids are discussed. A nearest-neighbor approximation for treating this three-state model is also formulated; it requires a 3 X 3 matrix, in which the same four parameters appear, but (as with the 4 X 4 matrix treatment) only three parameters (wh, uh, and v epsilon) are required if relative statistical weights are used. The relationship between the present three-state model (3 X 3 matrix treatment) and models of the helix--coil transition is discussed. Then, the three-state model (3 X 3 matrix treatment) is incorporated into an earlier (Tanaka--Scheraga) model of the helix-coil transition, in which asymmetric nucleation of helical sequences is taken into account. A method for calculating molecular averages and conformational-sequence probabilities, P(iota\/eta\/(rho)), i.e., the probability of finding a sequence of eta residues in a specific conformational state (rho), starting at the iotath position of the chain, is described. Two alternative methods for calculating P(iota\/eta\/(rho)), that can be applied to a model involving any number of states, are proposed and presented; one is the direct matrix-multiplication method, and the other uses a first-order a priori probability and a conditional probability. In this paper, these calculations are performed with the nearest-neighbor model, and without the feature of asymmetric nucleation. Finally, it is indicated how the three-state model and the methods for computing P(iota\/eta\/(rho)) can be applied to predict protein conformation.","642":"A statistical mechanical (one-dimensional Ising model) treatment, based on the dominance of short-range interactions, is developed in this series of papers; it is intended as an improvement over empirical prediction schemes for obtaining approximate initial conformations of proteins (to be used to try to deduce the native conformation by subsequent energy minimization). In the present paper, the statistical weights for a two-state model (alpha-helical and other conformations) and for a three-state model (alpha-helical, extended, and other conformations) are evaluated from x-ray data on 16 native proteins. The method for evaluating the statistical weights is presented. Asymmetric alpha-helical nucleation parameters are also evaluated for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. On the basis of these statistical weights, the conformational properties of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids are discussed. The statistical weights evaluated from x-ray data are also discussed in comparison with experimental results on the helix--coil transition in polyamino acids in solution. The predominant role of short-range interactions, and some possible long-range effects in determining the statistical weights, are discussed in conjunction with the mechanism of protein folding.","643":"Sequential polypeptides with the repeating units L-alanyl-(S)-beta-aminobutyric acid, L-alanyl-(R)-beta-aminobutyric acid, and L-alanyl-(R,S)-beta-aminobutyric acid have been synthesized by polycondensation of the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester hydrochloride salts of the corresponding dipeptides. Circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy studies of films of the polypeptides and circular dichroism study of their solutions in hexafluoro-2-propanol and hexafluoropropane-2,2-diol show the tendency of the polypeptides to adopt the beta conformation in the solid state. In pure hexafluoro-2-propanol or hexafluoroacetone, the three polymers adopt what we interpret as random coil conformations. In mixtures of hexafluoro-2-propanol-water or hexafluoropropane-2,2-diol-water, the polypeptide containing the S isomer shows a definite tendency to form beta structure. This tendency is not established for the R and the R,S isomers.","644":"","645":"The differential scanning calorimetric behavior of a series of alpha-amino acid homopolymers and copolymers was investigated in the range of temperature from -80 to +130 degrees C. The following polymers have been examined: poly(N'-carbobenzoxy-L-lysine), poly(O-carbobenzoxy-L-tyrosine), random copolymers of O-carbobenzoxy-L-tyrosine and N'-carbobenzoxy-L-lysine, poly(Ngamma-carbobenzoxy-L-diaminobutyric acid), and poly(N sigma-carbobenzoxy-L-ornithine). Each sample exhibited a prominent glass-like transition between +30 and +60 degrees C with a specific heat increment deltacp of the order of 0.03-0.11 cal\/(g degrees C). Endothermal peaks, developed by annealing, have been also been revealed. It is concluded that in poly(alpha-amino acids) side chain motions are capable of undergoing glass-like transition.","646":"The solution conformations of several D,L copoly benzyl glutamates both random and alternating are studied by comparing their NMR spectra in chloroform and also in dioxane and dimethylformamide. The alpha CH chemical shifts characteristic of the alpha helix of strictly alternating DL copolymers in chloroform\/0.5% TFA are established (3.65 and 3.82 ppm) and differ from that of the regular alpha helix (3.92 ppm). It is concluded that alternating copolymers prepared by an essentially racemization-free method are completely in the alpha-helical conformation which is characteristic of strictly alternating D-L copolymers, whereas random copolymers are largely regular alpha. The alpha leads to piDL helix\/helix transition of an alternating copolymer in dioxane has been monitored and the alpha CH resonance characteristic of the piDL helix is found to be at the unusually low chemical shift of 4.45 ppm.","647":"As in solid state, strictly alternating poly(gamma-benzyl D-L-glutamate) in solution can adopt two different helical conformations. Besides the alpha helix, a second helical conformation is found at higher temperatures in dioxane and chloroform, the properties of which correspond to that of the piDL4 helix. As the molecules have a finite length a screw sense is favored for both helical forms thus giving rise to optical activity allowing the study of the transconformation by optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism besides infrared and dielectric measurements. Thus, as the temperature is raised the equilibria right-left handed alpha helices and alpha-piDL helical forms can be followed. The favored screw senses are determined by the number of interacting side chains for the alpha helix and by the number of hydrogen bonds which are formed in the piDL helical conformation. The side chain-side chain interactions in the alpha helix are experimentally shown to be attractive.","648":"Using an improved method for computing conformations of closed rings with symmetry, in conjunction with an improved empirical energy function, the conformational space of Gramicidin S is reexamined. The search for minimum energy conformations is confined to the subspace containing closed symmetric rings. A large number of initial conformations selected from that subspace is subjected to energy minimization or is eliminated in a sequence of steps designed to locate the global minimum-energy conformation. One conformation having distinctly low energy is found and is judged to be the global minimum-energy conformation. This conformation is of the beta-pleated sheet type and is in complete agreement with experimental data. Similar structures with beta-pleated sheet-type conformations have been proposed previously on the basis of less extensive examiniations of the conformational space; the condition of exact ring closure, and the extensive examination of conformational space, used here, establish this structure on a firm basis.","649":"The Zimm and Bragg parameter sigma is calculated numerically for poly(L-alanine), polyglycine, and the copolymers of L-alanine and glycine using the molecular theory of s and sigma as developed by Go, Go, and Scheraga in a modified formulation. In this formulation, sigma is obtained from the partition function of the whole chain in the helix-coil transition region and represents therefore the contributions from the ends of helical and coil sequences and from the interactions between atoms in a coil sequence with those in the neighboring helical sequence. When the parameter sigma is calculated numerically from a hard-sphere potential, it appears that steric intractions between atoms in the coil sequence with atoms in the neighboring helical sequence, which have been neglected in previous calculations, contribute significantly to the value of sigma. Owing to these interactions the entropy of the coil sequence as well as sigma decrease, but the decrease of sigma is larger in poly(L-alanine) than in polyglycine, because of the higher flexibility of the monomer in polyglycine. The numerical value of sigma for polyglycine compared with that of poly(L-alanine) might be overestimated however by the model presented here due to approximations inherent in the hard-sphere treatment and because only regular helical sequences are considered.","650":"Proton Fourier transform NMR spectra at 270 MHz were obtained for three different molecular weight samples of poly(L-proline) in D2O. A weak, but clearly discernable, resonance at 4.3 ppm was observed in each case with an integrated intensity about 2-3% of the Calpha trans proton resonance. Based on the Torchia-Bovey assignment this resonance is attributed to the Calpha cis proton. The presence of cis residues, even in this small concentration, necessitates a reexamination of the conformational properties of this polymer. Definite conclusions cannot be reached from spectra obtained in organic solvents because of the much smaller separation between the cis and trans resonances.","651":"Allowing for rotation about the Calpha-C' bond (i.e., variation of psi) and for some degree of freedom about the peptide bond (i.e., small variations of omega), the characteristic ratios, (R2)o\/nl2, of the form I (cis) and form II (trans) poly(L-proline) chain have been calculated by a Monte Carlo method in which the conformational energies were used as weighting factors. The Monte Carlo method enabled short-range interactions (beyond those involved in a single residue) to be taken into account. The effect of the presence of a small amount of one form (say cis in a trans-rich chain) on (R2)o\/nl2 was also investigated. The results for the trans-rich form are in good agreement with values observed experimentally in solvents in which the poly(L-proline) chain is predominantly in form II; the presence of a small amount of cis residues reduces the characteristic ratio of the trans-rich form of poly(L-proline) significantly.","652":"Proton nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism studies were carried out on aqueous solutions of the tetrapeptide Asp-Lys-Thr-Gly (which appears as a bend at residues 35-38 of alpha-chymotrypsin) and its sequence variants Gly-Thr-Asp-Lys, Asp-Lys-Gly-Thr, and Lys-Thr-Gly-Asp; the N and C termini of all four tetrapeptides were blocked with CH3CO and NHCH3 groups, respectively. The spectroscopic data suggest that bend conformations may exist, to some extent, among the distributions of conformations in the first, third, and fourth, but not in the second, tetrapeptide. This result is consistent with empirical probabilities for the prediction of bend conformations in proteins. Conformational energy calculations on these four tetrapeptides support the indications from the experimental data. It thus appears that, because of short-range interactions, the tendency toward bend formation exists in short peptides, provided that both the composition and amino acid sequence are energetically favorable for bend formation.","653":"","654":"","655":"The relaxation behavior of the helix-coil transition has been investigated for all sizes of polypeptides. Unlike previously reported results, regardless of the size of polypeptides, the first-order kinetics plays a principal role in the relaxation process when a helical state is relaxed to a half-coiled state [i.e. s(f) is congruent to 1, where s(f) is the helix stability parameter at the final state]. On the other hand, when a helical state is relaxed to a coiled state [i.e., s(f) is less than 1], the zeroth-order kinetics plays a major role. In addition, the range of the validity of a kinetic version of the zipper model has been investigated. We have found that when a helical state is relaxed to a state where s(f) is less than or equal to 1, the zipper model is valid for polypeptides with chain length N satisfying the relation N is less than 1\/(sigmagammaC)1\/2 where sigma is the cooperativity parameter and gammaC is the coil nucleation rate parameter.","656":"A treatment of the configurational statistics of polysaccharides is given in the isomeric state approximation. All classes of linear polysaccharides of specifiec chemical sequence are treated simultaneously. Chain tortuosity arising from torsional motions about the chemical bonds of the glycosidic linkages is recognized explicitly as is the possibility for conformational isomerism of the sugar residues. Valence angles and lengths are taken to be fixed at the equilibrium values, and pyranose residues in their chair conformations are treated as inflexible constituents of the skeletal structure. Pyranose and furanose forms capable of pseudorotation may be incorporated as rigid skeletal entities as well, provided suitable attention is given to the selection and interpretation of the conformational isomeric states included. Separation of the configuration energy into independent contributions is shown to be impossible in general. Methods are described for assessing the influence of neighbor interactions on the populations of the several conformers of the sugar residues. The relative conformational free energy of the flexible and chair form conformers of pyranose sugars is discussed, and appropriate measures of polysaccharide chain flexibility and stiffness are suggested.","657":"Phenomenological theories of the form I in equilibrium to form II interconversion in poly(L-proline) have been presented by Schwarz (using the parameters s, sigma, beta', and beta'' in a 2 X 2 matrix formulation) and by the present authors (using the parameters s, sigma, betaC, and betaN in a 4 X 4 matrix formulation). In addition, a molecular theory was developed to compute s, sigma, beta', and beta'' under vacuum. In this paper, we take into account the effect of solvent on the parameters s, sigma, beta', and beta'' of the isothermal poly(L-proline) form I in equilibrium to form II interconversion. The growth parameter is sensitive to the binding of solvent molecules to the peptide CO groups, but the nucleation parameters sigma, beta', and beta'' are not affected by this type of solvent effect. The calculated values of s and sigma under vacuum are in good agreement with the corresponding values derived from experimental data. By combining the theoretical values of s, sigma, beta', and beta'' under vacuum with experimentally determined equilibrium constants for the binding of alcohols to the peptide CO groups (which differ in magnitude for form I and form II), it was possible to reproduce the experimental tranistion curves satisfactorily. Alternatively, the binding constants for alcohols, obtained by combining our theoretically computed parameters under vacuum with experimental equilibrium transition curves, are in a satisfactory agreement with those evaluated independently by infrared spectral measurements of the binding of alcohols to the peptide CO groups. It is pointed out that significant errors may arise in analyzing experimental data if short chains are included with long chains in the determination of s, sigma, beta', and beta'' from the equilibrium transition curves. The transition of poly(L-proline) from form II to form I when n-butyl alcohol is added to a solution of the polymer in benzyl alcohol is brought about by the slight difference in the binding free energies of both alcohols to the carbonyl groups of form II. The different binding affinities of two alcohols, ROH, to form II may arise from (a) the different hydrogen-bond strength between the alcohol and the proline carbonyl group, and (b) possible differences in nonbonded and electrostatic interactions between the R group and the binding-site environment of the proline carbonyl group. The greater binding affinity of form II (compared to form I) for given alcohol is attributed to the more open and extended conformation of form II.","658":"Phenomenological theories of the transition between helical form I (cis peptide bond) and helical form II (trans peptide bond) of poly(-L-proline), which is a typical order in equilibrium order transition, have been presented by Schwarz (using the parameters s, sigma, beta', and beta'' in a 2 X 2 matrix formulation) and by the present authors (using the parameters s, sigma betaC, and betaN in a 4 X 4 matrix formulation). A molecular theory of the same transition has been formulated to account for the phenomenological parameters. The statistical weights of regular helical sequences with and without junctions between the two forms were computed from empirical potential energy functions. Two puckering conformations of the pyrrolidine ring, i.e., with the Cgamma atom down and up, were allowed, and the free energy was computed for chains with four types of puckering, viz., regular down, regular up, random A, and random B, in the latter two of which the up and down puckerings were randomly distributed. The random A and random B chains have higher energy than those with regular down or up puckering, in both forms I and II. From both an energetical and a free energetical point of view, form I is more stable than form II under vacuum at room temperature. The dependence of the relative stabilities of form I and form II under vacuum on chain length was examined from both an energy and free energy point of view. The four parameters, s, sigma, beta', and beta'', which describe the transitions in Schwarz's theory, were calculated from the statistical weights of various types of sequences. It was found that the thermally induced transition between form I and II under vacuum occurs with the pyrrolidine rings remaining in the down conformation. The calculated values of s suggest that form I is more stable than form II in the regular down chain, while form II is more stable than form I in the regular up chain under vacuum at room temperature. The calculated values of sigma for regular down and regular up pyrrolidine ring puckering are in good agreement with experimental observations, whereas those for random A and random B puckering are much smaller than the experimental values. A theory for the effect of solvent on the parameters s, sigma, beta', and beta'' (at constant temperature) is developed, and the computations involving solvent effects are described in the next paper.","659":"The states of three residues are correlated in a nearest-neighbor Ising model matrix treatment of a one-dimensional phase transition, in which nucleation is assumed to differ at each end of a regular sequence (asymmetric nucleation). The correlation of the states of three residues requires a 4 X 4 matrix, which cannot be reduced in size because of the asymmetric nature of the nucleation. Also, because of the asymmetry, at least four independent parameters for a homopolymer (rather than the two usually encountered in the helix-coil transition), ant at least five for a specific-sequence copolymer, are required to describe the transition behavior. The most important current interest in such a treatment (for a homopolymer) is its applicability to the poly(L-proline) form I in equilibrium form II interconversion. The earlier treatment of Schwarz, using the nearest-neighbor Ising model (with correlation of only two residues), is identical with the above treatment, and requires only a 2 X 2 matrix which greatly simplifies numerical computations, which are presented in the next two papers of this series. However, the 4 X 4 matrix treatment is required in order to make the asymmetric nature of the nucleation explicit and physically understandable, for a homopolymer; for a specific-sequence copolymer, such as a protein, it is essential in order to show how the asymmetric nature of helix nucleation differs from one amino acid to another.","660":"It has been found that the fraction of glutamic acid residues which are helical in proteins is larger than might be expected from the experimentally determined value of the helical stability constants of glutamic acid. In order to understand this difference, the effect of neighboring charged side chains on the glutamic acid residues in proteins of known structure is examined. It is found that a positively charged side chain four residues away from a glutamic acid greatly enhances its probability to be helical. Similar results are obtained for aspartic acid, lysine, arginine, and histidine.","661":"The effects of volume exclusion on polymer chain conformations can be determined from the study of the angular dependence of radiation scattered by chain molecules. It is found that useful information can be obtained only when the variable x is large, where x is the product of the square of the magnitude of the scattering vector and of the mean square radius of gyration. Hence, solutions of macromolecules of very high molecular weight are needed for these investigations. The theoretical treatment of the scattering function is based on several assumptions. The validity of these assumptions is examined by computing, using a Monte-Carlo technique, various moments of intramolecular separations and comparing the results so obtained, in the limit of a chain of infinite length, with the analytical results. The computations seem to verify the validity of the theoretical model. The scattering behavior of solutions of recently synthesized polystyrene of Mw = 4.4 X 10(7) in cyclohexane at various temperatures and in benzene at 40 degrees was investigated. From the log-log plots of the scattering function vs. x, a statistical parameter was calculated, whose value depends on the magnitude of long-range correlations between any pair of chain elements. It is found that above the theta temperature this parameter is practically independent of temperature and that its numerical value was found to agree well with the value obtained from Monte-Carlo calculations. In the neighborhood of the theta temperature, this parameter decreases rapidly with decreasing temperature, indicating a first-order transition in chain conformation.","662":"The water solubility of poly(1-Me-5-VIm) has made it possible to achieve phenomenal rate enhancements and to gain even greater insight into the mechanism of catalysis by polymeric imidazoles. The poly(1-Me-5-VIm)-catalyzed hydrolysis of S12- exhibited saturation in excess catalyst nad in excess substrate. Inhibition of the poly(1-Me-5-Vim) catalyzed hydrolysis of Sn- type substrates by analog inhibitors was also observed. The saturation apparently did not follow a simple Michaelis-Menten mechanism; however, the results could be rationalized by analogy to certain enzymatic systems. Multisite enzymes have long been known to display kinetic patterns different from that exhibited by enzymes with only one active site, i.e. such phenomena as sigmoidal rate vs [S] plots. These phenomena may arise entirely as a result of the multisite nature of the enzyme. Consequently, a synthetic macromolecular catalyst with multiple sites might also be expected to display such characteristics. The poly(1-Me-5-VIm)-catalyzed hydrolysis of S12- is apparently the first synthetic system in which such phenomena have been observed. The intermediacy of an apolar polymer substrate complex for the poly(1-Me-5-VIm)-catalyzed hydrolysis of S12- in water was given support by studies of the effect of temperature on the rate of hydrolysis. Activation parameters were determined for catalysis by 1,5-DMIm and by poly(1-Me-5-VIm). These results showed that the rate enhancement exhibited by the polymer was due entirely to a favorable entropy term.","663":"In an effort to exploit the enhancement in catalytic activity which might be derived through hydrophobic interactions between polymeric catalyst and substrate, 1-methyl-5-vinylimidazole (1-Me-5-VIm), 1-methyl-4-vinylimidazole (1-Me-4-VIm), 1-butyl-5-vinylimidazole (1-Bu-5-VIm), and 1-butyl-4-vinylimidazole (1-Bu-4-VIm) have been synthesized and polymerized. In 28.5% ethanol-water, poly(1-alkyl-5-vinylimidazoles)proved to be efficient catalysts for the hydrolysis of various 3-nitro-4-acyloxybenzoic acids (Sn-, where n denotes the acyl chain length). Order of magnitude rate enhancements, as compared to the model compound, 1,5-dimethylimidazole (1,5-DMIm) were observed in the poly(1-alkyl-5-vinylimidazole)-catalyzed solvolysis of S12- and S18-. Poly(1-Me-5-VIm) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S18-88 times faster than does 1,5-DMIm. The poly(1-Me-5-VIm)-catalyzed hydrolysis of S18- in ethanol-water was analyzed in terms of a simple Michaelis-Menten type mechanism. Vmax and Km were determined to be 40.2 X 10(-7) M min-1 and 2.20 X 10(-5) M, respectively.","664":"The synthesis and characterization of water-soluble random copolymers containing L-glutamic acid with N5-(4-hydroxybutyl)-L-glutamine and the thermally induced helix-coil transitions of these copolymers in water and in 0.1 N KCl are described. The incorporation of L-glutamic acid was found to increase the helix content of the polymer at low pH and to decrease it at high pH even though the presence of 0.1 N KCl effectively eliminated the difference between the electrostatic free energies of the helix and the coil. The Zimm-Bragg parameters sigma and s for the helix-coil transition in poly(L-glutamic acid) in water and in 0.1 N KCl were deduced from an analysis of the melting curves of the copolymers in the manner described in earlier papers. The synthesis of N-acetyl-N'-methylglutamic acid amide and its titration, as well as that of the copolymers and poly(L-glutamic acid), in 0.1 N KCl are described.","665":"A Monte Carlo study of the distribution functions for the end-to-end distance and radius of gyration for hard-sphere models of poly(glycine) and poly(L-alanine) random coils has been conducted in the chain-length range n = 3 to 100 monomer units for both unperturbed chains and chains perturbed by long-range interactions (excluded volume effects). The distribution functions for the radius of gyration in all cases have been very precisely calculated, those for the perturbed end-to-end distance less precisely, and those for the unperturbed end-to-end distance least precisely. Empirical distribution functions of the form W(p) = ap-b exp(-cp-d) for the reduced end-to-end distance p = r\/\"r-2\"-one-half and a similar form for the reduced radius of gyration could be least-squares fit to the Monte Carlo data. The expansion factors alpha-r and alpha-s were calculated vs. chain length and were used to test various versions of the two-parameter theory of the excluded volume effect. To be consistent with the chain-length dependence of alpha-r and alpha-s as determined by the Monte Carlo calculations, each of these theories required two different binary cluster integrals, a beta-r based on alpha-r and a beta-s based on alpha-s, both of which were strongly chain-length dependent. Both of these results suggest that the two-parameter theory is not applicable to the models used in this study. It was also found that, except for very short chain lengths, plots of ln alphs-r vs. ln n were linear, and thus that alpha-r could be estimated for long chain lengths. Comparison of these estimates with the experimental data on four polypeptide chains in one-earth solvents that the hard-sphere models used in this study yield expansion factors that do not seriously overestimate the magnitude of the excluded volume effect.","666":"Cellulose microfibrils are viewed as imperfect array of elementary fibrils. We have investigated the possible defects in Valonia cellulose microfibrils, which are such that the microfibrils can be broken into elementary fibrils by deformation, but are not sufficient to allow for a small angle maximum corresponding to the elementary fibril dimension. The microfibril has been constructed by convolution of th elementary fibril with a two dimensional point lattice. Defects have been incorporated in the microfibril, first by introduction of gaps between the elementary fibrils. These regular gaps were then replaced by a statistical distribution of the elementary fibrils about the lattice points, modeled by Hosemann distortions of the first type. The cylindrically averaged transforms of such structures show that significant distortions can be incorporated within the microfibril without producing large scale changes in the equatorial intensity distribution. Larger distortions are necessary before a small angle maximum corresponding to the 35 A elementary fibril is predicted, by which stage the wide angle x-ray pattern is unacceptable.","667":"Dielectric dispersion measurements were made on dilute solutions of poly(epsilon-carbobenzoxy-L-lysine) in m-cresol; this system underwent a very sharp thermal helix-coil transition of inverse type around 30 degrees. Mean-square dipole moments \"mu-2\" and mean rotational relaxation times t were obtained as functions of molecular weight and helical fraction fN. It was found that \"mu-2\"-one-half varied almost linearly with fN-one-half over a substantial portion of the transition. The relaxation times corrected for solvent viscosity and temperature changed only slightly with fN except in the region of small fN, while, at fixed fN, they displayed molecular weight dependence characteristic of rod-like molecules. These results can be explained if the transition is assumed to proceed almost in all-or-none fashion. This assumption is consistent with the previous finding from statistical thermodynamic analyses that the transition of the system PCBL-m-cresol is highly cooperative, with standard deviation of population one-half being 0.0025 to 0.0027, where standard deviation of population is the cooperativity parameter. Application of Nagai's theory of \"mu-2\" for interrupted helices yielded the result that standard deviation of population-one-half was in the range 0.001 to 0.005 and the monomeric dipole moment in the helical conformation was 5.4 to 6.2 D.","668":"A simplified single virtual bond scheme has been developed for the calculation of mean-square unperturbed dimensions in polynucleotide chains. As a consequence of the structural rigidity of the sugar residues in the chain, it is possible to represent the six chemical bonds comprising the chain backbone repeating unit by a single virtual bond (connecting successive phosphorus atoms). The mutual orientation of a pair of adjoining virtual bonds is determined by the angles of rotation about the phosphodiester bonds adjoining intervening phosphorus atoms and is independent of the orientation of all other virtual bonds in the chain. Computed values of chain dimensions based on the single virtual bond scheme are comparable to those calculated previously using a two virtual bond model which permits rotational flexibility in the sugar moieties of the chain.","669":"The behavior of alpha-helical poly(gamma-phenacyl L-glutamate) (PPLG) has been studied by hydrodynamic, optical rotation, dielectric, and nmr measurements in different solvents. Special attention has been paid to side-chain interactions which depend on the ease of solvation of the phenacyl chromophore. Thus, in hexafluoro-2-propanol the circular dichroism spectrum is very similar to that usually observed for an alpha helix, and hydrogen bonding was shown to occur between the solvent and phenacyl CO group. In other heliocogenic solvents, side chain-side chain interactions occur. In dimethylformamide and pyridine they give rise at low temperature and low concentrations to an aggregation phenomenon whose molecular mechanism implies a molecular weight dependent folding of the molecules. Models for the side-chain conformation are proposed for the polymer in the solid state on the basis of infrared dichroism.","670":"The efficiency of energy transfer between a fluorescent donor, L-tyrosine, and a fluorescent acceptor, L-tryptophan, has been determined in R'-L-Trp-L-Ala-L-Tyr-R\", R-L-Trp-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Tyr-R\", and R'-L-Trp-Gly-L-Ala-L-Tyr-R\" in ethanol solution. The protecting groups R' and R\" were respectively tert-butyloxycarbonyl and methyl ester. A conformational theoretical analysis of molecules studied has been performed in parallel on the basis of semiempirical conformational potential energy function. In the theoretical models all the side chains have been represented by a methyl group. From the distribution of distances between chromophores obtained theoretically, transfer efficiencies have been computed assuming a random orientation of the chromophores (k-2 equals 2\/3). The comparison of calculated efficiencies with the values determined experimentally for the same value of k-2 has been used as a check for the theoretical model. Both experimental and theoretical studies have been shown that the glycyl residue procudes a reduction of dimensions when it replaces in a tetrapeptide a residue with a beta-carbon atom such as the L-alanyl residue. However, only a qualitative agreement between experimental and theoretical values of the efficiencies has been obtained.","671":"","672":"","673":"","674":"","675":"","676":"","677":"","678":"","679":"","680":"","681":"","682":"","683":"","684":"","685":"","686":"","687":"","688":"","689":"","690":"","691":"","692":"","693":"","694":"","695":"","696":"","697":"","698":"","699":"","700":"","701":"","702":"","703":"","704":"","705":"","706":"","707":"","708":"","709":"","710":"","711":"","712":"","713":"","714":"","715":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Hybrid
