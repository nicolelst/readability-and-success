increasing number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been found to regulate gene expression and protein functions, playing important roles in diverse biological processes and diseases. Their crucial functions have been reported in almost every cell type and all stages of skin wound healing. Evidence of their pathogenetic roles in common wound complications, such as chronic nonhealing wounds and excessive scarring, is also accumulating. Given their unique expression and functional properties, ncRNAs are promising therapeutic and diagnostic entities. In this review, we discuss current knowledge about the functional roles of noncoding elements, such as microRNAs, long ncRNAs, and circular RNAs, in skin wound healing, focusing on in vivo evidence from studies of human wound samples and animal wound models. Finally, we provide a perspective on the outlook of ncRNA-based therapeutics in wound care.","2":"","3":"Sex as a biological variable is the focus of much literature and has been emphasized by the National Institutes of Health, in part, to remedy a long history of male-dominated studies in preclinical and clinical research. We propose that time-of-day is also a crucial biological variable in biomedical research. In common with sex differences, time-of-day should be considered in analyses and reported to improve reproducibility of studies and to provide the appropriate context to the conclusions. Endogenous circadian rhythms are present in virtually all living organisms, including bacteria, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Virtually all physiological and behavioral processes display daily fluctuations in optimal performance that are driven by these endogenous circadian clocks; importantly, many of those circadian rhythms also show sex differences. In this review, we describe some of the documented sex differences in circadian rhythms.","4":"Wound healing requires a complex cascade of highly controlled and conserved cellular and molecular processes. These involve numerous cell types and extracellular matrix molecules regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. This microscopic network of filaments is present within the cytoplasm of all cells and provides the shape and mechanical support required for cell movement and proliferation. Here, an overview of the processes of wound healing are described from the perspective of the cell in relation to the actin cytoskeleton. Key points of discussion include the role of actin, its binding proteins, signaling pathways, and events that play significant roles in the phases of wound healing. The identification of cytoskeletal targets that can be used to manipulate and improve wound healing is included as an emerging area of focus that may inform future therapeutic approaches to improve healing of complex wounds.","5":"","6":"Imaginal discs are simple epithelial sacs found in Drosophila larvae, which generate adult structures including wings and legs. The first studies of imaginal disc regeneration involved technically challenging transplantation experiments. Yet despite the difficulty, many aspects of regeneration including wound healing, blastema formation, and the repatterning of regenerated tissue were characterized. An important discovery was the phenomenon of transdetermination, where a small group of cells in regenerating tissue collectively switch fate (\"collective cell reprogramming\"). The development of genetic tissue-ablation systems over the last 12 years has energized this field, by making experiments less technically challenging, more reproducible, and by incorporating additional genetic analysis. Recent progress includes defining mechanistic links between early responses to wounding and the signaling pathways that drive proliferation, uncovering a role for localized silencing of damage-responsive enhancers to limit regenerative capacity as tissues mature, and identifying genes that maintain cellular plasticity within acceptable limits during regeneration.","7":"Investigations of sex differences in the human brain take place on politically sensitive terrain. While some scholars express concern that gendered biases and stereotypes remain embedded in scientific research, others are alarmed about the politicization of science. To help better understand these debates, this review sets out three kinds of conflicts that can arise in the neuroscience of sex differences: academic freedom versus gender equality; frameworks, background assumptions, and dominant methodologies; and inductive risk and social values. The boundaries between fair criticism and politicization are explored for each kind of conflict, pointing to ways in which the academic community can facilitate fair criticism while protecting against politicization.","8":"Embryonic development and cell specification have been viewed as an epigenetically rigid process. Through accumulation of irreversible epigenetic marks, the differentiation process has been considered unidirectional, and once completed cell specification would be permanent and stable. However, somatic cell nuclear transfer that involved the implantation of a somatic nucleus into a previously enucleated oocyte accomplished in amphibians in the 1950s and in mammals in the late 1990s-resulting in the birth of \"Dolly the sheep\"-clearly showed that \"terminal\" differentiation is reversible. In parallel, work on lineage-determining factors like MyoD revealed surprising potential to modulate lineage identity in somatic cells. This work culminated in the discovery that a set of four defined factors can reprogram fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which were shown to be molecularly and functionally equivalent to blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells, thus essentially showing that defined factors can induce authentic reprogramming without the need of oocytes. This concept was further extended when it was shown that fibroblasts can be directly converted into neurons, showing induced lineage conversion is possible even between cells representing two different germ layers. These findings suggest that \"everything is possible\" (i.e., once key lineage reprogramming factors are identified, cells should be able to convert into any desired lineage).","9":"In laboratory animals, exposure to gonadal steroid hormones before and immediately after birth can exert permanent effects on many behaviors, particularly reproductive behaviors. The extent to which such effects occur in humans remains an open question, but several lines of evidence indicate that perinatal levels of both androgens and estrogens may affect adult human psychology and behavior, including sexual orientation and gender nonconformity. Some putative indicators of prenatal androgen exposure, including the ratio of the length of the index finger to that of the ring finger (2D:4D), have repeatedly indicated that lesbians, on average, were exposed to more prenatal androgens than straight women, suggesting that sufficient fetal androgen exposure predisposes a fetus to gynephilia (attraction to women) at maturity. The digit ratios of gay men do not differ from those of straight men, suggesting that prenatal androgen levels are not responsible for their androphilia (attraction to men). However, evidence that gay men who prefer an insertive anal sex role (ASR) have more masculine digit ratios than those preferring a receptive ASR suggests that early androgens influence some sexual preferences in men. Furthermore, digit ratios among gay men have been found to correlate with recalled childhood gender nonconformity (CGN). People with isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD) offer further insight into the effects of perinatal gonadal steroid exposure. In people with IGD, gonadal hormone production is low or absent after the first trimester of gestation. However, because placental gonadotropins drive gonadal hormone secretion during the first trimester when genitalia sexually differentiate, individuals with IGD are unambiguously male or female at birth, consistent with their chromosomal and gonadal sex. Men with IGD report greater CGN, again suggesting that perinatal androgen exposure contributes to male-typical behavioral patterns in humans. Interestingly, women with IGD report less androphilia and more bisexuality than control women, suggesting that perinatal ovarian steroids in females typically augment androphilia in adulthood. Taken together, these findings indicate that the perinatal hormonal milieu influences human sexual orientation and gender conformity.","10":"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration is the remarkable process by which extremely rare, normally inactive cells of the bone marrow can replace an entire organ if called to do so by injury or harnessed by transplantation. HSC research is arguably the first quantitative single-cell science and the foundation of adult stem cell biology. Bone marrow transplant is the oldest and most refined technique of regenerative medicine. Here we review the intertwined history of the discovery of HSCs and bone marrow transplant, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HSC self-renewal, and the use of HSCs and their derivatives for cell therapy.","11":"Despite the evolutionary loss of tissue regenerative potential, robust skeletal muscle repair processes are largely retained even in higher vertebrates. In mammals, the skeletal muscle regeneration program is driven by resident stem cells termed satellite cells, guided by the coordinated activity of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors and other cell types. A thorough understanding of muscle repair mechanisms is crucial not only for combating skeletal myopathies, but for its prospective aid in devising therapeutic strategies to endow regenerative potential on otherwise regeneration-deficient organs. In this review, we discuss skeletal muscle regeneration from an evolutionary perspective, summarize the current knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and highlight novel paradigms of muscle repair revealed by explorations of the recent decade.","12":"The regenerative capabilities of the liver represent a paradigm for understanding tissue repair in solid organs. Regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rodent models is well understood, while regeneration in the context of clinically relevant chronic injuries is less studied. Given the growing incidence of fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, interest in liver regeneration is increasing. Here, we will review the principles, genetics, and cell biology underlying liver regeneration, as well as new approaches being used to study heterogeneity in liver tissue maintenance and repair.","13":"Lung epithelium, the lining that covers the inner surface of the respiratory tract, is directly exposed to the environment and thus susceptible to airborne toxins, irritants, and pathogen-induced damages. In adult mammalian lungs, epithelial cells are generally quiescent but can respond rapidly to repair of damaged tissues. Evidence from experimental injury models in rodents and human clinical samples has led to the identification of these regenerative cells, as well as pathological metaplastic states specifically associated with different forms of damages. Here, we provide a compendium of cells and cell states that exist during homeostasis in normal lungs and the lineage relationships between them. Additionally, we discuss various experimental injury models currently being used to probe the cellular sources-both resident and recruited-that contribute to repair, regeneration, and remodeling following acute and chronic injuries. Finally, we discuss certain maladaptive regeneration-associated cell states and their role in disease pathogenesis.","14":"For hundreds of years, the question of why some organisms can regenerate missing body parts while others cannot has remained poorly understood. This has been due in great part to the inability to genetically, molecularly, and cellularly dissect this problem for most of the history of the field. It has only been in the past 20-30 years that important mechanistic advances have been made in methodologies that introduce loss and gain of gene function in animals that can regenerate. However, we still have a very incomplete understanding of how broadly regenerative abilities may be dispersed across species and whether or not such properties share a common evolutionary origin, which may have emerged independently or both. Understanding regeneration, therefore, will require rigorously practiced fundamental, curiosity-driven, discovery research. Expanding the number of research organisms used to study regeneration allows us to uncover aspects of this problem we may not yet know exist and simultaneously increases our chances of solving this long-standing problem of biology.","15":"Females have long been underrepresented in preclinical research and clinical drug trials. Directives by the U.S. National Institutes of Health have increased female participation in research protocols, although analysis of outcomes by sex remains infrequent. The long-held view that traits of female rats and mice are more variable than those of males is discredited, supporting equal representation of both sexes in most studies. Drug pharmacokinetic analysis reveals that, among subjects administered a standard drug dose, women are exposed to higher blood drug concentrations and longer drug elimination times. This contributes to increased adverse drug reactions in women and suggests that women are routinely overmedicated and should be administered lower drug doses than men. The past decade has seen progress in female inclusion, but key subsequent steps such as sex-based analysis and sex-specific drug dosing remain to be implemented.","16":"The zebrafish caudal fin has become a popular model to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of regeneration due to its high regenerative capacity, accessibility for experimental manipulations, and relatively simple anatomy. The formation of a regenerative epidermis and blastema are crucial initial events and tightly regulated. Both the regenerative epidermis and the blastema are highly organized structures containing distinct domains, and several signaling pathways regulate the formation and interaction of these domains. Bone is the major tissue regenerated from the progenitor cells of the blastema. Several cellular mechanisms can provide source cells for blastemal (pre-)osteoblasts, including dedifferentiation of differentiated osteoblasts and de novo formation from other cell types, providing intriguing examples of cellular plasticity. In recent years, omics analyses and single-cell approaches have elucidated genetic and epigenetic regulation, increasing our knowledge of the surprisingly complex coordination of various mechanisms to achieve successful restoration of a seemingly simple structure.","17":"The apparent virilization of the female spotted hyena raises questions about sex differences in behavior and morphology. We review these sex differences to find a mosaic of dimorphic traits, some of which conform to mammalian norms. These include space-use, dispersal behavior, sexual behavior, and parental behavior. By contrast, sex differences are reversed from mammalian norms in the hyena's aggressive behavior, social dominance, and territory defense. Androgen exposure early in development appears to enhance aggressiveness in female hyenas. Weapons, hunting behavior, and neonatal body mass do not differ between males and females, but females are slightly larger than males as adults. Sex differences in the hyena's nervous system are relatively subtle. Overall, it appears that the \"masculinized\" behavioral traits in female spotted hyenas are those, such as aggression, that are essential to ensuring consistent access to food; food critically limits female reproductive success in this species because female spotted hyenas have the highest energetic investment per litter of any mammalian carnivore. Evidently, natural selection has acted to modify traits related to food access, but has left intact those traits that are unrelated to acquiring food, such that they conform to patterns of sexual dimorphism in other mammals.","18":"Sex differences are commonly observed in behaviors that are closely linked to adaptive function, but sex differences can also be observed in behavioral \"building blocks\" such as locomotor activity and reward processing. Modern neuroscientific inquiry, in pursuit of generalizable principles of functioning across sexes, has often ignored these more subtle sex differences in behavioral building blocks that may result from differences in these behavioral building blocks. A frequent assumption is that there is a default (often male) way to perform a behavior. This approach misses fundamental drivers of individual variability within and between sexes. Incomplete behavioral descriptions of both sexes can lead to an overreliance on reduced \"single-variable\" readouts of complex behaviors, the design of which may be based on male-biased samples. Here, we advocate that the incorporation of new machine-learning tools for collecting and analyzing multimodal \"big behavior\" data allows for a more holistic and richer approach to the quantification of behavior in both sexes. These new tools make behavioral description more robust and replicable across laboratories and species, and may open up new lines of neuroscientific inquiry by facilitating the discovery of novel behavioral states. Having more accurate measures of behavioral diversity in males and females could serve as a hypothesis generator for where and when we should look in the brain for meaningful neural differences.","19":"The skin forms a crucial, dynamic barrier between an animal and the external world. In mammals, three stem cell populations possess robust regenerative potential to maintain and repair the body's protective surface: epidermal stem cells, which maintain the stratified epidermis; hair follicle stem cells, which power the cyclic growth of the hair follicle; and melanocyte stem cells, which regenerate pigment-producing melanocytes to color the skin and hair. These stem cells reside in complex microenvironments (\"niches\") comprising diverse cellular repertoires that enable stem cells to rejuvenate tissues during homeostasis and regenerate them upon injury. Beyond their niches, skin stem cells can also sense and respond to fluctuations in organismal health or changes outside the body. Here, we review these diverse cellular interactions and highlight how far-reaching signals can be transmitted at the local level to enable skin stem cells to tailor their actions to suit the particular occasion and optimize fitness.","20":"Salamanders, such as axolotls and newts, can regenerate complex tissues including entire limbs. But what mechanisms ensure that an amputated limb regenerates a limb, and not a tail or unpatterned tissue? An important concept in regeneration is positional memory-the notion that adult cells \"remember\" spatial identities assigned to them during embryogenesis (e.g., \"head\" or \"hand\") and use this information to restore the correct body parts after injury. Although positional memory is well documented at a phenomenological level, the underlying cellular and molecular bases are just beginning to be decoded. Herein, we review how major principles in positional memory were established in the salamander limb model, enabling the discovery of positional memory-encoding molecules, and advancing insights into their pattern-forming logic during regeneration. We explore findings in other amphibians, fish, reptiles, and mammals and speculate on conserved aspects of positional memory. We consider the possibility that manipulating positional memory in human cells could represent one route toward improved tissue repair or engineering of patterned tissues for therapeutic purposes.","21":"","22":null,"23":"The intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous cellular turnover, making it an attractive model to study tissue renewal and regeneration. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) can both self-renew and differentiate along all epithelial cell lineages. Decisions about which fate to pursue are controlled by a balance between high Wnt signaling at the crypt bottom, where Lgr5 + ISCs reside, and increasing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) levels toward the villus, where differentiated cells are located. Under stress conditions, epithelial cells in the intestine are quite plastic, with dedifferentiation, the reversal of cell fate from a differentiated cell to a more stem-like cell, allowing for most mature epithelial cell types to acquire stem cell-like properties. The ISC niche, mainly made up of mesenchymal, immune, enteric neuronal, and endothelial cells, plays a central role in maintaining the physiological function of the intestine. Additionally, the immune system and the microbiome play an essential role in regulating intestinal renewal. The development of various mouse models, organoid co-cultures and single-cell technologies has led to advances in understanding signals emanating from the mesenchymal niche. Here, we review how intestinal regeneration is driven by stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, with an emphasis on the niche that fine tunes these processes in both homeostasis and injury conditions.","24":"The regenerative capacity of the vertebrate retina varies substantially across species. Whereas fish and amphibians can regenerate functional retina, mammals do not. In this perspective piece, we outline the various strategies nonmammalian vertebrates use to achieve functional regeneration of vision. We review key differences underlying the regenerative potential across species including the cellular source of postnatal progenitors, the diversity of cell fates regenerated, and the level of functional vision that can be achieved. Finally, we provide an outlook on the field of engineering the mammalian retina to replace neurons lost to injury or disease.","25":"The capacity for regeneration is broad in the animal kingdom. Planarians are flatworms that can regenerate any missing body part and their regenerative powers have combined with ease of experimentation to make them a classic regeneration model for more than a century. Pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts generate missing planarian tissues. Fate specification happens in the neoblasts, and this can occur in response to regeneration instructions in the form of positional information. Fate specification can lead to differentiating cells in single steps rather than requiring a long lineage hierarchy. Planarians display constitutive expression of positional information from muscle cells, which is required for patterned maintenance of tissues in tissue turnover. Amputation leads to the rapid resetting of positional information in a process triggered by wound signaling and the resetting of positional information is required for regeneration. These findings suggest a model for planarian regeneration in which adult positional information resets after injury to regulate stem cells to bring about the replacement of missing parts.","26":"Axons are a unique cellular structure that allows for the communication between neurons. Axon damage compromises neuronal communications and often leads to functional deficits. Thus, developing strategies that promote effective axon regeneration for functional restoration is highly desirable. One fruitful approach is to dissect the regenerative mechanisms used by some types of neurons in both mammalian and nonmammalian systems that exhibit spontaneous regenerative capacity. Additionally, numerous efforts have been devoted to deciphering the barriers that prevent successful axon regeneration in the most regeneration-refractory system-the adult mammalian central nervous system. As a result, several regeneration-promoting strategies have been developed, but significant limitations remain. This review is aimed to summarize historic progression and current understanding of this exciting yet incomplete endeavor.","27":"Microscopy and genomic approaches provide detailed descriptions of the three-dimensional folding of chromosomes and nuclear organization. The fundamental question is how activity of molecules at the nanometer scale can lead to complex and orchestrated spatial organization at the scale of chromosomes and the whole nucleus. At least three key mechanisms can bridge across scales: (1) tethering of specific loci to nuclear landmarks leads to massive reorganization of the nucleus; (2) spatial compartmentalization of chromatin, which is driven by molecular affinities, results in spatial isolation of active and inactive chromatin; and (3) loop extrusion activity of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) complexes can explain many features of interphase chromatin folding and underlies key phenomena during mitosis. Interestingly, many features of chromosome organization ultimately result from collective action and the interplay between these mechanisms, and are further modulated by transcription and topological constraints. Finally, we highlight some outstanding questions that are critical for our understanding of nuclear organization and function. We believe many of these questions can be answered in the coming years.","28":"","29":"Depression and related mood disorders constitute an enormous burden on health, quality of life, and the global economy, and women have roughly twice the lifetime risk of men for experiencing depression. Here, we review sex differences in human brain physiology that may be connected to the increased susceptibility of women to major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, we summarize decades of preclinical research using animal models for the study of mood dysfunction that uncover some of the potential molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms that may underlie sex differences and disease etiology. We place particular emphasis on a series of recent studies demonstrating the central contribution of the circuit projecting from ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens and how inherent sex differences in the excitability of this circuit may predict and drive depression-related behaviors. The findings covered in this review underscore the continued need for studies using preclinical models and circuit-specific strategies for uncovering molecular and physiological mechanisms that could lead to potential sex-specific diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and\/or treatments for MDD and other mood disorders.","30":"This work reviews nuclear compartments, defined broadly to include distinct nuclear structures, bodies, and chromosome domains. It first summarizes original cytological observations before comparing concepts of nuclear compartments emerging from microscopy versus genomic approaches and then introducing new multiplexed imaging approaches that promise in the future to meld both approaches. I discuss how previous models of radial distribution of chromosomes or the binary division of the genome into A and B compartments are now being refined by the recognition of more complex nuclear compartmentalization. The poorly understood question of how these nuclear compartments are established and maintained is then discussed, including through the modern perspective of phase separation, before moving on to address possible functions of nuclear compartments, using the possible role of nuclear speckles in modulating gene expression as an example. Finally, the review concludes with a discussion of future questions for this field.","31":"Our understanding of how genomic DNA is tightly packed inside the nucleus, yet is still accessible for vital cellular processes, has grown dramatically over recent years with advances in microscopy and genomics technologies. Computational methods have played a pivotal role in the structural interpretation of experimental data, which helped unravel some organizational principles of genome folding. Here, we give an overview of current computational efforts in mechanistic and data-driven 3D chromatin structure modeling. We discuss strengths and limitations of different methods and evaluate the added value and benefits of computational approaches to infer the 3D structural and dynamic properties of the genome and its underlying mechanisms at different scales and resolution, ranging from the dynamic formation of chromatin loops and topological associated domains to nuclear compartmentalization of chromatin and nuclear bodies.","32":"It has long been proposed that nuclear RNAs might play an important role in organizing the structure of the nucleus. Initial experiments performed more than 30 years ago found that global disruption of RNA led to visible rearrangements of nuclear organization. Yet, this idea remained controversial for many years, in large part because it was unclear what specific RNAs might be involved, and which specific nuclear structures might be dependent on RNA. Over the past few years, the contributions of RNA to organizing nuclear structures have become clearer with the discovery that many nuclear bodies are enriched for specific noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); in specific cases, ncRNAs have been shown to be essential for establishment and maintenance of these nuclear structures. More recently, many different ncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in initiating the three-dimensional (3D) spatial organization of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules in the nucleus. These examples, combined with global imaging and genomic experiments, have begun to paint a picture of a broader role for RNA in nuclear organization and to uncover a unifying mechanism that may explain why RNA is a uniquely suited molecule for this role. In this review, we provide an overview of the history of RNA and nuclear structure and discuss key examples of RNA-mediated bodies, the global roles of ncRNAs in shaping nuclear structure, and emerging insights into mechanisms of RNA-mediated nuclear organization.","33":"Auxin has always been at the forefront of research in plant physiology and development. Since the earliest contemplations by Julius von Sachs and Charles Darwin, more than a century-long struggle has been waged to understand its function. This largely reflects the failures, successes, and inevitable progress in the entire field of plant signaling and development. Here I present 14 stations on our long and sometimes mystical journey to understand auxin. These highlights were selected to give a flavor of the field and to show the scope and limits of our current knowledge. A special focus is put on features that make auxin unique among phytohormones, such as its dynamic, directional transport network, which integrates external and internal signals, including self-organizing feedback. Accented are persistent mysteries and controversies. The unexpected discoveries related to rapid auxin responses and growth regulation recently disturbed our contentment regarding understanding of the auxin signaling mechanism. These new revelations, along with advances in technology, usher us into a new, exciting era in auxin research.","34":"Lamins interact with a host of nuclear membrane proteins, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, signaling molecules, splicing factors, and even chromatin itself to form a nuclear subcompartment, the nuclear lamina, that is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the governance of nuclear integrity, nuclear positioning, mitosis, DNA repair, DNA replication, splicing, signaling, mechanotransduction and -sensation, transcriptional regulation, and genome organization. Lamins are the primary scaffold for this nuclear subcompartment, but interactions with lamin-associated peptides in the inner nuclear membrane are self-reinforcing and mutually required. Lamins also interact, directly and indirectly, with peripheral heterochromatin domains called lamina-associated domains (LADs) and help to regulate dynamic 3D genome organization and expression of developmentally regulated genes.","35":"Dramatic nuclear reorganization occurs during early development to convert terminally differentiated gametes to a totipotent zygote, which then gives rise to an embryo. Aberrant epigenome resetting severely impairs embryo development and even leads to lethality. How the epigenomes are inherited, reprogrammed, and reestablished in this critical developmental period has gradually been unveiled through the rapid development of technologies including ultrasensitive chromatin analysis methods. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on epigenetic reprogramming in gametogenesis and embryogenesis, and how it contributes to gamete maturation and parental-to-zygotic transition. Finally, we highlight the key questions that remain to be answered to fully understand chromatin regulation and nuclear reprogramming in early development.","36":"Limb loss due to traumatic injury or amputation is a major biomedical burden. Many vertebrates exhibit the ability to form and pattern normal limbs during embryogenesis from amorphous clusters of precursor cells, hinting that this process could perhaps be activated later in life to rebuild missing or damaged limbs. Indeed, some animals, such as salamanders, are proficient regenerators of limbs throughout their life span. Thus, research over the last century has sought to stimulate regeneration in species that do not normally regenerate their appendages. Importantly, these efforts are not only a vital aspect of regenerative medicine, but also have fundamental implications for understanding evolution and the cellular control of growth and form throughout the body. Here we review major recent advances in augmenting limb regeneration, summarizing the degree of success that has been achieved to date in frog and mammalian models using genetic, biochemical, and bioelectrical interventions. While the degree of whole limb repair in rodent models has been modest to date, a number of new technologies and approaches comprise an exciting near-term road map for basic and clinical progress in regeneration.","37":"","38":"In adult insects, as in vertebrates, the gut epithelium is a highly regenerative tissue that can renew itself rapidly in response to changing inputs from nutrition, the gut microbiota, ingested toxins, and signals from other organs. Because of its cellular and genetic similarities to the mammalian intestine, and its relevance as a target for the control of insect pests and disease vectors, many researchers have used insect intestines to address fundamental questions about stem cell functions during tissue maintenance and regeneration. In Drosophila, where most of the experimental work has been performed, not only are intestinal cell types and behaviors well characterized, but numerous cell signaling interactions have been detailed that mediate gut epithelial regeneration. A prevailing model for regenerative responses in the insect gut invokes stress sensing by damaged enterocytes (ECs) as a principal source for signaling that activates the division of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the growth and differentiation of their progeny. However, extant data also reveal alternative mechanisms for regeneration that involve ISC-intrinsic functions, active culling of healthy epithelial cells, enhanced EC growth, and even cytoplasmic shedding by infected ECs. This article reviews current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in gut regeneration in several insect models (Drosophila and Aedes of the order Diptera, and several Lepidoptera).","39":"In this review, we present the current state of knowledge surrounding mammalian digit tip regeneration. We discuss the origin and formation of the blastema, a structure integral to digit tip regeneration, as well as recent insights driven by single-cell RNA sequencing into the molecular markers and cellular composition of the blastema. The digit tip is a composite of many different tissue types and we address what is known about the role of these separate tissues in regeneration of the whole digit tip. Specifically, we discuss the most extensively studied tissues in the digit tip: bone, nail epithelium, and peripheral nerves. We also address how known molecular pathways in limb development can inform research into digit tip regeneration. Overall, the mouse digit tip is an excellent model of complex mammalian regeneration that can provide insight into inducing regeneration in human tissues.","40":"Root system architecture is an important determinant of below-ground resource capture and hence overall plant fitness. The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in almost every facet of root development from the cellular to the whole-root-system level. Here, using Arabidopsis as a model, we review the multiple gene signaling networks regulated by auxin biosynthesis, conjugation, and transport that underpin primary and lateral root development. We describe the role of auxin in establishing the root apical meristem and discuss how the tight spatiotemporal regulation of auxin distribution controls transitions between cell division, cell growth, and differentiation. This includes the localized reestablishment of mitotic activity required to elaborate the root system via the production of lateral roots. We also summarize recent discoveries on the effects of auxin and auxin signaling and transport on the control of lateral root gravitropic setpoint angle (GSA), a critical determinant of the overall shape of the root system. Finally, we discuss how environmental conditions influence root developmental plasticity by modulation of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and the canonical auxin signaling pathway.","41":"In eukaryotic cells, the genetic material is segregated inside the nucleus. This compartmentalization of the genome requires a transport system that allows cells to move molecules across the nuclear envelope, the membrane-based barrier that surrounds the chromosomes. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the central component of the nuclear transport machinery. These large protein channels penetrate the nuclear envelope, creating a passage between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through which nucleocytoplasmic molecule exchange occurs. NPCs are one of the largest protein assemblies of eukaryotic cells and, in addition to their critical function in nuclear transport, these structures also play key roles in many cellular processes in a transport-independent manner. Here we will review the current knowledge of the NPC structure, the cellular mechanisms that regulate their formation and maintenance, and we will provide a brief description of a variety of processes that NPCs regulate.","42":"One of the most fundamental questions in developmental biology is how one fertilized cell can give rise to a fully mature organism and how gene regulation governs this process. Precise spatiotemporal gene expression is required for development and is believed to be achieved through a complex interplay of sequence-specific information, epigenetic modifications, trans-acting factors, and chromatin folding. Here we review the role of chromatin folding during development, the mechanisms governing 3D genome organization, and how it is established in the embryo. Furthermore, we discuss recent advances and debated questions regarding the contribution of the 3D genome to gene regulation during organogenesis. Finally, we describe the mechanisms that can reshape the 3D genome, including disease-causing structural variations and the emerging view that transposable elements contribute to chromatin organization.","43":"In female eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression is achieved during development through transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes. Following X chromosome inactivation (XCI), the inactive X chromosome remains faithfully silenced throughout somatic cell divisions. XCI is dependent on Xist, a long noncoding RNA that coats and silences the X chromosome from which it is transcribed. Xist coating triggers a cascade of chromosome-wide changes occurring at the levels of transcription, chromatin composition, chromosome structure, and spatial organization within the nucleus. XCI has emerged as a paradigm for the study of such crucial nuclear processes and the dissection of their functional interplay. In the past decade, the advent of tools to characterize and perturb these processes have provided an unprecedented understanding into their roles during XCI. The mechanisms orchestrating the initiation of XCI as well as its maintenance are thus being unraveled, although many questions still remain. Here, we introduce key aspects of the XCI process and review the recent discoveries about its molecular basis.","44":"Here we discuss the developmental and homeostatic conditions necessary for Hydra regeneration. Hydra is characterized by populations of adult stem cells paused in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, ready to respond to injury signals. The body column can be compared to a blastema-like structure, populated with multifunctional epithelial stem cells that show low sensitivity to proapoptotic signals, and high inducibility of autophagy that promotes resistance to stress and starvation. Intact Hydra polyps also exhibit a dynamic patterning along the oral-aboral axis under the control of homeostatic organizers whose activity results from regulatory loops between activators and inhibitors. As in bilaterians, injury triggers the immediate production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals that promote wound healing and contribute to the reactivation of developmental programs via cell death and the de novo formation of new organizing centers from somatic tissues. In aging Hydra, regeneration is rapidly lost as homeostatic conditions are no longer pro-regenerative.","45":"Over the past two decades, it has become clear that the multiscale spatial and temporal organization of the genome has important implications for nuclear function. This review centers on insights gained from recent advances in light microscopy on our understanding of transcription. We discuss spatial and temporal aspects that shape nuclear order and their consequences on regulatory components, focusing on genomic scales most relevant to function. The emerging picture is that spatiotemporal constraints increase the complexity in transcriptional regulation, highlighting new challenges, such as uncertainty about how information travels from molecular factors through the genome and space to generate a functional output.","46":"","47":"The change in cell state from normal to malignant is driven fundamentally by oncogenic mutations in cooperation with epigenetic alterations of chromatin. These alterations in chromatin can be a consequence of environmental stressors or germline and\/or somatic mutations that directly alter the structure of chromatin machinery proteins, their levels, or their regulatory function. These changes can result in an inability of the cell to differentiate along a predefined lineage path, or drive a hyperactive, highly proliferative state with addiction to high levels of transcriptional output. We discuss how these genetic alterations hijack the chromatin machinery for the oncogenic process to reveal unique vulnerabilities and novel targets for cancer therapy.","48":"While some animals, such as planaria and hydra, appear to be capable of seemingly endless cycles of regeneration, most animals experience a gradual decline in fitness and ultimately die. The progressive loss of cell and tissue function, leading to senescence and death, is generally referred to as aging. Adult (\"tissue\") stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis and facilitate repair; however, age-related changes in stem cell function over time are major contributors to loss of organ function or disease in older individuals. Therefore, considerable effort is being invested in restoring stem cell function to counter degenerative diseases and age-related tissue dysfunction. Here, we will review strategies that could be used to restore stem cell function, including the use of environmental interventions, such as diet and exercise, heterochronic approaches, and cellular reprogramming. Maintaining optimal stem cell function and tissue homeostasis into late life will likely extend the amount of time older adults are able to be independent and lead healthy lives.","49":"Polyploidy is defined as a cell with three or more whole genome sets and enables cell growth across the kingdoms of life. Studies in model organisms have revealed that polyploid cell growth can be required for optimal tissue repair and regeneration. In mammals, polyploid cell growth contributes to repair of many tissues, including the liver, heart, kidney, bladder, and eye, and similar strategies have been identified in Drosophila and zebrafish tissues. This review discusses the heterogeneity and versatility of polyploidy in tissue repair and regeneration. Polyploidy has been shown to restore tissue mass and maintain organ size as well as protect against oncogenic insults and genotoxic stress. Polyploid cells can also serve as a reservoir for new diploid cells in regeneration. The numerous mechanisms to generate polyploid cells provide an unlimited resource for tissues to exploit to undergo repair or regeneration.","50":"Cells generate and sense mechanical forces that trigger biochemical signals to elicit cellular responses that control cell fate changes. Mechanical forces also physically distort neighboring cells and the surrounding connective tissue, which propagate mechanochemical signals over long distances to guide tissue patterning, organogenesis, and adult tissue homeostasis. As the largest and stiffest organelle, the nucleus is particularly sensitive to mechanical force and deformation. Nuclear responses to mechanical force include adaptations in chromatin architecture and transcriptional activity that trigger changes in cell state. These force-driven changes also influence the mechanical properties of chromatin and nuclei themselves to prevent aberrant alterations in nuclear shape and help maintain genome integrity. This review will discuss principles of nuclear mechanotransduction and chromatin mechanics and their role in DNA damage and cell fate regulation.","51":"Heart regeneration is a remarkable process whereby regrowth of damaged cardiac tissue rehabilitates organ anatomy and function. Unfortunately, the human heart is highly resistant to regeneration, which creates a shortage of cardiomyocytes in the wake of ischemic injury, and explains, in part, why coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Luckily, a detailed blueprint for achieving therapeutic heart regeneration already exists in nature because several lower vertebrate species successfully regenerate amputated or damaged heart muscle through robust cardiomyocyte proliferation. A growing number of species are being interrogated for cardiac regenerative potential, and several commonalities have emerged between those animals showing high or low innate capabilities. In this review, we provide a historical perspective on the field, discuss how regenerative potential is influenced by cardiomyocyte properties, mitogenic signals, and chromatin accessibility, and highlight unanswered questions under active investigation. Ultimately, delineating why heart regeneration occurs preferentially in some organisms, but not in others, will uncover novel therapeutic inroads for achieving cardiac restoration in humans.","52":"Within the nucleus, messenger RNA is generated and processed in a highly organized and regulated manner. Messenger RNA processing begins during transcription initiation and continues until the RNA is translated and degraded. Processes such as 5' capping, alternative splicing, and 3' end processing have been studied extensively with biochemical methods and more recently with single-molecule imaging approaches. In this review, we highlight how imaging has helped understand the highly dynamic process of RNA processing. We conclude with open questions and new technological developments that may further our understanding of RNA processing.","53":"From embryogenesis to fruit formation, almost every aspect of plant development and differentiation is controlled by the cellular accumulation or depletion of auxin from cells and tissues. The respective auxin maxima and minima are generated by cell-to-cell auxin transport via transporter proteins. Differential auxin accumulation as a result of such transport processes dynamically regulates auxin distribution during differentiation. In this review, we introduce all auxin transporter (families) identified to date and discuss the knowledge on prominent family members, namely, the PIN-FORMED exporters, ATP-binding cassette B (ABCB)-type transporters, and AUX1\/LAX importers. We then concentrate on the biochemical features of these transporters and their regulation by posttranslational modifications and interactors.","54":"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a highly conserved channel in the nuclear envelope that mediates mRNA export to the cytosol and bidirectional protein transport. Many chromosomal loci physically interact with nuclear pore proteins (Nups), and interactions with Nups can promote transcriptional repression, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional poising. Interaction with the NPC also affects the spatial arrangement of genes, interchromosomal clustering, and folding of topologically associated domains. Thus, the NPC is a spatial organizer of the genome and regulator of genome function.","55":"In eukaryotic cells, protein and RNA factors involved in genome activities like transcription, RNA processing, DNA replication, and repair accumulate in self-organizing membraneless chromatin subcompartments. These structures contribute to efficiently conduct chromatin-mediated reactions and to establish specific cellular programs. However, the underlying mechanisms for their formation are only partly understood. Recent studies invoke liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNAs in the establishment of chromatin activity patterns. At the same time, the folding of chromatin in the nucleus can drive genome partitioning into spatially distinct domains. Here, the interplay between chromatin organization, chromatin binding, and LLPS is discussed by comparing and contrasting three prototypical chromatin subcompartments: the nucleolus, clusters of active RNA polymerase II, and pericentric heterochromatin domains. It is discussed how the different ways of chromatin compartmentalization are linked to transcription regulation, the targeting of soluble factors to certain parts of the genome, and to disease-causing genetic aberrations.","56":"Auxin biology as a field has been at the forefront of advances in delineating the structures, dynamics, and control of plant growth networks. Advances have been enabled by combining the complementary fields of top-down, holistic systems biology and bottom-up, build-to-understand synthetic biology. Continued collaboration between these approaches will facilitate our understanding of and ability to engineer auxin's control of plant growth, development, and physiology. There is a need for the application of similar complementary approaches to improving equity and justice through analysis and redesign of the human systems in which this research is undertaken.","57":"Robust immunity to intracellular infections is mediated by antigen-specific naive CD8 T cells that become activated and differentiate into phenotypically and functionally diverse subsets of effector cells, some of which terminally differentiate and others that give rise to memory cells that provide long-lived protection. This developmental system is an outstanding model with which to elucidate how regulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional control establish gene expression programs that govern cell fate determination, insights from which are likely to be useful for informing the design of immunotherapeutic approaches to engineer durable immunity to infections and tumors. A unifying framework that describes how naive CD8 T cells develop into memory cells is still outstanding. We propose a model that incorporates a common early linear path followed by divergent paths that slowly lose capacity to interconvert and discuss classical and contemporary observations that support these notions, focusing on insights from transcriptional control and chromatin regulation.","58":"The pool of memory CD8 T cells is comprised of highly specialized subpopulations of cells with both shared and distinct functions. The ongoing study of T-cell memory is focused on how these different subpopulations arise, how the cells are maintained over the life of the host, and how the cells protect a host against reinfection. As a field we have used the convenience of a narrow range of surface markers to define and study these memory T-cell subsets. However, as we learn more about these cells, it is becoming clear that these broad definitions are insufficient to capture the complexity of the CD8 memory T-cell pool, and an updated definition of these cellular states are needed. Here, we discuss data that have recently arisen that highlight the difficulty in using surface markers to functionally characterize CD8 T-cell populations, and the possibility of using the epigenetic state of cells to more clearly define the functional capacity of CD8 memory T-cell subsets.","59":"","60":"Early studies of transmissible tumors in chickens provided evidence that viruses such as avian leukosis virus (ALV) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) can cause cancer in these animals. Doubts about the relevance to human tumors and failures to replicate some early work meant the field of tumor virology followed a bumpy course. Nevertheless, viruses that can cause cancers in rodents and humans were ultimately identified, and several Nobel prizes were awarded for work in this area. In this excerpt from his forthcoming book on the history of cancer research, Joe Lipsick looks back at the early history of tumor virus research, from some of the early false starts and debates, to discovery of reverse transcriptase, and identification of human papilloma virus (HPV) as the major cause of cervical cancer.","61":"Auxin signaling regulates growth and developmental processes in plants. The core of nuclear auxin signaling relies on just three components: TIR1\/AFBs, Aux\/IAAs, and ARFs. Each component is itself made up of several domains, all of which contribute to the regulation of auxin signaling. Studies of the structural aspects of these three core signaling components have deepened our understanding of auxin signaling dynamics and regulation. In addition to the structured domains of these components, intrinsically disordered regions within the proteins also impact auxin signaling outcomes. New research is beginning to uncover the role intrinsic disorder plays in auxin-regulated degradation and subcellular localization. Structured and intrinsically disordered domains affect auxin perception, protein degradation dynamics, and DNA binding. Taken together, subtle differences within the domains and motifs of each class of auxin signaling component affect signaling outcomes and specificity.","62":"Auxin signaling and patterning is an inherently complex process, involving polarized auxin transport, metabolism, and signaling, its effect on developmental zones, as well as growth rates, and the feedback between all these different aspects. This complexity has led to an important role for computational modeling in unraveling the multifactorial roles of auxin in plant developmental and adaptive processes. Here we discuss the basic ingredients of auxin signaling and patterning models for root development as well as a series of key modeling studies in this area. These modeling studies have helped elucidate how plants use auxin signaling to compute the size of their root meristem, the direction in which to grow, and when and where to form lateral roots. Importantly, these models highlight how auxin, through patterning of and collaborating with other factors, can fulfill all these roles simultaneously.","63":"Auxin regulates many aspects of plant development and behavior, including the initiation of new outgrowth, patterning of vascular systems, control of branching, and responses to the environment. Computational models have complemented experimental studies of these processes. We review these models from two perspectives. First, we consider cellular and tissue-level models of interaction between auxin and its transporters in shoots. These models form a coherent body of results exploring different hypotheses pertinent to the patterning of new outgrowth and vascular strands. Second, we consider models operating at the level of plant organs and entire plants. We highlight techniques used to reduce the complexity of these models, which provide a path to capturing the essence of studied phenomena while running simulations efficiently.","64":"To predict transcription, one needs a mechanistic understanding of how the numerous required transcription factors (TFs) explore the nuclear space to find their target genes, assemble, cooperate, and compete with one another. Advances in fluorescence microscopy have made it possible to visualize real-time TF dynamics in living cells, leading to two intriguing observations: first, most TFs contact chromatin only transiently; and second, TFs can assemble into clusters through their intrinsically disordered regions. These findings suggest that highly dynamic events and spatially structured nuclear microenvironments might play key roles in transcription regulation that are not yet fully understood. The emerging model is that while some promoters directly convert TF-binding events into on\/off cycles of transcription, many others apply complex regulatory layers that ultimately lead to diverse phenotypic outputs. Cracking this kinetic code is an ongoing and challenging task that is made possible by combining innovative imaging approaches with biophysical models.","65":"Immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity that confers long-lasting protection from reinfections. Memory CD8+ T cells provide protection by actively scanning for their cognate antigen and migrating into inflamed tissues. Trafficking patterns of CD8+ T cells are also a major determinant of cell fate outcomes during differentiation into effector and memory cell states. CD8+ T-cell trafficking must therefore be dynamically and tightly regulated to ensure that CD8+ T cells arrive at the correct locations and differentiate to acquire appropriate effector functions. This review aims to discuss the importance of CD8+ T-cell trafficking patterns in regulating effector and memory differentiation, maintenance, and reactivation.","66":"Not simply an attribute of the adaptive immune system, immunological memory can be viewed on multiple levels. Accordingly, the molecular basis of memory comprises multiple mechanisms. The advent of new sequencing technologies has greatly enhanced the understanding of gene regulation and lymphocyte specification, and improved measurement of chromatin states affords new insights into the epigenomic and transcriptomic programs that underlie memory. Beyond canonical genes, the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is becoming increasingly apparent, and it appears that there are more than two to three times as many lncRNAs as protein-coding genes. lncRNAs can directly interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins, and a single lncRNA can contain multiple modular domains and thus interact with different classes of molecules. Yet, most lncRNAs have not been tested for function, and even fewer knockout mice have been generated. It is therefore timely to consider new potential mechanisms that may contribute to immune memory.","67":"Immunological memory is a fundamental hallmark of the adaptive immune responses and one of the most relevant aspects of protective immunity. Our understanding of the processes of memory T-cell differentiation and maintenance of long-term immunity is continuously evolving, and recent advances highlight new regulatory networks and chromatin dynamic changes contributing to maintain T-cell identity and impeding the reprogramming of specific T-cell states. Here, the current understanding of the mechanisms that generate the diversity and the heterogeneity of CD8+ T-cell subsets will be discussed, focusing on the temporal and epigenetic mechanisms orchestrating the establishment and maintenance of distinct states of T-cell fate determination and functional commitment.","68":"","69":"Memory differentiation of CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations has been extensively studied and many key molecular players and transcriptional networks have been identified. But how regulatory principles, identified on this population level, translate to immune responses that originate from single antigen-specific T cells is only now being elucidated. Here, we provide a short summary of the approaches used for mapping the fate of individual T cells and their progeny in vivo. We then highlight which major questions, with respect to memory T-cell differentiation, have been addressed by studying the development of single-cell-derived T-cell families during infection or vaccination. We discuss how fate decisions of single T cells are modulated by the affinity of their TCR and further shaped through a coregulation of T-cell differentiation and T-cell proliferation. These current findings indicate the early segregation into slowly dividing T central memory precursors (CMPs) and rapidly dividing non-CMPs, as a key event that separates the developmental paths of long- and short-lived T cells.","70":"Since colonizing land, plants have developed mechanisms to tolerate a broad range of abiotic stresses that include flooding, drought, high salinity, and nutrient limitation. Roots play a key role acclimating plants to these as their developmental plasticity enables them to grow toward more favorable conditions and away from limiting or harmful stresses. The phytohormone auxin plays a key role translating these environmental signals into developmental outputs. This is achieved by modulating auxin levels and\/or signaling, often through cross talk with other hormone signals like abscisic acid (ABA) or ethylene. In our review, we discuss how auxin controls root responses to water, osmotic and nutrient-related stresses, and describe how the synthesis, degradation, transport, and response of this key signaling hormone helps optimize root architecture to maximize resource acquisition while limiting the impact of abiotic stresses.","71":"Mammalian genomes have distinct levels of spatial organization and structure that have been hypothesized to play important roles in transcription regulation. Although much has been learned about these architectural features with ensemble techniques, single-cell studies are showing a new universal trend: Genomes are stochastic and dynamic at every level of organization. Stochastic gene expression, on the other hand, has been studied for years. In this review, we probe whether there is a causative link between the two phenomena. We specifically discuss the functionality of chromatin state, topologically associating domains (TADs), and enhancer biology in light of their stochastic nature and their specific roles in stochastic gene expression. We highlight persistent fundamental questions in this area of research.","72":"We have discovered that the determination of CD4 effector and memory fates after infection is regulated not only by initial signals from antigen and pathogen recognition, but also by a second round of such signals at a checkpoint during the effector response. Signals to effectors determine their subsequent fate, inducing further progression to tissue-restricted follicular helpers, cytotoxic CD4 effectors, and long-lived memory cells. The follicular helpers help the germinal center B-cell responses that give rise to high-affinity long-lived antibody responses and memory B cells that synergize with T-cell memory to provide robust long-lived protection. We postulate that inactivated vaccines do not provide extended signals from antigen and pathogen beyond a few days, and thus elicit ineffective CD4 T- and B-cell effector responses and memory. Defining the mechanisms that underlie effective responses should provide insights necessary to develop vaccine strategies that induce more effective and durable immunity.","73":"Naive CD4+ T cells become memory cells after proliferating in response to their cognate major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-bound peptide and passing through an effector cell stage. The process by which CD4+ memory T cells emerge from the effector cell pool, however, is less well understood than in the case of CD8+ T cells. During certain acute infections, naive CD4+ T cells proliferate and differentiate into various forms of type 1 (Th1) and follicular helper (Tfh) effector cells. We review the evidence that about 10% of the cells in each of these subsets survive to become memory cells that resemble their effector cell precursors. The roles that asymmetric cell division, the TCF-1 transcription factor, metabolic activity, reactive oxygen species, and the IL-7 receptor play in the effector to memory cell transition are discussed. We propose a speculative model in which the metabolic activity needed for rapid clonal expansion also generates toxic products that induce apoptosis in most effector cells. Memory cells then arise from the effector cells in each subset that are at the low end of the metabolic activity spectrum.","74":"Auxin is a crucial growth regulator that governs plant development and responses to environmental perturbations. It functions at the heart of many developmental processes, from embryogenesis to organ senescence, and is key to plant interactions with the environment, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli. As remarkable as auxin is, it does not act alone, but rather solicits the help of, or is solicited by, other endogenous signals, including the plant hormones abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene, gibberellic acid, jasmonates, salicylic acid, and strigolactones. The interactions between auxin and other hormones occur at multiple levels: hormones regulate one another's synthesis, transport, and\/or response; hormone-specific transcriptional regulators for different pathways physically interact and\/or converge on common target genes; etc. However, our understanding of this crosstalk is still fragmentary, with only a few pieces of the gigantic puzzle firmly established. In this review, we provide a glimpse into the complexity of hormone interactions that involve auxin, underscoring how patchy our current understanding is.","75":"Plants, in contrast to animals, are unique in their capacity to postembryonically develop new organs due to the activity of stem cell populations, located in specialized tissues called meristems. Above ground, the shoot apical meristem generates aerial organs and tissues throughout plant life. It is well established that auxin plays a central role in the functioning of the shoot apical meristem. Auxin distribution in the meristem is not uniform and depends on the interplay between biosynthesis, transport, and degradation. Auxin maxima and minima are created, and result in transcriptional outputs that drive the development of new organs and contribute to meristem maintenance. To uncover and understand complex signaling networks such as the one regulating auxin responses in the shoot apical meristem remains a challenge. Here, we will discuss our current understanding and point to important research directions for the future.","76":"The molecular basis of the persistence of experienced T lymphocytes, also known as \"memory T lymphocytes,\" is still enigmatic. We are beginning to understand their considerable heterogeneity and topographic compartmentalization into memory T cells circulating through the body and those residing in a particular tissue. In some tissues, like murine spleen, subpopulations of memory T cells proliferating in the absence of antigen (homeostatic proliferation) have been described. Other populations are maintained resting in terms of transcription, mobility, and proliferation in dedicated survival niches organized by stromal cells. The survival of these memory T cells is conditional on being in such a niche, where they can persist for a lifetime. Circulating memory T lymphocytes of distinct immune responses slowly decline in numbers over time. The rules governing their entry into and exit from blood, as well as their lifestyle outside of the blood and their relation to resident memory T cells are poorly understood. Homeostasis of circulating, proliferating, and resting memory T cells is obviously controlled by different rheostats: tissue-exit and tissue-entry signals for circulating and proliferation-inducing signals for proliferating memory T cells. For tissue-resident, resting memory T cells, it is the availability of their survival niche. Apparently, this mechanism (i.e., the link between memory T cell and stromal cell) is so robust that it provides efficient T-cell memory over a lifetime in tissues such as the bone marrow.","77":"The auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) has endured a history of undulating prominence as a candidate receptor for this important phytohormone. Its capacity for binding auxin has not been in doubt, a feature adequately explained by its crystal structure, but any relevance of this to auxin signaling and plant development has been far more demanding to define. Over its research lifetime, it has been associated with many auxin-induced activities, including ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and cell shape, and the abundance of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane via control of endocytosis, all of which required its presence in the apoplast. Yet, ABP1 has a KDEL sequence that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum, where most of it remains. This mismatch has been more than adequately compensated for by the need for an auxin receptor to account for responses far too rapid to be executed through transcription and translation and the TIR1\/AuxIAA coreceptor system. However, discoveries showing that abp1-null mutants are not compromised for auxin signaling or development, that TIR1 or AFB1 are necessarily involved with very rapid responses at the plasma membrane, and that these rapid responses are mediated with intracellular auxin all suggest that ABP1's auxin-binding capacity is not physiologically relevant. Nevertheless, ABP1 is ubiquitous in higher plants and throughout plant tissues. We need to complete its history by defining its function inside plant cells.","78":"Auxin represents one of the most potent and most versatile hormonal signals in the plant kingdom. Built on a simple core of only a few dedicated components, the auxin signaling system plays important roles for diverse aspects of plant development, physiology, and defense. Key to the diversity of context-dependent functional outputs generated by cells in response to this small molecule are gene duplication events and sub-functionalization of signaling components on the one hand, and a deep embedding of the auxin signaling system into complex regulatory networks on the other hand. Together, these evolutionary innovations provide the mechanisms to allow each cell to display a highly specific auxin response that suits its individual requirements. In this review, we discuss the regulatory networks connecting auxin with a large number of diverse pathways at all relevant levels of the signaling system ranging from biosynthesis to transcriptional response.","79":"Genomic information is encoded on long strands of DNA, which are folded into chromatin and stored in a tiny nucleus. Nuclear chromatin is a negatively charged polymer composed of DNA, histones, and various nonhistone proteins. Because of its highly charged nature, chromatin structure varies greatly depending on the surrounding environment (e.g., cations, molecular crowding, etc.). New technologies to capture chromatin in living cells have been developed over the past 10 years. Our view on chromatin organization has drastically shifted from a regular and static one to a more variable and dynamic one. Chromatin forms numerous compact dynamic domains that act as functional units of the genome in higher eukaryotic cells and locally appear liquid-like. By changing DNA accessibility, these domains can govern various functions. Based on new evidences from versatile genomics and advanced imaging studies, we discuss the physical nature of chromatin in the crowded nuclear environment and how it is regulated.","80":"The formation of long-lived memory T cells is a critical feature of the adaptive immune response. T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to establish a functional memory population. While initial studies characterized key metabolic pathways necessary for memory T-cell development, recent findings highlight that metabolic regulation of memory T-cell subsets is diverse. Here we describe the different requirements for metabolic programs and metabolism-related signaling pathways in memory T-cell development. We further discuss the contribution of cellular metabolism to memory T-cell functional reprogramming and stemness within acute and chronic inflammatory environments. Last, we highlight knowledge gaps and propose approaches to determine the roles of metabolites and metabolic enzymes in memory T-cell fate. Understanding how cellular metabolism regulates a functionally diverse memory population will undoubtedly provide new therapeutic insights to modulate protective T-cell immunity in human disease.","81":"","82":"The plant hormone auxin governs many aspects of normal plant growth and development. Auxin also plays an important role in plant-microbe interactions, including interactions between plant hosts and pathogenic microorganisms that cause disease. It is now well established that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the most well-studied form of auxin, promotes disease in many plant-pathogen interactions. Recent studies have shown that IAA can act both as a plant hormone that modulates host signaling and physiology to increase host susceptibility and as a microbial signal that directly impacts the pathogen to promote virulence, but large gaps in our understanding remain. In this article, we review recent studies on the roles that auxin plays during plant-pathogen interactions and discuss the virulence mechanisms that many plant pathogens have evolved to manipulate host auxin signaling and promote pathogenesis.","83":null,"84":"Immunological memory and exhaustion are fundamental features of adaptive immunity. Recent advances reveal increasing heterogeneity and diversity among CD8 T-cell subsets, resulting in new subsets to annotate and understand. Here, we review our current knowledge of differentiation and maintenance of memory and exhausted CD8 T cells, including phenotypic classification, developmental paths, transcriptional and epigenetic features, and cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Additionally, we use this outline to discuss the nomenclature of effector, memory, and exhausted CD8 T cells. Finally, we discuss how new findings about these cell types may impact the therapeutic efficacy and development of immunotherapies targeting effector, memory, and\/or exhausted CD8 T cells in chronic infections and cancer.","85":"Memory T-cell responses are partitioned between the blood, secondary lymphoid organs, and nonlymphoid tissues. Tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells are a population of immune cells that remain permanently in tissues without recirculating in blood. These nonrecirculating cells serve as a principal node in the anamnestic response to invading pathogens and developing malignancies. Here, we contemplate how T-cell tissue residency is defined and shapes protective immunity in the steady state and in the context of disease. We review the properties and heterogeneity of Trm cells, highlight the critical roles these cells play in maintaining tissue homeostasis and eliciting immune pathology, and explore how they might be exploited to treat disease.","86":"Viral infection is intrinsically linked to the capacity of the virus to generate progeny. Many DNA and some RNA viruses need to access the nuclear machinery and therefore transverse the nuclear envelope barrier through the nuclear pore complex. Viral genomes then become chromatinized either in their episomal form or upon integration into the host genome. Interactions with host DNA, transcription factors or nuclear bodies mediate their replication. Often interfering with nuclear functions, viruses use nuclear architecture to ensure persistent infections. Discovering these multiple modes of replication and persistence served in unraveling many important nuclear processes, such as nuclear trafficking, transcription, and splicing. Here, by using examples of DNA and RNA viral families, we portray the nucleus with the virus inside.","87":"The nuclear compartment is delimited by a specialized expanded sheet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) known as the nuclear envelope (NE). Compared to the outer nuclear membrane and the contiguous peripheral ER, the inner nuclear membrane (INM) houses a unique set of transmembrane proteins that serve a staggering range of functions. Many of these functions reflect the exceptional position of INM proteins at the membrane-chromatin interface. Recent research revealed that numerous INM proteins perform crucial roles in chromatin organization, regulation of gene expression, genome stability, and mediation of signaling pathways into the nucleus. Other INM proteins establish mechanical links between chromatin and the cytoskeleton, help NE remodeling, or contribute to the surveillance of NE integrity and homeostasis. As INM proteins continue to gain prominence, we review these advancements and give an overview on the functional versatility of the INM proteome.","88":"Conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes comprise a mixture of naive and memory cells. Generation and survival of these T-cell subsets is under strict homeostatic control and reflects contact with self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and certain cytokines. Naive T cells arise in the thymus via T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent positive selection to self-peptide\/MHC complexes and are then maintained in the periphery through self-MHC interaction plus stimulation via interleukin-7 (IL-7). By contrast, memory T cells are largely MHC-independent for their survival but depend strongly on stimulation via cytokines. Whereas typical memory T cells are generated in response to foreign antigens, some arise spontaneously through contact of naive precursors with self-MHC ligands; we refer to these cells as memory-phenotype (MP) T cells. In this review, we discuss the generation and homeostasis of naive T cells and these two types of memory T cells, focusing on their relative interaction with MHC ligands and cytokines.","89":"Resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells permanently reside in nonlymphoid tissues where they act as a first line of defense against recurrent pathogens. How and when antigen-inexperienced CD8+ T cells differentiate into Trm has been a topic of major interest, as knowledge on how to steer this process may be exploited in the development of vaccines and anticancer therapies. Here, we first review the current understanding of the early signals that CD8+ T cells receive before they have entered the tissue and that govern their capacity to develop into tissue-resident memory T cells. Subsequently, we discuss the tissue-derived factors that promote Trm maturation in situ. Combined, these data sketch a model in which a subset of responding T cells develops a heightened capacity to respond to local cues present in the tissue microenvironment, which thereby imprints their ability to contribute to the tissue-resident memory CD8+ T-cell pool that provide local control against pathogens.","90":"","91":"Auxin regulates the transcription of auxin-responsive genes by the TIR1\/AFBs-Aux\/IAA-ARF signaling pathway, and in this way facilitates plant growth and development. However, rapid, nontranscriptional responses to auxin that cannot be explained by this pathway have been reported. In this review, we focus on several examples of rapid auxin responses: (1) the triggering of changes in plasma membrane potential in various plant species and tissues, (2) inhibition of root growth, which also correlates with membrane potential changes, cytosolic Ca2+ spikes, and a rise of apoplastic pH, (3) the influence on endomembrane trafficking of PIN proteins and other membrane cargoes, and (4) activation of ROPs (Rho of plants) and their downstream effectors such as the cytoskeleton or vesicle trafficking. In most cases, the signaling pathway triggering the response is poorly understood. A role for the TIR1\/AFBs in rapid root growth regulation is emerging, as well as the involvement of transmembrane kinases (TMKs) in the activation of ROPs. We discuss similarities and differences among these rapid responses and focus on their physiological significance, which remains an enigma in most cases.","92":"The generation of effective adaptive T-cell memory is a cardinal feature of the adaptive immune system. The establishment of protective T-cell immunity requires the differentiation of CD8+ T cells from a naive state to one where pathogen-specific memory CD8+ T cells are capable of responding to a secondary infection more rapidly and robustly without the need for further differentiation. The study of factors that determine the fate of activated CD8+ T cells into either effector or memory subsets has a long history. The advent of new technologies is now providing new insights into how epigenetic regulation not only impacts acquisition and maintenance of effector function, but also the maintenance of the quiescent yet primed memory state. There is growing appreciation that rather than distinct subsets, memory T-cell populations may reflect different points on a spectrum between the starting naive T-cell population and a terminally differentiated effector CD8+ T-cell population. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that the molecular mechanisms that underpin the rapid effector function of memory T cells are also observed in innate immune cells such as macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. This raises an interesting hypothesis that the memory\/effector T-cell state represents a default innate-like response to antigen recognition, and that it is the naive state that is the defining feature of adaptive immunity. These issues are discussed.","93":"Indole-3-acetic acid, that is, auxin, is a molecule found in a broad phylogenetic distribution of organisms, from bacteria to eukaryotes. In the ancestral land plant auxin was co-opted to be the paramount phytohormone mediating tropic responses and acting as a facilitator of developmental decisions throughout the life cycle. The evolutionary origins of land plant auxin biology genes can now be traced with reasonable clarity. Genes encoding the two enzymes of the land plant auxin biosynthetic pathway arose in the ancestral land plant by a combination of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria and possible neofunctionalization following gene duplication. Components of the auxin transcriptional signaling network have their origins in ancestral alga genes, with gene duplication and neofunctionalization of key domains allowing integration of a portion of the preexisting transcriptional network with auxin. Knowledge of the roles of orthologous genes in extant charophycean algae is lacking, but could illuminate the ancestral functions of both auxin and the co-opted transcriptional network.","94":"Plant fitness is largely dependent on the root, the underground organ, which, besides its anchoring function, supplies the plant body with water and all nutrients necessary for growth and development. To exploit the soil effectively, roots must constantly integrate environmental signals and react through adjustment of growth and development. Important components of the root management strategy involve a rapid modulation of the root growth kinetics and growth direction, as well as an increase of the root system radius through formation of lateral roots (LRs). At the molecular level, such a fascinating growth and developmental flexibility of root organ requires regulatory networks that guarantee stability of the developmental program but also allows integration of various environmental inputs. The plant hormone auxin is one of the principal endogenous regulators of root system architecture by controlling primary root growth and formation of LR. In this review, we discuss recent progress in understanding molecular networks where auxin is one of the main players shaping the root system and acting as mediator between endogenous cues and environmental factors.","95":"Immediately following the discovery of the structure of DNA and the semi-conservative replication of the parental DNA sequence into two new DNA strands, it became apparent that DNA replication is organized in a temporal and spatial fashion during the S phase of the cell cycle, correlated with the large-scale organization of chromatin in the nucleus. After many decades of limited progress, technological advances in genomics, genome engineering, and imaging have finally positioned the field to tackle mechanisms underpinning the temporal and spatial regulation of DNA replication and the causal relationships between DNA replication and other features of large-scale chromosome structure and function. In this review, we discuss these major recent discoveries as well as expectations for the coming decade.","96":"Heightened immunity after a primary infection, persistent control of low-level infection, or vanquished immunity from chronic-active infection and cancer are interrelated issues concerning the nature of T-cell regeneration during immunity. For many regenerating tissues and cellular systems, such as epithelia and blood, there are at least three distinguishable stages of development and repair, marked by progressive loss of self-renewal and progressive commitment to differentiation. T cells seem to be no different. Quiescent precursors become activated and yield anabolic, proliferative progenitors while self-renewing the quiescent precursor population. Activated progenitors then yield differentiated cellular descendants alongside the self-renewal of progenitors. Nomenclature reflecting the mutually opposing nature of T-cell self-renewal and T-cell differentiation would help synchronize phenomena such as T-cell memory, protective immunity, and T-cell exhaustion with other regenerative paradigms, as well as offer new strategies to influence the intensity and duration of immunity.","97":"","98":"Plant fitness depends on the adequate morphological adjustment to the prevailing conditions of the environment. Therefore, plants sense environmental cues through their life cycle, including the presence of full darkness, light, or shade, the range of ambient temperatures, the direction of light and gravity vectors, and the presence of water and mineral nutrients (such as nitrate and phosphate) in the soil. The environmental information impinges on different aspects of the auxin system such as auxin synthesis, degradation, transport, perception, and downstream transcriptional regulation to modulate organ growth. Although a single environmental cue can affect several of these points, the relative impacts differ significantly among the various growth processes and cues. While stability in the generation of precise auxin gradients serves to guide the basic developmental pattern, dynamic changes in the auxin system fine-tune body shape to optimize the capture of environmental resources.","99":"Bryophytes, including liverworts, mosses, and hornworts, are gametophyte-dominant land plants that are derived from a common ancestor and underwent independent evolution from the sporophyte-dominant vascular plants since their divergence. The plant hormone auxin has been shown to play pleiotropic roles in the haploid bodies of bryophytes. Pharmacological and chemical studies identified conserved auxin molecules, their inactivated forms, and auxin transport in bryophyte tissues. Recent genomic and molecular biological studies show deep conservation of components and their functions in auxin biosynthesis, inactivation, transport, and signaling in land plants. Low genetic redundancy in model bryophytes enable unique assays, which are elucidating the design principles of the auxin signaling pathway. In this article, the physiological roles of auxin and regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and development by auxin in Bryophyta are reviewed.","100":"Auxin influences all aspects of plant growth and development and exerts its function at scales ranging from the subcellular to the whole-organism level. A canonical mechanism for auxin signaling has been elucidated, which is based on derepression of downstream genes via ubiquitin-mediated degradation of transcriptional repressors. While the combinatorial nature of this canonical pathway provides great potential for specificity in the auxin response, alternative noncanonical signaling pathways required to mediate certain processes have been identified. One such pathway affects gene regulation in a manner that is reminiscent of mechanisms employed in animal hormone signaling, while another triggers transcriptional changes through auxin perception at the plasma membrane and the stabilization of transcriptional repressors. In some cases, the exact perception mechanisms and the nature of the receptors involved are yet to be revealed. In this review, we describe and discuss current knowledge on noncanonical auxin signaling and highlight unresolved questions surrounding auxin biology.","101":"Throughout plant development, vascular cells continually form from within a population of seemingly equivalent cells. Vascular cells connect end to end to form continuous strands, and vascular strands connect at both or either end to form networks of exquisite complexity and mesmerizing beauty. Here we argue that experimental evidence gained over the past few decades implicates the plant hormone auxin-its production, transport, perception, and response-in all the steps that lead to the patterned formation of the plant vascular system, from the formation of vascular cells to their connection into vascular networks. We emphasize the organizing principles of the cell- and tissue-patterning process, rather than its molecular subtleties. In the picture that emerges, cells compete for an auxin-dependent, cell-polarizing signal; positive feedback between cell polarization and cell-to-cell movement of the polarizing signal leads to gradual selection of cell files; and selected cell files differentiate into vascular strands that drain the polarizing signal from the neighboring cells. Although the logic of the patterning process has become increasingly clear, the molecular details remain blurry; the future challenge will be to bring them into razor-sharp focus.","102":"Molecular genetic and structural studies have revealed the mechanisms of fundamental components of key auxin regulatory pathways consisting of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. Chemical biology methods applied in auxin research have been greatly expanded through the understanding of auxin regulatory pathways. Many small-molecule modulators of auxin metabolism, transport, and signaling have been generated on the basis of the outcomes of genetic and structural studies on auxin regulatory pathways. These chemical modulators are now widely used as essential tools for dissecting auxin biology in diverse plants. This review covers the structures, primary targets, modes of action, and applications of chemical tools in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling.","103":"Embryogenesis in seed plants is the process during which a single cell develops into a mature multicellular embryo that encloses all the modules and primary patterns necessary to build the architecture of the new plant after germination. This process involves a series of cell divisions and coordinated cell fate determinations resulting in the formation of an embryonic pattern with a shoot-root axis and cotyledon(s). The phytohormone auxin profoundly controls pattern formation during embryogenesis. Auxin functions in the embryo through its maxima\/minima distribution, which acts as an instructive signal for tissue specification and organ initiation. In this review, we describe how disruptions of auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response severely affect embryo development. Also, the mechanism of auxin action in the development of the shoot-root axis and the three-tissue system is discussed with recent findings. Biological tools that can be implemented to study the auxin function during embryo development are presented, as they may be of interest to the reader.","104":"The major natural auxin in plants, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), orchestrates a plethora of developmental responses that largely depend on the formation of auxin concentration gradients within plant tissues. Together with inter- and intracellular transport, IAA metabolism-which comprises biosynthesis, conjugation, and degradation-modulates auxin gradients and is therefore critical for plant growth. It is now very well established that IAA is mainly produced from Trp and that the IPyA pathway is a major and universally conserved biosynthetic route in plants, while other redundant pathways operate in parallel. Recent findings have shown that metabolic inactivation of IAA is also redundantly performed by oxidation and conjugation processes. An exquisite spatiotemporal expression of the genes for auxin synthesis and inactivation have been shown to drive several plant developmental processes. Moreover, a group of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators controlling the expression of auxin metabolic genes have been identified in past years, which are illuminating the road to understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the coordinated responses of local auxin metabolism to specific cues. Besides transcriptional regulation, subcellular compartmentalization of the IAA metabolism and posttranslational modifications of the metabolic enzymes are emerging as important contributors to IAA homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on (1) the pathways for IAA biosynthesis and inactivation in plants, (2) the influence of spatiotemporally regulated IAA metabolism on auxin-mediated responses, and (3) the regulatory mechanisms that modulate IAA levels in response to external and internal cues during plant development.","105":"","106":"The establishment of the species-specific floral organ body plan involves many coordinated spatiotemporal processes, which include the perception of positional information that specifies floral meristem and floral organ founder cells, coordinated organ outgrowth coupled with the generation and maintenance of inter-organ and inter-whorl boundaries, and the termination of meristem activity. Auxin is integrated within the gene regulatory networks that control these processes and plays instructive roles at the level of tissue-specific biosynthesis and polar transport to generate local maxima, perception, and signaling. Key features of auxin function in several floral contexts include cell nonautonomy, interaction with cytokinin gradients, and the central role of MONOPTEROS and ETTIN to regulate canonical and noncanonical auxin response pathways, respectively. Arabidopsis flowers are not representative of the enormous angiosperm floral diversity; therefore, comparative studies are required to understand how auxin underlies these developmental differences. It will be of great interest to compare the conservation of auxin pathways among flowering plants and to discuss the evolutionary role of auxin in floral development.","107":"Recent years have provided considerable insights into the dynamic nature of the cell nucleus, which is constantly reorganizing its genome, controlling its size and shape, as well as spatiotemporally orchestrating chromatin remodeling and transcription. Remarkably, it has become clear that the ancient and highly conserved cytoskeletal protein actin plays a crucial part in these processes. However, the underlying mechanisms, regulations, and properties of actin functions inside the nucleus are still not well understood. Here we summarize the diverse and distinct roles of monomeric and filamentous actin as well as the emerging roles for actin dynamics inside the nuclear compartment for genome organization and nuclear architecture.","108":"Despite the availability of seasonal vaccines, influenza A (IAV) prevails as a leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. Current vaccination efforts aim at increasing protection against heterologous and potentially pandemic IAV strains. Lung-resident CD8+ T cells (Trm) generated upon IAV infection are vital for heterosubtypic immunity to IAV reexposure and provide quick and robust responses upon reactivation. Yet, protection wanes with time as lung Trm cell numbers decline, a contrasting feature with Trm cells at other mucosal sites such as the skin. In this review, we discuss current data on lung Trm compared to Trm cells in other tissues. Furthermore, major knowledge gaps in the generation and maintenance of IAV-specific lung Trm are addressed and mechanisms that may contribute to their decline are discussed. Further understanding in the mechanisms that govern effector function versus immunopathology is paramount for future IAV vaccine design in enhancing durability of lung Trm cells.","109":"With ever-improving methods of cell characterization, the field of immunology has enjoyed unprecedented opportunities to resolve distinctions between lymphocyte populations. However, this has led to a proliferation of \"subset\" designations that threatens to complicate and confuse clear identification of populations that share critical functional traits. This article discusses some of the challenges associated with a uniform approach to assigning subset designations to memory T-cell populations.","110":"In the past several decades, the establishment of in vitro models of pluripotency has ushered in a golden era for developmental and stem cell biology. Research in this arena has led to profound insights into the regulatory features that shape early embryonic development. Nevertheless, an integrative theory of the epigenetic principles that govern the pluripotent nucleus remains elusive. Here, we summarize the epigenetic characteristics that define the pluripotent state. We cover what is currently known about the epigenome of pluripotent stem cells and reflect on the use of embryonic stem cells as an experimental system. In addition, we highlight insights from super-resolution microscopy, which have advanced our understanding of the form and function of chromatin, particularly its role in establishing the characteristically \"open chromatin\" of pluripotent nuclei. Further, we discuss the rapid improvements in 3C-based methods, which have given us a means to investigate the 3D spatial organization of the pluripotent genome. This has aided the adaptation of prior notions of a \"pluripotent molecular circuitry\" into a more holistic model, where hotspots of co-interacting domains correspond with the accumulation of pluripotency-associated factors. Finally, we relate these earlier hypotheses to an emerging model of phase separation, which posits that a biophysical mechanism may presuppose the formation of a pluripotent-state-defining transcriptional program.","111":"Immunological memory, defined as the ability to respond in an enhanced manner upon secondary encounter with the same pathogen, can provide substantial protection against infectious disease. The improved protection is mediated in part by different populations of memory CD8 T cells that are retained after primary infection. Memory cells persist in the absence of pathogen-derived antigens and enable secondary CD8 T-cell responses with accelerated kinetics and of larger magnitude after reencounter with the same pathogen. At least three subsets of memory T cells have been defined that are referred to as central memory CD8 T cells (Tcm), effector memory CD8 T cells (Tem), and tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (Trm). Tcm and Tem are circulating memory T cells that mediate bodywide immune surveillance in search of invading pathogens. In contrast, Trm permanently reside in peripheral barrier tissues, where they form a stationary defensive line of sentinels that alert the immune system upon pathogen reencounter. The characterization of these different subsets has been instrumental in our understanding of the strategies that memory T cells employ to counter invading pathogens. It is clear that memory T cells not only have a numerical advantage over naive T cells resulting in improved protection in secondary responses, but also acquire distinct sets of competencies that assist in pathogen clearance. Nevertheless, inherent challenges are associated with the allocation of memory T cells to a limited number of subsets. The classification of memory T cells into Tcm, Tem, and Trm may not take into account the full extent of the heterogeneity that is observed in the memory population. Therefore, in this review, we will revisit the current classification of memory subsets, elaborate on functional and migratory properties attributed to Tcm, Tem, and Trm, and discuss how potential heterogeneity within these populations arises and persists.","112":"Memory T cells, which protect against reinfection in many diseases, have predominantly been characterized in models of acute viral or bacterial infection. In contrast, memory T cells are less well understood in diseases where pathogens persist following disease resolution, such as leishmaniasis, in spite of the fact that these infections often lead to immunity to reinfection, termed concomitant immunity. Defining the T cells that mediate concomitant immunity is an important step in developing vaccines for these diseases. One set of protective T cells are short-lived effector T cells requiring constant stimulation, which would be difficult to maintain by vaccination. However, parasite-independent memory T cells, including central memory T cells (Tcm) and skin-resident T cells (Trm) have recently been described in leishmaniasis. Given their location, Trm cells are particularly suited for protection, and were found to globally seed the skin following Leishmania infection or immunization. Upon challenge, Trm cells rapidly respond to reduce the parasite burden, suggesting that developing strategies to generate parasite-independent Trm cells will be an important step in the quest for a successful leishmaniasis vaccine.","113":"Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) comprise the majority of memory cells in nonlymphoid tissues and play a predominant role in immunity at barrier surfaces. A better understanding of Trm cell maintenance and function is essential for the development of vaccines that confer frontline protection. However, it is currently challenging to precisely distinguish Trm cells from other T cells, and this has led to confusion in the literature. Here we highlight gaps in our understanding of tissue memory and discuss recent advances in the classification of Trm cell subsets based on their distribution and functional characteristics.","114":"","115":"The distal lung is a honeycomb-like collection of delicate gas exchange sacs called alveoli lined by two interspersed epithelial cell types: the cuboidal, surfactant-producing alveolar type II (AT2) and the flat, gas-exchanging alveolar type I (AT1) cell. During aging, a subset of AT2 cells expressing the canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, function as stem cells, renewing themselves while generating new AT1 and AT2 cells. Wnt activity endows AT2 cells with proliferative competency, enabling them to respond to activating cues, and simultaneously blocks AT2 to AT1 cell transdifferentiation. Acute alveolar injury rapidly expands the AT2 stem cell pool by transiently inducing Wnt signaling activity in \"bulk\" AT2 cells, facilitating rapid epithelial repair. AT2 cell \"stemness\" is thus tightly regulated by access to Wnts, supplied by a specialized single-cell fibroblast niche during maintenance and by AT2 cells themselves during injury repair. Two non-AT2 \"reserve\" cell populations residing in the distal airways also contribute to alveolar repair, but only after widespread epithelial injury, when they rapidly proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into airway and alveolar lineages. Here, we review alveolar renewal and repair with a focus on the niches, rather than the stem cells, highlighting what is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which they control stem cell activity in vivo.","116":"Mouse spermatogenesis is supported by spermatogenic stem cells (SSCs). SSCs maintain their pool while migrating over an open (or facultative) niche microenvironment of testicular seminiferous tubules, where ligands that support self-renewal are likely distributed widely. This contrasts with the classic picture of closed (or definitive) niches in which stem cells are gathered and the ligands are highly localized. Some of the key properties observed in the dynamics of SSCs in the testicular niche in vivo, which show the flexible and stochastic (probabilistic) fate behaviors, are found to be generic for a wide range of, if not all, tissue stem cells. SSCs also show properties characteristic of an open niche-supported system, such as high motility. Motivated by the properties of SSCs, in this review, I will reconsider the potential unity and diversity of tissue stem cell systems, with an emphasis on the varying degrees of ligand distribution and stem cell motility.","117":"Advances in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and computational analysis have enabled the systematic interrogation of the cellular composition of tissues. Combined with tools from developmental biology, cell biology, and genetics, these approaches are revealing fundamental aspects of tissue geometry and physiology, including the distribution, origins, and inferred functions of specialized cell types, and the dynamics of cellular turnover and differentiation. By comparing different tissues, such studies can delineate shared and specialized features of cell types and their lineage. Here, we compare two developmentally related murine epithelia, the airway and the small intestinal epithelia, which are both derived from the embryonic endodermal gut tube. We examine how airway and intestine generate and functionalize common archetypal cell types to fulfill similar shared physiologic functionalities. We point to cases in which similar cell types are repurposed to accommodate each tissue's unique physiologic role, and highlight tissue-specific cells whose specializations contribute to the distinct functional roles of each organ. We discuss how archetypal and unique cell types are incorporated within a cellular lineage, and how the regulation of the proportions of these cell types enables tissue-level organization to meet functional demands and maintain homeostasis.","118":null,"119":"Cardiac neural crest (CNC) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the dorsal neural tube that migrate and contribute to the remodeling of pharyngeal arch arteries and septation of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT). Numerous molecular cascades regulate the induction, specification, delamination, and migration of the CNC. Extensive analyses of the CNC ranging from chick ablation models to molecular biology studies have explored the mechanisms of heart development and disease, particularly involving the OFT and aortic arch (AA) system. Recent studies focus more on reciprocal signaling between the CNC and cells originated from the second heart field (SHF), which are essential for the development of the OFT myocardium, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital heart diseases (CHDs) and some human syndromes.","120":"Identification of progenitor cells that generate differentiated cell types during development, regeneration, and disease states is central to understanding the mechanisms governing such transitions. For more than a century, different lineage-tracing strategies have been developed, which helped disentangle the complex relationship between progenitor cells and their progenies. In this review, we discuss how lineage-tracing analyses have evolved alongside technological advances, and how this approach has contributed to the identification of progenitor cells in different contexts of cell differentiation. We also highlight a few examples in which lineage-tracing experiments have been instrumental for resolving long-standing debates and for identifying unexpected cellular origins. This discussion emphasizes how this century-old quest to delineate cellular lineage relationships is still active, and new discoveries are being made with the development of newer methodologies.","121":"Tumor suppressor genes encode critical intracellular regulators, such as the retinoblastoma protein. They control processes including cell proliferation, cell survival, and responses to DNA damage and are frequently mutated in cancer. In this excerpt from his forthcoming book on the history of cancer research, Joe Lipsick looks back at the discovery of tumor suppressor genes, covering the early work on cell fusion by Henry Harris, Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, the genetic mapping studies that first identified the RB gene, and subsequent work on silencing.","122":"Understanding how the four-chambered mammalian heart is formed from a simple, looped tube remains challenging, notwithstanding the descriptive accounts left by generations of cardiac anatomists. Much of the difficulty lies in attempting to visualize an intricate series of morphological transformations through the restrictive lens of two-dimensional images derived from histology. Modern imaging methods offer a way to overcome this limitation by providing comprehensive and high-resolution image sets of the developing heart. We have used one such method, high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM), to obtain virtual three-dimensional (3D) models of successive stages in mouse heart development. Taking advantage of the ability afforded by 3D modeling to view each heart in any orientation or erosion plane, we provide an illustrated account of how the mouse heart divides into left and right ventricular chambers, and how each acquires its own distinct outflow vessel.","123":"On binding to their cognate ligands, death receptors can initiate a cascade of events that can result in two distinct outcomes: gene expression and cell death. The study of three different death receptor-ligand systems, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), the CD95L-CD95, and the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-TRAIL-R1\/2 system, has drawn the attention of generations of scientists over the past 50 years. This scientific journey, as often happens in science, has been anything but a straight line to success and discoveries in this field were often made by serendipity, catching the scientists by surprise. However, as Louis Pasteur pointed out, luck prefers the prepared mind. It is therefore not surprising that the most impactful discovery of the field to date, the fact that TNF inhibition serves as an effective treatment for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, has been like this. Luckily, the scientists who made this discovery were prepared and, most importantly, determined to harness their discovery for therapeutic benefit. Today's research on these death receptor-ligand systems has led to the discovery of a causal link between cell death induced by a variety of these systems and inflammation. In this review, we explain why we predict that therapeutic exploitation of this discovery may profoundly impact the future treatment of inflammatory disease and cancer.","124":"The cardiac conduction system initiates and propagates each heartbeat. Specialized conducting cells are a well-conserved phenomenon across vertebrate evolution, although mammalian and avian species harbor specific components unique to organisms with four-chamber hearts. Early histological studies in mammals provided evidence for a dominant pacemaker within the right atrium and clarified the existence of the specialized muscular axis responsible for atrioventricular conduction. Building on these seminal observations, contemporary genetic techniques in a multitude of model organisms has characterized the developmental ontogeny, gene regulatory networks, and functional importance of individual anatomical compartments within the cardiac conduction system. This review describes in detail the transcriptional and regulatory networks that act during cardiac conduction system development and homeostasis with a particular emphasis on networks implicated in human electrical variation by large genome-wide association studies. We conclude with a discussion of the clinical implications of these studies and describe some future directions.","125":"Endocardial cells are specialized endothelial cells that, during embryogenesis, form a lining on the inside of the developing heart, which is maintained throughout life. Endocardial cells are an essential source for several lineages of the cardiovascular system including coronary endothelium, endocardial cushion mesenchyme, cardiomyocytes, mural cells, fibroblasts, liver vasculature, adipocytes, and hematopoietic cells. Alterations in the differentiation programs that give rise to these lineages has detrimental effects, including premature lethality or significant structural malformations present at birth. Here, we will review the literature pertaining to the contribution of endocardial cells to valvular, and nonvalvular lineages and highlight critical pathways required for these processes. The lineage differentiation potential of embryonic, and possibly adult, endocardial cells has therapeutic potential in the regeneration of damaged cardiac tissue or treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","126":"Early heart morphogenesis involves a process in which embryonic precursor cells are instructed to form a cyclic contracting muscle tube connected to blood vessels, pumping fluid. Subsequently, the heart becomes structurally complex and its size increases several orders of magnitude to functionally keep up with the demands of the growing organism. Programmed transcriptional regulatory networks control the early steps of cardiac development. However, already during the early stages of its assembly, the heart tube starts to produce electrochemical potentials, contractions, and flow, which are transduced into signals that feed back into the process of morphogenesis itself. Heart morphogenesis, thus, involves the interplay between progressively changing genetic networks, function, and shape. Morphogenesis is evolutionarily conserved, but species-specific differences occur and in mouse, for instance, distinct phases of development become overlapping and compounded in an extremely fast gestation. Here, we review the early morphogenesis of the chambered heart that maintains a circulation supporting development of an organism rapidly growing in size and requirements.","127":"Technological advances play a key role in furthering our understanding of stem cell biology, and advancing the prospects of regenerative therapies. Highly parallelized methods, developed in the last decade, can profile DNA, RNA, or proteins in thousands of cells and even capture data across two or more modalities (multiomics). This allows unbiased and precise definition of molecular cell states, thus allowing classification of cell types, tracking of differentiation trajectories, and discovery of underlying mechanisms. Despite being based on destructive techniques, novel experimental and bioinformatic approaches enable embedding and extraction of temporal information, which is essential for deconvolution of complex data and establishing cause and effect relationships. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies pertinent to stem cell biology, followed by an outlook on how further advances in single-cell molecular profiling and computational analysis have the potential to shape the future of both basic and translational research.","128":"The mechanisms that regulate the balance between stem cell duplication and differentiation in adult tissues remain in debate. Using a combination of genetic lineage tracing and marker-based assays, the quantitative statistical analysis of clone size and cell composition has provided insights into the patterns of stem cell fate across a variety of tissue types and organisms. These studies have emphasized the role of niche factors and environmental cues in promoting stem cell competence, fate priming, and stochastic renewal programs. At the same time, evidence for injury-induced \"cellular reprogramming\" has revealed the remarkable flexibility of cell states, allowing progenitors to reacquire self-renewal potential during regeneration. Together, these findings have questioned the nature of stem cell identity and function. Here, focusing on a range of canonical tissue types, we review how quantitative modeling-based approaches have uncovered conserved patterns of stem cell fate and provided new insights into the mechanisms that regulate self-renewal.","129":"Adult stem cells fuel tissue homeostasis and regeneration through their unique ability to self-renew and differentiate into specialized cells. Thus, their DNA provides instructions that impact the tissue as a whole. Since DNA is not an inert molecule, but rather dynamic, interacting with a myriad of chemical and physical factors, it encounters damage from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Damage to DNA introduces deviations from its normal intact structure and, if left unrepaired, may result in a genetic mutation. In turn, mutant genomes of stem and progenitor cells are inherited in cells of the lineage, thus eroding the genetic information that maintains homeostasis of the somatic cell population. Errors arising in stem and progenitor cells will have a substantially larger impact on the tissue in which they reside than errors occurring in postmitotic differentiated cells. Therefore, maintaining the integrity of genomic DNA within our stem cells is essential to protect the instructions necessary for rebuilding healthy tissues during homeostatic renewal. In this review, we will first discuss DNA damage arising in stem cells and cell- and tissue-intrinsic mechanisms that protect against harmful effects of this damage. Secondly, we will examine how erroneous DNA repair and persistent DNA damage in stem and progenitor cells impact stem cells and tissues in the context of cancer initiation and aging. Finally, we will discuss the use of invertebrate and vertebrate model systems to address unanswered questions on the role that DNA damage and mutation may play in aging and precancerous conditions.","130":"The exquisite transcriptional control of developmental gene programs is critical for hardwiring the complex expression patterns that govern cell-fate determination and differentiation during heart development. During the past several years, studies have illuminated our understanding of a complex noncoding transcriptional landscape, primarily associated with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), that is implicated in these developmental processes and has begun to reveal key functions of these transcripts. In this review, we discuss the expanding roles for lncRNAs in the earliest points of cardiac development and through differentiation and maturation of multiple cell types within the adult heart. We go on to outline the diverse mechanisms by which cardiovascular lncRNAs orchestrate these transcriptional programs, explore the challenges linked to the study of lncRNAs in developmental phenotypes, and summarize the implications for these molecules in human cardiovascular disorders.","131":"RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional structures that sample alternate conformations ranging from minor differences in tertiary structure dynamics to major differences in secondary structure. This allows them to form entirely different substructures with each population potentially giving rise to a distinct biological outcome. The substructures can be partitioned along an existing energy landscape given a particular static cellular cue or can be shifted in response to dynamic cues such as ligand binding. We review a few key examples of RNA molecules that sample alternate conformations and how these are capitalized on for control of critical regulatory functions.","132":"Stem cell fate decisions are informed by physical and chemical cues presented within and by the extracellular matrix. Despite the generally attributed importance of extracellular cues in governing self-renewal, differentiation, and collective behavior, knowledge gaps persist with regard to the individual, synergistic, and competing effects that specific physiochemical signals have on cell function. To better understand basic stem cell biology, as well as to expand opportunities in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, a growing suite of customizable biomaterials has been developed. These next-generation cell culture materials offer user-defined biochemical and biomechanical properties, increasingly in a manner that can be controlled in time and 3D space. This review highlights recent innovations in this regard, focusing on advances to culture and maintain stemness, direct fate, and to detect stem cell function using biomaterial-based strategies.","133":null,"134":"Inflammation is a fundamental biological process mediating host defense and wound healing during infections and tissue injury. Perpetuated and excessive inflammation may cause autoinflammation, autoimmunity, degenerative disorders, allergies, and malignancies. Multimodal signaling by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) plays a crucial role in determining the transition between inflammation, cell survival, and programmed cell death. Targeting TNF signaling has been proven as an effective therapeutic in several immune-related disorders. Mouse studies have provided critical mechanistic insights into TNFR1 signaling and its potential role in a broad spectrum of diseases. The characterization of patients with monogenic primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) has highlighted the importance of TNFR1 signaling in human disease. In particular, patients with PIDs have revealed paradoxical connections between immunodeficiency, chronic inflammation, and dysregulated cell death. Importantly, studies on PIDs may help to predict beneficial effects and side-effects of therapeutic targeting of TNFR1 signaling.","135":"Congenital cardiovascular malformations represent the most common type of birth defect and encompass a spectrum of anomalies that range from mild to severe. The etiology of congenital heart disease (CHD) is becoming increasingly defined based on prior epidemiologic studies that supported the importance of genetic contributors and technological advances in human genome analysis. These have led to the discovery of a growing number of disease-contributing genetic abnormalities in individuals affected by CHD. The ever-growing population of adult CHD survivors, which are the result of reductions in mortality from CHD during childhood, and this newfound genetic knowledge have led to important questions regarding recurrence risks, the mechanisms by which these defects occur, the potential for novel approaches for prevention, and the prediction of long-term cardiovascular morbidity in adult CHD survivors. Here, we will review the current status of genetic models that accurately model human CHD as they provide an important tool to answer these questions and test novel therapeutic strategies.","136":"The lymphatic system plays crucial roles in regulating fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance, and lipid transport. As is in most of the body's organs, the heart possesses an extensive lymphatic network. Moreover, a robust lymphangiogenic response has been shown to take place following myocardial infarction, highlighting cardiac lymphatics as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Yet, the unique molecular properties and functions of the heart's lymphatic system have only recently begun to be addressed. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the formation and growth of cardiac lymphatics during embryonic development and describe their characteristics across species. We further summarize recent findings highlighting diverse cellular origins for cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells and how they integrate to form a single functional lymphatic network. Finally, we outline novel therapeutic avenues aimed at enhancing lymphatic vessel formation and integrity following cardiac injury, which hold great promise for promoting healing of the infarcted heart.","137":null,"138":"During embryonic development, the heart arises from various sources of undifferentiated mesodermal progenitors, with an additional contribution from ectodermal neural crest cells. Mesodermal cardiac progenitors are plastic and multipotent, but are nevertheless specified to a precise heart region and cell type very early during development. Recent findings have defined both this lineage plasticity and early commitment of cardiac progenitors, using a combination of single-cell and population analyses. In this review, we discuss several aspects of cardiac progenitor specification. We discuss their markers, fate potential in vitro and in vivo, early segregation and commitment, and also intrinsic and extrinsic cues regulating lineage restriction from multipotency to a specific cell type of the heart. Finally, we also discuss the subdivisions of the cardiopharyngeal field, and the shared origins of the heart with other mesodermal derivatives, including head and neck muscles.","139":"Programmed cell death (PCD) pathways are found in many phyla, ranging from developmentally programmed apoptosis in animals to cell-autonomous programmed necrosis pathways that limit the spread of biotrophic pathogens in multicellular assemblies. Prominent examples for the latter include animal necroptosis and pyroptosis, plant hypersensitive response (HR), and fungal heterokaryon incompatibility (HI) pathways. PCD pathways in the different kingdoms show fundamental differences in execution mechanism, morphology of the dying cells, and in the biological sequelae. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed remarkable evolutionary parallels, including a striking sequence relationship between the \"HeLo\" domains found in the pore-forming components of necroptosis and some types of plant HR and fungal HI pathways. Other PCD execution components show cross-kingdom conservation as well, or are derived from prokaryotic ancestors. The currently available data suggest a model, wherein the primordial eukaryotic PCD pathway used proteins similar to present-day plant R-proteins and caused necrotic cell death by direct action of Toll and IL-1 receptor (TIR) and HeLo-like domains.","140":"Degenerative retinal disease is the major cause of sight loss in the developed world and currently there is a lack of effective treatments. As the loss of vision is directly the result of the loss of retinal cells, effective cell replacement through stem-cell-based therapies may have the potential to treat a great number of retinal diseases whatever their underlying etiology. The eye is an ideal organ to develop cell therapies as it is immune privileged, and modern surgical techniques enable precise delivery of cells to the retina. Furthermore, a range of noninvasive diagnostic tests and high-resolution imaging techniques facilitate the evaluation of any therapeutic intervention. In this review, we evaluate the progress to date of current cell therapy strategies for retinal repair, focusing on transplantation of pluripotent stem-cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells.","141":"A transcriptional program implemented by transcription factors and epigenetic regulators governs cardiac development and disease. Mutations in these factors are important causes of congenital heart disease. Here, we review selected recent advances in our understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic control of heart development, including determinants of cardiac transcription factor chromatin occupancy, the gene regulatory network that regulates atrial septation, the chromatin landscape and cardiac gene regulation, and the role of Brg\/Brahma-associated factor (BAF), nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD), and Polycomb epigenetic regulatory complexes in heart development.","142":"Mammalian genomes encode tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have been implicated in a diverse array of biological processes and human diseases. In recent years, the development of new tools for studying lncRNAs has enabled important progress in defining the mechanisms by which Xist and other lncRNAs function. This collective work provides a framework for how to define the mechanisms by which lncRNAs act. This includes defining lncRNA function, identifying and characterizing lncRNA-protein interactions, and lncRNA localization in the cell. In this review, we discuss various experimental approaches for deciphering lncRNA mechanisms and discuss issues and limitations in interpreting these results. We explore what these data can reveal about lncRNA function and mechanism as well as emerging insights into lncRNA biology that have been derived from these studies.","143":null,"144":"The amniote embryonic heart starts as a crescent of mesoderm that transitions through a midline linear heart tube in the course of developing into the four chambered heart. It is unusual in having to contract rhythmically while still undergoing extensive morphogenetic remodeling. Advances in imaging have allowed us to determine when during development this contractile activity starts. In the mouse, focal regions of contractions can be detected as early as the cardiac crescent stage. Calcium transients, required to trigger contraction, can be detected even earlier, prior to contraction. In this review, we outline what is currently known about how this early contractile function is initiated and the impact early contractile function has on cardiac development.","145":"Stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis by driving cellular turnover and regeneration upon damage. They reside within specialized niches that provide the signals required for stem cell maintenance. Stem cells have been identified in many tissues and cancer types, but their behavior within the niche and their reaction to microenvironmental signals were inferred from limited static observations. Recent advances in live imaging techniques, such as live cell imaging and intravital microscopy, have allowed the visualization of stem cell behavior and dynamics over time in their (near) native environment. Through these recent technological advances, it is now evident that stem cells are much more dynamic than previously anticipated, resulting in a model in which stemness is a state that can be gained or lost over time. In this review, we will highlight how live imaging and intravital microscopy have unraveled previously unanticipated stem cell dynamics and plasticity during development, homeostasis, regeneration, and tumor formation.","146":"Heart development is a complex process and begins with the long-range migration of cardiac progenitor cells during gastrulation. This culminates in the formation of a simple contractile tube with multiple layers, which undergoes remodeling into a four-chambered heart. During this morphogenesis, additional cell populations become incorporated. It is important to unravel the underlying genetic and cellular mechanisms to be able to identify the embryonic origin of diseases, including congenital malformations, which impair cardiac function and may affect life expectancy or quality. Owing to the evolutionary conservation of development, observations made in nonamniote and amniote vertebrate species allow us to extrapolate to human. This review will focus on the contributions made to a better understanding of heart development through studying avian embryos-mainly the chicken but also quail embryos. We will illustrate the classic and recent approaches used in the avian system, give an overview of the important discoveries made, and summarize the early stages of cardiac development up to the establishment of the four-chambered heart.","147":"The human brain is often described as the most complex organ in our body. Because of the limited accessibility of living brain tissue, human-specific features of neurodevelopment and disease remain largely unknown. The ability of induced pluripotent stem cells to self-organize into 3D brain organoids has revolutionized approaches to studying brain development in vitro. This review will first look at the history of studying neural development in a dish and how organoids came to be. We evaluate the ability of brain organoids to recapitulate key developmental events, focusing on the generation of various regional identities, cytoarchitecture, cell diversity, features of neuronal maturation, and circuit formation. We also consider the limitations of the model and review recent approaches to improve reproducibility and the healthy maturation of brain organoids.","148":"Xenopus has been used to study a wide array of developmental processes, benefiting from vast quantities of relatively large, externally developing eggs. Xenopus is particularly amenable to examining the cardiac system because many of the developmental processes and genes involved in cardiac specification, differentiation, and growth are conserved between Xenopus and human and have been characterized in detail. Furthermore, compared with other higher vertebrate models, Xenopus embryos can survive longer without a properly functioning heart or circulatory system, enabling investigation of later consequences of early embryological manipulations. This biology is complemented by experimental technology, such as embryonic explants to study the heart, microinjection of overexpression constructs, and, most recently, the generation of genetic mutations through gene-editing technologies. Recent investigations highlight Xenopus as a powerful experimental system for studying injury\/repair and regeneration and for congenital heart disease (CHD) modeling, which reinforces why this model system remains ideal for studying heart development.","149":"Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow and then patrol blood vessels from which they can be rapidly recruited to a site of infection. Neutrophils bind, engulf, and efficiently kill invading microbes via a suite of defense mechanisms. Diverse extracellular and intracellular microbes induce neutrophils to extrude neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through the process of NETosis. Here, we review the signaling mechanisms and cell biology underpinning the key NETosis pathways during infection and the antimicrobial functions of NETs in host defense.","150":"Brain disorders, from neurodegenerative to psychiatric disorders, are among the most challenging conditions to study because of the intricate nature of the human brain and the limitations of existing model systems in recapitulating all these intricacies. However, innovations in stem cell technologies now allow us to reprogram patient somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can then be differentiated to disease-relevant neural and glial cells. iPSCs are a valuable tool to model brain disorders, as they can be derived from patients with known symptom histories, genetics, and drug-response profiles. Here, we discuss the premise and validity of the iPSC-based in vitro model system and highlight key findings from the most commonly studied neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.","151":"Caspases play central roles in mediating both cell death and inflammation. It has more recently become evident that caspases also drive other biological processes. Most prominently, caspases have been shown to be involved in differentiation. Several stem and progenitor cell types rely on caspases to initiate and execute their differentiation processes. These range from neural and glial cells, to skeletal myoblasts and osteoblasts, and several cell types of the hematopoietic system. Beyond differentiation, caspases have also been shown to play roles in other \"noncanonical\" processes, including cell proliferation, arrest, and senescence, thereby contributing to the mechanisms that regulate tissue homeostasis at multiple levels. Remarkably, caspases directly influence the course of the cell cycle in both a positive and negative manner. Caspases both cleave elements of the cell-cycle machinery and are themselves substrates of cell-cycle kinases. Here we aim to summarize the breadth of interactions between caspases and cell-cycle regulators. We also highlight recent developments in this area.","152":"Whereas the apoptosis cell death pathway typically enables cells to undergo death in an immunologically silent manner, cell death by necroptosis induces cell lysis and release of cellular constituents known to elicit an immune response. Consequently, the origins of necroptosis likely originated in host defense against pathogens, although recently it has emerged that dysregulation of the pathway underlies many human pathologies. The past decade has seen a rapid advance in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying necroptotic cell death, including the implication of the pseudokinase, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), as the terminal effector in the pathway. Here, I review our current understanding of how MLKL is activated by the upstream receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3, the proposed mechanism(s) by which MLKL kills cells, and recently described layers of regulation that tune MLKL's killing activity.","153":"A chambered heart is common to all vertebrates, but reptiles show unparalleled variation in ventricular septation, ranging from almost absent in tuataras to full in crocodilians. Because mammals and birds evolved independently from reptile lineages, studies on reptile development may yield insight into the evolution and development of the full ventricular septum. Compared with reptiles, mammals and birds have evolved several other adaptations, including compact chamber walls and a specialized conduction system. These adaptations appear to have evolved from precursor structures that can be studied in present-day reptiles. The increase in the number of studies on reptile heart development has been greatly facilitated by sequencing of several genomes and the availability of good staging systems. Here, we place reptiles in their phylogenetic context with a focus on features that are primitive when compared with the homologous features of mammals. Further, an outline of major developmental events is given, and variation between reptile species is discussed.","154":"The diverse roles of cellular RNAs can be studied by purifying RNAs of interest together with the biomolecules they bind. Biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides that hybridize specifically to the RNA of interest provide a general approach to develop affinity reagents for these experiments. Such oligonucleotides can be used to enrich endogenous RNAs from cross-linked chromatin extracts to study the genomic binding sites of RNAs. These hybridization capture protocols are evolving modular experiments that are compatible with a range of cross-linkers and conditions. This review discusses the principles of these hybridization capture experiments as well as considerations and controls necessary to interpret the resulting data without being misled by artifactual signals.","155":"To date, more than 200 monogenic, often devastating, skin diseases have been described. Because of unmet medical needs, development of long-lasting and curative therapies has been consistently attempted, with the aim of correcting the underlying molecular defect. In this review, we will specifically address the few combined cell and gene therapy strategies that made it to the clinics. Based on these studies, what can be envisioned for the future is a patient-oriented strategy, built on the specific features of the individual in need. Most likely, a combination of different strategies, approaches, and advanced therapies will be required to reach the finish line at the end of the long and winding road hampering the achievement of definitive treatments for genodermatoses.","156":"Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a highly conserved serine\/threonine kinase that is ubiquitously expressed throughout the human body. Specialized isoforms of CaMKII play key roles in neuronal and cardiac signaling. The distinctive holoenzyme architecture of CaMKII, with 12-14 kinase domains attached by flexible linkers to a central hub, poses formidable challenges for structural characterization. Nevertheless, progress in determining the structural mechanisms underlying CaMKII functions has come from studying the kinase domain and the hub separately, as well as from a recent electron microscopic investigation of the intact holoenzyme. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the structure of CaMKII. We also discuss the intriguing finding that the CaMKII holoenzyme can undergo activation-triggered subunit exchange, a process that has implications for the potentiation and perpetuation of CaMKII activity.","157":"Calcium (Ca2+) signaling is an essential process in all cells that is maintained by a plethora of channels, pumps, transporters, receptors, and intracellular Ca2+ sequestering stores. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration govern processes as far reaching as fertilization, cell growth, and motility through to cell death. In recent years, lysosomes have emerged as a major intracellular Ca2+ storage organelle with an increasing involvement in triggering or regulating cellular functions such as endocytosis, autophagy, and Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This review will summarize recent work in the area of lysosomal Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis, including newly identified functions, and the involvement of lysosome-derived Ca2+ signals in human disease. In addition, we explore recent controversies in the techniques used for measurement of lysosomal Ca2+ content.","158":"Calcium (Ca2+) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling cross talk and synergize to stimulate the cardinal functions of exocrine cells, regulated exocytosis, and fluid and electrolyte secretion. This physiological process requires the organization of the two signaling pathways into complexes at defined cellular domains and close placement. Such domains are formed by membrane contact sites (MCS). This review discusses the basic properties of Ca2+ signaling in exocrine cells, the role of MCS in the organization of cell signaling and in cross talk and synergism between the Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways and, finally, the mechanism by which the Ca2+ and cAMP pathways synergize to stimulate epithelial fluid and electrolyte secretion.","159":"Understanding how coronary blood vessels form and regenerate during development and progression of cardiac diseases will shed light on the development of new treatment options targeting coronary artery diseases. Recent studies with the state-of-the-art technologies have identified novel origins of, as well as new, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of coronary vessels in the postnatal heart, including collateral artery formation, endocardial-to-endothelial differentiation and mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition. These new mechanisms of coronary vessel formation and regeneration open up new possibilities targeting neovascularization for promoting cardiac repair and regeneration. Here, we highlight some recent studies on cellular mechanisms of coronary vessel formation, and discuss the potential impact and significance of the findings on basic research and clinical application for treating ischemic heart disease.","160":"Our understanding of how the first mammalian cell lineages arise has been shaped largely by studies of the preimplantation mouse embryo. Painstaking work over many decades has begun to reveal how a single totipotent cell is transformed into a multilayered structure representing the foundations of the body plan. Here, we review how the first lineage decision is initiated by epigenetic regulation but consolidated by the integration of morphological features and transcription factor activity. The establishment of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell lines has enabled deeper analysis of molecular and epigenetic regulation of cell fate decisions. The capability to assemble these stem cells into artificial embryos is an exciting new avenue of research that offers a long-awaited window into cell fate specification in the human embryo. Together, these approaches are poised to profoundly increase our understanding of how the first lineage decisions are made during mammalian embryonic development.","161":"Within the realm of zoological study, the question of how an organism reaches a specific size has been largely unexplored. Recently, studies performed to understand the regulation of organ size have revealed that both cellular signals and external cues contribute toward the determination of total cell mass within each organ. The establishment of final organ size requires the precise coordination of cell growth, proliferation, and survival throughout development and postnatal life. In the mammalian heart, the regulation of size is biphasic. During development, cardiomyocyte proliferation predominantly determines cardiac growth, whereas in the adult heart, total cell mass is governed by signals that regulate cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding the extrinsic factors and intrinsic mechanisms that control heart size during development. We also discuss the metabolic switch that occurs in the heart after birth and precedes homeostatic control of postnatal heart size.","162":"Pathogen recognition by the plant immune system leads to defense responses that are often accompanied by a form of regulated cell death known as the hypersensitive response (HR). HR shares some features with regulated necrosis observed in animals. Genetically, HR can be uncoupled from local defense responses at the site of infection and its role in immunity may be to activate systemic responses in distal parts of the organism. Recent advances in the field reveal conserved cell death-specific signaling modules that are assembled by immune receptors in response to pathogen-derived effectors. The structural elucidation of the plant resistosome-an inflammasome-like structure that may attach to the plasma membrane on activation-opens the possibility that HR cell death is mediated by the formation of pores at the plasma membrane. Necrotrophic pathogens that feed on dead tissue have evolved strategies to trigger the HR cell death pathway as a survival strategy. Ectopic activation of immunomodulators during autoimmune reactions can also promote HR cell death. In this perspective, we discuss the role and regulation of HR in these different contexts.","163":"The BCL-2 family of proteins control a key checkpoint in apoptosis, that of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or, simply, mitochondrial poration. The family consists of three subgroups: BH3-only initiators that respond to apoptotic stimuli; antiapoptotic guardians that protect against cell death; and the membrane permeabilizing effectors BAX, BAK, and BOK. On activation, effector proteins are converted from inert monomers into membrane permeabilizing oligomers. For many years, this process has been poorly understood at the molecular level, but a number of recent advances have provided important insights. We review the regulation of these effectors, their activation, subsequent conformational changes, and the ensuing oligomerization events that enable mitochondrial poration, which initiates apoptosis through release of key signaling factors such as cytochrome c We highlight the mysteries that remain in understanding these important proteins in an endeavor to provide a comprehensive picture of where the field currently sits and where it is moving toward.","164":"Inflammasomes assemble in the cytosol of myeloid and epithelial cells on sensing of cellular stress and pathogen-associated molecular patterns and serve as scaffolds for recruitment and activation of inflammatory caspases. Inflammasomes play beneficial roles in host and immune responses against diverse pathogens but may also promote inflammatory tissue damage if uncontrolled. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a recently identified substrate of murine caspase-1 and caspase-11, and human caspases-1, -4, and -5 that mediates a regulated lytic cell death mode termed pyroptosis. Recent studies have identified pyroptosis as a critical inflammasome effector mechanism that controls inflammasome-dependent cytokine secretion and contributes to antimicrobial defense and inflammasome-mediated autoinflammatory diseases. Here, we review recent developments on inflammasome-associated effector functions with an emphasis on the emerging roles of gasdermin pores and pyroptosis.","165":"Store-operated calcium (Ca2+) entry (SOCE) occurs through a widely distributed family of ion channels activated by the loss of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The best understood of these is the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel, which is notable for its unique activation mechanism as well as its many essential physiological functions and the diverse pathologies that result from dysregulation. In response to ER Ca2+ depletion, CRAC channels are formed through a diffusion trap mechanism at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions, where the ER Ca2+-sensing stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins bind and activate hexamers of Orai pore-forming proteins to trigger Ca2+ entry. Cell biological studies are clarifying the architecture of ER-PM junctions, their roles in Ca2+ and lipid transport, and functional interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. Molecular structures of STIM and Orai have inspired a multitude of mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies that reveal potential mechanisms for how STIM is toggled between inactive and active states, how it binds and activates Orai, and the importance of STIM-binding stoichiometry for opening the channel and establishing its signature characteristics of extremely high Ca2+ selectivity and low Ca2+ conductance.","166":"Cardiac fibroblasts and fibrosis contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure, a prevalent cause of mortality. Therefore, a majority of the existing information regarding cardiac fibroblasts is focused on their function and behavior after heart injury. Less is understood about the signaling and transcriptional networks required for the development and homeostatic roles of these cells. This review is devoted to describing our current understanding of cardiac fibroblast development. I detail cardiac fibroblast formation during embryogenesis including the discovery of a second embryonic origin for cardiac fibroblasts. Additional information is provided regarding the roles of the genes essential for cardiac fibroblast development. It should be noted that many questions remain regarding the cell-fate specification of these fibroblast progenitors, and it is hoped that this review will provide a basis for future studies regarding this topic.","167":"In the nervous system, calcium signals play a major role in the conversion of synaptic stimuli into transcriptional responses. Signal-regulated gene transcription is fundamental for a range of long-lasting adaptive brain functions that include learning and memory, structural plasticity of neurites and synapses, acquired neuroprotection, chronic pain, and addiction. In this review, we summarize the diverse mechanisms governing calcium-dependent transcriptional regulation associated with central nervous system plasticity. We focus on recent advances in the field of synapse-to-nucleus communication that include studies of the signal-regulated transcriptome in human neurons, identification of novel regulatory mechanisms such as activity-induced DNA double-strand breaks, and the identification of novel forms of activity- and transcription-dependent adaptations, in particular, metabolic plasticity. We summarize the reciprocal interactions between different kinds of neuroadaptations and highlight the emerging role of activity-regulated epigenetic modifiers in gating the inducibility of signal-regulated genes.","168":"Cell death is an invariant feature throughout our life span, starting with extensive scheduled cell death during morphogenesis and continuing with death under homeostasis in adult tissues. Additionally, cells become victims of accidental, unscheduled death following injury and infection. Cell death in each of these occasions triggers specific and specialized responses in the living cells that surround them or are attracted to the dying\/dead cells. These responses sculpt tissues during morphogenesis, replenish lost cells in homeostasis to maintain tissue\/system function, and repair damaged tissues after injury. Wherein lies the information that sets in motion the cascade of effector responses culminating in remodeling, renewal, or repair? Here, we attempt to provide a framework for thinking about cell death in terms of the specific effector responses that accompanies various modalities of cell death. We also propose an integrated threefold \"cell death code\" consisting of information intrinsic to the dying\/dead cell, the surroundings of the dying cell, and the identity of the responder.","169":"Congenital heart disease (CHD) has many forms and a wide range of causes. Clinically, it is important to understand the causes. This allows estimation of recurrence rate, guides treatment options, and may also be used to formulate public health advice to reduce the population prevalence of CHD. The recent advent of sophisticated genetic and genomic methods has led to the identification of more than 100 genes associated with CHD. However, despite these great strides, to date only one-third of CHD cases have been shown to have a simple genetic cause. This is because CHD can also be caused by oligogenic factors, environmental factors, and\/or gene-environment interaction. Although solid evidence for environmental causes of CHD have been available for almost 80 years, it is only very recently that the molecular mechanisms for these risk factors have begun to be investigated. In this review, we describe the most important environmental CHD risk factors, and what is known about how they cause CHD.","170":"Innate immune sensors can recognize when host cells are irrevocably compromised by pathogens, and in response can trigger programmed cell death (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis). Innate sensors can directly bind microbial ligands; for example, NAIP\/NLRC4 detects flagellin\/rod\/needle, whereas caspase-11 detects lipopolysaccharide. Other sensors are guards that monitor normal function of cellular proteins; for instance, pyrin monitors Rho GTPases, whereas caspase-8 and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3 guards RIPK1 transcriptional signaling. Some proteins that need to be guarded can be duplicated as decoy domains, as seen in the integrated decoy domains within NLRP1 that watch for microbial attack. Here, we discuss the evolutionary battle between pathogens and host innate immune sensors\/guards, illustrated by the Red Queen hypothesis. We discuss in depth four pathogens, and how they either fail in this evolutionary race (Chromobacterium violaceum, Burkholderia thailandensis), or how the evolutionary race generates increasingly complex virulence factors and host innate immune signaling pathways (Yersinia species, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [EPEC]).","171":"Stimulation of cell-surface receptors induces cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increases that are detected and transduced by effector proteins for regulation of cell function. Intracellular Ca2+ release, via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR), and Ca2+ influx, via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), contribute to the increase in [Ca2+]i The amplitude, frequency, and spatial characteristics of the [Ca2+]i increases are controlled by the compartmentalization of proteins into signaling complexes such as receptor-signaling complexes and SOCE complexes. Both complexes include protein and lipid components, located in the plasma membrane (PM) and ER. Receptor signaling initiates in the PM via phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and culminates with the activation of IP3R in the ER. Conversely, SOCE is initiated in the ER by Ca2+-sensing stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins, which then interact with PM channels Orai1 and TRPC1 to activate Ca2+ entry. This review will address how ER-PM junctions serve a central role in agonist regulation of SOCE.","172":"The pro- and antiapoptotic proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family exert a critical control over cell-death processes by enabling or counteracting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Beyond this mitochondrial function, several Bcl-2 family members have emerged as critical modulators of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and dynamics, showing proapoptotic and antiapoptotic functions. Bcl-2 family proteins specifically target several intracellular Ca2+-transport systems, including organellar Ca2+ channels: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Ca2+-release channels mediating Ca2+ flux from the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which mediate Ca2+ flux across the mitochondrial outer membrane into the mitochondria. Although the formation of protein complexes between Bcl-2 proteins and these channels has been extensively studied, a major advance during recent years has been elucidating the complex interaction of Bcl-2 proteins with IP3Rs. Distinct interaction sites for different Bcl-2 family members were identified in the primary structure of IP3Rs. The unique molecular profiles of these Bcl-2 proteins may account for their distinct functional outcomes when bound to IP3Rs. Furthermore, Bcl-2 inhibitors used in cancer therapy may affect IP3R function as part of their proapoptotic effect and\/or as an adverse effect in healthy cells.","173":"Calcium ions (Ca2+) are prominent cell signaling effectors that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. Among the different players in Ca2+ homeostasis, primary active Ca2+ transporters are responsible for keeping low basal Ca2+ levels in the cytosol while establishing steep Ca2+ gradients across intracellular membranes or the plasma membrane. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the three types of primary active Ca2+-ATPases: the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps, the secretory pathway Ca2+- ATPase (SPCA) isoforms, and the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) Ca2+-transporters. We first discuss the Ca2+ transport mechanism of SERCA1a, which serves as a reference to describe the Ca2+ transport of other Ca2+ pumps. We further highlight the common and unique features of each isoform and review their structure-function relationship, expression pattern, regulatory mechanisms, and specific physiological roles. Finally, we discuss the increasing genetic and in vivo evidence that links the dysfunction of specific Ca2+-ATPase isoforms to a broad range of human pathologies, and highlight emerging therapeutic strategies that target Ca2+ pumps.","174":"Multicellular organisms are not created through cell proliferation alone. It is through cell death that an indefinite cellular mass is pared back to reveal its true form. Cells are also lost throughout life as part of homeostasis and through injury. This detritus represents a significant burden to the living organism and must be cleared, most notably through the use of specialized phagocytic cells. Our understanding of these phagocytes and how they engulf cell corpses has been greatly aided by studying the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster Here we review the contribution of Drosophila research to our understanding of how phagocytes respond to cell death. We focus on the best studied phagocytes in the fly: the glia of the central nervous system, the ovarian follicle cells, and the macrophage-like hemocytes. Each is explored in the context of the tissue they maintain as well as how they function during development and in response to injury.","175":null,"176":"Although the basic aspects of protein synthesis are preserved in all kingdoms of life, there are many important structural and functional differences between bacterial and the more complex eukaryotic ribosomes. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography structures of eukaryotic ribosomes have revealed the complex architectures of eukaryotic ribosomes and species-specific variations in protein and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) extensions. They also enabled structural studies of a range of eukaryotic ribosomal complexes involved in translation initiation, elongation, and termination, revealing unique mechanistic features of the eukaryotic translation process, especially with respect to the identification and recognition of translation start and stop codons on messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Most recently, structural biology has provided insights into the eukaryotic ribosomal biogenesis pathway by visualizing several of its complex intermediates. This review highlights the past decade's structural work on eukaryotic ribosomes and its implications on our understanding of eukaryotic translation.","177":null,"178":"The innate immune system senses and responds to pathogens and endogenous damage through supramolecular protein complexes known as inflammasomes. Cytosolic inflammasome sensor proteins trigger inflammasome assembly on detection of infection and danger. Assembled inflammasomes activate a cascade of inflammatory caspases, which process procytokines and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cleaved GSDMD forms membrane pores that lead to cytokine release and\/or programmed lytic cell death, called pyroptosis. In this review, we provide a primer on pyroptosis and focus on its executioner, the GSDM protein family. In addition to inflammasome-mediated GSDMD pore formation, we describe recently discovered GSDMD activation by caspase-8 and elastase in Yersinia-infected macrophages and aging neutrophils, respectively, and GSDME activation by apoptotic caspases. Finally, we discuss strategies that host cells and pathogens use to restrict GSDMD pore formation, in addition to therapeutics targeting the GSDM family.","179":"Neurodegenerative disease is characterized by the progressive deterioration of neuronal function caused by the degeneration of synapses, axons, and ultimately the death of nerve cells. An increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying altered cellular homeostasis and neurodegeneration is critical to the development of effective treatments for disease. Here, we review what is known about neuronal cell death and how it relates to our understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathology. First, we discuss prominent molecular signaling pathways that drive neuronal loss, and highlight the upstream cell biology underlying their activation. We then address how neuronal death may occur during disease in response to neuron intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction and cell death will open up avenues for clinical intervention in a field lacking disease-modifying treatments.","180":"The epicardium, the outermost tissue layer that envelops all vertebrate hearts, plays a crucial role in cardiac development and regeneration and has been implicated in potential strategies for cardiac repair. The heterogenous cell population that composes the epicardium originates primarily from a transient embryonic cell cluster known as the proepicardial organ (PE). Characterized by its high cellular plasticity, the epicardium contributes to both heart development and regeneration in two critical ways: as a source of progenitor cells and as a critical signaling hub. Despite this knowledge, there are many unanswered questions in the field of epicardial biology, the resolution of which will advance the understanding of cardiac development and repair. We review current knowledge in cross-species epicardial involvement, specifically in relation to lineage specification and differentiation during cardiac development.","181":"Changes in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) represent a vital signaling mechanism enabling communication between and among cells as well as with the environment. Cells have developed a sophisticated set of molecules, \"the Ca2+ toolkit,\" to adapt [Ca2+]i changes to specific cellular functions. Mammalian oocytes and eggs, the subject of this review, are not an exception, and in fact the initiation of embryo devolvement in all species is entirely dependent on distinct [Ca2+]i responses. Here, we review the components of the Ca2+ toolkit present in mammalian oocytes and eggs, the regulatory mechanisms that allow these cells to accumulate Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, release it, and maintain basal and stable cytoplasmic concentrations. We also discuss electrophysiological and genetic studies that have uncovered Ca2+ influx channels in oocytes and eggs, and we analyze evidence supporting the role of a sperm-specific phospholipase C isoform as the trigger of Ca2+ oscillations during mammalian fertilization including its implication in fertility.","182":null,"183":"Receptor-interacting serine threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a widely expressed kinase that is essential for limiting inflammation in both mice and humans. Mice lacking RIPK1 die at birth from multiorgan inflammation and aberrant cell death, whereas humans lacking RIPK1 are immunodeficient and develop very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast to complete loss of RIPK1, inhibiting the kinase activity of RIPK1 genetically or pharmacologically prevents cell death and inflammation in several mouse disease models. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of RIPK1 are in phase I clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and phase II clinical trials for psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. This review focuses on which signaling pathways use RIPK1, how activation of RIPK1 is regulated, and when activation of RIPK1 appears to be an important driver of inflammation.","184":"Calcium signaling is critical to neuronal function and regulates highly diverse processes such as gene transcription, energy production, protein handling, and synaptic structure and function. Because there are many common underlying calcium-mediated pathological features observed across several neurological conditions, it has been proposed that neurodegenerative diseases have an upstream underlying calcium basis in their pathogenesis. With certain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, specific sources of calcium dysregulation originating from distinct neuronal compartments or channels have been shown to have defined roles in initiating or sustaining disease mechanisms. Herein, we will review the major hallmarks of these diseases, and how they relate to calcium dysregulation. We will then discuss neuronal calcium handling throughout the neuron, with special emphasis on channels involved in neurodegeneration.","185":"Ionized calcium (Ca2+) is the most versatile cellular messenger. All cells use Ca2+ signals to regulate their activities in response to extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. Alterations in cellular Ca2+ signaling and\/or Ca2+ homeostasis can subvert physiological processes into driving pathological outcomes. Imaging of living cells over the past decades has demonstrated that Ca2+ signals encode information in their frequency, kinetics, amplitude, and spatial extent. These parameters alter depending on the type and intensity of stimulation, and cellular context. Moreover, it is evident that different cell types produce widely varying Ca2+ signals, with properties that suit their physiological functions. This primer discusses basic principles and mechanisms underlying cellular Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+ homeostasis. Consequently, we have cited some historical articles in addition to more recent findings. A brief summary of the core features of cellular Ca2+ signaling is provided, with particular focus on Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ transport across cellular membranes, as well as mechanisms by which Ca2+ signals activate downstream effector systems.","186":"RNA molecules perform diverse functions in mammalian cells, including transferring genetic information from DNA to protein and playing diverse regulatory roles through interactions with other cellular components. Here, we discuss how clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based technologies for directed perturbations of DNA and RNA are revealing new insights into RNA regulation. First, we review the fundamentals of CRISPR-Cas enzymes and functional genomics tools that leverage these systems. Second, we explore how these new perturbation technologies are transforming the study of regulation of and by RNA, focusing on the functions of DNA regulatory elements and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Third, we highlight an emerging class of RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes that have the potential to catalyze studies of RNA biology by providing tools to directly perturb or measure RNA modifications and functions. Together, these tools enable systematic studies of RNA function and regulation in mammalian cells.","187":"At each active protein-encoding gene, nascent RNA is tethered to the DNA axis by elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and is continuously altered by splicing and other processing events during its synthesis. This review discusses the development of three major methods that enable us to track the conversion of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) to messenger RNA (mRNA) products in vivo: live-cell imaging, metabolic labeling of RNA, and RNA-seq of purified nascent RNA. These approaches are complementary, addressing distinct issues of transcription rates and intron lifetimes alongside spatial information regarding the gene position of Pol II at which spliceosomes act. The findings will be placed in the context of active transcription units, each of which-because of the presence of nascent RNA, Pol II, and features of the chromatin environment-will recruit a potentially gene-specific constellation of RNA binding proteins and processing machineries.","188":"Ca2+ is an important intracellular messenger affecting diverse cellular processes. In eukaryotic cells, Ca2+ is handled by a myriad of Ca2+-binding proteins found in organelles that are organized into the cellular reticular network (CRN). The network is comprised of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, membranous components of the endocytic and exocytic pathways, peroxisomes, and the nuclear envelope. Membrane contact sites between the different components of the CRN enable the rapid movement of Ca2+, and communication of Ca2+ status, within the network. Ca2+-handling proteins that reside in the CRN facilitate Ca2+ sensing, buffering, and cellular signaling to coordinate the many processes that operate within the cell.","189":"Since the identification of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) and its putative target, the two-pore channel (TPC), the NAADP\/TPC\/Ca2+ signaling pathway has been reported to play a role in a diverse range of functions in a variety of different cell types. TPCs have also been associated with a number of diseases, which arise when their activity is perturbed. In addition, TPCs have been shown to play key roles in various embryological processes and during the differentiation of a variety of cell types. Here, we review the role of NAADP\/TPC\/Ca2+ signaling during early embryonic development and cellular differentiation. We pay particular attention to the role of TPC2 in the development and maturation of early neuromuscular activity in zebrafish, and during the differentiation of isolated osteoclasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. Our aim is to emphasize the conserved features of TPC-mediated Ca2+ signaling in a number of selected examples.","190":"Calcium (Ca2+) ion microdomains are subcellular regions of high Ca2+ concentration that develop rapidly near open Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane or internal stores and generate local regions of high Ca2+ concentration. These microdomains are remarkably versatile in that they activate a range of responses that differ enormously in both their temporal and spatial profile. In this review, we describe how Ca2+ microdomains generated by store-operated calcium channels, a widespread and conserved Ca2+ entry pathway, stimulate different signaling pathways, and how the spatial extent of a Ca2+ microdomain can be influenced by Ca2+ ATPase pumps.","191":"Semidwarf stature is a valuable agronomic trait in grain crops that reduces lodging and increases harvest index. A fundamental advance during the 1960s Green Revolution was the introduction of semidwarf cultivars of rice and wheat. Essentially, all semidwarf varieties of rice under cultivation today owe their diminished stature to a specific null mutation in the gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis gene, SD1 However, it is now well-established that, in addition to GAs, brassinosteroids and strigolactones also control plant height. In this review, we describe the synthesis and signaling pathways of these three hormones as understood in rice and discuss the mutants and transgenics in these pathways that confer semidwarfism and other valuable architectural traits. We propose that such genes offer underexploited opportunities for broadening the genetic basis and germplasm in semidwarf rice breeding.","192":null,"193":null,"194":"Regeneration is the process by which lost or damaged tissue is replaced in adult organisms. Some organisms exhibit robust regenerative capabilities, while others, including humans, do not. Understanding the molecular principles governing the regenerative malleability of different organisms is of fundamental biological interest. Further, this problem has clear impact for the field of \"regenerative medicine,\" which aspires to understand how human cells, tissues, and organs may be restored to normal function in scenarios of disease, damage, or age-related decline. This review will focus on the planarian flatworm as a powerful model system for studying the role of Ca2+ signals in regeneration. These invertebrate animals display an astounding innate regenerative capacity capable of regenerating complete organisms from tiny, excised fragments. New knowledge and methodological capabilities in this system highlight the potential for studying the role of Ca2+ signaling at multiple stages of the regenerative blueprint that controls stem cell behavior in vivo.","195":"Rhythmic increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration underlie the contractile function of the heart. These heart muscle-wide changes in intracellular Ca2+ are induced and coordinated by electrical depolarization of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma by the action potential. Originating at the sinoatrial node, conduction of this electrical signal throughout the heart ensures synchronization of individual myocytes into an effective cardiac pump. Ca2+ signaling pathways also regulate gene expression and cardiomyocyte growth during development and in pathology. These fundamental roles of Ca2+ in the heart are illustrated by the prevalence of altered Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, heart failure (an inability of the heart to support hemodynamic needs), rhythmic disturbances, and inappropriate cardiac growth all share an involvement of altered Ca2+ handling. The prevalence of these pathologies, contributing to a third of all deaths in the developed world as well as to substantial morbidity makes understanding the mechanisms of Ca2+ handling and dysregulation in cardiomyocytes of great importance.","196":"The above-ground plant body in different plant species can have very distinct forms or architectures that arise by recurrent redeployment of a finite set of building blocks-leaves with axillary meristems, stems or branches, and flowers. The unique architectures of plant inflorescences in different plant families and species, on which this review focuses, determine the reproductive success and yield of wild and cultivated plants. Major contributors to the inflorescence architecture are the activity and developmental trajectories adopted by axillary meristems, which determine the degree of branching and the number of flowers formed. Recent advances in genetic and molecular analyses in diverse flowering plants have uncovered both common regulatory principles and unique players and\/or regulatory interactions that underlie inflorescence architecture. Modulating activity of these regulators has already led to yield increases in the field. Additional insight into the underlying regulatory interactions and principles will not only uncover how their rewiring resulted in altered plant form, but will also enhance efforts at optimizing plant architecture in desirable ways in crop species.","197":"Recent advances in structural biology methods have enabled a surge in the number of RNA and RNA-protein assembly structures available at atomic or near-atomic resolution. These complexes are often trapped in discrete conformational states that exist along a mechanistic pathway. Single-molecule fluorescence methods provide temporal resolution to elucidate the dynamic mechanisms of processes involving complex RNA and RNA-protein assemblies, but interpretation of such data often requires previous structural knowledge. Here we highlight how single-molecule tools can directly complement structural approaches for two processes--translation and reverse transcription-to provide a dynamic view of molecular function.","198":"Deciphering complex RNA-protein interactions on a (near-)atomic level is a hurdle that hinders advancing our understanding of fundamental processes in RNA metabolism and RNA-based gene regulation. To overcome challenges associated with individual structure determination methods, structural information derived from complementary biophysical methods can be combined in integrative structural biology approaches. Here, we review recent advances in such hybrid structural approaches with a focus on combining mass spectrometric analysis of cross-linked protein-RNA complexes and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.","199":"Glycosylation plays a major role in the structural diversification of plant natural products. It influences the properties of molecules by modifying the reactivity and solubility of the corresponding aglycones, so influencing cellular localization and bioactivity. Glycosylation of plant natural products is usually carried out by uridine diphosphate(UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) belonging to the carbohydrate-active enzyme glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family. These enzymes transfer sugars from UDP-activated sugar moieties to small hydrophobic acceptor molecules. Plant GT1s generally show high specificity for their sugar donors and recognize a single UDP sugar as their substrate. In contrast, they are generally promiscuous with regard to acceptors, making them attractive biotechnological tools for small molecule glycodiversification. Although microbial hosts have traditionally been used for heterologous engineering of plant-derived glycosides, transient plant expression technology offers a potentially disruptive platform for rapid characterization of new plant glycosyltransferases and biosynthesis of complex glycosides.","200":"Of the established Ca2+-mobilizing messengers, NAADP is arguably the most tantalizing. It is the most potent, often efficacious at low nanomolar concentrations, and its receptors undergo dramatic desensitization. Recent studies have identified a new class of calcium-release channel, the two-pore channels (TPCs), as the likely targets for NAADP regulation, even though the effect may be indirect. These channels localized at endolysosomes, where they mediate local Ca2+ release, and have highlighted a new role of acidic organelles as targets for messenger-evoked Ca2+ mobilization. Three distinct roles of TPCs have been identified. The first is to effect local Ca2+ release that may play a role in endolysosomal function including vesicular fusion and trafficking. The second is to trigger global calcium release by recruiting Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (CICR) channels at lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions. The third is to regulate plasma membrane excitability by the targeting of Ca2+ release from appropriately positioned subplasma membrane stores to regulate plasma membrane Ca2+-activated channels. In this review, I discuss the role of nicotinic acid adenine nucleotide diphosphate (NAADP)-mediated Ca2+ release from endolysosomal stores as a widespread trigger for intracellular calcium signaling mechanisms, and how studies of TPCs are beginning to enhance our understanding of the central role of lysosomes in Ca2+ signaling.","201":"Manihot esculenta Crantz (cassava) is a food crop originating from South America grown primarily for its starchy storage roots. Today, cassava is grown in the tropics of South America, Africa, and Asia with an estimated 800 million people relying on it as a staple source of calories. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, cassava is particularly crucial for food security. Cassava root starch also has use in the pharmaceutical, textile, paper, and biofuel industries. Cassava has seen strong demand since 2000 and production has increased consistently year-over-year, but potential yields are hampered by susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, bacterial and viral diseases can cause severe yield losses. Of note are cassava bacterial blight (CBB), cassava mosaic disease (CMD), and cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), all of which can cause catastrophic losses for growers. In this article, we provide an overview of the major microbial diseases of cassava, discuss current and potential future efforts to engineer new sources of resistance, and conclude with a discussion of the regulatory hurdles that face biotechnology.","202":"Eggplant, or brinjal (Solanum melongena), is a popularly consumed vegetable grown throughout Asia that is prone to vicious and sustained attack by the eggplant fruit and shoot borer (EFSB) (Leucinodes orbonalis) throughout the growing season. Yield losses in Bangladesh because of EFSB infestation have been reported as high as 86%. Farmers reduce crop losses by frequent applications of insecticide. To counter the EFSB pest, Bangladesh has developed and released four Bt brinjal varieties expressing Cry1Ac (Bt brinjal). Bangladesh is the first developing country to release a commercial genetically engineered (GE) food crop. In this article, we discuss the development and adoption of Bt brinjal in Bangladesh from initial distribution to 20 farmers in 2014 to cultivation by more than 27,000 farmers in 2018. Bt brinjal provides essentially complete control of EFSB, dramatically reduces insecticide sprays, provides a sixfold increase in grower profit, and does not affect nontarget arthropod biodiversity. A major focus is to ensure its durability through stewardship. Bangladesh has shown great leadership in adopting biotechnology for the benefit of its farmers and serves as an example for other countries.","203":null,"204":"","205":"The remarkable physicochemical properties of the natural nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, define modern biology at the molecular level and are widely believed to have been central to life's origins. However, their ability to form repositories of information as well as functional structures such as ligands (aptamers) and catalysts (ribozymes\/DNAzymes) is not unique. A range of nonnatural alternatives, collectively termed xeno nucleic acids (XNAs), are also capable of supporting genetic information storage and propagation as well as evolution. This gives rise to a new field of \"synthetic genetics,\" which seeks to expand the nucleic acid chemical toolbox for applications in both biotechnology and molecular medicine. In this review, we outline XNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase engineering as a key enabling technology and summarize the application of \"synthetic genetics\" to the development of aptamers, enzymes, and nanostructures.","206":"An important mechanism of gene expression regulation is the regulated modification of nucleotides in messenger RNA (mRNA). These modified nucleotides affect mRNA translation, stability, splicing, and other processes. A cluster of nucleotide modifications is found adjacent to the mRNA cap structure and another set can be found internally within transcripts. The most prominent modifications are methylations of adenosine to form either N 6-methyladenosine (m6A), an internal modified nucleotide, or N 6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), which is found exclusively at the first templated nucleotide of certain mRNAs. In addition, other rare modified nucleotides have been identified and together these form the epitranscriptomic code of mRNA. In the case of some modified nucleotides, the presence, location, or abundance is a subject of debate. Here, we review the methods that enable the discovery of modified nucleotides and how these approaches can be used to map epitranscriptomic modifications in mRNA.","207":"The evolutionary processes that transitioned plants to land-based habitats also incorporated a multiplicity of strategies to enhance resilience to the greater environmental variation encountered on land. The sensing of light, its quality, quantity, and duration, is central to plant survival and, as such, serves as a central network hub. Similarly, plants as sessile organisms that can encounter isolation must continually assess their reproductive options, requiring plasticity in propagation by self- and cross-pollination or asexual strategies. Irregular fluctuations and intermittent extremes in temperature, soil fertility, and moisture conditions have given impetus to genetic specializations for network resiliency, protein neofunctionalization, and internal mechanisms to accelerate their evolution. We review some of the current advancements made in understanding plant resiliency and phenotypic plasticity mechanisms. These mechanisms incorporate unusual nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions, various transposable element (TE) activities, and epigenetic plasticity of central gene networks that are broadly pleiotropic to influence resiliency phenotypes.","208":"The circadian oscillator is a complex network of interconnected feedback loops that regulates a wide range of physiological processes. Indeed, variation in clock genes has been implicated in an array of plant environmental adaptations, including growth regulation, photoperiodic control of flowering, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress. Although the clock is buffered against the environment, maintaining roughly 24-h rhythms across a wide range of conditions, it can also be reset by environmental cues such as acute changes in light or temperature. These competing demands may help explain the complexity of the links between the circadian clock network and environmental response pathways. Here, we discuss our current understanding of the clock and its interactions with light and temperature-signaling pathways. We also describe different clock gene alleles that have been implicated in the domestication of important staple crops.","209":"Calcification is a regulated physiological process occurring in bones and teeth. However, calcification is commonly found in soft tissues in association with aging and in a variety of diseases. Over the last two decades, it has emerged that calcification occurring in diseased arteries is not simply an inevitable build-up of insoluble precipitates of calcium phosphate. In some cases, it is an active process in which transcription factors drive conversion of vascular cells to an osteoblast or chondrocyte-like phenotype, with the subsequent production of mineralizing \"matrix vesicles.\" Early studies of bone and cartilage calcification suggested roles for cellular calcium signaling in several of the processes involved in the regulation of bone calcification. Similarly, calcium signaling has recently been highlighted as an important component in the mechanisms regulating pathological calcification. The emerging hypothesis is that ectopic\/pathological calcification occurs in tissues in which there is an imbalance in the regulatory mechanisms that actively prevent calcification. This review highlights the various ways that calcium signaling regulates tissue calcification, with a particular focus on pathological vascular calcification.","210":"Intracellular Ca2+ signals are well organized in all cell types, and trigger a variety of vital physiological processes. The temporal and spatial characteristics of cytosolic Ca2+ increases are mainly governed by the fluxes of this ion across the membrane of the endoplasmic\/sarcoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. However, various Ca2+ transporters also allow for Ca2+ exchanges between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ stimulate the production of ATP, which allows the cells to cope with the increased energy demand created by the stimulus. Less widely appreciated is the fact that Ca2+ handling by mitochondria also shapes cytosolic Ca2+ signals. Indeed, the frequency, amplitude, and duration of cytosolic Ca2+ increases can be altered by modifying the rates of Ca2+ transport into, or from, mitochondria. In this review, we focus on the interplay between mitochondria and Ca2+ signaling, highlighting not only the consequences of cytosolic Ca2+ changes on mitochondrial Ca2+, but also how cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics is controlled by modifications of the Ca2+-handling properties and the metabolism of mitochondria.","211":"An invasive fungal pathogen has reduced the American chestnut (Castanea dentata), once a keystone tree species within its natural range in the eastern United States and Canada, to functional extinction. To help restore this important canopy tree, blight-tolerant American chestnut trees have been developed using an oxalate oxidase-encoding gene from wheat. This enzyme breaks down oxalate, which is produced by the pathogen and forms killing cankers. Expressing oxalate oxidase results in blight tolerance, where the tree and the fungus can coexist, which is a more evolutionarily stable relationship than direct pathogen resistance. Genetic engineering (GE) typically makes a very small change in the tree's genome, potentially avoiding incompatible gene interactions that have been detected in some chestnut hybrids. The GE American chestnut also retains all the wild American chestnut's alleles for habitat adaptation, which are important for a forest ecosystem restoration program.","212":"Astrocytes are the homeostatic and protective cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In neurological diseases, astrocytes undergo complex changes, which are subclassified into (1) reactive astrogliosis, an evolutionary conserved defensive rearrangement of cellular phenotype aimed at neuroprotection; (2) pathological remodeling, when astrocytes acquire new features driving pathology; and (3) astrodegeneration, which is manifested by astroglial atrophy and loss of homeostatic functions. In aging brains as well as in the brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), astrocytes acquire both atrophic and reactive phenotypes in a region- and disease-stage-dependent manner. Prevalence of atrophy overreactivity, observed in certain brain regions and in terminal stages of the disease, arguably facilitates the development of neurological deficits. Astrocytes exhibit ionic excitability mediated by changes in intracellular concentration of ions, most importantly of Ca2+ and Na+, with intracellular ion dynamics triggered by the activity of neural networks. AD astrocytes associated with senile plaques demonstrate Ca2+ hyperactivity in the form of aberrant Ca2+ oscillations and pathological long-range Ca2+ waves. Astroglial Ca2+ signaling originating from Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum is a key factor in initiating astrogliotic response; deficient Ca2+ signaling toolkits observed in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices of AD model animals may account for vulnerability of these regions to the pathology.","213":"Bcl-2 is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cell survival. Expression of Bcl-2 is aberrantly elevated in many types of cancer. Within cells of the immune system, Bcl-2 has a physiological role in regulating immune responses. However, in cancers arising from cells of the immune system Bcl-2 promotes cell survival and proliferation. This review summarizes discoveries over the past 30 years that have elucidated Bcl-2's role in the normal immune system, including its actions in regulating calcium (Ca2+) signals necessary for the immune response, and for Ca2+-mediated apoptosis at the end of an immune response. How Bcl-2 modulates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) is discussed, and in particular, the role of Bcl-2\/IP3R interactions in promoting the survival of cancer cells by preventing Ca2+-mediated cell death. The development and usage of a peptide, referred to as TAT-Pep8, or more recently, BIRD-2, that induces death of cancer cells by inhibiting Bcl-2's control over IP3R-mediated Ca2+ elevation is discussed. Studies aimed at discovering a small molecule that mimics BIRD-2's anticancer mechanism of action are summarized, along with the prospect of such a compound becoming a novel therapeutic option for cancer.","214":"Maintenance of the proteome, ensuring the proper locations, proper conformations, appropriate concentrations, etc., is essential to preserve the health of an organism in the face of environmental insults, infectious diseases, and the challenges associated with aging. Maintaining the proteome is even more difficult in the background of inherited mutations that render a given protein and others handled by the same proteostasis machinery misfolding prone and\/or aggregation prone. Maintenance of the proteome or maintaining proteostasis requires the orchestration of protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation by way of highly conserved, interacting, and competitive proteostasis pathways. Each subcellular compartment has a unique proteostasis network compromising common and specialized proteostasis maintenance pathways. Stress-responsive signaling pathways detect the misfolding and\/or aggregation of proteins in specific subcellular compartments using stress sensors and respond by generating an active transcription factor. Subsequent transcriptional programs up-regulate proteostasis network capacity (i.e., ability to fold and degrade proteins in that compartment). Stress-responsive signaling pathways can also be linked by way of signaling cascades to nontranscriptional means to reestablish proteostasis (e.g., by translational attenuation). Proteostasis is also strongly influenced by the inherent kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding, misfolding, and aggregation of individual proteins, and these sequence-based attributes in combination with proteostasis network capacity together influence proteostasis. In this review, we will focus on the growing body of evidence that proteostasis deficits leading to human pathology can be reversed by pharmacologic adaptation of proteostasis network capacity through stress-responsive signaling pathway activation. The power of this approach will be exemplified by focusing on the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response stress responsive-signaling pathway that regulates proteostasis network capacity of the secretory pathway.","215":null,"216":"Processes that are important in cancer progression, such as sustained cell growth, invasion to other organs, and resistance to cell death inducers, have a clear overlap with pathways regulated by Ca2+ signaling. It is therefore not surprising that proteins important in Ca2+ signaling, sometimes referred to as the \"Ca2+ signaling toolkit,\" can contribute to cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness, and the ability of agents to induce cancer cell death. Ca2+ signaling is also critical in other aspects of cancer progression, including events in the tumor microenvironment and processes involved in the acquisition of resistance to anticancer therapies. This review will consider the role of Ca2+ signaling in tumor progression and highlight areas in which a better understanding of the interplay between the Ca2+-signaling toolkit and tumorigenesis is still required.","217":"Strigolactones (SLs), a group of plant secondary metabolites, play an important role as a host recognition signal for symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the rhizosphere. SLs promote symbioses with other beneficial microbes, including root nodule bacteria. Root parasitic weeds also take advantage of SLs as a clue to locate living host roots. In plants, SLs function as plant hormones regulating various growth and developmental processes including shoot and root architectures. Plants under nutrient deficiencies, especially that of phosphate, promote SL production and exudation to attract symbionts and to optimize shoot and root architecture.","218":"In the postgenomic era, it is clear that the human genome encodes thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Along the way, RNA imaging (e.g., RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization [RNA-FISH]) has been instrumental in identifying powerful roles for lncRNAs based on their subcellular localization patterns. Here, we explore how RNA imaging technologies have shed new light on how, when, and where lncRNAs may play functional roles. Specifically, we will synthesize the underlying principles of RNA imaging techniques by exploring several landmark lncRNA imaging studies that have illuminated key insights into lncRNA biology.","219":"Stomata are small pores on the surface of land plants that facilitate gas exchange-acquiring CO2 from surrounding atmosphere and releasing water vapor. In adverse conditions, such as drought, stomata close to minimize water loss. The activities of stomata are vital for plant growth and survival. In the last two decades, key players for stomatal development have been discovered thanks to the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana Our knowledge about the formation of stomata and their response to environmental changes are accumulating. In this review, we summarize the genetic and molecular mechanisms of stomatal development, with specific emphasis on recent findings and potential applications toward enhancing the sustainability of agriculture.","220":"The functional health of the proteome is determined by properties of the proteostasis network (PN) that regulates protein synthesis, folding, macromolecular assembly, translocation, and degradation. In eukaryotes, the PN also integrates protein biogenesis across compartments within the cell and between tissues of metazoans for organismal health and longevity. Additionally, in metazoans, proteome stability and the functional health of proteins is optimized for development and yet declines throughout aging, accelerating the risk for misfolding, aggregation, and cellular dysfunction. Here, I describe the cell-nonautonomous regulation of organismal PN by tissue communication and cell stress-response pathways. These systems are robust from development through reproductive maturity and are genetically programmed to decline abruptly in early adulthood by repression of the heat shock response and other cell-protective stress responses, thus compromising the ability of cells and tissues to properly buffer against the cumulative stress of protein damage during aging. While the failure of multiple protein quality control processes during aging challenges cellular function and tissue health, genetic studies, and the identification of small-molecule proteostasis regulators suggests strategies that can be employed to reset the PN with potential benefit on cellular health and organismal longevity.","221":"RNAs, across their numerous classes, often work in concert with proteins in RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) to execute critical cellular functions. Ensemble-averaging methods have been instrumental in revealing many important aspects of these RNA-protein interactions, yet are insufficiently sensitive to much of the dynamics at the heart of RNP function. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM) offers complementary, versatile tools to probe RNP conformational and compositional changes in detail. In this review, we first outline the basic principles of SMFM as applied to RNPs, describing key considerations for labeling, imaging, and quantitative analysis. We then sample applications of in vitro and in vivo single-molecule visualization using the case studies of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and RNA silencing, respectively. After discussing specific insights single-molecule fluorescence methods have yielded, we briefly review recent developments in the field and highlight areas of anticipated growth.","222":null,"223":"The autophagy lysosomal pathway (ALP) is a major mechanism for degrading intracellular macromolecules. The catabolic products can then be used by the cell for energy or as building blocks to make other macromolecules. Since its discovery, a variety of cellular pathways have emerged that target components with varying specificity for lysosomal degradation. Under some circumstances, lysosomes may release their contents into the extracellular space where they may serve signaling or pathogenic functions. The ALP is active in healthy cells, and the level of activity can be regulated by nutrient-sensing and metabolic signaling pathways. The ALP is the primary pathway by which lipids and damaged organelles are degraded and may be the only pathway capable of degrading aggregated proteins. As such, there has been intense interest in understanding the role of the ALP in the accumulation of aggregated misfolded proteins characteristic of many of the major adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the ALP and its potential relationship to the pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","224":"Cancer is often associated with alterations in the chaperome, a collection of chaperones, cochaperones, and other cofactors. Changes in the expression levels of components of the chaperome, in the interaction strength among chaperome components, alterations in chaperome constituency, and in the cellular location of chaperome members, are all hallmarks of cancer. Here we aim to provide an overview on how chemical biology has played a role in deciphering such complexity in the biology of the chaperome in cancer and in other diseases. The focus here is narrow and on pathologic changes in the chaperome executed by enhancing the interaction strength between components of distinct chaperome pathways, specifically between those of HSP90 and HSP70 pathways. We will review chemical tools and chemical probe-based assays, with a focus on HSP90. We will discuss how kinetic binding, not classical equilibrium binding, is most appropriate in the development of drugs and probes for the chaperome in disease. We will then present our view on how chaperome inhibitors may become potential drugs and diagnostics in cancer.","225":"The misfolding of proteins is now recognized to be the origin of a large number of medical disorders. One particularly important group of such disorders is associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins into amyloid structures, and includes conditions ranging from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases to type II diabetes. Such conditions already affect over 500 million people in the world, a number that is rising rapidly, and at present these disorders cannot be effectively treated or prevented. This review provides an overview of this field of science and discusses recent progress in understanding the nature and properties of the amyloid state, the kinetics and mechanism governing its formation, the origins of its links with disease, and the manner in which its formation may be inhibited or suppressed. This latter topic is of particular importance, both to enhance our knowledge of the maintenance of protein homeostasis in living organisms and also to address the development of therapeutic strategies through which to combat the loss of homeostasis and the associated onset and progression of disease.","226":"Phosphorous is important for life but often limiting for plants. The symbiotic pathway of phosphate uptake via arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is evolutionarily ancient and today occurs in natural and agricultural ecosystems alike. Plants capable of this symbiosis can obtain up to all of the phosphate from symbiotic fungi, and this offers potential means to develop crops less dependent on unsustainable P fertilizers. Here, we review the mechanisms and insights gleaned from the fine-tuned signal exchanges that orchestrate the intimate mutualistic symbiosis between plants and AMF. As the currency of trade, nutrients have signaling functions beyond being the nutritional goal of mutualism. We propose that such signaling roles and metabolic reprogramming may represent commitments for a mutualistic symbiosis that act across the stages of symbiosis development.","227":"Proteinopathies are degenerative diseases in which specific proteins adopt deleterious conformations, leading to the dysfunction and demise of distinct cell types. They comprise some of the most significant diseases of aging-from Alzheimer's disease to Parkinson's disease to type 2 diabetes-for which not a single disease-modifying or preventative strategy exists. Here, we survey approaches in tractable cellular and organismal models that bring us toward a more complete understanding of the molecular consequences of protein misfolding. These include proteome-scale profiling of genetic modifiers, as well as transcriptional and proteome changes. We describe assays that can capture protein interactomes in situ and distinct protein conformational states. A picture of cellular drivers and responders to proteotoxicity emerges from this work, distinguishing general alterations of proteostasis from cellular events that are deeply tied to the intrinsic function of the misfolding protein. These distinctions have consequences for the understanding and treatment of proteinopathies.","228":"Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels play diverse roles in cellular Ca2+ signaling. First, as Ca2+-permeable channels that respond to a variety of stimuli, TRP channels can directly initiate cellular Ca2+ signals. Second, as nonselective cation channels, TRP channel activation leads to membrane depolarization, influencing Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated and store-operated Ca2+ channels. Finally, Ca2+ modulates the activity of most TRP channels, allowing them to function as molecular effectors downstream of intracellular Ca2+ signals. Whereas the TRP channel field has long been devoid of detailed channel structures, recent advances, particularly in cryo-electron microscopy-based structural approaches, have yielded a flurry of TRP channel structures, including members from all seven subfamilies. These structures, in conjunction with mutagenesis-based functional approaches, provided important new insights into the mechanisms whereby TRP channels permeate and sense Ca2+ These insights will be highly instrumental in the rational design of novel treatments for the multitude of TRP channel-related diseases.","229":"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that rely on their hosts for protein synthesis, genome replication, and viral particle production. As such, they have evolved mechanisms to divert host resources, including molecular chaperones, facilitate folding and assembly of viral proteins, stabilize complex structures under constant mutational pressure, and modulate signaling pathways to dampen antiviral responses and prevent premature host death. Biogenesis of viral proteins often presents unique challenges to the proteostasis network, as it requires the rapid and orchestrated production of high levels of a limited number of multifunctional, multidomain, and aggregation-prone proteins. To overcome such challenges, viruses interact with the folding machinery not only as clients but also as regulators of chaperone expression, function, and subcellular localization. In this review, we summarize the main types of interactions between viral proteins and chaperones during infection, examine evolutionary aspects of this relationship, and discuss the potential of using chaperone inhibitors as broad-spectrum antivirals.","230":"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones that delay formation of harmful protein aggregates. sHSPs' role in protein homeostasis has been appreciated for decades, but their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This gap in understanding is largely a consequence of sHSP properties that make them recalcitrant to detailed study. Multiple stress-associated conditions including pH acidosis, oxidation, and unusual availability of metal ions, as well as reversible stress-induced phosphorylation can modulate sHSP chaperone activity. Investigations of sHSPs reveal that sHSPs can engage in transient or long-lived interactions with client proteins depending on solution conditions and sHSP or client identity. Recent advances in the field highlight both the diversity of function within the sHSP family and the exquisite sensitivity of individual sHSPs to cellular and experimental conditions. Here, we will present and highlight current understanding, recent progress, and future challenges.","231":"Cells invest in an extensive network of factors to maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates. This proteostasis network (PN) comprises the machineries for the biogenesis, folding, conformational maintenance, and degradation of proteins with molecular chaperones as central coordinators. Here, we review recent progress in understanding the modular architecture of the PN in mammalian cells and how it is modified during cell differentiation. We discuss the capacity and limitations of the PN in maintaining proteome integrity in the face of proteotoxic stresses, such as aggregate formation in neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we outline various pharmacological interventions to ameliorate proteostasis imbalance.","232":"The continuous refreshment of the proteome is critical to maintain protein homeostasis and to adapt cells to changing conditions. Thus, de novo protein biogenesis by ribosomes is vitally important to every cellular system. This process is delicate and error-prone and requires, besides cytosolic chaperones, the guidance by a specialized set of molecular chaperones that bind transiently to the translation machinery and the nascent protein to support early folding events and to regulate cotranslational protein transport. These chaperones include the bacterial trigger factor (TF), the archaeal and eukaryotic nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), and the eukaryotic ribosome-associated complex (RAC). This review focuses on the structures, functions, and substrates of these ribosome-associated chaperones and highlights the most recent findings about their potential mechanisms of action.","233":"One of the major functions of the protein homeostasis system is to maintain proteins in their soluble states, and indeed several human disorders are associated with the aberrant aggregation of proteins. An active involvement of the protein homeostasis system is necessary to avoid aggregation because proteins are expressed at levels close to their solubility limits, hence being poorly soluble. The mechanisms by which the protein homeostasis system acts to control protein aggregation are, however, still not known in much detail. To facilitate systematic investigations of these mechanisms, we describe here the CamSol method of predicting protein solubility, and illustrate its initial applications. We anticipate that with the advent of powerful proteomics and transcriptomic methods, in combination with the use of the CamSol method and related approaches to predict the solubility and other biophysical properties of proteins, it will become possible to increase our understanding of the principles of protein homeostasis related to the maintenance of the proteome in its soluble form.","234":"Calcium signaling in neurons as in other cell types can lead to varied changes in cellular function. Neuronal Ca2+ signaling processes have also become adapted to modulate the function of specific pathways over a wide variety of time domains and these can have effects on, for example, axon outgrowth, neuronal survival, and changes in synaptic strength. Ca2+ also plays a key role in synapses as the trigger for fast neurotransmitter release. Given its physiological importance, abnormalities in neuronal Ca2+ signaling potentially underlie many different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanisms by which changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neurons can bring about diverse responses is underpinned by the roles of ubiquitous or specialized neuronal Ca2+ sensors. It has been established that synaptotagmins have key functions in neurotransmitter release, and, in addition to calmodulin, other families of EF-hand-containing neuronal Ca2+ sensors, including the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) and the calcium-binding protein (CaBP) families, play important physiological roles in neuronal Ca2+ signaling. It has become increasingly apparent that these various Ca2+ sensors may also be crucial for aspects of neuronal dysfunction and disease either indirectly or directly as a direct consequence of genetic variation or mutations. An understanding of the molecular basis for the regulation of the targets of the Ca2+ sensors and the physiological roles of each protein in identified neurons may contribute to future approaches to the development of treatments for a variety of human neuronal disorders.","235":"A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the segregation of complex biochemical processes among different intracellular compartments. The protein targeting, translocation, and trafficking pathways that sustain compartmentalization must recognize a diverse range of clients via degenerate signals. This recognition is imperfect, resulting in polypeptides at incorrect cellular locations. Cells have evolved mechanisms to selectively recognize mislocalized proteins and triage them for degradation or rescue. These spatial quality control pathways maintain cellular protein homeostasis, become especially important during organelle stress, and might contribute to disease when they are impaired or overwhelmed.","236":"The proteasome, the most complex protease known, degrades proteins that have been conjugated to ubiquitin. It faces the unique challenge of acting enzymatically on hundreds and perhaps thousands of structurally diverse substrates, mechanically unfolding them from their native state and translocating them vectorially from one specialized compartment of the enzyme to another. Moreover, substrates are modified by ubiquitin in myriad configurations of chains. The many unusual design features of the proteasome may have evolved in part to endow this enzyme with a robust ability to process substrates regardless of their identity. The proteasome plays a major role in preserving protein homeostasis in the cell, which requires adaptation to a wide variety of stress conditions. Modulation of proteasome function is achieved through a large network of proteins that interact with it dynamically, modify it enzymatically, or fine-tune its levels. The resulting adaptability of the proteasome, which is unique among proteases, enables cells to control the output of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway on a global scale.","237":"Long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are abundantly expressed in animals, in which they frequently occur in introns and 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs. Functions of long, cellular dsRNAs are poorly understood, although deficiencies in adenosine deaminases that act on RNA, or ADARs, promote their recognition as viral dsRNA and an aberrant immune response. Diverse dsRNA-binding proteins bind cellular dsRNAs, hinting at additional roles. Understanding these roles is facilitated by mapping the genomic locations that express dsRNA in various tissues and organisms. ADAR editing provides a signature of dsRNA structure in cellular transcripts. In this review, we detail approaches to map ADAR editing sites and dsRNAs genome-wide, with particular focus on high-throughput sequencing methods and considerations for their successful application to the detection of editing sites and dsRNAs.","238":"Publishing, particularly journal publishing, offers the chance to stay in contact with science and scientists and so appeals to people considering leaving the laboratory for another career. Professional editors of research journals review and select manuscripts for publication, negotiating as needed with authors and referees. Review journal editors commission articles on suitable topics and work with authors to shape manuscripts appropriately for the readership. Experienced individuals may advance to become a Managing Editor and further to a Publisher\/Publishing Director position within a company or a not-for-profit organization, with responsibility for the business aspects of a publishing program. Would-be editors must be prepared to broaden their scientific knowledge, engage in person with community members, be tactful but firm in decision making, and work happily in the background. Evidence of a genuine interest in the communication of science beyond the usual writing and publishing of papers is necessary to compete successfully for entry positions.","239":"The fact that sugars, amino acids, and the biological polymers they construct exist exclusively in one of two possible mirror-image forms has fascinated scientists and laymen alike for more than a century. Yet, it was only in the late 20th century that experimental studies began to probe how biological homochirality, a signature of life, arose from a prebiotic world that presumably contained equal amounts of both mirror-image forms of these molecules. This review discusses experimental studies aimed at understanding how chemical reactions, physical processes, or a combination of both may provide prebiotically relevant mechanisms for the enrichment of one form of a chiral molecule over the other to allow for the emergence of biological homochirality.","240":"The spliceosome is a highly complex, dynamic ribonucleoprotein molecular machine that undergoes numerous structural and compositional rearrangements that lead to the formation of its active site. Recent advances in cyroelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided a plethora of near-atomic structural information about the inner workings of the spliceosome. Aided by previous biochemical, structural, and functional studies, cryo-EM has confirmed or provided a structural basis for most of the prevailing models of spliceosome function, but at the same time allowed novel insights into splicing catalysis and the intriguing dynamics of the spliceosome. The mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing is highly conserved between humans and yeast, but the compositional dynamics and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) remodeling of the human spliceosome are more complex. Here, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular architecture of the human spliceosome, highlighting differences between the human and yeast splicing machineries.","241":"Noncoding introns are removed from nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in a two-step phosphoryl transfer reaction by the spliceosome, a dynamic multimegadalton enzyme. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome were recently determined in eight key states. Combined with the wealth of available genetic and biochemical data, these structures have revealed new insights into the mechanisms of spliceosome assembly, activation, catalysis, and disassembly. The structures show how a single RNA catalytic center forms during activation and accomplishes both steps of the splicing reaction. The structures reveal how spliceosomal helicases remodel the spliceosome for active site formation, substrate docking, reaction product undocking, and spliceosome disassembly and how they facilitate splice site proofreading. Although human spliceosomes contain additional proteins, their cryo-EM structures suggest that the underlying mechanism is conserved across all eukaryotes. In this review, we summarize the current structural understanding of pre-mRNA splicing.","242":"Aberrant protein aggregation is a defining feature of most neurodegenerative diseases. During pathological aggregation, key proteins transition from their native state to alternative conformations, which are prone to oligomerize into highly ordered fibrillar states. As part of the cellular quality control machinery, molecular chaperones can intervene at many stages of the aggregation process to inhibit or reverse aberrant protein aggregation or counteract the toxicity associated with amyloid species. Although the action of chaperones is considered cytoprotective, essential housekeeping functions can be hijacked for the propagation and spreading of protein aggregates, suggesting the cellular protein quality control system constitutes a double-edged sword in neurodegeneration. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms used by chaperones to influence protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils to understand how the interplay of these activities produces specific cellular outcomes and to define mechanisms that may be targeted by pharmacological agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions.","243":"Hsp104 is a hexameric AAA+ ATPase and protein disaggregase found in yeast, which couples ATP hydrolysis to the dissolution of diverse polypeptides trapped in toxic preamyloid oligomers, phase-transitioned gels, disordered aggregates, amyloids, and prions. Hsp104 shows plasticity in disaggregating diverse substrates, but how its hexameric architecture operates as a molecular machine has remained unclear. Here, we highlight structural advances made via cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) that enhance our mechanistic understanding of Hsp104 and other related AAA+ translocases. Hsp104 hexamers are dynamic and adopt open \"lock-washer\" spiral states and closed ring structures that envelope polypeptide substrate inside the axial channel. ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational changes at the spiral seam ratchet substrate deeper into the channel. Remarkably, this mode of polypeptide translocation is reminiscent of models for how hexameric helicases unwind DNA and RNA duplexes. Thus, Hsp104 likely adapts elements of a deeply rooted, ring-translocase mechanism to the specialized task of protein disaggregation.","244":"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of animal cells, allow Ca2+ to be redistributed from the ER to the cytosol or other organelles, and they initiate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). For all three IP3R subtypes, binding of IP3 primes them to bind Ca2+, which then triggers channel opening. We are now close to understanding the structural basis of IP3R activation. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release regulated by IP3 allows IP3Rs to regeneratively propagate Ca2+ signals. The smallest of these regenerative events is a Ca2+ puff, which arises from the nearly simultaneous opening of a small cluster of IP3Rs. Ca2+ puffs are the basic building blocks for all IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals, but only some IP3 clusters, namely those parked alongside the ER-plasma membrane junctions where SOCE occurs, are licensed to respond. The location of these licensed IP3Rs may allow them to selectively regulate SOCE.","245":"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone involved in the maturation of a plethora of substrates (\"clients\"), including protein kinases, transcription factors, and E3 ubiquitin ligases, positioning Hsp90 as a central regulator of cellular proteostasis. Hsp90 undergoes large conformational changes during its ATPase cycle. The processing of clients by cytosolic Hsp90 is assisted by a cohort of cochaperones that affect client recruitment, Hsp90 ATPase function or conformational rearrangements in Hsp90. Because of the importance of Hsp90 in regulating central cellular pathways, strategies for the pharmacological inhibition of the Hsp90 machinery in diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration are being developed. In this review, we summarize recent structural and mechanistic progress in defining the function of organelle-specific and cytosolic Hsp90, including the impact of individual cochaperones on the maturation of specific clients and complexes with clients as well as ways of exploiting Hsp90 as a drug target.","246":"Maintenance of a healthy and functional proteome in all cellular compartments is critical to cell and organismal homeostasis. Yet, our understanding of the proteostasis process within the nucleus is limited. Here, we discuss the identified roles of the major molecular chaperones Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp60 with client proteins working in diverse DNA-associated pathways. The unique challenges facing proteins in the nucleus are considered as well as the conserved features of the molecular chaperone system in facilitating DNA-linked processes. As nuclear protein inclusions are a common feature of protein-aggregation diseases (e.g., neurodegeneration), a better understanding of nuclear proteostasis is warranted.","247":"Proteins containing tyrosine kinase activity play critical roles in cancer signaling. Intracellular SRC-family kinases relay growth signals from numerous cell surface receptors and can be constitutively activated by oncogenic mutations, as can transmembrane growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) that signal via their tyrosine kinase activity. In this excerpt from his forthcoming book on the history of cancer research, Joe Lipsick looks back at the discovery of tyrosine kinases and the demonstration that the V-SRC protein encoded by Rous sarcoma virus was a tyrosine kinase.","248":"Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of RNA-protein assemblies, generically referred to as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. Such RNP granules include stress granules and P-bodies in the cytosol and the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and paraspeckles in the nucleus. A variety of imaging approaches have been used to reveal different components, structural features, and dynamics of RNP granules. In this review, we discuss imaging approaches that have been used to study stress granules and the insights gained from these experiments. A general theme is that these approaches can be transferred to other RNP granules to examine similar aspects of their composition, ultrastructure, dynamics and control.","249":"Academic administration can be an extension of an academic career at the bench or it can run parallel to a career of discovery. To be an academic administrator at the executive level in a college or university generally requires advancement through the academic ranks to the professorial level. These positions include department chair, dean of a college, head of a center or institute, provost, senior research officer, and university or college president. Positions that can begin immediately after attaining a PhD or after a postdoctoral position include some assistant dean roles and positions in technology transfer, grants management, and laboratory management, among many others. Many of the skills developed during the pursuit of an advanced degree in the life sciences are directly applicable to these jobs. All require problem solving, critical thinking, collaboration, and the ability to communicate clearly.","250":"Recent observations showed that nascent RNA polymerase II transcripts, pre-mRNAs, and noncoding RNAs are highly susceptible to premature 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) from numerous intronic cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs). The importance of this in gene regulation was not previously appreciated as PASs, despite their prevalence, were thought to be active in terminal exons at gene ends. Unexpectedly, antisense oligonucleotide interference with U1 snRNA base-pairing to 5' splice sites, which is necessary for U1 snRNP's (U1) function in splicing, caused widespread PCPA in metazoans. This uncovered U1's PCPA suppression activity, termed telescripting, as crucial for full-length transcription in thousands of vertebrate genes, providing a general role in transcription elongation control. Progressive intron-size expansion in metazoan evolution greatly increased PCPA vulnerability and dependence on U1 telescripting. We describe how these observations unfolded and discuss U1 telescripting's role in shaping the transcriptome.","251":"Misfolded proteins compromise cellular homeostasis. This is especially problematic in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is a high-capacity protein-folding compartment and whose function requires stringent protein quality-control systems. Multiprotein complexes in the ER are able to identify, remove, ubiquitinate, and deliver misfolded proteins to the 26S proteasome for degradation in the cytosol, and these events are collectively termed ER-associated degradation, or ERAD. Several steps in the ERAD pathway are facilitated by molecular chaperone networks, and the importance of ERAD is highlighted by the fact that this pathway is linked to numerous protein conformational diseases. In this review, we discuss the factors that constitute the ERAD machinery and detail how each step in the pathway occurs. We then highlight the underlying pathophysiology of protein conformational diseases associated with ERAD.","252":"Mitochondria are metabolic hubs that use multiple proteases to maintain proteostasis and to preserve their overall quality. A decline of mitochondrial proteolysis promotes cellular stress and may contribute to the aging process. Mitochondrial proteases have also emerged as tightly regulated enzymes required to support the remarkable mitochondrial plasticity necessary for metabolic adaptation in a number of physiological scenarios. Indeed, the mutation and dysfunction of several mitochondrial proteases can cause specific human diseases with severe metabolic phenotypes. Here, we present an overview of the proteolytic regulation of key mitochondrial functions such as respiration, lipid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial dynamics, all of which are required for metabolic control. We also pay attention to how mitochondrial proteases are acutely regulated in response to cellular stressors or changes in growth conditions, a greater understanding of which may one day uncover their therapeutic potential.","253":"Most of the secreted and plasma membrane proteins are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They require engagement of ER-resident chaperones and foldases that assist in their folding and maturation. Since protein homeostasis in the ER is crucial for cellular function, the protein-folding status in the organelle's lumen is continually surveyed by a network of signaling pathways, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein-folding imbalances, or \"ER stress,\" are detected by highly conserved sensors that adjust the ER's protein-folding capacity according to the physiological needs of the cell. We review recent developments in the field that have provided new insights into the ER stress-sensing mechanisms used by UPR sensors and the mechanisms by which they integrate various cellular inputs to adjust the folding capacity of the organelle to accommodate to fluctuations in ER protein-folding demands.","254":null,"255":"The mitochondrial proteome encompasses more than a thousand proteins, which are encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Mitochondrial biogenesis and network health relies on maintenance of protein import pathways and the protein-folding environment. Cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic stressors that challenge mitochondrial proteostasis negatively affect organellar function. During conditions of stress, cells use impaired protein import as a sensor for mitochondrial dysfunction to activate a stress response called the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). UPRmt activation leads to an adaptive transcriptional program that promotes mitochondrial recovery, metabolic adaptations, and innate immunity. In this review, we discuss the regulation of UPRmt activation as well as its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in physiological and pathological scenarios.","256":"Cells under stress must adjust their physiology, metabolism, and architecture to adapt to the new conditions. Most importantly, they must down-regulate general gene expression, but at the same time induce synthesis of stress-protective factors, such as molecular chaperones. Here, we investigate how the process of phase separation is used by cells to ensure adaptation to stress. We summarize recent findings and propose that the solubility of important translation factors is specifically affected by changes in physical-chemical parameters such temperature or pH and modulated by intrinsically disordered prion-like domains. These stress-triggered changes in protein solubility induce phase separation into condensates that regulate the activity of the translation factors and promote cellular fitness. Prion-like domains play important roles in this process as environmentally regulated stress sensors and modifier sequences that determine protein solubility and phase behavior. We propose that protein phase separation is an evolutionary conserved feature of proteins that cells harness to regulate adaptive stress responses and ensure survival in extreme environmental conditions.","257":"The pharmaceutical industry spends billions each year on the clinical development of new medicines. Getting those products to the patients who will benefit from them requires an ability to convey the results of extensive clinical research programs to regulatory authorities, physicians, and payers. Employed by medical communications agencies, contract research organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, medical writers distill and translate complex clinical and scientific data to develop documentation spanning the entire pharmaceutical-product life cycle, from clinical development to registration and marketing. Despite being a relatively new career, the market for medical communications professionals has doubled in recent years and future job prospects look promising.","258":"In addition to coding for protein sequences, RNA molecules encode a diverse set of gene-regulatory elements. RNA switches are one class of gene-regulatory elements that control protein expression in a manner that is dependent on the concentration of specific ligand molecules. These allosteric gene-regulatory elements have been shown as useful tools in engineering diverse cell types to display novel function. In particular, RNA switches have been used as genetically encoded biosensors and conditional controllers to direct cellular decisions based on the system's changing environment. A significant focus in the field has been the generation of novel RNA switches that are tailored for different biological systems. We review approaches that have been used to generate RNA switches, which leverage the unique physical properties of RNA and the myriad ways in which RNA can modulate gene expression.","259":"Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is executed by the spliceosome. In the past 3 years, cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have been elucidated for a majority of the yeast spliceosomal complexes and for a few human spliceosomes. During the splicing reaction, the dynamic spliceosome has an immobile core of about 20 protein and RNA components, which are organized around a conserved splicing active site. The divalent metal ions, coordinated by U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), catalyze the branching reaction and exon ligation. The spliceosome also contains a mobile but compositionally stable group of about 13 proteins and a portion of U2 snRNA, which facilitate substrate delivery into the splicing active site. The spliceosomal transitions are driven by the RNA-dependent ATPase\/helicases, resulting in the recruitment and dissociation of specific splicing factors that enable the reaction. In summary, the spliceosome is a protein-directed metalloribozyme.","260":"","261":"RNA molecules are folded into structures and complexes to perform a wide variety of functions. Determination of RNA structures and their interactions is a fundamental problem in RNA biology. Most RNA molecules in living cells are large and dynamic, posing unique challenges to structure analysis. Here we review progress in RNA structure analysis, focusing on methods that use the \"cross-link, proximally ligate, and sequence\" principle for high-throughput detection of base-pairing interactions in living cells. Beginning with a comparison of commonly used methods in structure determination and a brief historical account of psoralen cross-linking studies, we highlight the important features of cross-linking methods and new biological insights into RNA structures and interactions from recent studies. Further improvement of these cross-linking methods and application to previously intractable problems will shed new light on the mechanisms of the \"modern RNA world.\"","262":"Opportunities for employment of PhD scientists exist within the world of scientific societies. Societies exist to serve the needs of their scientific or engineering constituencies. As membership organizations, they provide their constituents with access to meetings, publications (both books and journals), educational programs, and advocacy assistance. Within many of these societies, leadership positions and associated coordinator\/analyst positions can be filled by someone with a PhD. Examples of positions in societies include science policy\/government relations, education, publications, communications, and executive departments. Interested PhDs should demonstrate their interest by volunteering to participate in society outreach or committee activities. The critical element is to remember that as a PhD you have the critical thinking and problem-solving ability to succeed in whatever career you pursue. The key is to demonstrate that these abilities are applicable to the available positions in the association.","263":"RNA plays a central role in gene expression from its transcription in the nucleus through translation and degradation in the cytoplasm. Technological advances in fluorescent microscopy and labeling methodologies have made it possible to detect single molecules of RNA in both fixed and living cells. Here, we focus on the recent developments in RNA imaging that have allowed quantitatively measuring the lives of individual transcripts from birth to death and all the events in between in single cells and tissues. Direct observation of RNAs within their native cellular environment has revealed a complex layer of spatial and temporal regulation that has profoundly impacted our understanding of RNA biology.","264":"Heat shock factors (HSFs) are the main transcriptional regulators of the heat shock response and indispensable for maintaining cellular proteostasis. HSFs mediate their protective functions through diverse genetic programs, which are composed of genes encoding molecular chaperones and other genes crucial for cell survival. The mechanisms that are used to tailor HSF-driven proteostasis networks are not yet completely understood, but they likely comprise from distinct combinations of both genetic and proteomic determinants. In this review, we highlight the versatile HSF-mediated cellular functions that extend from cellular stress responses to various physiological and pathological processes, and we underline the key advancements that have been achieved in the field of HSF research during the last decade.","265":"The physiological consequences of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are mediated by changes in gene expression. Underlying them are rapid processes involving preexisting components. We review recent insights gained into the regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70 chaperone BiP, whose incorporation into inactive oligomers and reversible AMPylation and de-AMPylation present a first line of response to fluctuating levels of unfolded proteins. BiP activity is tied to the regulation of the UPR transducers by a recently discovered cycle of ER-localized, J protein-mediated formation of a repressive IRE1-BiP complex, whose working we contrast to an alternative model for UPR regulation that relies on direct recognition of unfolded proteins. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that repress messenger RNA (mRNA) translation to limit the flux of newly synthesized proteins into the ER, a rapid adaptation that does not rely on new macromolecule biosynthesis.","266":null,"267":"Although we live in the remnants of an RNA world, the world of drug discovery and chemical probes is firmly protein-centric. Developing highly selective small molecules targeting RNA is often considered to be an insurmountable challenge. Our goal is to demystify the design of such compounds. In this review, we describe various approaches to design small molecules that target RNA from sequence and the application of these compounds in RNA biology, with a focus on inhibition of human RNA-protein complexes. We have developed a library-versus-library screening approach to define selective RNA-small-molecule binding partners and applied them to disease-causing RNAs, in particular noncoding oncogenic RNAs and expanded RNA repeats, to modulate their biology in cells and animals. We also describe the design of new types of small-molecule probes that could broadly decipher the mysteries of RNA in cells.","268":"Compared with life sciences, management consulting is a relatively new field. Nonetheless, leading firms have assumed a central role in the global business economy and command increasing influence as advisors to corporations and organizations in the public and social sectors. Offering robust analysis, independent and expert perspectives, and-in the best cases-valuable creative input, these companies focus on helping clients to improve their performance or more effectively execute their mission.Because the top firms tackle the most complex problems for the most successful organizations in the world, they attract top graduates. But the field is no longer the sole province of those with MBAs. In recent years, the profession has increasingly diversified and now actively recruits candidates with advanced degrees in a range of disciplines-including the life sciences.Those who join the field will find many parallels between the consulting approach and scientific inquiry. As a result, life scientists have many of the intrinsic skills needed to thrive in the industry, which can offer an extraordinary breadth of assignments, global experience, and an accelerated way to learn. At leading firms, the intensive training and development offered can pave the way for partnership, in which consultants counsel senior executives as peers. Many of those who leave become entrepreneurs or join top organizations-sometimes their former clients-at a leadership level.","269":"One of the last hurdles to quantifying the full central dogma of molecular biology in living cells with single-molecule resolution has been the imaging of single messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. Here we describe how recent advances in protein tagging and imaging technologies are being used to precisely visualize and quantify the synthesis of nascent polypeptide chains from single mRNA in living cells. We focus on recent applications of repeat-epitope tags and describe how they enable quantification of single mRNA ribosomal densities, translation initiation and elongation rates, and translation site mobility and higher-order structure. Together with complementary live-cell assays to monitor translation using fast-maturing fluorophores and mRNA-binding protein knockoff, single-molecule studies are beginning to uncover striking and unexpected heterogeneity in gene expression at the level of translation.","270":"High-throughput sequencing methods have revolutionized our ability to catalog the diversity of RNAs and RNA-protein interactions that can exist in our cells. However, the relationship between RNA sequence, structure, and function is enormously complex, demonstrating the need for methods that can provide quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic measurements of macromolecular interaction with RNA, at a scale commensurate with the sequence diversity of RNA. Here, we discuss a class of methods that extend the core functionality of DNA sequencers to enable high-throughput measurements of RNA folding and RNA-protein interactions. Topics discussed include a description of the method and multiple applications to RNA-binding proteins, riboswitch design and engineering, and RNA tertiary structure energetics.","271":"Science policy offers a challenging and rewarding career path for scientists interested in the social, ethical, and legal implications of their field. This topic encompasses a broad spectrum of activities all in support of advancing the scientific enterprise. Science policy spans various sectors, and policy careers are found in many different organizations, including the federal government, scientific societies, and professional organizations. Although their specific duties may vary greatly, science policy professionals generally apply their scientific training to ensure that the scientific enterprise advances in a responsible and ethical manner and to solve challenges with broad scientific and societal implications.","272":"The past decades have witnessed tremendous developments in our understanding of RNA biology. At the core of these advances have been studies aimed at discerning RNA structure and at understanding the forces that influence the RNA folding process. It is easy to take the present state of understanding for granted, but there is much to be learned by considering the path to our current understanding, which has been tortuous, with the birth and death of models, the adaptation of experimental tools originally developed for characterization of protein structure and catalysis, and the development of novel tools for probing RNA. In this review we tour the stages of RNA folding studies, considering them as \"epochs\" that can be generalized across scientific disciplines. These epochs span from the discovery of catalytic RNA, through biophysical insights into the putative primordial RNA World, to characterization of structured RNAs, the building and testing of models, and, finally, to the development of models with the potential to yield generalizable predictive and quantitative models for RNA conformational, thermodynamic, and kinetic behavior. We hope that this accounting will aid others as they navigate the many fascinating questions about RNA and its roles in biology, in the past, present, and future.","273":"How organisms perceive and respond to their surroundings is one of the great questions in biology. It is clear that RNA plays key roles in sensing. Cellular and environmental cues that RNA responds to include temperature, ions, metabolites, and biopolymers. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and in vivo chemical probing have provided unprecedented insights into RNA folding in vivo and genome-wide. Patterns of chemical reactivity have implicated control of gene expression by RNA and aided prediction of RNA structure. Central to these advances has been development of molecular biological and chemical techniques. Key advances are improvements in the quality, cost, and throughput of library preparation; availability of a wider array of chemicals for probing RNA structure in vivo; and robustness and user friendliness of data analysis. Insights from probing transcriptomes and future directions are provided.","274":"3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are best known to regulate mRNA-based processes, such as mRNA localization, mRNA stability, and translation. In addition, 3' UTRs can establish 3' UTR-mediated protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and thus can transmit genetic information encoded in 3' UTRs to proteins. This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3' UTR-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3' UTR functions-the regulation of mRNA and protein-based processes-and highlights how each 3' UTR function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned. This review also discusses novel approaches to study 3' UTR functions in the future by taking advantage of recent advances in technology.","275":"The general notion of an \"RNA world\" is that, in the early development of life on the Earth, genetic continuity was assured by the replication of RNA, and RNA molecules were the chief agents of catalytic function. Assuming that all of the components of RNA were available in some prebiotic locale, these components could have assembled into activated nucleotides that condensed to form RNA polymers, setting the stage for the chemical replication of polynucleotides through RNA-templated RNA polymerization. If a sufficient diversity of RNAs could be copied with reasonable rate and fidelity, then Darwinian evolution would begin with RNAs that facilitated their own reproduction enjoying a selective advantage. The concept of a \"protocell\" refers to a compartment where replication of the primitive genetic material took place and where primitive catalysts gave rise to products that accumulated locally for the benefit of the replicating cellular entity. Replication of both the protocell and its encapsulated genetic material would have enabled natural selection to operate based on the differential fitness of competing cellular entities, ultimately giving rise to modern cellular life.","276":"Scientist administrators at the National Institutes of Health fall into two categories: program officers and scientific review officers. Program officers provide advice to applicants and grantees, make funding recommendations, oversee grantees' research progress, and facilitate research opportunities in emerging areas of science. Scientific review officers oversee all aspects of the initial (peer) review of grant applications.","277":null,"278":"Translation is the fundamental biological process that converts the genetic information in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into functional proteins. Translation regulation allows cells to control when, where, and how many proteins are synthesized. Much of what we know about translation comes from ensemble approaches that measure the average of many cells. The cellular and molecular heterogeneity in the regulation of translation remains largely elusive. Fluorescence microscopy allows interrogation of biological problems with single-molecule, single-cell sensitivity. In recent years, improved design of reagents and microscopy tools has led to improved spatial and temporal resolution of translation imaging. It is now possible to track global translation in specific subcellular compartments and follow the translation dynamics of single transcripts. Highlighted here is the recent progress in translation imaging with emphasis on in vivo translation dynamics. These tools will be invaluable to the study of translation regulation.","279":"The many steps of gene expression, from the transcription of a gene to the production of its protein product, are well understood. Yet, transcriptional regulation has been the focal point for the study of gene expression during development. However, quantitative studies reveal that messenger RNA (mRNA) levels are not necessarily good predictors of the respective proteins' levels in a cell. This discrepancy is, at least in part, the result of developmentally regulated, translational mechanisms that control the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. In this review, we focus on translational regulatory mechanisms mediating global transitions in gene expression: the shift from the maternal to the embryonic developmental program in the early embryo and the switch from the self-renewal of stem cells to differentiation in the adult.","280":"Protein synthesis and its regulation are central to all known forms of life and impinge on biological arenas as varied as agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine. Otherwise known as translation and translational control, these processes have been investigated with increasing intensity since the middle of the 20th century, and in increasing depth with advances in molecular and cell biology. We review the origins of the field, focusing on the underlying concepts and early studies of the cellular machinery and mechanisms involved. We highlight key discoveries and events on a timeline, consider areas where current research has engendered new ideas, and conclude with some speculation on future directions for the field.","281":"Most of the eukaryotic genome is pervasively transcribed, yielding hundreds to thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), some of which are well conserved during evolution. Functions have been described for a few lncRNAs and circRNAs but remain elusive for most. Both classes of RNAs play regulatory roles in translation by interacting with messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), or mRNA-binding proteins (RBPs), thereby modulating translation in trans Moreover, although initially defined as noncoding, a number of lncRNAs and circRNAs have recently been reported to contain functional open reading frames (ORFs). Here, we review current understanding of the roles played by lncRNAs and circRNAs in protein synthesis and discuss challenges and open questions in the field.","282":"Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are non-membrane-enclosed RNA granules that dynamically sequester translationally inactive messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) into compartments that are distinct from the surrounding cytoplasm. mRNP remodeling, silencing, and\/or storage involves the dynamic partitioning of closed-loop polyadenylated mRNPs into SGs, or the sequestration of deadenylated, linear mRNPs into PBs. SGs form when stress-activated pathways stall translation initiation but allow elongation and termination to occur normally, resulting in a sudden excess of mRNPs that are spatially condensed into discrete foci by protein:protein, protein:RNA, and RNA:RNA interactions. In contrast, PBs can exist in the absence of stress, when specific factors promote mRNA deadenylation, condensation, and sequestration from the translational machinery. The formation and dissolution of SGs and PBs reflect changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) metabolism and allow cells to modulate the proteome and\/or mediate life or death decisions during changing environmental conditions.","283":"The need for centralized shared core facilities and highly qualified core facility staff is becoming increasingly important in universities, research institutes, and commercial laboratories. With the continued advancement and sophistication of scientific equipment typically comes a larger price tag than can be handled by individual research laboratories. Moreover, the ever-increasing need for researchers to think and act in cross-disciplinary environments, coupled with the increasing sophistication of both the instrumentation and associated technologies, prevents most researchers from becoming \"experts\" in all areas.At all levels, core facility positions involve a love of technology, working with people, working on many diverse scientific questions, and days full of multitasking. Entry-level positions include basic and advanced technicians that require a BSc or MSc degree and some experience in the field. Midlevel management positions require experience in the field and an MSc or PhD degree. Management experience is a plus but not always required. Scientific directorship positions require a PhD and a keen interest in the technologies that are typically applied in the director's research program. Associate deans of core resources are often former core managers or scientific directors with a vision for the core and who are strong administrators.A career as a core facility staff member can be very rewarding. Successful managers and directors must be able to multitask, reassess priorities, and be adept at using logical reasoning to identify and solve issues as they arise. These positions will continue to be available over the long term with the increasing complexity and continued fast pace of technology development.","284":"To understand the assembly and functional outcomes of protein-RNA regulation, it is crucial to precisely identify the positions of such interactions. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) serves this purpose by exploiting covalent protein-RNA cross-linking and RNA fragmentation, along with a series of stringent purification and quality control steps to prepare complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries for sequencing. Here we describe the core steps of CLIP, its primary variations, and the approaches to data analysis. We present the application of CLIP to studies of specific cell types in genetically engineered mice and discuss the mechanistic and physiologic insights that have already been gained from studies using CLIP. We conclude by discussing the future opportunities for CLIP, including studies of human postmortem tissues from disease patients and controls, RNA epigenetic modifications, and RNA structure. These and other applications of CLIP will continue to unravel fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms while providing important biologic and clinically relevant insights.","285":"The translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein and the folding of the resulting protein into an active form are prerequisites for virtually every cellular process and represent the single largest investment of energy by cells. Ribosome profiling-based approaches have revolutionized our ability to monitor every step of protein synthesis in vivo, allowing one to measure the rate of protein synthesis across the proteome, annotate the protein coding capacity of genomes, monitor localized protein synthesis, and explore cotranslational folding and targeting. The rich and quantitative nature of ribosome profiling data provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore and model complex cellular processes. New analytical techniques and improved experimental protocols will provide a deeper understanding of the factors controlling translation speed and its impact on protein function and cell physiology as well as the role of ribosomal RNA and mRNA modifications in regulating translation.","286":"The cellular proteome reflects the total outcome of many regulatory mechanisms that affect the metabolism of messenger RNA (mRNA) along its pathway from synthesis to degradation. Accumulating evidence in recent years has uncovered the roles of a growing number of mRNA modifications in every step along this pathway, shaping translational output. mRNA modifications affect the translation machinery directly, by influencing translation initiation, elongation and termination, or by altering mRNA levels and subcellular localization. Features of modification-related translational control are described, charting a new and complex layer of translational regulation.","287":"Patent law is an area that many people move into after obtaining a PhD in biomedical science. Close to the cutting edge of research, patent agents draft detailed descriptions of new biotechnology inventions required for patent applications and engage with patent offices during the review process known as patent prosecution. Jobs are also available as patent examiners who examine these patent applications, and it is common for individuals to move between the two jobs. A law firm is generally the best place to train as a patent agent, but biotech companies and tech-transfer offices can provide an alternative route. Although obtaining a law degree is not essential after your PhD, it is recommended, and all patent agents must pass rigorous qualifying exams. Further down the road, training in patent law offers opportunities for in-house work in biotech companies, business development, and mergers and acquisitions.","288":"RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) secondary structures are proposed to play key roles in fundamental biological processes that include the modulation of transcriptional, co-transcriptional, and posttranscriptional events. Recent methodological developments that include predictive algorithms and structure-based sequencing have enabled the detection and mapping of rG4 structures on a transcriptome-wide scale at high sensitivity and resolution. The data generated by these studies provide valuable insights into the potentially diverse roles of rG4s in biology and open up a number of mechanistic hypotheses. Herein we highlight these methodologies and discuss the associated findings in relation to rG4-related biological mechanisms.","289":"Organisms in the three domains of life depend on protein polymers to form a cytoskeleton that helps to establish their shapes, maintain their mechanical integrity, divide, and, in many cases, move. Eukaryotes have the most complex cytoskeletons, comprising three cytoskeletal polymers-actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules-acted on by three families of motor proteins (myosin, kinesin, and dynein). Prokaryotes have polymers of proteins homologous to actin and tubulin but no motors, and a few bacteria have a protein related to intermediate filament proteins.","290":"Protein synthesis involves a complex machinery comprising numerous proteins and RNAs joined by noncovalent interactions. Its function is to link long chains of amino acids into proteins with precise sequences as encoded by the genome. Regulation of protein synthesis, called translational control, occurs both at a global level and at specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs). To understand how translation is regulated, knowledge of the molecular structures and kinetic interactions of its components is needed. This review focuses on the targets of translational control and the mechanisms employed.","291":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression by repressing protein synthesis and exert a broad influence over development, physiology, adaptation, and disease. Over the past two decades, great strides have been made toward elucidating how miRNAs go about shutting down messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and promoting mRNA decay.","292":"The translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins is a key event in the regulation of gene expression. This is especially true in the cancer setting, as many oncogenes and transforming events are regulated at this level. Cancer-promoting factors that are translationally regulated include cyclins, antiapoptotic factors, proangiogenic factors, regulators of cell metabolism, prometastatic factors, immune modulators, and proteins involved in DNA repair. This review discusses the diverse means by which cancer cells deregulate and reprogram translation, and the resulting oncogenic impacts, providing insights into the complexity of translational control in cancer and its targeting for cancer therapy.","293":"The eukaryotic translation pathway has been studied for more than four decades, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate each stage of the pathway are not completely defined. This is in part because we have very little understanding of the kinetic framework for the assembly and disassembly of pathway intermediates. Steps of the pathway are thought to occur in the subsecond to second time frame, but most assays to monitor these events require minutes to hours to complete. Understanding translational control in sufficient detail will therefore require the development of assays that can precisely monitor the kinetics of the translation pathway in real time. Here, we describe the translation pathway from the perspective of its kinetic parameters, discuss advances that are helping us move toward the goal of a rigorous kinetic understanding, and highlight some of the challenges that remain.","294":"Protein synthesis, including the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), is regulated by extracellular stimuli such as hormones and by the levels of certain nutrients within cells. This control involves several well-understood signaling pathways and protein kinases, which regulate the phosphorylation of proteins that control the translational machinery. These pathways include the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), its downstream effectors, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (extracellular ligand-regulated kinase [ERK]) signaling pathway. This review describes the regulatory mechanisms that control translation initiation and elongation factors, in particular the effects of phosphorylation on their interactions or activities. It also discusses current knowledge concerning the impact of these control systems on the translation of specific mRNAs or subsets of mRNAs, both in physiological processes and in diseases such as cancer.","295":"The vast majority of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) initiate translation through a canonical, cap-dependent mechanism requiring a free 5' end and 5' cap and several initiation factors to form a translationally active ribosome. Stresses such as hypoxia, apoptosis, starvation, and viral infection down-regulate cap-dependent translation during which alternative mechanisms of translation initiation prevail to express proteins required to cope with the stress, or to produce viral proteins. The diversity of noncanonical initiation mechanisms encompasses a broad range of strategies and cellular cofactors. Herein, we provide an overview and, whenever possible, a mechanistic understanding of the various noncanonical mechanisms of initiation used by cells and viruses. Despite many unanswered questions, recent advances have propelled our understanding of the scope, diversity, and mechanisms of alternative initiation.","296":"In the past 4 years, because of the advent of new cameras, many ribosome structures have been solved by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) at high, often near-atomic resolution, bringing new mechanistic insights into the processes of translation initiation, peptide elongation, termination, and recycling. Thus, cryo-EM has joined X-ray crystallography as a powerful technique in structural studies of translation. The significance of this new development is that structures of ribosomes in complex with their functional binding partners can now be determined to high resolution in multiple states as they perform their work. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of these new studies and assess the contributions they have made toward an understanding of translation and translational control.","297":"More than 40 different neurological diseases are caused by microsatellite repeat expansions that locate within translated or untranslated gene regions, including 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), introns, and protein-coding regions. Expansion mutations are transcribed bidirectionally and have been shown to give rise to proteins, which are synthesized from three reading frames in the absence of an AUG initiation codon through a novel process called repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. RAN proteins, which were first described in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), have now been reported in a growing list of microsatellite expansion diseases. This article reviews what is currently known about RAN proteins in microsatellite expansion diseases and experiments that provide clues on how RAN translation is regulated.","298":"Single-molecule fluorescence methods have illuminated the dynamics of the translational machinery. Structural and bulk biochemical experiments have provided detailed atomic and global mechanistic views of translation, respectively. Single-molecule studies of translation have bridged these views by temporally connecting the conformational and compositional states defined from structural data within the mechanistic framework of translation produced from biochemical studies. Here, we discuss the context for applying different single-molecule fluorescence experiments, and present recent applications to studying prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation. We underscore the power of observing single translating ribosomes to delineate and sort complex mechanistic pathways during initiation and elongation, and discuss future applications of current and improved technologies.","299":"As obligate intracellular parasites, virus reproduction requires host cell functions. Despite variations in genome size and configuration, nucleic acid composition, and their repertoire of encoded functions, all viruses remain unconditionally dependent on the protein synthesis machinery resident within their cellular hosts to translate viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs). A complex signaling network responsive to physiological stress, including infection, regulates host translation factors and ribosome availability. Furthermore, access to the translation apparatus is patrolled by powerful host immune defenses programmed to restrict viral invaders. Here, we review the tactics and mechanisms used by viruses to appropriate control over host ribosomes, subvert host defenses, and dominate the infected cell translational landscape. These not only define aspects of infection biology paramount for virus reproduction, but continue to drive fundamental discoveries into how cellular protein synthesis is controlled in health and disease.","300":"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is arguably the best-studied eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) surveillance pathway, yet fundamental questions concerning the molecular mechanism of target RNA selection remain unsolved. Besides degrading defective mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (PTCs), NMD also targets many mRNAs encoding functional full-length proteins. Thus, NMD impacts on a cell's transcriptome and is implicated in a range of biological processes that affect a broad spectrum of cellular homeostasis. Here, we focus on the steps involved in the recognition of NMD targets and the activation of NMD. We summarize the accumulating evidence that tightly links NMD to translation termination and we further discuss the recruitment and activation of the mRNA degradation machinery and the regulation of this complex series of events. Finally, we review emerging ideas concerning the mechanistic details of NMD activation and the potential role of NMD as a general surveyor of translation efficacy.","301":"Microtubules act as \"railways\" for motor-driven intracellular transport, interact with accessory proteins to assemble into larger structures such as the mitotic spindle, and provide an organizational framework to the rest of the cell. Key to these functions is the fact that microtubules are \"dynamic.\" As with actin, the polymer dynamics are driven by nucleotide hydrolysis and influenced by a host of specialized regulatory proteins, including microtubule-associated proteins. However, microtubule turnover involves a surprising behavior-termed dynamic instability-in which individual polymers switch stochastically between growth and depolymerization. Dynamic instability allows microtubules to explore intracellular space and remodel in response to intracellular and extracellular cues. Here, we review how such instability is central to the assembly of many microtubule-based structures and to the robust functioning of the microtubule cytoskeleton.","302":"A growing collection of bacterial riboswitch classes is being discovered that sense central metabolites, coenzymes, and signaling molecules. Included among the various mechanisms of gene regulation exploited by these RNA regulatory elements are several that modulate messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. In this review, the mechanisms of riboswitch-mediated translation control are summarized to highlight both their diversity and potential ancient origins. These mechanisms include ligand-gated presentation or occlusion of ribosome-binding sites, control of alternative splicing of mRNAs, and the regulation of mRNA stability. Moreover, speculation on the potential for novel riboswitch discoveries is presented, including a discussion on the potential for the discovery of a greater diversity of mechanisms for translation control.","303":"Termination of mRNA translation occurs when a stop codon enters the A site of the ribosome, and in eukaryotes is mediated by release factors eRF1 and eRF3, which form a ternary eRF1\/eRF3-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) complex. eRF1 recognizes the stop codon, and after hydrolysis of GTP by eRF3, mediates release of the nascent peptide. The post-termination complex is then disassembled, enabling its constituents to participate in further rounds of translation. Ribosome recycling involves splitting of the 80S ribosome by the ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 to release the 60S subunit. Subsequent dissociation of deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) from the 40S subunit may be mediated by initiation factors (priming the 40S subunit for initiation), by ligatin (eIF2D) or by density-regulated protein (DENR) and multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 (MCT1). These events may be subverted by suppression of termination (yielding carboxy-terminally extended read-through polypeptides) or by interruption of recycling, leading to reinitiation of translation near the stop codon.","304":"This review summarizes our current understanding of the major pathway for the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, with a focus on recent advances. We describe the major scanning or messenger RNA (mRNA) m7G cap-dependent mechanism, which is a highly coordinated and stepwise regulated process that requires the combined action of at least 12 distinct translation factors with initiator transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomes, and mRNAs. We limit our review to studies involving either mammalian or budding yeast cells and factors, as these represent the two best-studied experimental systems, and only include a reference to other organisms where particular insight has been gained. We close with a brief description of what we feel are some of the major unknowns in eukaryotic initiation.","305":"Myosin motors power movements on actin filaments, whereas dynein and kinesin motors power movements on microtubules. The mechanisms of these motor proteins differ, but, in all cases, ATP hydrolysis and subsequent release of the hydrolysis products drives a cycle of interactions with the track (either an actin filament or a microtubule), resulting in force generation and directed movement.","306":null,"307":"This review summarizes our current understanding of translation in prokaryotes, focusing on the mechanistic and structural aspects of each phase of translation: initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling. The assembly of the initiation complex provides multiple checkpoints for messenger RNA (mRNA) and start-site selection. Correct codon-anticodon interaction during the decoding phase of elongation results in major conformational changes of the small ribosomal subunit and shapes the reaction pathway of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. The ribosome orchestrates proton transfer during peptide bond formation, but requires the help of elongation factor P (EF-P) when two or more consecutive Pro residues are to be incorporated. Understanding the choreography of transfer RNA (tRNA) and mRNA movements during translocation helps to place the available structures of translocation intermediates onto the time axis of the reaction pathway. The nascent protein begins to fold cotranslationally, in the constrained space of the polypeptide exit tunnel of the ribosome. When a stop codon is reached at the end of the coding sequence, the ribosome, assisted by termination factors, hydrolyzes the ester bond of the peptidyl-tRNA, thereby releasing the nascent protein. Following termination, the ribosome is dissociated into subunits and recycled into another round of initiation. At each step of translation, the ribosome undergoes dynamic fluctuations between different conformation states. The aim of this article is to show the link between ribosome structure, dynamics, and function.","308":"Keratins-types I and II-are the intermediate-filament-forming proteins expressed in epithelial cells. They are encoded by 54 evolutionarily conserved genes (28 type I, 26 type II) and regulated in a pairwise and tissue type-, differentiation-, and context-dependent manner. Here, we review how keratins serve multiple homeostatic and stress-triggered mechanical and nonmechanical functions, including maintenance of cellular integrity, regulation of cell growth and migration, and protection from apoptosis. These functions are tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications and keratin-associated proteins. Genetically determined alterations in keratin-coding sequences underlie highly penetrant and rare disorders whose pathophysiology reflects cell fragility or altered tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, keratin mutation or misregulation represents risk factors or genetic modifiers for several additional acute and chronic diseases.","309":"In this review, we highlight the current understanding of translation elongation and recoding in eukaryotes. In addition to providing an overview of the process, recent advances in our understanding of the role of the factor eIF5A in both translation elongation and termination are discussed. We also highlight mechanisms of translation recoding with a focus on ribosomal frameshifting during elongation. We see that the balance between the basic steps in elongation and the less common recoding events is determined by the kinetics of the different processes as well as by specific sequence determinants.","310":"The delivery of intracellular material within cells is crucial for maintaining normal function. Myosins transport a wide variety of cargo, ranging from vesicles to ribonuclear protein particles (RNPs), in plants, fungi, and metazoa. The properties of a given myosin transporter are adapted to move on different actin filament tracks, either on the disordered actin networks at the cell cortex or along highly organized actin bundles to distribute their cargo in a localized manner or move it across long distances in the cell. Transport is controlled by selective recruitment of the myosin to its cargo that also plays a role in activation of the motor.","311":null,"312":"The ability to block biological processes with selective small molecules provides advantages distinct from most other experimental approaches. These include rapid time to onset, swift reversibility, ability to probe activities in manners that cannot be accessed by genetic means, and the potential to be further developed as therapeutic agents. Small molecule inhibitors can also be used to alter expression and activity without affecting the stoichiometry of interacting partners. These tenets have been especially evident in the field of translation. Small molecule inhibitors were instrumental in enabling investigators to capture short-lived complexes and characterize specific steps of protein synthesis. In addition, several drugs that are the mainstay of modern antimicrobial drug therapy are potent inhibitors of prokaryotic translation. Currently, there is much interest in targeting eukaryotic translation as decades of research have revealed that deregulated protein synthesis in cancer cells represents a targetable vulnerability. In addition to being potential therapeutics, small molecules that manipulate translation have also been shown to influence cognitive processes such as memory. In this review, we focus on small molecule modulators that target the eukaryotic translation initiation apparatus and provide an update on their potential application to the treatment of disease.","313":"Muscle cells are designed to generate force and movement. There are three types of mammalian muscles-skeletal, cardiac, and smooth. Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and move them relative to each other. Cardiac muscle comprises the heart, which pumps blood through the vasculature. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are known as striated muscles, because the filaments of actin and myosin that power their contraction are organized into repeating arrays, called sarcomeres, that have a striated microscopic appearance. Smooth muscle does not contain sarcomeres but uses the contraction of filaments of actin and myosin to constrict blood vessels and move the contents of hollow organs in the body. Here, we review the principal molecular organization of the three types of muscle and their contractile regulation through signaling mechanisms and discuss their major structural and functional similarities that hint at the possible evolutionary relationships between the cell types.","314":"RNA decay plays a major role in regulating gene expression and is tightly networked with other aspects of gene expression to effectively coordinate post-transcriptional regulation. The goal of this work is to provide an overview of the major factors and pathways of general messenger RNA (mRNA) decay in eukaryotic cells, and then discuss the effective interplay of this cytoplasmic process with the protein synthesis machinery. Given the transcript-specific and fluid nature of mRNA stability in response to changing cellular conditions, understanding the fundamental networking between RNA decay and translation will provide a foundation for a complete mechanistic understanding of this important aspect of cell biology.","315":"The actin cytoskeleton-a collection of actin filaments with their accessory and regulatory proteins-is the primary force-generating machinery in the cell. It can produce pushing (protrusive) forces through coordinated polymerization of multiple actin filaments or pulling (contractile) forces through sliding actin filaments along bipolar filaments of myosin II. Both force types are particularly important for whole-cell migration, but they also define and change the cell shape and mechanical properties of the cell surface, drive the intracellular motility and morphogenesis of membrane organelles, and allow cells to form adhesions with each other and with the extracellular matrix.","316":"Although induction of CD8+ responses is widely accepted as critical in clearing viral infections and necessary for effective vaccines against viruses, much less is known regarding the role of these cells in bacterial and other infections, particularly those that enter the host via the gastrointestinal tract. In this commentary, I discuss the likelihood that CD8+ responses are also important in protection from intestinal Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the many factors that should be taken into consideration during the development of vaccines, based on eliciting long-term protection predominantly mediated by CD8+ responses against these organisms.","317":"Although CD8 T-cell vaccines do not have the record of success of humoral-mediated vaccines, they do not receive the same degree of effort. Many diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have not yielded to vaccines, and intrinsic barriers may impede approaches limited solely to generating antibodies. Moreover, population growth and modernization are driving an increased pace of new emerging global health threats (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] is a recent example), which will create unpredictable challenges for vaccinologists. Vaccine-elicited CD8 T cells may contribute to protective modalities, although their development will require a more thorough understanding of CD8 T-cell biology, practices for manufacturing and delivering CD8 T-cell-eliciting vectors that have acceptable safety profiles, and, ultimately, the political will and faith of those that make vaccine research funding decisions.","318":"Recent work by several groups has undoubtedly shown that we can produce cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens. However, each vaccine is essentially a single-use, patient-specific product, making this approach resource-intensive. For this reason, it is important to ask whether this approach will be any more successful than what has been attempted during the last 30 years using vaccines targeting self-epitopes. Here, we discuss what might be expected from neoantigen vaccines based on our experience in chronic viral infections, and how this new approach may be applied to cancer immunotherapy.","319":"The term \"neoantigen,\" as applied to molecules newly expressed on tumor cells, has a long history. The groundbreaking discovery of a cancer causing virus in chickens by Rous over 100 years ago, followed by discoveries of other tumor-causing viruses in animals, suggested a viral etiology of human cancers. The search for other oncogenic viruses in the 1960s and 1970s resulted in the discoveries of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human papilloma virus (HPV), and continues until the present time. Contemporaneously, the budding field of immunology was posing the question can the immune system of animals or humans recognize a tumor that develops from one's own tissues and what types of antigens would distinguish the tumor from normal cells. Molecules encoded by oncogenic viruses provided the most logical candidates and evidence was quickly gathered for both humoral and cellular recognition of viral antigens, referred to as neoantigens. Often, however, serologic responses to virus-bearing tumors revealed neoantigens unrelated to viral proteins and expressed on multiple tumor types, foreshadowing later findings of multiple changes in other genes in tumor cells creating nonviral neoantigens.","320":"Immunological memory is an evolutionary adaptation of the vertebrate immune system that protects the host from repeated pathogen infection. T and B cells possess the specificity and longevity required to generate immune memory, whereas natural killer (NK) cells make up a component of the immune system that was not thought to possess these features. However, much evidence from the last decade has challenged this dogma. The investigators were asked to address the following questions: Is there NK cell memory? And can NK cell memory be harnessed for vaccination? Thus, this article explores the recent literature showing immune memory in NK cells. Along with highlighting these studies, we speculate how NK cell memory can be harnessed in immunization strategies against infectious diseases and cancer.","321":"Natural killer (NK) cells have historically been considered to be a part of the innate immune system, exerting a rapid response against pathogens and tumors in an antigen (Ag)-independent manner. However, over the past decade, evidence has accumulated suggesting that at least some NK cells display certain characteristics of adaptive immune cells. Indeed, NK cells can learn and remember encounters with a variety of Ags, including chemical haptens and viruses. Upon rechallenge, memory NK cells mount potent recall responses selectively to those Ags. This phenomenon, traditionally termed \"immunological memory,\" has been reported in mice, nonhuman primates, and even humans and appears to be concentrated in discrete NK cell subsets. Because immunological memory protects against recurrent infections and is the central goal of active vaccination, it is crucial to define the mechanisms and consequences of NK cell memory. Here, we summarize the different kinds of memory responses that have been attributed to specific NK cell subsets and discuss the possibility to harness NK cell memory for vaccination purposes.","322":"Vaccines that stimulate CD8+ T cells could clear early virus infection or control ongoing infection and prevent disease. This could be valuable to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) where it has not yet been possible to generate broadly reacting neutralizing antibodies with a vaccine. However, HIV-1 vaccines aimed at stimulating CD8+ T cells have had no success. In contrast, a cytomegalovirus vectored simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine enabled clearance of early SIV infection. This may open the door to the design of an effective HIV vaccine.","323":"Studies over the last decade have decisively shown that innate immune natural killer (NK) cells exhibit enhanced long-lasting functional responses following a single activation event. With the increased recognition of memory and memory-like properties of NK cells, questions have arisen with regard to their ability to effectively mediate vaccination responses in humans. Moreover, recently discovered innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) could also potentially exhibit memory-like functions. Here, we review different forms of NK cell memory, and speculate about the ability of these cells and ILCs to meaningfully contribute to vaccination responses.","324":"Natural killer (NK) cells are components of innate immunity mediating defense at early times after viral infections. Their cytokine production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity functions overlap those of CD8 T cells elicited later during primary adaptive immune responses, but the populations are distinguished by their basal states and activating receptors as well as the kinetics of their responses. Demonstration of long-lived NK cells has led to speculation on the potential for inducing these to contribute to immunological memory. Conversely, activated CD8 T cells can acquire responses to innate cytokines and, as a result, have the potential to contribute to innate immunity. These observations beg the question: what is required to be a player in innate and adaptive immunity?","325":"Recent advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics have empowered a revolution in immuno-oncology that has led to numerous unambiguous demonstrations of spontaneous and therapy-induced T-cell responses in patients against a subset of immunogenic tumor-specific somatic mutations known as neoantigens. These findings raise the exciting possibility that patients could be therapeutically treated with personalized vaccines against the mutations expressed by their own tumor. A central challenge for the broader clinical application of this approach will be to define the best antigens to target, to determine the subset of patients most likely to derive significant clinical benefit, and, finally, to discover both the best method of vaccine delivery and the optimal time in the disease course to do so. A growing number of translational immunologists believe that these challenges can be overcome and this perspective will discuss strategies to achieve this.","326":"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as an expanding family of effector cells particularly enriched in the mucosal barriers. ILCs are promptly activated by stress signals and multiple epithelial- and myeloid-cell-derived cytokines. In response, ILCs rapidly secrete effector cytokines, which allow them to survey and maintain the mucosal integrity. Uncontrolled action of ILCs might contribute to tissue damage, chronic inflammation, metabolic diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the cytokine network that modulate ILC immune responses: stimulating cytokines, signature cytokines secreted by ILC subsets, autocrine cytokines, and cytokines that induce cell plasticity.","327":"Scientists who leave the laboratory bench to work for biomedical foundations mobilize and focus resources on the most promising research behind a foundation's mission. They acquire a broad view of a field, interact closely with research scientists at meetings and laboratory visits, and often manage proposal review boards and monitor grant progress. Increasingly, scientists at foundations also have a more active role in catalyzing research: They are involved in organizing targeted workshops, setting research priorities, and directly creating and managing resources for a scientific community. They often work closely with patient advocacy groups, contract research organizations, government funders and regulators, and biotech and pharmaceutical companies.Job opportunities in foundations are highly varied, reflecting the diversity of foundations and missions. For example, some foundations have general missions to support broad basic scientific research, whereas others focus specifically on a particular disease and may require different skills. Most scientific positions at foundations require a PhD or MD and often some postdoctoral or other experience, although not all do. Foundations often lack the clear career path that an academic position offers (various levels of professorship, tenure, etc.), although there is often significant potential for growth in responsibilities in terms of managing science, people, and budgets. Jobs in foundations can be challenging yet extremely rewarding, especially for those with broad interests and goal-oriented personalities. Many at foundations feel that they have the potential to have an even greater impact than if they had stayed at the bench.","328":"SummaryType III intermediate filament (IF) proteins assemble into cytoplasmic homopolymeric and heteropolymeric filaments with other type III and some type IV IFs. These highly dynamic structures form an integral component of the cytoskeleton of muscle, brain, and mesenchymal cells. Here, we review the current ideas on the role of type III IFs in health and disease. It turns out that they not only offer resilience to mechanical strains, but, most importantly, they facilitate very efficiently the integration of cell structure and function, thus providing the necessary scaffolds for optimal cellular responses upon biochemical stresses and protecting against cell death, disease, and aging.","329":null,"330":null,"331":null,"332":"The world of biotechnology \"start-ups\" and entrepreneurship offers exciting new avenues for driving state-of-the-art research using an arsenal of multidisciplinary skills, whether your role is as part of a team or as a leader. Although traditionally these positions may not be as secure as those offered by some of the larger companies, the small start-up culture provides opportunities for contributing at many levels to a wide range of responsibilities: from scientific discovery to delivery of proof of concept and intellectual property; from analysis of market opportunities and competitive intelligence to creation of time lines and business plans for a first product. Often, if you get in on the ground level, you get to validate your own concept, pitch to potential investors, argue value, build a team, engage advisors, and then, with funding in hand, launch an entirely new research and development (R&amp;D) enterprise. Many of the skills and much of the experience gained while pursuing a graduate degree can be put to good use in these arenas as well. This path, however, is not for the faint of heart; it requires not only a strong scientific background and organizational skills, but also the ability to work well on a team, excellent communication skills, and persistence when faced with delays or disappointment. With increasing responsibilities in the small company come the requirements for aptitudes for leadership, strategic and financial planning, networking, negotiating, and managing both projects and personnel.","333":"SUMMARYThe cytoskeleton is the major mechanical structure of the cell; it is a complex, dynamic biopolymer network comprising microtubules, actin, and intermediate filaments. Both the individual filaments and the entire network are not simple elastic solids but are instead highly nonlinear structures. Appreciating the mechanics of biopolymer networks is key to understanding the mechanics of cells. Here, we review the mechanical properties of cytoskeletal polymers and discuss the implications for the behavior of cells.","334":"Members of the interleukin (IL)-10 family of cytokines play important roles in regulating immune responses during host defense but also in autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. Although IL-10 itself primarily acts on leukocytes and has potent immunosuppressive functions, other family members preferentially target nonimmune compartments, such as tissue epithelial cells, where they elicit innate defense mechanisms to control viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, protect tissue integrity, and promote tissue repair and regeneration. As cytokines are prime drug targets, IL-10 family cytokines provide great opportunities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, tissue damage, and cancer. Yet no therapy in this space has been approved to date. Here, we summarize the diverse biology of the IL-10 family as it relates to human disease and review past and current strategies and challenges to target IL-10 family cytokines for clinical use.","335":"A dichotomy exists in the field of vaccinology about the promise versus the hype associated with application of \"systems biology\" approaches to rational vaccine design. Some feel it is the only way to efficiently uncover currently unknown parameters controlling desired immune responses or discover what elements actually mediate these responses. Others feel that traditional experimental, often reductionist, methods for incrementally unraveling complex biology provide a more solid way forward, and that \"systems\" approaches are costly ways to collect data without gaining true insight. Here I argue that both views are inaccurate. This is largely because of confusion about what can be gained from classical experimentation versus statistical analysis of large data sets (bioinformatics) versus methods that quantitatively explain emergent properties of complex assemblies of biological components, with the latter reflecting what was previously called \"physiology.\" Reductionist studies will remain essential for generating detailed insight into the functional attributes of specific elements of biological systems, but such analyses lack the power to provide a quantitative and predictive understanding of global system behavior. But by employing (1) large-scale screening methods for discovery of unknown components and connections in the immune system (omics), (2) statistical analysis of large data sets (bioinformatics), and (3) the capacity of quantitative computational methods to translate these individual components and connections into models of emergent behavior (systems biology), we will be able to better understand how the overall immune system functions and to determine with greater precision how to manipulate it to produce desired protective responses.","336":"Preventing morbidity and mortality from infectious disease through the development and use of effective vaccines is one of medicine's greatest achievements and greatest frustrations. We are struggling with improving vaccine efficacy for some of the most globally widespread diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis. In an effort to gain an edge, systems biology approaches have begun to be employed to more broadly investigate the pathways leading to protective vaccine responses. As such, we are now at a critical juncture, needing to evaluate how fruitful these approaches have been. Herein we discuss the level of success achieved as compared to the original promise of systems methodologies, and conclude that while we have indeed begun to make clear inroads into understanding the immune response to vaccines, we still have much to learn and gain from the more comprehensive approach of systems-level analysis.","337":"A diverse range of species, from cyanobacteria to humans, evolved endogenous biological clocks that allow for the anticipation of daily variations in light and temperature. The ability to anticipate regular environmental rhythms promotes optimal performance and survival. Herein we present a brief historical timeline of how circadian concepts and terminology have emerged since the early observation of daily leaf movement in plants made by an astronomer in the 1700s.","338":"During the last decade, several high-throughput technologies have been applied to gather deeper understanding on the biological events elicited by vaccination. The main goal of systems biology is to integrate different sources of data and extract biologically meaningful information. This holistic approach has provided new insights on the impact that the innate immune status has on vaccine responsiveness. Other factors like chronic infections, age, microbiome, and metabolism can influence the outcome of vaccination, and systems biology offers unique opportunities to expand our understanding of their role on the immune response. However, a few challenges that still need to be overcome will be discussed.","339":"The circadian clock in cyanobacteria employs a posttranslational oscillator composed of a sequential phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of KaiC protein, in which the dynamics of protein structural changes driven by temperature-compensated KaiC's ATPase activity are critical for determining the period. On the other hand, circadian clocks in eukaryotes employ transcriptional feedback loops as a core mechanism. In this system, the dynamics of protein accumulation and degradation affect the circadian period. However, recent studies of eukaryotic circadian clocks reveal that the mechanism controlling the circadian period can be independent of the regulation of protein abundance. Instead, the circadian substrate is often phosphorylated at multiple sites at flexible protein regions to induce structural changes. The phosphorylation is catalyzed by kinases that induce sequential multisite phosphorylation such as casein kinase 1 (CK1) with temperature-compensated activity. We propose that the design principles of phosphorylation-dependent circadian-period determination in eukaryotes may share characteristics with the posttranslational oscillator in cyanobacteria.","340":null,"341":null,"342":"The advent of high-throughput \"omics\" technologies, combined with the computational and statistical methods necessary to analyze such data, have revolutionized biology, enabling a global view of the complex molecular processes and interactions that occur within a biological system. Such systems-based approaches have begun to be used in the evaluation of immune responses to vaccination, with the promise of identifying predictive biomarkers capable of rapidly evaluating vaccine efficacy, transforming our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for protective responses to vaccination and contributing to a new generation of rationally designed vaccines. Here we present our opinion that systems biology does indeed have a critical role in the future of vaccinology. Such approaches have shown potential in identifying transcriptional and cellular signatures of responsiveness to vaccination using diverse vaccines, adjuvants, and human populations. These findings, coupled with further mechanistic evaluation in animal models, will guide development of targeted vaccine and adjuvant formulations designed to optimally induce protective responses in populations of differing immune status.","343":"Circadian rhythms influence virtually all life forms on our planet, a notion that opens the question on how the circadian cycles of individual organisms may interplay with each other. In mammals, a potentially dangerous environmental stress is represented by encounters with infectious agents. Microbial attack is a major risk for organismal homeostasis and therefore needs to be efficiently counteracted by mechanisms implemented by the host immune system. Accumulating evidence shows that the immune system may anticipate an emerging pathogenic exposure through an enhanced inflammatory state. Notably, the circadian clock orchestrates these anticipatory responses to fluctuating conditions in the external world. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the relationship between the circadian clock and pathogenic infections. We discuss the role of the circadian clock against infection and specific pathogens, the core clock proteins involved in the defense mechanisms, and the specific tissue or cell type in which they function to counteract the infection. Finally, circadian oscillations in the gut microbiome composition and its possible role in protecting against foodborne pathogen colonization are presented.","344":"","345":"A career as a tenure-track professor at a liberal arts college provides the opportunity to combine serious interests in teaching with research. The basic goals of the liberal arts institution are to educate the student broadly while encouraging mastery of a particular area of interest. Preparing for such a career requires not only a commitment to teaching but also a productive PhD and postdoctoral experience, regardless of the expectations for active research within the job. The application and interview processes require one to be informed, flexible, energetic, and clear-in writing and in speaking. Establishing an invigorating teaching and research program will allow you to balance realism and ambition as you find a way to bring the best science to the undergraduate setting. The exposure to students whose thinking is often more unfettered and creative, and to colleagues whose scholarships span many disciplines, makes a position at a liberal arts college one of the most intellectually stimulating careers available to a scientist.","346":"The study of murine dendritic cell (DC) development has been integral to the identification of specialized DC subsets that have unique requirements for their form and function. Advances in the field have also provided a framework for the identification of human DC counterparts, which appear to have conserved mechanisms of development and function. Multiple transcription factors are expressed in unique combinations that direct the development of classical DCs (cDCs), which include two major subsets known as cDC1s and cDC2s, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). pDCs are potent producers of type I interferons and thus these cells are implicated in immune responses that depend on this cytokine. Mouse models deficient in the cDC1 lineage have revealed their importance in directing immune responses to intracellular bacteria, viruses, and cancer through the cross-presentation of cell-associated antigen. Models of transcription factor deficiency have been used to identify subsets of cDC2 that are required for T helper (Th)2 and Th17 responses to certain pathogens; however, no single factor is known to be absolutely required for the development of the complete cDC2 lineage. In this review, we will discuss the current state of knowledge of mouse and human DC development and function and highlight areas in the field that remain unresolved.","347":"Interferons (IFNs) are a broad class of cytokines elicited on challenge to the host defense and are essential for mobilizing immune responses to pathogens. Divided into three classes, type I, type II, and type III, all IFNs share in common the ability to evoke antiviral activities initiated by the interaction with their cognate receptors. The nine-member IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family, first discovered in the context of transcriptional regulation of type I IFN genes following viral infection, are pivotal for the regulation of the IFN responses. In this review, we briefly describe cardinal features of the three types of IFNs and then focus on the role of the IRF family members in the regulation of each IFN system.","348":"Specialized groups of neurons in the brain are key mediators of circadian rhythms, receiving daily environmental cues and communicating those signals to other tissues in the organism for entrainment and to organize circadian physiology. In Drosophila, the \"circadian clock\" is housed in seven neuronal clusters, which are defined by their expression of the main circadian proteins, Period, Timeless, Clock, and Cycle. These clusters are distributed across the fly brain and are thereby subject to the respective environments associated with their anatomical locations. While these core components are universally expressed in all neurons of the circadian network, additional regulatory proteins that act on these components are differentially expressed, giving rise to \"local clocks\" within the network that nonetheless converge to regulate coherent behavioral rhythms. In this review, we describe the communication between the neurons of the circadian network and the molecular differences within neurons of this network. We focus on differences in protein-expression patterns and discuss how such variation can impart functional differences in each local clock. Finally, we summarize our current understanding of how communication within the circadian network intersects with intracellular biochemical mechanisms to ultimately specify behavioral rhythms. We propose that additional efforts are required to identify regulatory mechanisms within each neuronal cluster to understand the molecular basis of circadian behavior.","349":"Cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes are crucial to couple intercellular adhesion to the actin or intermediate filament cytoskeletons, respectively. As such, these intercellular junctions are essential to provide not only integrity to epithelia and other tissues but also the mechanical machinery necessary to execute complex morphogenetic and homeostatic intercellular rearrangements. Moreover, these spatially defined junctions serve as signaling hubs that integrate mechanical and chemical pathways to coordinate tissue architecture with behavior. This review takes an evolutionary perspective on how the emergence of these two essential intercellular junctions at key points during the evolution of multicellular animals afforded metazoans with new opportunities to integrate adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling. We discuss known literature on cross-talk between the two junctions and, using the skin epidermis as an example, provide a model for how these two junctions function in concert to orchestrate tissue organization and function.","350":"A number of interesting reports highlight the intricate network of signaling proteins that coordinate formation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts. We have much yet to learn about how the in vitro binding data is translated into protein association inside the cells and whether such interaction modulates the signaling properties of the protein. What emerges from recent studies is the importance to carefully consider small GTPase activation in the context of where its activation occurs, which upstream regulators are involved in the activation\/inactivation cycle and the GTPase interacting partners that determine the intracellular niche and extent of signaling. Data discussed here unravel unparalleled cooperation and coordination of functions among GTPases and their regulators in supporting strong adhesion between cells.","351":"Science journalists cover some of the most complex, exciting, and important issues of our day, ranging from the impacts of climate change to emerging infectious diseases. They use words, sounds, images, and graphics to create compelling stories about science that appear in newspapers and magazines, in print and online, on the radio and TV, and in podcasts and videos. The field is undergoing rapid change, which presents both challenges and opportunities. The migration of readers and advertising to the internet and digital platforms has led to declining sales of print publications. This means that jobs are now scarce in traditional print media, but that there are growing opportunities to produce digital content.","352":"Most PhD students in the biological sciences will not go on to become academics. For these individuals, choosing the best career path can be difficult. Fortunately, there are many options that allow them to take advantage of skills they hone during graduate and postdoctoral work.","353":"SUMMARYIntermediate filaments (IFs) comprise a diverse group of flexible cytoskeletal structures, the assembly, dynamics, and functions of which are regulated by posttranslational modifications. Characteristically, the expression of IF proteins is specific for tissues, differentiation stages, cell types, and functional contexts. Recent research has rapidly expanded the knowledge of IF protein functions. From being regarded as primarily structural proteins, it is now well established that IFs act as powerful modulators of cell motility and migration, playing crucial roles in wound healing and tissue regeneration, as well as inflammatory and immune responses. Although many of these IF-associated functions are essential for tissue repair, the involvement of IF proteins has been established in many additional facets of tissue healing and regeneration. Here, we review the recent progress in understanding the multiple functions of cytoplasmic IFs that relate to cell motility in the context of wound healing, taking examples from studies on keratin, vimentin, and nestin. Wound healing and regeneration include orchestration of a broad range of cellular processes, including regulation of cell attachment and migration, proliferation, differentiation, immune responses, angiogenesis, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. In this respect, IF proteins now emerge as multifactorial and tissue-specific integrators of tissue regeneration, thereby acting as essential guardian biopolymers at the interface between health and disease, the failing of which contributes to a diverse range of pathologies.","354":"Endothelial cell-cell junctions must perform seemingly incompatible tasks during vascular development-providing stable connections that prevent leakage, while allowing dynamic cellular rearrangements during sprouting, anastomosis, lumen formation, and functional remodeling of the vascular network. This review aims to highlight recent insights into the molecular mechanisms governing endothelial cell-cell adhesion in the context of vascular development.","355":"Endothelial cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) supervise fundamental vascular functions, such as the control of permeability and transmigration of circulating leukocytes, and the maintenance of existing vessels and formation of new ones. These processes are often dysregulated in pathologies. However, the evidence that links dysfunction of endothelial AJs to human pathologies is mostly correlative. In this review, we present an update of the molecular organization of AJ complexes in endothelial cells (ECs) that is mainly based on observations from experimental models. Furthermore, we report in detail on a human pathology, cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), which is initiated by loss-of-function mutations in the genes that encode the three cytoplasmic components of AJs (CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3). At present, these represent a unique example of mutations in components of endothelial AJs that cause human disease. We describe also how studies into the defects of AJs in CCM are shedding light on the crucial regulatory mechanisms and signaling activities of these endothelial structures. Although these observations are specific for CCM, they support the concept that dysfunction of endothelial AJs can directly contribute to human pathologies.","356":null,"357":"Cadherins form a large family of proteins often involved in calcium-dependent cellular adhesion. Although classical members of the family can provide a physical bond between cells, a subset of special cadherins use their extracellular domains to interlink apical specializations of single epithelial sensory cells. Two of these cadherins, cadherin-23 (CDH23) and protocadherin-15 (PCDH15), form extracellular \"tip link\" filaments that connect apical bundles of stereocilia on hair cells essential for inner-ear mechanotransduction. As these bundles deflect in response to mechanical stimuli from sound or head movements, tip links gate hair-cell mechanosensitive channels to initiate sensory perception. Here, we review the unusual and diverse structural properties of these tip-link cadherins and the functional significance of their deafness-related missense mutations. Based on the structural features of CDH23 and PCDH15, we discuss the elasticity of tip links and models that bridge the gap between the nanomechanics of cadherins and the micromechanics of hair-cell bundles during inner-ear mechanotransduction.","358":"The study of cytokines has evolved from the detection of functional activities present in tissue culture supernatants to the characterization of the three-dimensional molecular structures of the cytokines and their receptors. Investigators studying cytokines need to have specialized expertise in using cytokine assays, assessing their receptor interactions, signal transduction, gene activation, and biological effects, and in the therapeutic utilization of agonists and antagonists. Cytokinology can therefore be considered a discipline. In this article, I have considered studies leading to the identification of novel cytokines, potential producers of cytokine mimics such as viruses and the microbiome, and the complex interactions of the cytokine network with our vital functions. Our ever-increasing success in using cytokines and, in particular, cytokine inhibitors therapeutically suggest that cytokinology will eventually become an independent discipline.","359":"The field of axon guidance was revolutionized over the past three decades by the identification of highly conserved families of guidance cues and receptors. These proteins are essential for normal neural development and function, directing cell and axon migration, neuron-glial interactions, and synapse formation and plasticity. Many of these genes are also expressed outside the nervous system in which they influence cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. Because the nervous system develops from neural epithelium, it is perhaps not surprising that these guidance cues have significant nonneural roles in governing the specialized junctional connections between cells in polarized epithelia. The following review addresses roles for ephrins, semaphorins, netrins, slits and their receptors in regulating adherens, tight, and gap junctions in nonneural epithelia and endothelia.","360":"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family and the TNF\/nerve growth factor (NGF) family of their cognate receptors together control numerous immune functions, as well as tissue-homeostatic and embryonic-development processes. These diverse functions are dictated by both shared and distinct features of family members, and by interactions of some members with nonfamily ligands and coreceptors. The spectra of their activities are further expanded by the occurrence of the ligands and receptors in both membrane-anchored and soluble forms, by \"re-anchoring\" of soluble forms to extracellular matrix components, and by signaling initiation via intracellular domains (IDs) of both receptors and ligands. Much has been learned about shared features of the receptors as well as of the ligands; however, we still have only limited knowledge of the mechanistic basis for their functional heterogeneity and for the differences between their functions and those of similarly acting cytokines of other families.","361":"Cell adhesion systems are defined by their ability to resist detachment force. Our understanding of the biology of cell-cell adhesions has recently been transformed by the realization that many of the forces that act on those adhesions are generated by the cells that they couple together; and that force at adhesive junctions can be sensed to regulate cell behavior. Here, we consider the mechanisms responsible for applying force to cell-cell junctions and the mechanosensory pathways that detect those forces. We focus on cadherins, as these are the best-studied examples to date, but it is likely that similar principles will apply to other molecular systems that can engage with force-generators within cells and physically couple those cells together.","362":null,"363":"Inherited or acquired alterations in the structure and function of connexin proteins have long been associated with disease. In the present work, we review current knowledge on the role of connexins in diseases associated with the heart, nervous system, cochlea, and skin, as well as cancer and pleiotropic syndromes such as oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD). Although incomplete by virtue of space and the extent of the topic, this review emphasizes the fact that connexin function is not only associated with gap junction channel formation. As such, both canonical and noncanonical functions of connexins are fundamental components in the pathophysiology of multiple connexin related disorders, many of them highly debilitating and life threatening. Improved understanding of connexin biology has the potential to advance our understanding of mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.","364":"Chronic inflammation is a well-recognized tumor-enabling capability, which allows nascent tumors to escape immunosurveillance. A number of soluble and cellular inflammatory mediators take part in the various phases of cancer initiation and progression, giving rise to a fatal conspiracy, which is difficult to efficiently overcome. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are pivotal players of the tumor microenvironment and, because of their characteristic plasticity, can acquire a number of distinct phenotypes and contribute in different ways to the various phases of cancerogenesis. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are also emerging as important components of the tumor microenvironment, given their unexpected heterogeneity and plasticity. TAMs and TANs are both integrated in cancer-related inflammation and an ever better understanding of their functions can be useful to tailor the use of anticancer therapeutic approaches and patient follow-up.","365":"Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a prototypical cytokine for maintaining homeostasis. When homeostasis is disrupted by infections or tissue injuries, IL-6 is produced immediately and contributes to host defense against such emergent stress through activation of acute-phase and immune responses. However, dysregulated excessive and persistent synthesis of IL-6 has a pathological effect on, respectively, acute systemic inflammatory response syndrome and chronic immune-mediated diseases. The IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, is currently being used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Castleman disease. Lines of recent evidence strongly suggest IL-6 blockade can provide broader therapeutic strategy for various diseases included in acute systemic and chronic inflammatory diseases.","366":"The circadian clock drives rhythms in the levels of thousands of proteins in the mammalian cell, arising in part from rhythmic transcriptional regulation of the genes that encode them. However, recent evidence has shown that posttranscriptional processes also play a major role in generating the rhythmic protein makeup and ultimately the rhythmic physiology of the cell. Regulation of steps throughout the life of the messenger RNA (mRNA), ranging from initial mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to extensive control of translation and degradation in the cytosol have been shown to be important for producing the final rhythms in protein levels critical for proper circadian rhythmicity. These findings will be reviewed here.","367":"The cadherin superfamily comprises a large, diverse collection of cell surface receptors that are expressed in the nervous system throughout development and have been shown to be essential for the proper assembly of the vertebrate nervous system. As our knowledge of each family member has grown, it has become increasingly clear that the functions of various cadherin subfamilies are intertwined: they can be present in the same protein complexes, impinge on the same developmental processes, and influence the same signaling pathways. This interconnectedness may illustrate a central way in which core developmental events are controlled to bring about the robust and precise assembly of neural circuitry.","368":"Mounting evidence in recent years supports the extensive interaction between the circadian and redox systems. The existence of such a relationship is not surprising because most organisms, be they diurnal or nocturnal, display daily oscillations in energy intake, locomotor activity, and exposure to exogenous and internally generated oxidants. The transcriptional clock controls the levels of many antioxidant proteins and redox-active cofactors, and, conversely, the cellular redox poise has been shown to feed back to the transcriptional oscillator via redox-sensitive transcription factors and enzymes. However, the circadian cycles in the S-sulfinylation of the peroxiredoxin (PRDX) proteins constituted the first example of an autonomous circadian redox oscillation, which occurred independently of the transcriptional clock. Importantly, the high phylogenetic conservation of these rhythms suggests that they might predate the evolution of the transcriptional oscillator, and therefore could be a part of a primordial circadian redox\/metabolic oscillator. This discovery forced the reappraisal of the dogmatic transcription-centered view of the clockwork and opened a new avenue of research. Indeed, the investigation into the links between the circadian and redox systems is still in its infancy, and many important questions remain to be addressed.","369":"","370":"Ciliary motility is crucial for the development and health of many organisms. Motility depends on the coordinated activity of multiple dynein motors arranged in a precise pattern on the outer doublet microtubules. Although significant progress has been made in elucidating the composition and organization of the dyneins, a comprehensive understanding of dynein regulation is lacking. Here, we focus on two conserved signaling complexes located at the base of the radial spokes. These include the I1\/f inner dynein arm associated with radial spoke 1 and the calmodulin- and spoke-associated complex and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex associated with radial spoke 2. Current research is focused on understanding how these two axonemal hubs coordinate and regulate the dynein motors and ciliary motility.","371":"Immune enhancement of dengue disease continues to be a concern for those with incomplete immunity in endemic areas. Advanced testing and follow-up of a newly available live attenuated dengue vaccine has recently shown the ability of vaccination to predispose some recipients for a severe outcome on subsequent infection. To improve safety, recommendations have been made to restrict use of the vaccine to those who are likely to have had prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV). Researchers continue to investigate dengue immunity and seek evidence that dengue vaccines can be safely administered to all populations needing protection.","372":"The scientific community now possesses information obtained directly from human beings that makes it possible to understand why breakthrough-enhanced dengue virus (DENV) infections occurred in children receiving Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia tetravalent live attenuated vaccine and to predict the possibility of breakthrough-enhanced DENV infections following immunization with two other tetravalent live attenuated vaccines now in phase III testing. Based upon recent research, Dengvaxia, lacking DENV nonstructural protein antigens, did not protect seronegatives because it failed to raise a competent T-cell response and\/or antibodies to NS1. It is also possible that chimeric structure does not present the correct virion conformation permitting the development of protective neutralizing antibodies. A premonitory signal shared by the Sanofi Pasteur and the Takeda vaccines was the failure of fully immunized subhuman primates to prevent low-level viremia and\/or anamnestic antibody responses to live DENV challenge. The vaccine developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (National Institutes of Health [NIH]) has met virtually all of the goals needed to demonstrate preclinical efficacy and safety for humans. Each monovalent vaccine was comprehensively studied for reactogenicity and immunogenicity in human volunteers. Protective immunity in subjects receiving tetravalent candidate vaccines was evidenced by the fact that when vaccinated subjects were given further doses of vaccine or different strains of DENV the result was \"solid immunity,\" a nonviremic and nonanamnestic immune response.","373":"Dengue is a still-growing public health concern in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The development and implementation of an effective dengue vaccine in these regions is a high priority. This insight focuses on the expected characteristics of a safe and efficacious vaccine, referring to the clinical experience obtained during the development of the first tetravalent dengue vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur, now licensed in several endemic countries. Safety and efficacy data from both short- and long-term follow-up of large-scale efficacy studies will be discussed, as well as the next steps following vaccine introduction.","374":"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arthropod-borne viral disease of humans. Although effective vaccines exist against other flaviviral diseases like yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis, dengue vaccine development is complicated by the presence of four virus serotypes and the possibility of partial immunity enhancing dengue disease severity. Several live attenuated dengue vaccines are being tested in human clinical trials. Initial results are mixed, with variable efficacy depending on DENV serotype and previous DENV exposure. Here, we highlight recent discoveries about the human antibody response to DENV and propose guidelines for advancing development of safe and effective dengue vaccines.","375":"Cytokines are key modulators of immunity. Most cytokines use the Janus kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway to promote gene transcriptional regulation, but their signals must be attenuated by multiple mechanisms. These include the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins, which represent a main negative regulation mechanism for the JAK-STAT pathway. Cytokine-inducible Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein (CIS), SOCS1, and SOCS3 proteins regulate cytokine signals that control the polarization of CD4+ T cells and the maturation of CD8+ T cells. SOCS proteins also regulate innate immune cells and are involved in tumorigenesis. This review summarizes recent progress on CIS, SOCS1, and SOCS3 in T cells and tumor immunity.","376":"Multipotent blood progenitor cells migrate into the thymus and initiate the T-cell differentiation program. T-cell progenitor cells gradually acquire T-cell characteristics while shedding their multipotentiality for alternative fates. This process is supported by extracellular signaling molecules, including Notch ligands and cytokines, provided by the thymic microenvironment. T-cell development is associated with dynamic change of gene regulatory networks of transcription factors, which interact with these environmental signals. Together with Notch or pre-T-cell-receptor (TCR) signaling, cytokines always control proliferation, survival, and differentiation of early T cells, but little is known regarding their cross talk with transcription factors. However, recent results suggest ways that cytokines expressed in distinct intrathymic niches can specifically modulate key transcription factors. This review discusses how stage-specific roles of cytokines and transcription factors can jointly guide development of early T cells.","377":"The balance of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 plays a key role in shaping the development of antitumor or protumor immunity. In this review, we discuss the role IL-12 and IL-23 plays in tumor biology from preclinical and clinical data. In particular, we discuss the mechanism by which IL-23 promotes tumor growth and metastases and how the IL-12\/IL-23 axis of inflammation can be targeted for cancer therapy.","378":"The behavior of cells within tissues is governed by the activities of adhesion receptors that provide spatial cues and transmit forces through intercellular junctions, and by growth-factor receptors, particularly receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), that respond to biochemical signals from the environment. Coordination of these two activities is essential for the patterning and polarized migration of cells during morphogenesis and for homeostasis in mature tissues; loss of this coordination is a hallmark of developing cancer and driver of metastatic progression. Although much is known about the individual functions of adhesion and growth factor receptors, we have a surprisingly superficial understanding of the mechanisms by which their activities are coordinated.","379":"Neurodegenerative diseases are a common cause of morbidity and cognitive impairment in older adults. Most clinicians who care for the elderly are not trained to diagnose these conditions, perhaps other than typical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each of these disorders has varied epidemiology, clinical symptomatology, laboratory and neuroimaging features, neuropathology, and management. Thus, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate and diagnose these conditions accurately. This review summarizes and highlights clinical aspects of several of the most commonly encountered neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and its variants, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD). For each condition, we provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, defining clinical symptoms and diagnostic criteria, relevant imaging and laboratory features, genetics, pathology, treatments, and differential diagnosis.","380":"Cytokines and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are intertwined in the regulatory circuit controlling immunity. lncRNA expression levels are altered following cytokine stimulation in a cell-type-specific fashion. lncRNAs, in turn, regulate the inducible expression of cytokines following immune activation. These studies position lncRNAs as important regulators of gene expression within the complex pathways of the immune system. Our understanding of the functions of lncRNAs is just beginning. Current methodologies for functionally understanding how these transcripts mediate their effects are unable to keep up with the speed of genomic outputs cataloging thousands of these novel genes. In this review, we highlight the interplay between cytokines and lncRNAs and speculate on the future utility of these genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.","381":"A dengue vaccine has been pursued for more than 50 years and, unlike other flaviviral vaccines such as that against yellow fever, progress has been slow. In this review, we describe progress toward the first licensed dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, which does not give complete protection against disease. The antibody response to the dengue virion is reviewed, highlighting immunodominant yet poorly neutralizing responses in the context of a highly dynamic structurally flexible dengue virus particle. Finally, we review recent evidence for cross-reactivity between antibody responses to Zika and dengue viruses, which may further complicate the development of broadly protective dengue virus vaccines.","382":null,"383":"Cell adhesions link cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to each other and depend on interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. Both cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesion sites contain discrete, yet overlapping, functional modules. These modules establish physical associations with the actin cytoskeleton, locally modulate actin organization and dynamics, and trigger intracellular signaling pathways. Interplay between these modules generates distinct actin architectures that underlie different stages, types, and functions of cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesions. Actomyosin contractility is required to generate mature, stable adhesions, as well as to sense and translate the mechanical properties of the cellular environment into changes in cell organization and behavior. Here, we review the organization and function of different adhesion modules and how they interact with the actin cytoskeleton. We highlight the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction in adhesions and how adhesion molecules mediate cross talk between cell-ECM and cell-cell adhesion sites.","384":"Influenza remains a major human pathogen despite seasonal vaccination. At long last, there is energy and resources to develop influenza vaccines that provide more predictable and durable protection. Vaccines based on inducing antibodies to the conserved stem of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) have emerged as leading candidates for broadening population immunity and ultimately limiting antigenic drift. Here, we discuss the knowns and unknowns of HA-specific B-cell and antibody responses. In particular, we focus on how immunodominance sculpts antibody responses and drives antigenic drift. We propose a number of strategies to overcome immunodominance and improve the breadth and efficacy of antibody responses.","385":"Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics as well as pandemics and are a significant concern for human health. Current influenza virus vaccines show efficacy when they are antigenically well matched to circulating strains. Seasonal influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift at a high rate and, therefore, current vaccines have to be reformulated and readministered on an annual basis. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains frequently occur, significantly decreasing vaccine efficacy. In addition, current seasonal influenza virus vaccines have limited efficacy against newly emerging pandemic viruses. A universal influenza virus vaccine that induces long-term protection against all influenza virus strains would abolish the need for annual readministration of seasonal influenza virus vaccines and would significantly enhance our pandemic preparedness. Here we discuss the characteristics of universal influenza virus vaccines, their potential target antigens, and critical aspects to consider on the path to successfully developing such vaccines.","386":"Development of optimal vaccines for influenza is challenging, in part as a result of the high antigenic variability in field strains associated with genetic shift from reassortment and genetic drift from point mutations. Discovery of conserved antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein for neutralizing antibodies suggested the possibility that influenza vaccines could be developed that induce focused antibody responses to the conserved neutralizing determinants, especially the HA stem region. Recent studies have focused on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of such domains, using monoclonal antibodies and candidate-engineered HA stem-based vaccines. Much progress has been made, but we still do not fully understand the biology of the immune response to this unique antigenic region.","387":"Current influenza vaccines preferentially generate B-cell responses to the variable hemagglutinin (HA) head. Focusing vaccine-induced antibody responses on epitopes in the conserved HA stem may provide better protection against future drifted and pandemic strains. Understanding the basis for the dominant HA head and subdominant HA stem-specific responses at the level of B-cell activation and differentiation will be critical for designing vaccines that induce sustained stem-specific responses. Identifying antibody lineages with broad neutralizing activity against influenza A viruses and defining the structural mode of recognition for germline precursors of those antibodies will also guide future immunogen design.","388":"Most broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 have in common an extreme degree of somatic hypermutation (SHM), which correlates with their ability to neutralize multiple viral strains. However, achieving such extreme SHM by immunization remains a challenge. Here, we discuss how antigenic variation during HIV-1 infection may work to exacerbate SHM by permitting multiple iterative cycles of affinity maturation in germinal centers, and speculate on how this could be recapitulated through vaccination.","389":null,"390":null,"391":"Vaccinations are one of the greatest success stories of modern medicine, saving millions of lives since their widespread adoption. However, several diseases continue to elude highly effective vaccination strategies. Chief among these are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza (flu), both of which will require vaccines that can guide the creation of highly mutated, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The generation of bnAbs is hindered by our inability to effectively drive the high levels of affinity maturation required to achieve them in a large number of cells. Major limitations placed on affinity maturation derives from the inherent mutability of immunoglobulin genes, the evolved activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) targeting mechanisms that exist within them, and biases in targeting of particular epitope B cells.","392":null,"393":"The cytokines of the interleukin 17 (IL-17) family play a central role in the control of infections, especially extracellular fungi. Conversely, if unrestrained, these inflammatory cytokines contribute to the pathology of numerous autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions. Recent advances have led to the approval of IL-17A-blocking biologics for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, but much remains to be understood about the biological functions, regulation, and signaling pathways downstream of these factors. In this review, we outline the current knowledge of signal transduction and known physiological activities of IL-17 family cytokines. We will highlight in particular the current understanding of these cytokines in the context of skin manifestations of disease.","394":"The interleukin (IL)-6 family cytokines is a group of cytokines consisting of IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), and IL-27. They are grouped into one family because the receptor complex of each cytokine contains two (IL-6 and IL-11) or one molecule (all others cytokines) of the signaling receptor subunit gp130. IL-6 family cytokines have overlapping but also distinct biologic activities and are involved among others in the regulation of the hepatic acute phase reaction, in B-cell stimulation, in the regulation of the balance between regulatory and effector T cells, in metabolic regulation, and in many neural functions. Blockade of IL-6 family cytokines has been shown to be beneficial in autoimmune diseases, but bacterial infections and metabolic side effects have been observed. Recent advances in cytokine blockade might help to minimize such side effects during therapeutic blockade.","395":"Many cytokines and all interferons activate members of a small family of kinases (the Janus kinases [JAKs]) and a slightly larger family of transcription factors (the signal transducers and activators of transcription [STATs]), which are essential components of pathways that induce the expression of specific sets of genes in susceptible cells. JAK-STAT pathways are required for many innate and acquired immune responses, and the activities of these pathways must be finely regulated to avoid major immune dysfunctions. Regulation is achieved through mechanisms that include the activation or induction of potent negative regulatory proteins, posttranslational modification of the STATs, and other modulatory effects that are cell-type specific. Mutations of JAKs and STATs can result in gains or losses of function and can predispose affected individuals to autoimmune disease, susceptibility to a variety of infections, or cancer. Here we review recent developments in the biochemistry, genetics, and biology of JAKs and STATs.","396":"I worked almost exclusively on nucleic acids and gene expression from the age of 19 as an undergraduate until the age of 38 as an associate professor. Mentors featured prominently in my choice of paths. My friendship with influential Brandeis colleagues then persuaded me that genetics was an important tool for studying gene expression, and I switched my experimental organism to yeast for this reason. Several years later, friendship also played a prominent role in my beginning work on circadian rhythms. As luck would have it, gene expression as well as genetics turned out to be important for circadian timekeeping. As a consequence, background and training put my laboratory in an excellent position to contribute to this aspect of the circadian problem. The moral of the story is, as in real estate, \"location, location, location.\"","397":"Cell-cell junctions link cells to each other in tissues, and regulate tissue homeostasis in critical cell processes that include tissue barrier function, cell proliferation, and migration. Defects in cell-cell junctions give rise to a wide range of tissue abnormalities that disrupt homeostasis and are common in genetic abnormalities and cancers. Here, we discuss the organization and function of cell-cell junctions primarily involved in adhesion (tight junction, adherens junction, and desmosomes) in two different epithelial tissues: a simple epithelium (intestine) and a stratified epithelium (epidermis). Studies in these tissues reveal similarities and differences in the organization and functions of different cell-cell junctions that meet the requirements for the specialized functions of each tissue. We discuss cell-cell junction responses to genetic and environmental perturbations that provide further insights into their roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis.","398":null,"399":"The Hippo signal transduction pathway is an important regulator of organ growth and cell differentiation, and its deregulation contributes to the development of cancer. The activity of the Hippo pathway is strongly dependent on cell junctions, cellular architecture, and the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how cell junctions transduce signals from the microenvironment and control the activity of the Hippo pathway. We also discuss how these mechanisms may control organ growth during development and regeneration, and how defects in them deregulate Hippo signaling in cancer cells.","400":"SUMMARYThe establishment and continuous cell type-specific adaptation of cytoplasmic intermediate filament (IF) networks are linked to various types of IF motility. Motor protein-driven active transport, linkage to other cellular structures, diffusion of small soluble subunits, and intrinsic network elasticity all contribute to the motile behavior of IFs. These processes are subject to regulation by multiple signaling pathways. IF motility is thereby connected to and involved in many basic cellular processes guarding the maintenance of cell and tissue integrity. Disturbances of IF motility are linked to diseases that are characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates containing IF proteins together with other cellular components.","401":"Classical cadherins are the key molecules that control cell-cell adhesion. Notwithstanding this function, it is also clear that classical cadherins are more than just the \"glue\" that keeps the cells together. Cadherins are essential regulators of tissue homeostasis that govern multiple facets of cellular function and development, by transducing adhesive signals to a complex network of signaling effectors and transcriptional programs. In cancer, cadherins are often inactivated or functionally inhibited, resulting in disease development and\/or progression. This review focuses on E-cadherin and its causal role in the development and progression of breast and gastric cancer. We provide a summary of the biochemical consequences and consider the conceptual impact of early (mutational) E-cadherin loss in cancer. We advocate that carcinomas driven by E-cadherin loss should be considered \"actin-diseases,\" caused by the specific disruption of the E-cadherin-actin connection and a subsequent dependence on sustained actomyosin contraction for tumor progression. Based on the available data from mouse and human studies we discuss opportunities for targeted clinical intervention.","402":"Mucosal surfaces are lined by epithelial cells. In the intestine, the epithelium establishes a selectively permeable barrier that supports nutrient absorption and waste secretion while preventing intrusion by luminal materials. Intestinal epithelia therefore play a central role in regulating interactions between the mucosal immune system and luminal contents, which include dietary antigens, a diverse intestinal microbiome, and pathogens. The paracellular space is sealed by the tight junction, which is maintained by a complex network of protein interactions. Tight junction dysfunction has been linked to a variety of local and systemic diseases. Two molecularly and biophysically distinct pathways across the intestinal tight junction are selectively and differentially regulated by inflammatory stimuli. This review discusses the mechanisms underlying these events, their impact on disease, and the potential of using these as paradigms for development of tight junction-targeted therapeutic interventions.","403":null,"404":"SUMMARYMicrotubules provide long tracks along which a broad range of organelles and vesicles are transported by kinesin and dynein motors. Motor protein complexes also tether cargoes to cytoskeletal filaments, helping facilitate their interaction and communication. The generation of biochemically distinct microtubule subpopulations allows subsets of motors to recognize a given microtubule identity, allowing further organization within the cytoplasm. Both transport and tethering are spatiotemporally regulated through multiple modes, including acute modification of both motor-cargo and motor-track associations by various physiological signals. Strict regulation of intracellular transport is particularly important in specialized cell types such as neurons. Here, we review general mechanisms by which cargo transport is controlled and also highlight examples of transport regulated by multiple mechanisms.","405":"Sleep is homeostatically regulated with sleep pressure accumulating with the increasing duration of prior wakefulness. Yet, a clear understanding of the molecular components of the homeostat, as well as the molecular and cellular processes they sense and control to regulate sleep intensity and duration, remain a mystery. Here, we will discuss the cellular and molecular basis of sleep homeostasis, first focusing on the best homeostatic sleep marker in vertebrates, slow wave activity; second, moving to the molecular genetic analysis of sleep homeostasis in the fruit fly Drosophila; and, finally, discussing more systemic aspects of sleep homeostasis.","406":null,"407":"The wide range of effector and memory T cells is instrumental for immune regulation and tailored mechanisms of protection against pathogens. Here, we will focus on human CD4 T cells and discuss T-cell plasticity and intraclonal diversification in the context of a progressive and selective model of CD4 T-cell differentiation.","408":"CD4+ T cells are critical for the elimination of an immense array of microbial pathogens. Although there are aspects of helper T-cell differentiation that can be modeled as a classic cell-fate commitment, CD4+ T cells also maintain considerable flexibility in their transcriptional program. Here, we present an overview of chromatin biology during cellular reprogramming and, within this context, envision how the scope of cellular reprogramming may be expanded to further our understanding of the controversy surrounding CD4+ T lymphocyte plasticity or determinism.","409":"The gut-resident constituents of the microbiota protect the mucosa from invasive pathogens through engagement of both innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. They are also likely to provide systemic protection from pathogens, by enhancing host robustness and tolerance to the invasive microbes and by inducing immune responses that prevent their growth. These properties of commensal microbiota, particularly the capacity of some bacteria to induce diverse types of antigen-specific immune responses, raises the prospect that they could be deployed as vaccine vectors to generate effective local and systemic immunity to viral and bacterial pathogens.","410":"The reliance of the immune system on constitutive microbial stimulation support the idea that both responsiveness to vaccines and vaccine design need to be considered in the context of host-microbiota interactions. Manipulation of microbe function or composition via diet alteration or microbiota engraftment may soon become a viable approach to control immunity and, as such, vaccine responses. Learning from our endogenous original adjuvants could be critical in overcoming the enormous hurdle of vaccine design against the numerous pathogens that cause chronic infection. Going forward, rationally designed vaccines that take advantage of the inherent adjuvant properties of the microbiota could have a major impact on the prevention of disease.","411":"Plasticity is the ability of a cell type to convert to another cell type. There are multiple effector CD4 T-cell subtypes, including TH1, TH2, TH17, TH1*, CD4 CTL, TH9, and TFH cells. It is commonly thought that a CD4 T cell can readily show full plasticity-full conversion from one differentiated cell-and this propensity to plasticity is possessed by memory CD4 T cells. However, there remains no direct demonstration of in vivo-generated resting memory CD4 T-cell conversion to a different subtype on secondary antigen challenge in vivo in an intact animal at the single-cell level. What has been clearly shown is that CD4 T cells possess extraordinary capacity for phenotypic heterogeneity, but that is a distinct property from plasticity. Heterogeneity is diversity of the resting memory CD4 T-cell population, not conversion of a single differentiated cell into another subtype. Apparently, plasticity at the population level can be accomplished by either mechanism, as heterogeneity of CD4 T-cell subpopulations could affect large shifts in subtype distribution at the overall population level via differential exponential expansion and death.","412":"In contrast to live attenuated vaccines, which are designed to induce immunity through a time-limited bloom in systemic tissues, the microbiota is a persistent feature of body surfaces, especially the intestine. The immune responses to the microbiota are idiosyncratic depending on the niche intimacy of different taxa and generally adapt the host to avoid overgrowth and maintain mutualism rather than to eliminate the organisms of that taxon. Both the microbiota and the host have so much molecular cross talk controlling each other, that the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic spaces of the host-microbial superorganism are federal rather than sovereign. This molecular cross talk is vital for the immune system to develop its mature form. Nevertheless, the microbiota\/host biomass spaces are rather well separated: The microbiota also limits colonization and penetration of pathogens through intense metabolic competition. Immune responses to those members of the microbiota mutually adapted to intimate association at mucosal surfaces have attractive potential durability, but for clinical use as persistent vehicles they would require personalization and engineered reversibility to manage the immune context and complications in individual human subjects.","413":null,"414":null,"415":"Much of what we understand about immunology, including the response to vaccines, come from studies in mice because they provide many practical advantages compared with research in higher mammals and humans. Nevertheless, modalities for preventing or treating disease do not always translate from mouse to humans, which has led to increasing scrutiny of the continued merits of mouse research. Here, we summarize the pros and cons of current laboratory mouse models for immunology research and discuss whether overreliance on nonphysiological, ultra-hygienic animal husbandry approaches has limited the ultimate translation potential of mouse-derived data to humans. Alternative approaches are discussed that may extend the use of the mouse model for preclinical studies.","416":"It is well established that control of vascular morphogenesis and homeostasis is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Delta-like 4 (Dll4), angiopoietin, and ephrin signaling. It has become clear that signaling by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which have a long history of studies in bone and early heart development, are also essential for regulating vascular function. Indeed, mutations that cause deregulated BMP signaling are linked to two human vascular diseases, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arterial hypertension. These observations are corroborated by data obtained with vascular cells in cell culture and in mouse models. BMPs are required for normal endothelial cell differentiation and for venous\/arterial and lymphatic specification. In adult life, BMP signaling orchestrates neo-angiogenesis as well as vascular inflammation, remodeling, and calcification responses to shear and oxidative stress. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of BMPs in the vascular system, based on studies of mouse models and human vascular disorders.","417":"Animal models are an essential feature of the vaccine design toolkit. Although animal models have been invaluable in delineating the mechanisms of immune function, their precision in predicting how well specific vaccines work in humans is often suboptimal. There are, of course, many obvious species differences that may limit animal models from predicting all details of how a vaccine works in humans. However, careful consideration of which animal models may have limitations should also allow more accurate interpretations of animal model data and more accurate predictions of what is to be expected in clinical trials. In this article, we examine some of the considerations that might be relevant to cross-species extrapolation of vaccine-related immune responses for the prediction of how vaccines will perform in humans.","418":null,"419":"Animal models have played a pivotal role in all stages of vaccine development. Their predictive value for vaccine effectiveness depends on the pathogen, the robustness of the animal challenge model, and the correlates of protection (if known). This article will cover key questions regarding bridging animal studies to efficacy trials in humans. Examples include human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in which animal protection after vaccination with heterologous prototype virus-like particles (VLPs) predicted successful efficacy trials in humans, and a recent approval of anthrax vaccine in accordance with the \"Animal Rule.\" The establishment of animal models predictive of vaccine effectiveness in humans has been fraught with difficulties with low success rate to date. Challenges facing the use of animal models for vaccine development against Ebola and HIV will be discussed.","420":"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge of rhesus macaques provides an invaluable tool to evaluate the clinical prospects of HIV-1 vaccine concepts. However, as with any animal model of human disease, it is crucial to understand the advantages and limitations of this system to maximize the translational value of SIV vaccine studies. Here, we discuss the importance of assessing the efficacy of vaccine prototypes using stringent SIV challenge regimens that mimic HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis. We also review some of the cautionary tales of HIV-1 vaccine research because they provide general lessons for the preclinical assessment of vaccine candidates.","421":"A minimal cell is one whose genome only encodes the minimal set of genes necessary for the cell to survive. Scientific reductionism postulates the best way to learn the first principles of cellular biology would be to use a minimal cell in which the functions of all genes and components are understood. The genes in a minimal cell are, by definition, essential. In 2016, synthesis of a genome comprised of only the set of essential and quasi-essential genes encoded by the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides created a near-minimal bacterial cell. This organism performs the cellular functions common to all organisms. It replicates DNA, transcribes RNA, translates proteins, undergoes cell division, and little else. In this review, we examine this organism and contrast it with other bacteria that have been used as surrogates for a minimal cell.","422":"The memory B-cell pool in an immune individual is more heterogeneous than previously recognized. The different types of memory B cells likely play distinct roles in tuning the secondary immune response because they differ in their potential to generate plasmablasts, which secrete antibodies, or germinal center (GC) cells, which generate new and higher affinity memory cells. We propose that the production of plasmablasts or GC cells by a memory B cell is controlled by its state of differentiation and the amount and affinity of antigen-specific antibodies present in the individual in which it resides.","423":"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a disease of defective tissue homeostasis resulting in active remodeling of nephrons and bile ducts to form fluid-filled sacs called cysts. The causal genes PKD1 and PKD2 encode transmembrane proteins polycystin 1 (PC1) and polycystin 2 (PC2), respectively. Together, the polycystins localize to the solitary primary cilium that protrudes from the apical surface of most kidney tubule cells and is thought to function as a privileged compartment that the cell uses for signal integration of sensory inputs. It has been proposed that PC1 and PC2 form a receptor-channel complex that detects external stimuli and transmit a local calcium-mediated signal, which may control a multitude of cellular processes by an as-yet unknown mechanism. Genetic studies using mouse models of cilia and polycystin dysfunction have shown that polycystins regulate an unknown cilia-dependent signal that is normally part of the homeostatic maintenance of nephron structure. ADPKD ensues when this pathway is dysregulated by absence of polycystins from intact cilia, but disruption of cilia also disrupts this signaling mechanism and ameliorates ADPKD even in the absence of polycystins. Understanding the role of cilia and ciliary signaling in ADPKD is challenging, but success will provide saltatory advances in our understanding of how tubule structure is maintained in healthy kidneys and how disruption of polycystin or cilia function leads to the pathological tissue remodeling process underlying ADPKD.","424":"Memory is the defining feature of the adaptive immune system. Humoral immune memory is largely though not exclusively generated in the germinal center (GC), which spawns long-lived plasma cells that support ongoing serum antibody titers as well as \"memory B cells\" (MBCs) that persist in the immune host at expanded frequencies. Upon reencounter with antigen, these MBCs are reactivated and potentially can contribute to protection by further expansion, rapid differentiation to antibody-forming cells, and\/or reseeding of a new round of GCs along with somatic V region mutation and selection. Here I will discuss what controls these various potential fates of MBCs and the functional significance of different types of MBC reactivation.","425":"Antigen recall can clearly induce a germinal center (GC) reaction. What has become an issue for debate are the origins of the antigen-specific B cells that form memory-response GCs (mGCs). Using antigen labeling and adoptive transfer, memory B cells expressing different antibody class can give rise to mGCs with differing efficiency. Here, we will argue that the range of class-specific memory responses reported across multiple systems represents the spectrum of memory B-cell fate and function. While the formulation of recall immunogen and location of mGCs have an important role, we propose that effective cognate regulation is the key variable influencing recall outcome. These issues remain central to contemporary efforts of rational vaccine design.","426":"Pertussis is resurgent in some countries, particularly those in which children receive acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines in early infancy and boosters later in life. Immunologic studies show that, whereas whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines orient the immune system toward Th1\/Th17 responses, acellular pertussis vaccines orient toward Th1\/Th2 responses. Although aP vaccines do provide protection during the first years of life, the change in T-cell priming results in waning effectiveness of aP as early as 2-3 years post-boosters. Although other factors, such as increased virulence of pertussis strains, better diagnosis, and better surveillance may play a role, the increase in pertussis appears to be the result of waning immunity. In addition, studies in baboon models, requiring confirmation in humans, show that aP is less able to prevent nasopharyngeal colonization of Bordetella pertussis than wP or natural infection.","427":"Photoreceptors are sensory neurons designed to convert light stimuli into neurological responses. This process, called phototransduction, takes place in the outer segments (OS) of rod and cone photoreceptors. OS are specialized sensory cilia, with analogous structures to those present in other nonmotile cilia. Deficient morphogenesis and\/or dysfunction of photoreceptor sensory cilia (PSC) caused by mutations in a variety of photoreceptor-specific and common cilia genes can lead to inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). IRDs can manifest as isolated retinal diseases or syndromic diseases. In this review, we describe the structure and composition of PSC and different forms of ciliopathies with retinal involvement. We review the genetics of the IRDs, which are monogenic disorders but genetically diverse with regard to causality.","428":"Brain networks have been of long-standing interest to neurodegeneration researchers, including but not limited to investigators focusing on conventional prion diseases, which are known to propagate along neural pathways. Tools for human network mapping, however, remained inadequate, limiting our understanding of human brain network architecture and preventing clinical research applications. Until recently, neuropathological studies were the only viable approach to mapping disease onset and progression in humans but required large autopsy cohorts and laborious methods for whole-brain sectioning and staining. Despite important advantages, postmortem studies cannot address in vivo, physiological, or longitudinal questions and have limited potential to explore early-stage disease except for the most common disorders. Emerging in vivo network-based neuroimaging strategies have begun to address these issues, providing data that complement the neuropathological tradition. Overall, findings to date highlight several fundamental principles of neurodegenerative disease anatomy and pathogenesis, as well as some enduring mysteries. These principles and mysteries provide a road map for future research.","429":null,"430":"The Crumbs proteins are evolutionarily conserved apical transmembrane proteins. Drosophila Crumbs was discovered via its crucial role in epithelial polarity during fly embryogenesis. Crumbs proteins have variable extracellular domains but a highly conserved intracellular domain that can bind FERM and PDZ domain proteins. Mammals have three Crumbs genes and this review focuses on Crumbs3, the major Crumbs isoform expressed in mammalian epithelial cells. Although initial work has highlighted the role of Crumbs3 in polarity, more recent studies have found it has an important role in tissue morphogenesis functioning as a linker between the apical membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, recent publications have linked Crumbs3 to growth control via regulation of the Hippo\/Yap pathway.","431":"Memory responses seen after whole-cell pertussis (wP) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine priming are different and reflect better long-term protection against pertussis disease seen with the whole-cell vaccines. Although acellular vaccines generate higher levels of antigen-specific IgG to the antigens included in the aP vaccines, there are many more pertussis antigens included in whole-cell vaccines. Acellular vaccine priming is associated with skewing of the immune response to a more Th2-like response, whereas whole-cell priming is associated with a Th1\/Th17 response. Repeated booster doses of acellular vaccine in children primed with acellular vaccine has been shown to result in progressively shorter duration of protection against disease. This may be explained by the generation of higher levels of antigen-specific IgG4, which does not bind complement and leads to a suboptimal inflammatory response and impaired phagocytosis and antimicrobial defense. In contrast, whole-cell priming followed by aP vaccine boosters results in better opsonization, phagocytosis, and complement mediated killing through the preferential induction of IgG1.","432":"The high incidence of pertussis in vaccinated adolescents suggests the failing of immune memory. We argue that acellular pertussis vaccines generate memory cells that are effectively reactivated by boosters better than by Bordetella pertussis exposure. We propose that there are two main causes. One is the induction of vaccine-specific immunity rather than pathogen-specific immunity. The second is that strictly mucosal infections such as B. pertussis poorly reactivate memory B and T cells residing deep in lymph nodes or tissues. Developing new vaccines for infants or adolescents will be immunologically and economically challenging. Let us hope that maternal and infant immunization, to date the most effective strategies against pertussis death, will remain so.","433":"Protruding from the apical surfaces of epithelial cells are specialized structures, including cilia, microplicae, microvilli, and stereocilia. These contribute to epithelial function by cushioning the apical surface, by amplifying its surface area to facilitate nutrient absorption, and by promoting sensory transduction and barrier function. Despite these important roles, and the diseases that result when their formation is perturbed, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of the biogenesis of apical protrusions, or the pathways that promote their organization and orientation once at the apical surface. Here, I review some general aspects of these apical structures, and then discuss our current understanding of their formation and organization with respect to proteins that specify apicobasolateral polarity and planar cell polarity.","434":"Epithelial cells play a key role in insuring physiological homeostasis by acting as a barrier between the outside environment and internal organs. They are also responsible for the vectorial transport of ions and fluid essential to the function of many organs. To accomplish these tasks, epithelial cells must generate an asymmetrically organized plasma membrane comprised of structurally and functionally distinct apical and basolateral membranes. Adherent and occluding junctions, respectively, anchor cells within a layer and prevent lateral diffusion of proteins in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and restrict passage of proteins and solutes through intercellular spaces. At a fundamental level, the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity requires that signals initiated at cell-substratum and cell-cell adhesions are transmitted appropriately and dynamically to the cytoskeleton, to the membrane-trafficking machinery, and to the regulation of occluding and adherent junctions. Rigorous descriptive and mechanistic studies published over the last 50 years have provided great detail to our understanding of epithelial polarization. Yet still, critical early steps in morphogenesis are not yet fully appreciated. In this review, we discuss how cytoskeletal motor proteins, primarily kinesins, contribute to coordinated modification of microtubule and actin arrays, formation and remodeling of cell adhesions to targeted membrane trafficking, and to initiating the formation and expansion of an apical lumen.","435":"Selective enrichment of the polyphosphoinositides (PPIn), such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns4P, helps to determine the identity of the plasma membrane (PM) and regulates many aspects of cell biology through a vast number of protein effectors. Polarity proteins had long been assumed to be non-PPIn-binding proteins that mainly associate with PM\/cell cortex through their extensive protein-protein interaction network. However, recent studies began to reveal that several key polarity proteins electrostatically bind to PPIn through their positively charged protein domains or structures and such PPIn-binding property is essential for their direct and specific attachment to PM. Although the physical nature of the charge-based PPIn binding appears to be simple and nonspecific, it serves as an elegant mechanism that can be efficiently and specifically regulated for achieving polarized PM targeting of polarity proteins. As an unexpected consequence, subcellular localization of PPIn-binding polarity proteins are also subject to regulations by physiological conditions such as hypoxia and ischemia that acutely and reversibly depletes PPIn from PM.","436":"Epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract require distinct apical and basolateral domains to function properly. Trafficking and insertion of enzymes and transporters into the apical brush border of intestinal epithelial cells is essential for effective digestion and absorption of nutrients. Specific critical ion transporters are delivered to the apical brush border to facilitate fluid and electrolyte uptake. Maintenance of these apical transporters requires both targeted delivery and regulated membrane recycling. Examination of altered apical trafficking in patients with Microvillus Inclusion disease caused by inactivating mutations in MYO5B has led to insights into the regulation of apical trafficking by elements of the apical recycling system. Modeling of MYO5B loss in cell culture and animal models has led to recognition of Rab11a and Rab8a as critical regulators of apical brush border function. All of these studies show the importance of apical membrane trafficking dynamics in maintenance of polarized epithelial cell function.","437":"One requirement for establishing polarity within a cell is the asymmetric trafficking of intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. This tightly regulated process creates spatial and temporal differences in both plasma membrane composition and the membrane-associated proteome. Asymmetric membrane trafficking is also a critical mechanism to regulate cell differentiation, signaling, and physiology. Many eukaryotic cell types use the eight-protein exocyst complex to orchestrate polarized vesicle trafficking to certain membrane locales. Members of the exocyst were originally discovered in yeast while screening for proteins required for the delivery of secretory vesicles to the budding daughter cell. The same eight exocyst genes are conserved in mammals, in which the specifics of exocyst-mediated trafficking are highly cell-type-dependent. Some exocyst members bind to certain Rab GTPases on intracellular vesicles, whereas others localize to the plasma membrane at the site of exocytosis. Assembly of the exocyst holocomplex is responsible for tethering these vesicles to the plasma membrane before their soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated exocytosis. In this review, we will focus on the role and regulation of the exocyst complex in targeted vesicular trafficking as related to the establishment and maintenance of cellular polarity. We will contrast exocyst function in apicobasal epithelial polarity versus front-back mesenchymal polarity, and the dynamic regulation of exocyst-mediated trafficking during cell phenotype transitions.","438":"","439":"Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based organelles whose assembly requires a motile process, known as intraflagellar transport (IFT), to bring tubulin and other components to the distal tip of the growing structure. The IFT system uses a multiprotein complex with components that appear to be specialized for the transport of different sets of cargo proteins. The mechanisms by which cargo is selected for ciliary import and transport by IFT remain an area of active research. The complex dynamics of cilia and flagella are under constant regulation to ensure proper length control, and this regulation appears to involve regulation at the stage of IFT injection into the flagellum, as well as regulation of flagellar disassembly and, possibly, of cargo binding. Cilia and flagella thus represent a convenient model system to study how multiple motile and signaling pathways cooperate to control the assembly and dynamics of a complex cellular structure.","440":"Design automation refers to a category of software tools for designing systems that work together in a workflow for designing, building, testing, and analyzing systems with a target behavior. In synthetic biology, these tools are called bio-design automation (BDA) tools. In this review, we discuss the BDA tools areas-specify, design, build, test, and learn-and introduce the existing software tools designed to solve problems in these areas. We then detail the functionality of some of these tools and show how they can be used together to create the desired behavior of two types of modern synthetic genetic regulatory networks.","441":null,"442":"The vectorial secretion and absorption of fluid and solutes by epithelial cells is dependent on the polarized expression of membrane solute transporters and channels at the apical and basolateral membranes. The establishment and maintenance of this polarized expression of transporters and channels are affected by divers protein-trafficking complexes. Moreover, regulation of the magnitude of transport is often under control of physiological stimuli, again through the interaction of transporters and channels with protein-trafficking complexes. This review highlights the value in utilizing transporters and channels as cargo to characterize core trafficking machinery by which epithelial cells establish and maintain their polarized expression, and how this machinery regulates fluid and solute transport in response to physiological stimuli.","443":"Polarized exocytosis is generally considered as the multistep vesicular trafficking process in which membrane-bounded carriers are transported from the Golgi or endosomal compartments to specific sites of the plasma membrane. Polarized exocytosis in cells is achieved through the coordinated actions of membrane trafficking machinery and cytoskeleton orchestrated by signaling molecules such as the Rho family of small GTPases. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of polarized exocytosis is essential to our understanding of a wide range of pathophysiological processes from neuronal development to tumor invasion.","444":null,"445":null,"446":"Neuronal circadian oscillators in the mammalian and Drosophila brain express a circadian clock comprised of interlocking gene transcription feedback loops. The genetic clock regulates the membrane electrical activity by poorly understood signaling pathways to generate a circadian pattern of action potential firing. During the day, Na+ channels contribute an excitatory drive for the spontaneous activity of circadian clock neurons. Multiple types of K+ channels regulate the action potential firing pattern and the nightly reduction in neuronal activity. The membrane electrical activity possibly signaling by changes in intracellular Ca2+ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates the activity of the gene clock. A decline in the signaling pathways that link the gene clock and neural activity during aging and disease may weaken the circadian output and generate significant impacts on human health.","447":"Plants are attractive platforms for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Plants' modular and plastic body plans, capacity for photosynthesis, extensive secondary metabolism, and agronomic systems for large-scale production make them ideal targets for genetic reprogramming. However, efforts in this area have been constrained by slow growth, long life cycles, the requirement for specialized facilities, a paucity of efficient tools for genetic manipulation, and the complexity of multicellularity. There is a need for better experimental and theoretical frameworks to understand the way genetic networks, cellular populations, and tissue-wide physical processes interact at different scales. We highlight new approaches to the DNA-based manipulation of plants and the use of advanced quantitative imaging techniques in simple plant models such as Marchantia polymorpha. These offer the prospects of improved understanding of plant dynamics and new approaches to rational engineering of plant traits.","448":null,"449":null,"450":"Epithelial tubes are crucial to the function of organ systems including the excretory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary. Studies in the last two decades using in vitro organotypic systems and a variety of animal models have substantiated a large number of the morphogenetic mechanisms required to form epithelial tubes in development and regeneration. Many of these mechanisms modulate the differentiation and proliferation events necessary for generating the cell movements and changes in cell shape to delineate the wide variety of epithelial tube sizes, lengths, and conformations. For instance, when coupled with oriented cell division, proliferation itself plays a role in changes in tube shape and their directed expansion. Most of these processes are regulated in response to signaling inputs from adjacent cells or soluble factors from the environment. Despite the great deal of recent investigation in this direction, the knowledge we have about the signaling pathways associated with all epithelial tubulogenesis in development and regeneration is still very limited.","451":"Collective cell migration is paramount to morphogenesis and contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer. To migrate directionally and reach their site of destination, migrating cells must distinguish a front and a rear. In addition to polarizing individually, cell-cell interactions in collectively migrating cells give rise to a higher order of polarity, which allows them to move as a supracellular unit. Rather than just conferring adhesion, emerging evidence indicates that cadherin-based adherens junctions intrinsically polarize the cluster and relay mechanical signals to establish both intracellular and supracellular polarity. In this review, we discuss the various functions of adherens junctions in polarity of migrating cohorts.","452":"Intestinal epithelial cell polarity is instrumental to maintain epithelial homeostasis and balance communications between the gut lumen and bodily tissue, thereby controlling the defense against gastrointestinal pathogens and maintenance of immune tolerance to commensal bacteria. In this review, we highlight recent advances with regard to the molecular mechanisms of cell polarity-controlled epithelial homeostasis and immunity in the human intestine.","453":"Tissue stem\/progenitor cells supply multiple types of epithelial cells that eventually acquire specialized functions during organ development. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures need to be established for organs to perform their physiological functions. The liver contains two types of epithelial cells, namely, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which are derived from hepatoblasts, fetal liver stem\/progenitor cells (LPCs), in mid-gestation. Hepatocytes performing many metabolic reactions form cord-like structures, whereas cholangiocytes, biliary epithelial cells, form tubular structures called intrahepatic bile ducts. Analyses for human genetic diseases and mutant mice have identified crucial molecules for liver organogenesis. Functions of those molecules can be examined in in vitro culture systems where LPCs are induced to differentiate into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. Recent technical advances have revealed 3D epithelial morphogenesis during liver organogenesis. Therefore, the liver is a good model to understand how tissue stem\/progenitor cells differentiate and establish 3D tissue architectures during organ development.","454":"Visceral organs of vertebrates show left-right (L-R) asymmetry with regard to their position and morphology. Cilia play essential role in generating L-R asymmetry. A number of genes required for L-R asymmetry have now been identified in vertebrates, including human, many of which contribute to the formation and motility of cilia. In the mouse embryo, breaking of L-R symmetry occurs in the ventral node, where two types of cilia (motile and immotile) are present. Motile cilia are located at the central region of the node, and generate a leftward fluid flow. These motile cilia at the node are unique in that they rotate in the clockwise direction, unlike other immotile cilia such as airway cilia that show planar beating. The second type of cilia essential for L-R asymmetry is immotile cilia that are peripherally located immotile cilia. They sense a flow-dependent signal, which is either chemical or mechanical in nature. Although Ca2+ signaling is implicated in flow sensing, the precise mechanism remains unknown.","455":"Polarized epithelial cells line diverse surfaces throughout the body forming selective barriers between the external environment and the internal milieu. To cross these epithelial barriers, large solutes and other cargoes must undergo transcytosis, an endocytic pathway unique to polarized cell types, and significant for the development of cell polarity, uptake of viral and bacterial pathogens, transepithelial signaling, and immunoglobulin transport. Here, we review recent advances in our knowledge of the transcytotic pathway for proteins and lipids. We also discuss briefly the promise of harnessing the molecules that undergo transcytosis as vehicles for clinical applications in drug delivery.","456":null,"457":null,"458":"Although the discovery of the prion protein (PrP) resulted from its co-purification with scrapie infectivity in Syrian hamsters, work with genetically defined and genetically modified mice proved crucial for understanding the fundamental processes involved not only in prion diseases caused by PrP misfolding, aggregation, and spread but also in other, much more common, neurodegenerative brain diseases. In this review, we focus on methodological and conceptual approaches used to study scrapie and related PrP misfolding diseases in mice and how these approaches have advanced our understanding of related disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.","459":null,"460":"The mucosal barrier is composed of polarized epithelial cells with distinct apical and basolateral surfaces separated by tight junctions and serves as both a physical and immunological barrier to incoming pathogens. Specialized polarity proteins are critical for establishment and maintenance of polarity. Many human pathogens have evolved virulence mechanisms that target the polarity network to enhance binding, create replication niches, move through the barrier by transcytosis, or bypass the barrier by disrupting cell-cell junctions. This review summarizes recent advances and compares and contrasts how three important human pathogens that colonize mucosal surfaces, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter pylori, and Neisseria meningitidis, subvert the host cell polarization machinery during infection.","461":null,"462":"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most versatile family of signaling receptors in humans. They respond to diverse external signals, such as photons, proteins, peptides, chemicals, hormones, lipids, and sugars, and mediate a myriad of functions in the human body. Signaling through GPCRs can be optimized by enriching receptors and downstream effectors in discrete cellular domains. Many GPCRs have been found to be selectively targeted to cilia on numerous mammalian cell types. Moreover, investigations into the pathophysiology of human ciliopathies have implicated GPCR ciliary signaling in a number of developmental and cellular pathways. Thus, cilia are now appreciated as an increasingly important nexus for GPCR signaling. Yet, we are just beginning to understand the precise signaling pathways mediated by most ciliary GPCRs and how they impact cellular function and mammalian physiology.","463":"The ability of structure-based design to control the shape and reactivity-the atomic-level chemistry-of an immunogen argues for it being one of the \"most powerful\" immunogen-design strategies. But antigenic reactivity is only one of the properties required to induce a protective immune response. Here, a multidimensional approach is used to exemplify the enabling role atomic-level information can play in the development of immunogens against three viral pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which have resisted standard approaches to vaccine development. Overall, structure-based strategies incorporating B-cell ontogenies and viral evasion mechanisms appear exceptionally powerful.","464":"Functional antibodies, i.e., those with antipathogen activity in in vitro assays, are generally the best correlate of vaccine protection. Mimics of natural infection, including live attenuated and killed pathogens, which induce such antibodies in vivo, have generated highly successful vaccines. However, pathogens that induce functional antibodies at lower levels or more sporadically have been more refractory to vaccine design. Such pathogens are being tackled by more systematic approaches involving identifying functional antibodies, templating immunogens from the antibodies, and then evaluating the immunogens iteratively. I believe this is a powerful new approach to vaccine design as discussed below.","465":"A central role for cilia in congenital heart disease (CHD) was recently identified in a large-scale mouse mutagenesis screen. Although the screen was phenotype-driven, the majority of genes recovered were cilia-related, suggesting that cilia play a central role in CHD pathogenesis. This partly reflects the role of cilia as a hub for cell signaling pathways regulating cardiovascular development. Consistent with this, many cilia-transduced cell signaling genes were also recovered, and genes regulating vesicular trafficking, a pathway essential for ciliogenesis and cell signaling. Interestingly, among CHD-cilia genes recovered, some regulate left-right patterning, indicating cardiac left-right asymmetry disturbance may play significant roles in CHD pathogenesis. Clinically, CHD patients show a high prevalence of ciliary dysfunction and show enrichment for de novo mutations in cilia-related pathways. Combined with the mouse findings, this would suggest CHD may be a new class of ciliopathy.","466":"SUMMARYThe nucleoskeleton is an important structural feature of the metazoan nucleus and is involved in the regulation of genome expression and maintenance. The nuclear lamins are intermediate filament proteins that form a peripheral nucleoskeleton in concert with other lamin-associated proteins. Several other proteins normally found in the cytoskeleton have also been identified in the nucleus, but, as will be discussed here, their roles in forming a nucleoskeleton have not been elucidated. Nevertheless, mutations in lamins and lamin-associated proteins cause a spectrum of diseases, making them interesting targets for future research.","467":null,"468":null,"469":"The cilium is an elongated and continuous structure that spans two major subcellular domains. The cytoplasmic domain contains a short centriole, which serves to nucleate the main projection of the cilium. This projection, known as the axoneme, remains separated from the cytoplasm by a specialized gatekeeping complex within a ciliary subdomain called the transition zone. In this way, the axoneme is compartmentalized. Intriguingly, however, this general principle of cilium biology is altered in the sperm cells of many animals, which instead contain a cytoplasmic axoneme domain. Here, we discuss the hypothesis that the formation of specialized sperm giant centrioles and cytoplasmic cilia is mediated by the migration of the transition zone from its typical location as part of a structure known as the annulus and examine the intrinsic properties of the transition zone that may facilitate its migratory behavior.","470":null,"471":null,"472":null,"473":"In this review, we detail our current knowledge of PrPSc structure on the basis of structural and computational studies. We discuss the progress toward an atomic resolution description of PrPSc and results from the broader field of amyloid studies that may further inform our knowledge of this structure. Moreover, we summarize work that investigates the role of PrPSc structure in its toxicity, transmissibility, and species specificity. We look forward to an atomic model of PrPSc, which is expected to bring diagnostics and\/or therapeutics to the field of prion disease.","474":"Adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes connect the actin and keratin filament networks of adjacent cells into a mechanical unit. Whereas AJs function in mechanosensing and in transducing mechanical forces between the plasma membrane and the actomyosin cytoskeleton, desmosomes and intermediate filaments (IFs) provide mechanical stability required to maintain tissue architecture and integrity when the tissues are exposed to mechanical stress. Desmosomes are essential for stable intercellular cohesion, whereas keratins determine cell mechanics but are not involved in generating tension. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the role of IFs and desmosomes in tissue mechanics and discuss whether the desmosome-keratin scaffold might be actively involved in mechanosensing and in the conversion of chemical signals into mechanical strength.","475":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the deterioration of motor neurons. The first symptoms of ALS always begin at a focal but variable site and consistently spread to neighboring regions, suggesting that neurodegeneration in ALS is an orderly and propagating process. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, misfolding of a specific protein is central to ALS. SOD1, the major constituent of the protein deposits in some familial and sporadic forms of ALS, propagates its misfolded conformation like prions, providing a plausible molecular basis for the focality and spreading of muscle weakness in ALS. Because protein misfolding is a common cause of diverse neurodegenerative diseases, strategies aimed at boosting a cell's ability to cope with misfolded proteins could lead to therapeutics to combat these devastating age-related proteinopathies.","476":"Cadherin-based adherens junctions are conserved structures that mediate epithelial cell-cell adhesion in invertebrates and vertebrates. Despite their pivotal function in epithelial integrity, adherens junctions show a remarkable plasticity that is a prerequisite for tissue architecture and morphogenesis. Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is continuously turned over and undergoes cycles of endocytosis, sorting and recycling back to the plasma membrane. Mammalian cell culture and genetically tractable model systems such as Drosophila have revealed conserved, but also distinct, mechanisms in the regulation of E-cadherin membrane trafficking. Here, we discuss our current knowledge about molecules and mechanisms controlling endocytosis, sorting and recycling of E-cadherin during junctional remodeling.","477":"The cadherin-catenin adhesion complex is the key component of the intercellular adherens junction (AJ) that contributes both to tissue stability and dynamic cell movements in epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. The cadherin adhesion complex bridges neighboring cells and the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, and thereby contributes to mechanical coupling between cells which drives many morphogenetic events and tissue repair. Mechanotransduction at cadherin adhesions enables cells to sense, signal, and respond to physical changes in their environment. Central to this process is the dynamic link of the complex to actin filaments (F-actin), themselves structurally dynamic and subject to tension generated by myosin II motors. We discuss in this review recent breakthroughs in understanding molecular and cellular aspects of the organization of the core cadherin-catenin complex in adherens junctions, its association to F-actin, its mechanosensitive regulation, and dynamics.","478":null,"479":"Collective cell migration critically depends on cell-cell interactions coupled to a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. Important cell-cell adhesion receptor systems implicated in controlling collective movements include cadherins, immunoglobulin superfamily members (L1CAM, NCAM, ALCAM), Ephrin\/Eph receptors, Slit\/Robo, connexins and integrins, and an adaptive array of intracellular adapter and signaling proteins. Depending on molecular composition and signaling context, cell-cell junctions adapt their shape and stability, and this gradual junction plasticity enables different types of collective cell movements such as epithelial sheet and cluster migration, branching morphogenesis and sprouting, collective network migration, as well as coordinated individual-cell migration and streaming. Thereby, plasticity of cell-cell junction composition and turnover defines the type of collective movements in epithelial, mesenchymal, neuronal, and immune cells, and defines migration coordination, anchorage, and cell dissociation. We here review cell-cell adhesion systems and their functions in different types of collective cell migration as key regulators of collective plasticity.","480":"The cilium is an evolutionally conserved apical membrane protrusion that senses and transduces diverse signals to regulate a wide range of cellular activities. The cilium is dynamic in length, structure, and protein composition. Dysregulation of ciliary dynamics has been linked with ciliopathies and other human diseases. The cilium undergoes cell-cycle-dependent assembly and disassembly, with ciliary resorption linked with G1-S transition and cell-fate choice. In the resting cell, the cilium remains sensitive to environmental cues for remodeling during tissue homeostasis and repair. Recent findings further reveal an interplay between the cilium and extracellular vesicles and identify bioactive cilium-derived vesicles, posing a previously unrecognized role of cilia for sending signals. The photoreceptor outer segment is a notable dynamic cilium. A recently discovered protein transport mechanism in photoreceptors maintains light-regulated homeostasis of ciliary length.","481":null,"482":null,"483":"Development of skeletal muscle is a multistage process that includes lineage commitment of multipotent progenitor cells, differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myofibers, and maturation of myofibers into distinct types. Lineage-specific transcriptional regulation lies at the core of this process, but myogenesis is also regulated by extracellular cues. Some of these cues are initiated by direct cell-cell contact between muscle precursor cells themselves or between muscle precursors and cells of other lineages. Examples of the latter include interaction of migrating neural crest cells with multipotent muscle progenitor cells, muscle interstitial cells with myoblasts, and neurons with myofibers. Among the signaling factors involved are Notch ligands and receptors, cadherins, Ig superfamily members, and Ephrins and Eph receptors. In this article we describe recent progress in this area and highlight open questions raised by the findings.","484":"Fertilization is exceptionally complex and, depending on the species, happens in entirely different environments. External fertilizers in aquatic habitats, like marine invertebrates or fish, release their gametes into the seawater or freshwater, whereas sperm from most internal fertilizers like mammals cross the female genital tract to make their way to the egg. Various chemical and physical cues guide sperm to the egg. Quite generally, these cues enable signaling pathways that ultimately evoke a cellular Ca2+ response that modulates the waveform of the flagellar beat and, hence, the swimming path. To cope with the panoply of challenges to reach and fertilize the egg, sperm from different species have developed their own unique repertoire of signaling molecules and mechanisms. Here, we review the differences and commonalities for sperm sensory signaling in marine invertebrates (sea urchin), fish (zebrafish), and mammals (mouse, human).","485":null,"486":"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the principal circadian clock of the brain, directing daily cycles of behavior and physiology. SCN neurons contain a cell-autonomous transcription-based clockwork but, in turn, circuit-level interactions synchronize the 20,000 or so SCN neurons into a robust and coherent daily timer. Synchronization requires neuropeptide signaling, regulated by a reciprocal interdependence between the molecular clockwork and rhythmic electrical activity, which in turn depends on a daytime Na+ drive and nighttime K+ drag. Recent studies exploiting intersectional genetics have started to identify the pacemaking roles of particular neuronal groups in the SCN. They support the idea that timekeeping involves nonlinear and hierarchical computations that create and incorporate timing information through the interactions between key groups of neurons within the SCN circuit. The field is now poised to elucidate these computations, their underlying cellular mechanisms, and how the SCN clock interacts with subordinate circadian clocks across the brain to determine the timing and efficiency of the sleep-wake cycle, and how perturbations of this coherence contribute to neurological and psychiatric illness.","487":"A variety of intermediate filament (IF) types show intricate association with plasma membrane proteins, including receptors and adhesion molecules. The molecular basis of linkage of IFs to desmosomes at sites of cell-cell interaction and hemidesmosomes at sites of cell-matrix adhesion has been elucidated and involves IF-associated proteins. However, IFs also interact with focal adhesions and cell-surface molecules, including dystroglycan. Through such membrane interactions, it is well accepted that IFs play important roles in the establishment and maintenance of tissue integrity. However, by organizing cell-surface complexes, IFs likely regulate, albeit indirectly, signaling pathways that are key to tissue homeostasis and repair.","488":"The chemical synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides and their assembly into synthons, genes, circuits, and even entire genomes by gene synthesis methods has become an enabling technology for modern molecular biology and enables the design, build, test, learn, and repeat cycle underpinning innovations in synthetic biology. In this perspective, we briefly review the techniques and technologies that enable the synthesis of DNA oligonucleotides and their assembly into larger DNA constructs with a focus on recent advancements that have sought to reduce synthesis cost and increase sequence fidelity. The development of lower-cost methods to produce high-quality synthetic DNA will allow for the exploration of larger biological hypotheses by lowering the cost of use and help to close the DNA read-write cost gap.","489":"Prions are proteins that can adopt self-perpetuating conformations and are traditionally regarded as etiological agents of infectious neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, and transmissible encephalopathies. More recently, a growing consensus has emerged that prion-like, self-templating mechanisms also underlie a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Perhaps most surprising, not all prion-like aggregates are associated with pathological changes. There are now several examples of prion-like proteins in mammals that serve positive biological functions in their aggregated state. In this review, we discuss functional prions in the nervous system, with particular emphasis on the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) and the role of its prion-like aggregates in synaptic plasticity and memory. We also mention a more recent example of a functional prion-like protein in the brain, TIA-1, and its role during stress. These studies of functional prion-like proteins have provided a number of generalizable insights on how prion-based protein switches may operate to serve physiological functions in higher eukaryotes.","490":"SUMMARYCell division-cytokinesis-involves large-scale rearrangements of the entire cell. Primarily driven by cytoskeletal proteins, cytokinesis also depends on topological rearrangements of the plasma membrane, which are coordinated with nuclear division in both space and time. Despite the fundamental nature of the process, different types of eukaryotic cells show variations in both the structural mechanisms of cytokinesis and the regulatory controls. In animal cells and fungi, a contractile actomyosin-based structure plays a central, albeit flexible, role. Here, the underlying molecular mechanisms are summarized and integrated and common themes are highlighted.","491":"Tubulin undergoes several highly conserved posttranslational modifications (PTMs) including acetylation, detyrosination, glutamylation, and glycylation. These PTMs accumulate on a subset of microtubules that are long-lived, including those in the basal bodies and axonemes. Tubulin PTMs are distributed nonuniformly. In the outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme, the B-tubules are highly enriched in the detyrosinated, polyglutamylated, and polyglycylated tubulin, whereas the A-tubules contain mostly unmodified tubulin. The nonuniform patterns of tubulin PTMs may functionalize microtubules in a position-dependent manner. Recent studies indicate that tubulin PTMs contribute to the assembly, disassembly, maintenance, and motility of cilia. In particular, tubulin glutamylation has emerged as a key PTM that affects ciliary motility through regulation of axonemal dynein arms and controls the stability and length of the axoneme.","492":"Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that are traditionally regarded as agents of neurodegenerative disease in animals. However, it has become evident that prion-like aggregation of endogenous proteins can also occur under normal physiological conditions (e.g., during memory storage or activation of the immune response). In this review, we focus on the functional prion-related protein TIA-1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism but is best understood in terms of its role in stress granule assembly during the cellular stress response. We propose that stress granule formation provides a useful conceptual framework with which to address the positive role of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation. Elucidating the function of TIA-1 prion-like aggregation will advance our understanding of how prion-based molecular switches are used in normal physiological settings.","493":"The transplantation of cells and organs has an extensive history, with blood transfusion and skin grafts described as some of the earliest medical interventions. The speed and efficiency of the human immune system evolved to rapidly recognize and remove pathogens; the human immune system also serves as a barrier against the transplant of cells and organs from even highly related donors. Although this shows the remarkable effectiveness of the immune system, the engineering of cells and organs that will survive in a host patient over the long term remains a steep challenge. Progress in the understanding of host immune responses to donor cells and organs, combined with the rapid advancement in synthetic biology applications, allows the rational engineering of more effective solutions for transplantation.","494":"Directional fluid flow is an essential process for embryo development as well as for organ and organism homeostasis. Here, we review the diverse structure of various organ-blood barriers, the driving forces, transporters, and polarity mechanisms that regulate fluid transport across them, focusing on kidney-, eye-, and brain-blood barriers. We end by discussing how cross talk between barrier epithelial and endothelial cells, perivascular cells, and basement membrane signaling contribute to generate and maintain organ-blood barriers.","495":"Propulsive forces generated by cilia and flagella are used in events that are critical for the thriving of diverse eukaryotic organisms in their environments. Despite distinctive strokes and regulations, the majority of them adopt the 9+2 axoneme that is believed to exist in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Only a few outliers have opted for a simpler format that forsakes the signature radial spokes and the central pair apparatus, although both are unnecessary for force generation or rhythmicity. Extensive evidence has shown that they operate as an integral system for motility control. Recent studies have made remarkable progress on the radial spoke. This review will trace how the new structural, compositional, and evolutional insights pose significant implications on flagella biology and, conversely, ciliopathy.","496":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia among the elderly population. The good correlation between the density and neocortical spread of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and the severity of cognitive impairment offers an opportunity to use a noninvasive imaging technique such as positron emission tomography (PET) for early diagnosis and staging of the disease. PET imaging of NFTs holds promise not only as a diagnostic tool but also because it may enable the development of disease-modifying therapeutics for AD. In this review, we focus on the structural diversity of tau PET tracers, the challenges related to identifying high-affinity and highly selective NFT ligands, and recent progress in the clinical development of tau PET radioligands.","497":"Neurodegenerative dementias are clinically heterogeneous, progressive diseases with frequently overlapping symptoms, such as cognitive impairments and behavior and movement deficits. Although a majority of cases appear to be sporadic, there is a large genetic component that has yet to be fully explained. Here, we review the recent genetic and genomic findings pertaining to Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and prion dementia. In this review, we describe causal and susceptibility genes identified for these dementias and discuss recent research pertaining to the molecular function of these genes. Of particular interest, there is a large overlap in clinical phenotypes, genes, and\/or aggregating protein products involved in these diseases, as well as frequent comorbid presentation, indicating that these dementias may represent a continuum of syndromes rather than individual diseases.","498":null,"499":"Mammals have evolved an internal timing system, the circadian clock, which synchronizes physiology and behavior to the daily light and dark cycles of the Earth. The master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, takes fluctuating light input from the retina and synchronizes other tissues to the same internal rhythm. The molecular clocks that drive these circadian rhythms are ticking in nearly all cells in the body. Efforts in systems chronobiology are now being directed at understanding, on a comprehensive scale, how the circadian clock controls different layers of gene regulation to provide robust timing cues at the cellular and tissue level. In this review, we introduce some basic concepts underlying periodicity of gene regulation, and then highlight recent genome-wide investigations on the propagation of rhythms across multiple regulatory layers in mammals, all the way from chromatin conformation to protein accumulation.","500":null,"501":"The centrosome acts as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) from the G1 to G2 phases of the cell cycle; it can mature into a spindle pole during mitosis and\/or transition into a cilium by elongating microtubules (MTs) from the basal body on cell differentiation or cell cycle arrest. New studies hint that the centrosome functions in more than MT organization. For instance, it has recently been shown that a specific substructure of the centrosome-the mother centriole appendages-are required for the recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane. This alone could have important implications for a renaissance in our understanding of the development of primary cilia, endosome recycling, and the immune response. Here, we review newly identified roles for the centrosome in directing membrane traffic, the immunological synapse, and the stress response.","502":"Targeted nucleases have provided researchers with the ability to manipulate virtually any genomic sequence, enabling the facile creation of isogenic cell lines and animal models for the study of human disease, and promoting exciting new possibilities for human gene therapy. Here we review three foundational technologies-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs). We discuss the engineering advances that facilitated their development and highlight several achievements in genome engineering that were made possible by these tools. We also consider artificial transcription factors, illustrating how this technology can complement targeted nucleases for synthetic biology and gene therapy.","503":null,"504":"It has been a decade since it was discovered that primary cilia have an essential role in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in mammals. This discovery came from screens in the mouse that identified a set of genes that are required for both normal Hh signaling and for the formation of primary cilia. Since then, dozens of mouse mutations have been identified that disrupt cilia in a variety of ways and have complex effects on Hedgehog signaling. Here, we summarize the genetic and developmental studies used to deduce how Hedgehog signal transduction is linked to cilia and the complex effects that perturbation of cilia structure can have on Hh signaling. We conclude by describing the current status of our understanding of the cell-type-specific regulation of ciliogenesis and how that determines the ability of cells to respond to Hedgehog ligands.","505":"The innate immune system relies on receptors that sense common signs of infection to trigger a robust host-defense response. Receptors such as RIG-I and NLRP3 activate downstream adaptors mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), respectively, to propagate immune and inflammatory signaling. Recent studies have indicated that both MAVS and ASC form functional prion-like polymers to propagate immune signaling. Here, we summarize the biochemical, genetic, and structural studies that characterize the prion-like behavior of MAVS and ASC in their respective signaling pathways. We then discuss prion-like polymerization as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of signal transduction in innate immunity in light of the similarity between the NLRP3-ASC, the NLRP3-ASC pathway in mammals, and the NWD2-HET-s pathway in fungi. We conclude by outlining the unique advantages to signaling through functional prions and potential future directions in the field.","506":"Maintaining functional protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a constant challenge in the face of limited protein-folding capacity, environmental threats, and aging. Cells have developed several quality-control mechanisms that assist nascent polypeptides to fold properly, clear misfolded molecules, respond to the accumulation of protein aggregates, and deposit potentially toxic conformers in designated sites. Proteostasis collapse can lead to the development of diseases known as proteinopathies. Here we delineate the current knowledge on the different layers of protein quality-control mechanisms at the organelle and cellular levels with an emphasis on the prion protein (PrP). We also describe how protein quality control is integrated at the organismal level and discuss future perspectives on utilizing proteostasis maintenance as a strategy to develop novel therapies for the treatment of proteinopathies.","507":"Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is the primary innate defense mechanism of the lung. The functional components are the protective mucous layer, the airway surface liquid layer, and the cilia on the surface of ciliated cells. The cilia are specialized organelles that beat in metachronal waves to propel pathogens and inhaled particles trapped in the mucous layer out of the airways. In health this clearance mechanism is effective, but in patients with primary cilia dyskinesia (PCD) the cilia are abnormal, resulting in deficient MCC and chronic lung disease. This demonstrates the critical importance of the cilia for human health. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the components of the MCC apparatus, focusing on the role of cilia in MCC.","508":null,"509":"Most transcription factors and RNA regulatory proteins encoded by eukaryotic genomes ranging from yeast to humans contain polypeptide domains variously described as intrinsically disordered, prion-like, or of low complexity (LC). These LC domains exist in an unfolded state when DNA and RNA regulatory proteins are studied in biochemical isolation from cells. Upon incubation in the purified state, many of these LC domains polymerize into homogeneous, labile amyloid-like fibers. Here, we consider several lines of evidence that may favor biologic utility for LC domain polymers.","510":null,"511":"Prions are alternatively folded, self-perpetuating protein isoforms involved in a variety of biological and pathological processes. Yeast prions are protein-based heritable elements that serve as an excellent experimental system for studying prion biology. The propagation of yeast prions is controlled by the same Hsp104\/70\/40 chaperone machinery that is involved in the protection of yeast cells against proteotoxic stress. Ribosome-associated chaperones, proteolytic pathways, cellular quality-control compartments, and cytoskeletal networks influence prion formation, maintenance, and toxicity. Environmental stresses lead to asymmetric prion distribution in cell divisions. Chaperones and cytoskeletal proteins mediate this effect. Overall, this is an intimate relationship with the protein quality-control machinery of the cell, which enables prions to be maintained and reproduced. The presence of many of these same mechanisms in higher eukaryotes has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of mammalian amyloid diseases.","512":null,"513":"In its \"grand challenge\" format in chemistry, \"synthesis\" as an activity sets out a goal that is substantially beyond current theoretical and technological capabilities. In pursuit of this goal, scientists are forced across uncharted territory, where they must answer unscripted questions and solve unscripted problems, creating new theories and new technologies in ways that would not be created by hypothesis-directed research. Thus, synthesis drives discovery and paradigm changes in ways that analysis cannot. Described here are the products that have arisen so far through the pursuit of one grand challenge in synthetic biology: Recreate the genetics, catalysis, evolution, and adaptation that we value in life, but using genetic and catalytic biopolymers different from those that have been delivered to us by natural history on Earth. The outcomes in technology include new diagnostic tools that have helped personalize the care of hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide. In science, the effort has generated a fundamentally different view of DNA, RNA, and how they work.","514":null,"515":null,"516":"Axonemal dyneins form the inner and outer rows of arms associated with the doublet microtubules of motile cilia. These enzymes convert the chemical energy released from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis into mechanical work by causing the doublets to slide with respect to each other. Dyneins form two major groups based on the number of heavy-chain motors within each complex. In addition, these enzymes contain other components that are required for assembly of the complete particles and\/or for the regulation of motor function in response to phosphorylations status, ligands such as Ca2+, changes in cellular redox state and which also apparently monitor and respond to the mechanical state or curvature in which any given motor finds itself. It is this latter property, which is thought to result in waves of motor function propagating along the axoneme length. Here, I briefly describe our current understanding of axonemal dynein structure, assembly, and organization.","517":"This review highlights state-of-the-art procedures for heterologous small-molecule biosynthesis, the associated bottlenecks, and new strategies that have the potential to accelerate future accomplishments in metabolic engineering. We emphasize that a combination of different approaches over multiple time and size scales must be considered for successful pathway engineering in a heterologous host. We have classified these optimization procedures based on the \"system\" that is being manipulated: transcriptome, translatome, proteome, or reactome. By bridging multiple disciplines, including molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and computational sciences, we can create an integral framework for the discovery and implementation of novel biosynthetic production routes.","518":null,"519":"Nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC) are a group of inherited diseases that affect genes encoding proteins that localize to primary cilia or centrosomes. With few exceptions, ciliopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and affected individuals manifest early during childhood or adolescence. NPHP-RC are genetically very heterogeneous, and, currently, mutations in more than 90 genes have been described as single-gene causes. The phenotypes of NPHP-RC are very diverse, and include cystic-fibrotic kidney disease, brain developmental defects, retinal degeneration, skeletal deformities, facial dimorphism, and, in some cases, laterality defects, and congenital heart disease. Mutations in the same gene can give rise to diverse phenotypes depending on the mutated allele. At the same time, there is broad phenotypic overlap between different monogenic genes. The identification of monogenic causes of ciliopathies has furthered the understanding of molecular mechanism and cellular pathways involved in the pathogenesis.","520":null,"521":"Cilia are plasma membrane protrusions that act as cellular propellers or antennae. To perform these functions, cilia must maintain a composition distinct from those of the contiguous cytosol and plasma membrane. The specialized composition of the cilium depends on the ciliary gate, the region at the ciliary base separating the cilium from the rest of the cell. The ciliary gate's main structural features are electron dense struts connecting microtubules to the adjacent membrane. These structures include the transition fibers, which connect the distal basal body to the base of the ciliary membrane, and the Y-links, which connect the proximal axoneme and ciliary membrane within the transition zone. Both transition fibers and Y-links form early during ciliogenesis and play key roles in ciliary assembly and trafficking. Accordingly, many human ciliopathies are caused by mutations that perturb ciliary gate function.","522":"The motile cilium is a complex organelle that is typically comprised of a 9+2 microtubule skeleton; nine doublet microtubules surrounding a pair of central singlet microtubules. Like the doublet microtubules, the central microtubules form a scaffold for the assembly of protein complexes forming an intricate network of interconnected projections. The central microtubules and associated structures are collectively referred to as the central apparatus (CA). Studies using a variety of experimental approaches and model organisms have led to the discovery of a number of highly conserved protein complexes, unprecedented high-resolution views of projection structure, and new insights into regulation of dynein-driven microtubule sliding. Here, we review recent progress in defining mechanisms for the assembly and function of the CA and include possible implications for the importance of the CA in human health.","523":"Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) technologies have enabled inexpensive and rapid recombinant protein expression. Numerous highly active CFPS platforms are now available and have recently been used for synthetic biology applications. In this review, we focus on the ability of CFPS to expand our understanding of biological systems and its applications in the synthetic biology field. First, we outline a variety of CFPS platforms that provide alternative and complementary methods for expressing proteins from different organisms, compared with in vivo approaches. Next, we review the types of proteins, protein complexes, and protein modifications that have been achieved using CFPS systems. Finally, we introduce recent work on genetic networks in cell-free systems and the use of cell-free systems for rapid prototyping of in vivo networks. Given the flexibility of cell-free systems, CFPS holds promise to be a powerful tool for synthetic biology as well as a protein production technology in years to come.","524":null,"525":"Stress-signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved and play an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis. These pathways are also critical for adaptation to new cellular environments. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by biosynthetic stress and leads to a compensatory increase in ER function. The JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways control adaptive responses to intracellular and extracellular stresses, including environmental changes such as UV light, heat, and hyperosmotic conditions, and exposure to inflammatory cytokines. Metabolic stress caused by a high-fat diet represents an example of a stimulus that coordinately activates both the UPR and JNK\/p38 signaling pathways. Chronic activation of these stress-response pathways ultimately causes metabolic changes associated with obesity and altered insulin sensitivity. Stress-signaling pathways, therefore, represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention in the metabolic stress response and other disease processes.","526":"Anton van Leeuwenhoek's startling microscopic observations in the 1600s first stimulated fascination with the way that cells use cilia to generate currents and to swim in a fluid environment. Research in recent decades has yielded deep knowledge about the mechanical and biochemical nature of these organelles but only opened a greater fascination about how such beautifully intricate and multifunctional structures arose during evolution. Answers to this evolutionary puzzle are not only sought to satisfy basic curiosity, but also, as stated so eloquently by Dobzhansky (Am Zool 4: 443 [1964]), because \"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\" Here I attempt to summarize current knowledge of what ciliary organelles of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) were like, explore the ways in which cilia have evolved since that time, and speculate on the selective processes that might have generated these organelles during early eukaryotic evolution.","527":"The plant circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate the predictable changes in the environment by adjusting their developmental and physiological traits. In the last few years, it was determined that responses known to be regulated by the oscillator are also able to modulate clock performance. These feedback loops and their multilayer communications create a complex web, and confer on the clock network a role that exceeds the measurement of time. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge of the wiring of the clock, including the interplay with metabolism, hormone, and stress pathways in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana We outline the importance of this system in crop agricultural traits, highlighting the identification of natural alleles that alter the pace of the timekeeper. We report evidence supporting the understanding of the circadian clock as a master regulator of plant life, and we hypothesize on its relevant role in the adaptability to the environment and the impact on the fitness of most organisms.","528":null,"529":null,"530":"The axoneme is the main extracellular part of cilia and flagella in eukaryotes. It consists of a microtubule cytoskeleton, which normally comprises nine doublets. In motile cilia, dynein ATPase motor proteins generate sliding motions between adjacent microtubules, which are integrated into a well-orchestrated beating or rotational motion. In primary cilia, there are a number of sensory proteins functioning on membranes surrounding the axoneme. In both cases, as the study of proteomics has elucidated, hundreds of proteins exist in this compartmentalized biomolecular system. In this article, we review the recent progress of structural studies of the axoneme and its components using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, mainly focusing on motile cilia. Structural biology presents snapshots (but not live imaging) of dynamic structural change and gives insights into the force generation mechanism of dynein, ciliary bending mechanism, ciliogenesis, and evolution of the axoneme.","531":"SUMMARYAll eukaryotic cells prepare for cell division by forming a \"mitotic spindle\"-a bipolar machine made from microtubules (MTs) and many associated proteins. This device organizes the already duplicated DNA so one copy of each chromosome attaches to each end of the spindle. Both formation and function of the spindle require controlled MT dynamics, as well as the actions of multiple motor enzymes. Spindle-driven motions separate the duplicated chromosomes into two distinct sets that are then moved toward opposite ends of the cell. The two cells that subsequently form by cytokinesis, therefore, contain all the genes needed to grow and divide again. ","532":"Many animal cells assemble single cilia involved in motile and\/or sensory functions. In contrast, multiciliated cells (MCCs) assemble up to 300 motile cilia that beat in a coordinate fashion to generate a directional fluid flow. In the human airways, the brain, and the oviduct, MCCs allow mucus clearance, cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and egg transportation, respectively. Impairment of MCC function leads to chronic respiratory infections and increased risks of hydrocephalus and female infertility. MCC differentiation during development or repair involves the activation of a regulatory cascade triggered by the inhibition of Notch activity in MCC progenitors. The downstream events include the simultaneous assembly of a large number of basal bodies (BBs)-from which cilia are nucleated-in the cytoplasm of the differentiating MCCs, their migration and docking at the plasma membrane associated to an important remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and the assembly and polarization of motile cilia. The direction of ciliary beating is coordinated both within cells and at the tissue level by a combination of planar polarity cues affecting BB position and hydrodynamic forces that are both generated and sensed by the cilia. Herein, we review the mechanisms controlling the specification and differentiation of MCCs and BB assembly and organization at the apical surface, as well as ciliary assembly and coordination in MCCs.","533":"Prion diseases are disorders that share several characteristics that are typical of many neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, several studies have extended the prion concept to pathological aggregation in malignant tumors involving misfolded p53, a tumor-suppressor protein. The aggregation of p53 and its coaggregation with p53 family members, p63 and p73, have been shown. Certain p53 mutants exert a dominant-negative regulatory effect on wild-type (WT) p53. The basis for this dominant-negative effect is that amyloid-like mutant p53 converts WT p53 into an aggregated species, leading to a gain-of-function (GoF) phenotype and the loss of its tumor-suppressor function. Recently, it was shown that p53 aggregates can be internalized by cells and can coaggregate with endogenous p53, corroborating the prion-like properties of p53 aggregates. The prion-like behavior of oncogenic p53 mutants provides an explanation for its dominant-negative and GoF properties, including the high metastatic potential of cancer cells carrying p53 mutations. The inhibition of p53 aggregation appears to represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention in patients with malignant tumors.","534":"The diversity and natural modularity of their biosynthetic pathways has turned natural products into attractive, but challenging, targets for synthetic biology approaches. Here, we discuss the current state of the field, highlighting recent advances and remaining bottlenecks. Global genomic assessments of natural product biosynthetic capacities across large parts of microbial diversity provide a first survey of the available natural parts libraries and identify evolutionary design rules for further engineering. Methods for compound and pathway detection and characterization are developed increasingly on the basis of synthetic biology tools, contributing to an accelerated translation of genomic information into usable building blocks for pathway assembly. A wide range of methods is also becoming available for accessing ever larger parts of chemical space by rational diversification of natural products, guided by rapid progress in our understanding of the underlying biochemistry and enzymatic mechanisms. Enhanced genome assembly and editing tools, adapted to the needs of natural products research, facilitate the realization of ambitious engineering strategies, ranging from combinatorial library generation to high-throughput optimization of product titers. Together, these tools and concepts contribute to the emergence of a new generation of revitalized natural product research.","535":null,"536":"Second messengers are small molecules and ions that relay signals received by cell-surface receptors to effector proteins. They include a wide variety of chemical species and have diverse properties that allow them to signal within membranes (e.g., hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and lipid derivatives), within the cytosol (e.g., polar molecules such as nucleotides and ions), or between the two (e.g., gases and free radicals). Second messengers are typically present at low concentrations in resting cells and can be rapidly produced or released when cells are stimulated. The levels of second messengers are exquisitely controlled temporally and spatially, and, during signaling, enzymatic reactions or opening of ion channels ensure that they are highly amplified. These messengers then diffuse rapidly from the source and bind to target proteins to alter their properties (activity, localization, stability, etc.) to propagate signaling.","537":null,"538":"For more than a century, bacteriophage (or phage) research has enabled some of the most important discoveries in biological sciences and has equipped scientists with many of the molecular biology tools that have advanced our understanding of replication, maintenance, and expression of genetic material. Phages have also been recognized and exploited as natural antimicrobial agents and nanovectors for gene therapy, but their potential as therapeutics has not been fully exploited in Western medicine because of challenges such as narrow host range, bacterial resistance, and unique pharmacokinetics. However, increasing concern related to the emergence of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics has heightened interest in phage therapy and the development of strategies to overcome hurdles associated with bacteriophage therapeutics. Recent progress in sequencing technologies, DNA manipulation, and synthetic biology allowed scientists to refactor the entire bacterial genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, thereby creating the first synthetic cell. These new strategies for engineering genomes may have the potential to accelerate the construction of designer phage genomes with superior therapeutic potential. Here, we discuss the use of phage as therapeutics, as well as how synthetic biology can create bacteriophage with desirable attributes.","539":null,"540":null,"541":"The ability to site-specifically incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) with novel structures into proteins in living cells affords a powerful tool to investigate and manipulate protein structure and function.

In this review, recent advances in the technology and its application to problems in protein biochemistry, cellular biology, and medicine are highlighted. ","542":null,"543":"DNA and histone modifications, together with constraints imposed by nuclear architecture, contribute to the transcriptional regulatory landscape of the nervous system. Here, we provide select examples showing how these regulatory layers, often referred to as epigenetic, contribute to neuronal differentiation and function. We describe the interplay between DNA methylation and Polycomb-mediated repression during neuronal differentiation, the role of DNA methylation and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions in Protocadherin promoter choice, and the contribution of heterochromatic silencing and nuclear organization in singular olfactory receptor expression. Finally, we explain how the activity-dependent expression of a histone variant determines the longevity of olfactory sensory neurons.","544":"Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved organelles that protrude from the cell surface. The unique location and properties of cilia allow them to function in vital processes such as motility and signaling. Ciliary assembly and maintenance rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bidirectional movement of a multicomponent transport system between the ciliary base and tip. Since its initial discovery more than two decades ago, considerable effort has been invested in dissecting the molecular mechanisms of IFT in a variety of model organisms. Importantly, IFT was shown to be essential for mammalian development, and defects in this process cause a number of human pathologies known as ciliopathies. Here, we review current knowledge of IFT with a particular emphasis on the IFT machinery and specific mechanisms of ciliary cargo recognition and transport.","545":"The [Het-s] prion of the fungus Podospora anserina is a well-studied model system to elucidate the action of prions and beyond. The [Het-s] prion works as an activation trigger of a cell death execution protein termed HET-S. Amyloid transconformation of the prion-forming region of HET-S induces activation of its pore-forming cell death execution HeLo domain. The prion motif functions in a signal transduction process by which a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor termed NWD2 controls the HET-S cell death effector. This prion motif thus corresponds to a functional amyloid motif, allowing a conformational crosstalk between homologous motif domains in signal transduction processes that appears to be widespread from the fungal to the mammalian animal kingdoms. This review aims to establish a structure-activity relationship of the HET-S\/s prion system and sets it in the context of its wider biological significance.

In reality, the organization of biological molecules has profound effects on cellular function: not only metabolic, but also physical and mechanical. Here, we discuss a variety of perturbations available to biologists in controlling protein, nucleotide, and membrane localization. These range from simple tags, fusions, and scaffolds to heterologous expression of compartments and other structures that confer unique physical properties to cells. Next, we relate these principles to those guiding the spatial environments outside of cells such as the extracellular matrix. Finally, we discuss new directions in building intercellular organizations to create novel symbioses.","549":"Throughout biology, function is intimately linked with form. Across scales ranging from subcellular to multiorganismal, the identity and organization of a biological structure's subunits dictate its properties. The field of molecular morphogenesis has traditionally been concerned with describing these links, decoding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to the shape and structure of cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. Recent advances in synthetic biology promise unprecedented control over these molecular mechanisms; this opens the path to not just probing morphogenesis but directing it. This review explores several frontiers in the nascent field of synthetic morphogenesis, including programmable tissues and organs, synthetic biomaterials and programmable matter, and engineering complex morphogenic systems de novo. We will discuss each frontier's objectives, current approaches, constraints and challenges, and future potential.

Changes in protein level, protein localization, protein activity, and protein-protein interactions are critical aspects of signal transduction, allowing cells to respond highly specifically to a nearly limitless set of cues and also to vary the sensitivity, duration, and dynamics of the response. Signal-dependent changes in levels of gene expression and protein synthesis play an important role in regulation of protein levels, whereas posttranslational modifications of proteins regulate their degradation, localization, and functional interactions. Protein ubiquitylation, for example, can direct proteins to the proteasome for degradation or provide a signal that regulates their interactions and\/or location within the cell. Similarly, protein phosphorylation by specific kinases is a key mechanism for augmenting protein activity and relaying signals to other proteins that possess domains that recognize the phosphorylated residues. ","554":"Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain is often viewed as a continuation of neurogenesis at earlier, developmental stages. Here, we will critically review the extent to which this is the case highlighting similarities as well as key differences. Although many transcriptional regulators are shared in neurogenesis at embryonic and adult stages, recent findings on the molecular mechanisms by which these neuronal fate determinants control fate acquisition and maintenance have revealed profound differences between development and adulthood. Importantly, adult neurogenesis occurs in a gliogenic environment, hence requiring adult-specific additional and unique mechanisms of neuronal fate specification and maintenance. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular logic for continuous adult neurogenesis provides important clues to develop strategies to manipulate endogenous stem cells for the purpose of repair.","555":"Most organisms use their olfactory system to detect and analyze chemical cues from the external world to guide essential behaviors. From worms to vertebrates, chemicals are detected by odorant receptors expressed by olfactory sensory neurons, which in vertebrates send an axon to the primary processing center called the olfactory bulb (OB). Within the OB, sensory neurons form excitatory synapses with projection neurons and with inhibitory interneurons. Thus, because of complex synaptic interactions, the output of a given projection neuron is determined not only by the sensory input, but also by the activity of local inhibitory interneurons that are regenerated throughout life in the process of adult neurogenesis. Herein, we discuss how it is optimized and why.","556":"SUMMARYEpigenetic changes are present in all human cancers and are now known to cooperate with genetic alterations to drive the cancer phenotype. These changes involve DNA methylation, histone modifiers and readers, chromatin remodelers, microRNAs, and other components of chromatin. Cancer genetics and epigenetics are inextricably linked in generating the malignant phenotype; epigenetic changes can cause mutations in genes, and, conversely, mutations are frequently observed in genes that modify the epigenome. Epigenetic therapies, in which the goal is to reverse these changes, are now one standard of care for a preleukemic disorder and form of lymphoma. The application of epigenetic therapies in the treatment of solid tumors is also emerging as a viable therapeutic route. ","557":"Synthetic gene switches are basic building blocks for the construction of complex gene circuits that transform mammalian cells into useful cell-based machines for next-generation biotechnological and biomedical applications. Ligand-responsive gene switches are cellular sensors that are able to process specific signals to generate gene product responses. Their involvement in complex gene circuits results in sophisticated circuit topologies that are reminiscent of electronics and that are capable of providing engineered cells with the ability to memorize events, oscillate protein production, and perform complex information-processing tasks. Microencapsulated mammalian cells that are engineered with closed-loop gene networks can be implanted into mice to sense disease-related input signals and to process this information to produce a custom, fine-tuned therapeutic response that rebalances animal metabolism. Progress in gene circuit design, in combination with recent breakthroughs in genome engineering, may result in tailored engineered mammalian cells with great potential for future cell-based therapies.","558":"The cellular basis of adult neurogenesis is neural stem cells residing in restricted areas of the adult brain. These cells self-renew and are multipotent. The maintenance of \"stemness\" and commitment to differentiation are tightly controlled by intricate molecular networks. Epigenetic mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), have profound regulatory roles in mammalian gene expression. Significant advances have been made regarding the dynamic roles of epigenetic modulation and function. It has become evident that epigenetic regulators are key players in neural-stem-cell self-renewal, fate specification, and final maturation of new neurons, therefore, adult neurogenesis. Altered epigenetic regulation can result in a number of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we review recent discoveries that advance our knowledge in epigenetic regulation of mammalian neural stem cells and neurogenesis. Insights from studies of epigenetic gene regulation in neurogenesis may lead to new therapies for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.","559":"The adult mammalian brain is a dynamic structure, capable of remodeling in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli. One dramatic example of brain plasticity is the birth and subsequent integration of newborn neurons into the existing circuitry. This process, termed adult neurogenesis, recapitulates neural developmental events in two specialized adult brain regions: the lateral ventricles of the forebrain. Recent studies have begun to delineate how the existing neuronal circuits influence the dynamic process of adult neurogenesis, from activation of quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) to the integration and survival of newborn neurons. Here, we review recent progress toward understanding the circuit-based regulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.","560":"Voltage-gated potassium channels play a fundamental role in the generation and propagation of the action potential. The discovery of these channels began with predictions made by early pioneers, and has culminated in their extensive functional and structural characterization by electrophysiological, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies. With the aid of a variety of crystal structures of these channels, a highly detailed picture emerges of how the voltage-sensing domain reports changes in the membrane electric field and couples this to conformational changes in the activation gate. In addition, high-resolution structural and functional studies of K(+) channel pores, such as KcsA and MthK, offer a comprehensive picture on how selectivity is achieved in K(+) channels. Here, we illustrate the remarkable features of voltage-gated potassium channels and explain the mechanisms used by these machines with experimental data. ","561":null,"562":"The genome is subject to a diverse array of epigenetic modifications from DNA methylation to histone posttranslational changes. Many of these marks are somatically stable through cell division. This article focuses on our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the inheritance of epigenetic marks, particularly, repressive ones, when the DNA and chromatin template are duplicated in S phase. This involves the action of histone chaperones, nucleosome-remodeling enzymes, histone and DNA methylation binding proteins, and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Last, the timing of DNA replication is discussed, including the question of whether this constitutes an epigenetic mark that facilitates the propagation of epigenetic marks.","563":"Neural stem\/progenitor cells (NSPCs) retain their ability to generate newborn neurons throughout life in the mammalian brain. Here, we describe how recently developed virus- and transgenesis-based techniques will help us (1) to understand the functional effects of neurogenesis in health and disease, (2) to design novel approaches to harness the potential for NSPC-associated endogenous repair, and (3) to induce the generation of neurons outside the main neurogenic niches in the adult brain. ","564":"The pervasive nature of bacterial recombination has become clear. Despite this, the population genetics of bacteria persist in being viewed as simple. Here, I argue against that characterization. After summarizing the history of the topic, I survey the evidence for remarkable and unexplained variation in recombination rate among and within bacterial species. I finally argue that despite recent assertions that recombination means bacterial genes are \"public goods,\" in bacteria the level of selection is the gene, and genes can be understood to have niches with dimensions including the other contents of the genome in which they find themselves.","565":"A large population of neural stem\/precursor cells (NSCs) persists in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) located in the walls of the lateral brain ventricles. V-SVZ NSCs produce large numbers of neuroblasts that migrate a long distance into the olfactory bulb (OB) where they differentiate into local circuit interneurons. Here, we review a broad range of discoveries that have emerged from studies of postnatal V-SVZ neurogenesis: the identification of NSCs as a subpopulation of astroglial cells, the neurogenic lineage, new mechanisms of neuronal migration, and molecular regulators of precursor cell proliferation and migration. It has also become evident that V-SVZ NSCs are regionally heterogeneous, with NSCs located in different regions of the ventricle wall generating distinct OB interneuron subtypes. Insights into the developmental origins and molecular mechanisms that underlie the regional specification of V-SVZ NSCs have also begun to emerge. Other recent studies have revealed new cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms that enable lifelong neurogenesis in the V-SVZ. Finally, we discuss intriguing differences between the rodent V-SVZ and the corresponding human brain region. The rapidly expanding cellular and molecular knowledge of V-SVZ NSC biology provides key insights into postnatal neural development, the origin of brain tumors, and may inform the development regenerative therapies from cultured and endogenous human neural precursors. ","566":"During long-term memory formation, cellular and molecular processes reshape how individual neurons respond to specific patterns of synaptic input. It remains poorly understood how such changes impact information processing across networks of mammalian neurons. To observe how networks encode, store, and retrieve information, neuroscientists must track the dynamics of large ensembles of individual cells in behaving animals, over timescales commensurate with long-term memory. Fluorescence Ca(2+)-imaging techniques can monitor hundreds of neurons in behaving mice, opening exciting avenues for studies of learning and memory at the network level. Genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators allow neurons to be targeted by genetic type or connectivity. Chronic animal preparations permit repeated imaging of neural Ca(2+) dynamics over multiple weeks. Together, these capabilities should enable unprecedented analyses of how ensemble neural codes evolve throughout memory processing and provide new insights into how memories are organized in the brain.","567":"Prions are a self-templating amyloidogenic state of normal cellular proteins, such as prion protein (PrP). They have been identified as the pathogenic agents, contributing to a number of diseases of the nervous system. However, the discovery that the neuronal RNA-binding protein, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), has a prion-like state that is involved in the stabilization of memory raised the possibility that prion-like proteins can serve normal physiological functions in the nervous system. Here, we review recent experimental evidence of prion-like properties of neuronal CPEB in various organisms and propose a model of how the prion-like state may stabilize memory. ","568":"Histone posttranslational modifications represent a versatile set of epigenetic marks involved not only in dynamic cellular processes, such as transcription and DNA repair, but also in the stable maintenance of repressive chromatin. In this article, we review many of the key and newly identified histone modifications known to be deregulated in cancer and how this impacts function. The latter part of the article addresses the challenges and current status of the epigenetic drug development process as it applies to cancer therapeutics.","569":"Communication between cells in a multicellular organism occurs by the production of ligands (proteins, peptides, fatty acids, steroids, gases, and other low-molecular-weight compounds) that are either secreted by cells or presented on their surface, and act on receptors on, or in, other target cells. Such signals control cell growth, migration, survival, and differentiation. Signaling receptors can be single-span plasma membrane receptors associated with tyrosine or serine\/threonine kinase activities, proteins with seven transmembrane domains, or intracellular receptors. Ligand-activated receptors convey signals into the cell by activating signaling pathways that ultimately affect cytosolic machineries or nuclear transcriptional programs or by directly translocating to the nucleus to regulate transcription.","570":null,"571":"Reconstructing the complete evolutionary history of extant life on our planet will be one of the most fundamental accomplishments of scientific endeavor, akin to the completion of the periodic table, which revolutionized chemistry. The road to this goal is via comparative genomics because genomes are our most comprehensive and objective evolutionary documents. The genomes of plant and animal species have been systematically targeted over the past decade to provide coverage of the tree of life. However, multicellular organisms only emerged in the last 550 million years of more than three billion years of biological evolution and thus comprise a small fraction of total biological diversity. The bulk of biodiversity, both past and present, is microbial. We have only scratched the surface in our understanding of the microbial world, as most microorganisms cannot be readily grown in the laboratory and remain unknown to science. Ground-breaking, culture-independent molecular techniques developed over the past 30 years have opened the door to this so-called microbial dark matter with an accelerating momentum driven by exponential increases in sequencing capacity. We are on the verge of obtaining representative genomes across all life for the first time. However, historical use of morphology, biochemical properties, behavioral traits, and single-marker genes to infer organismal relationships mean that the existing highly incomplete tree is riddled with taxonomic errors. Concerted efforts are now needed to synthesize and integrate the burgeoning genomic data resources into a coherent universal tree of life and genome-based taxonomy. ","572":"Aided by advances in technology, recent studies of neural precursor identity and regulation have revealed various cell types as contributors to ongoing cell genesis in the adult mammalian brain. Here, we use stem-cell biology as a framework to highlight the diversity of adult neural precursor populations and emphasize their hierarchy, organization, and plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions. ","573":"The restriction of adult neurogenesis to only a handful of regions of the brain is suggestive of some shared requirement for this dramatic form of structural plasticity. However, a common driver across neurogenic regions has not yet been identified. Computational studies have been invaluable in providing insight into the functional role of new neurons; however, researchers have typically focused on specific scales ranging from abstract neural networks to specific neural systems, most commonly the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus. These studies have yielded a number of diverse potential functions for new neurons, ranging from an impact on pattern separation to the incorporation of time into episodic memories to enabling the forgetting of old information. This review will summarize these past computational efforts and discuss whether these proposed theoretical functions can be unified into a common rationale for why neurogenesis is required in these unique neural circuits.

The patterns of diversity revealed in the first 100 bacterial genomes fostered development of a comprehensive framework that can explain their contents, organization, and evolution. ","575":"Studies of adult neurogenesis have greatly expanded in the last decade, largely as a result of improved tools for detecting and quantifying neurogenesis. In this review, we summarize and critically evaluate detection methods for neurogenesis in mammalian and human brain tissue. Besides thymidine analog labeling, cell-cycle markers are discussed, as well as cell stage and lineage commitment markers. Use of these histological tools is critically evaluated in terms of their strengths and limitations, as well as possible artifacts. Finally, we discuss the method of radiocarbon dating for determining cell and tissue turnover in humans.

The article focuses on the structural basis underlying readout of isolated marks by single reader molecules, as well as multivalent readout of multiple marks by linked reader cassettes at the histone tail and nucleosome level. Additional topics addressed include the role of histone mimics, cross talk between histone marks, technological developments at the genome-wide level, advances using chemical biology approaches, the linkage between histone and DNA methylation, the role for regulatory lncRNAs, and the promise of chromatin-based therapeutic modalities.","577":"Genetic causes for human disorders are being discovered at an unprecedented pace. A growing subclass of disease-causing mutations involves changes in the epigenome or in the abundance and activity of proteins that regulate chromatin structure. This article focuses on research that has uncovered human diseases that stem from such epigenetic deregulation. Disease may be caused by direct changes in epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, commonly found to affect imprinted gene regulation. Also described are disease-causing genetic mutations in epigenetic modifiers that either affect chromatin in trans or have a cis effect in altering chromatin configuration.","578":"Psychiatric disorders continue to be among the most challenging disorders to diagnose and treat because there is no single genetic or anatomical locus that is causative for the disease. Current treatments are often blunt tools used to ameliorate the most severe symptoms, at the risk of disrupting functional neural systems. There is a critical need to develop new therapeutic strategies that can target circumscribed functional or anatomical domains of pathology. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis may be one such domain. Here, we review the evidence suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a role in emotional regulation and forms of learning and memory that include temporal and spatial memory encoding and context discrimination, and that its dysregulation is associated with psychiatric disorders, such as affective disorders, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Further, adult neurogenesis has proven to be an effective model to investigate basic processes of neuronal development and converging evidence suggests that aberrant neural development may be an etiological factor, even in late-onset diseases. Constitutive neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the mature brain reflects large-scale plasticity unique to this region and could be a potential hub for modulation of a subset of cognitive and affective behaviors that are affected by multiple psychiatric disorders. ","579":"Microbes acquire DNA from a variety of sources. The last decades, which have seen the development of genome sequencing, have revealed that horizontal gene transfer has been a major evolutionary force that has constantly reshaped genomes throughout evolution. However, because the history of life must ultimately be deduced from gene phylogenies, the lack of methods to account for horizontal gene transfer has thrown into confusion the very concept of the tree of life. As a result, many questions remain open, but emerging methodological developments promise to use information conveyed by horizontal gene transfer that remains unexploited today. ","580":"Teleost fish have a remarkable neurogenic and regenerative capacity in the adult throughout the rostrocaudal axis of the brain. The distribution of proliferation zones shows a remarkable conservation, even in distantly related teleost species, suggesting a common teleost ground plan of proliferation zones. There are different progenitor populations in the neurogenic niches-progenitors positive for radial glial markers (dorsal telencephalon, hypothalamus) and progenitors with neuroepithelial-like characteristics (ventral telencephalon, optic tectum, cerebellum). Definition of these progenitors has allowed studying their role in normal growth of the adult brain, but also when challenged following a lesion. From these studies, important roles have emerged for intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals controlling the activation of adult neurogenesis that enable regeneration of the adult brain to occur, opening up new perspectives on rekindling regeneration also in the context of the mammalian brain.","581":"Natural selection should no longer be thought of simply as a primitive (magical) concept that can be used to support all kinds of evolutionary theorizing. We need to develop causal theories of natural selection; how it arises. Because the factors contributing to the creation of natural selection are expected to be complex and intertwined, theories explaining the causes of natural selection can only be developed through the experimental method. Microbial experimental evolution provides many benefits that using other organisms does not. Microorganisms are small, so millions can be housed in a test tube; they have short generation times, so evolution over hundreds of generations can be easily studied; they can grow in chemically defined media, so the environment can be precisely defined; and they can be frozen, so the fitness of strains or populations can be directly compared across time. Microbial evolution experiments can be divided into two types. The first is to measure the selection coefficient of two known strains over the first 50 or so generations, before advantageous mutations rise to high frequency. This type of experiment can be used to directly test hypotheses. The second is to allow microbial cultures to evolve over many hundreds or thousands of generations and follow the genetic changes, to infer what phenotypes are selected. In the last section of this article, I propose that selection coefficients are not constant, but change as the population becomes fitter, introducing the idea of the selection space. ","582":"Epigenomics has grown exponentially, providing a better understanding of the mechanistic aspects of new and old phenomena originally described through genetics, as well as providing unexpected insights into the way chromatin modulates the genomic information. In this overview, some of the advances are selected for discussion and comment under six topics: (1) histone modifications, (2) weak interactions, (3) interplay with external inputs, (4) the role of RNA molecules, (5) chromatin folding and architecture, and, finally, (6) a view of the essential role of chromatin transactions in regulating the access to genomic DNA.","583":"The cytoplasm of prokaryotes contains many molecular machines interacting directly with the chromosome. These vital interactions depend on the chromosome structure, as a molecule, and on the genome organization, as a unit of genetic information. Strong selection for the organization of the genetic elements implicated in these interactions drives replicon ploidy, gene distribution, operon conservation, and the formation of replication-associated traits. The genomes of prokaryotes are also very plastic with high rates of horizontal gene transfer and gene loss. The evolutionary conflicts between plasticity and organization lead to the formation of regions with high genetic diversity whose impact on chromosome structure is poorly understood. Prokaryotic genomes are remarkable documents of natural history because they carry the imprint of all of these selective and mutational forces. Their study allows a better understanding of molecular mechanisms, their impact on microbial evolution, and how they can be tinkered in synthetic biology. ","584":"In this article, the term \"early microbial evolution\" refers to the phase of biological history from the emergence of life to the diversification of the first microbial lineages. In the modern era (since we knew about archaea), three debates have emerged on the subject that deserve discussion: (1) thermophilic origins versus mesophilic origins, (2) autotrophic origins versus heterotrophic origins, and (3) how do eukaryotes figure into early evolution. Here, we revisit those debates from the standpoint of newer data. We also consider the perhaps more pressing issue that molecular phylogenies need to recover anaerobic lineages at the base of prokaryotic trees, because O2 is a product of biological evolution; hence, the first microbes had to be anaerobes. If molecular phylogenies do not recover anaerobes basal, something is wrong. Among the anaerobes, hydrogen-dependent autotrophs--acetogens and methanogens--look like good candidates for the ancestral state of physiology in the bacteria and archaea, respectively. New trees tend to indicate that eukaryote cytosolic ribosomes branch within their archaeal homologs, not as sisters to them and, furthermore tend to root archaea within the methanogens. These are major changes in the tree of life, and open up new avenues of thought. Geochemical methane synthesis occurs as a spontaneous, abiotic exergonic reaction at hydrothermal vents. The overall similarity between that reaction and biological methanogenesis fits well with the concept of a methanogenic root for archaea and an autotrophic origin of microbial physiology.","585":"When adult neurogenesis was discovered in the mammalian brain it was often considered an atavism and, even today, many people are convinced that there has been a \"phylogenetic reduction\" away from lifelong neurogenesis, favoring stability for complex brains. Adult neurogenesis is found throughout the animal kingdom but varies to a large extent. Mammals might have fewer neurogenic zones than, for example, fish, but within their remaining neurogenic zones, the new neurons are highly functional. Especially, humans have very substantial quantities of neurogenesis in their hippocampus. At least for the mammalian dentate gyrus, one can thus argue that there has been evolution toward neurogenesis-based plasticity rather than away from it. ","586":"The brain is thought to represent specific memories through the activity of sparse and distributed neural ensembles. In this review, we examine the use of immediate early genes (IEGs), genes that are induced by neural activity, to specifically identify and genetically modify neurons activated naturally by environmental experience. Recent studies using this approach have identified cellular and molecular changes specific to neurons activated during learning relative to their inactive neighbors. By using opto- and chemogenetic regulators of neural activity, the neurons naturally recruited during learning can be artificially reactivated to directly test their role in coding external information. In contextual fear conditioning, artificial reactivation of learning-induced neural ensembles in the hippocampus or neocortex can substitute for the context itself. That is, artificial stimulation of these neurons can apparently cause the animals to \"think\" they are in the context. This represents a powerful approach to testing the principles by which the brain codes for the external world and how these circuits are modified with learning.

Working-memory maintenance involves frontoparietal regions and distributed representational areas, and can be based on persistent activity in reentrant loops, synchronous oscillations, or changes in synaptic strength. Manipulation of content of working memory depends on the dorsofrontal cortex, and updating is realized by a frontostriatal '\"gating\" function. Goals and intentions are represented as cognitive and motivational contexts in the rostrofrontal cortex. Different working-memory networks are linked via associative reinforcement-learning mechanisms into a self-organizing system. Normal capacity variation, as well as working-memory deficits, can largely be accounted for by the effectiveness and integrity of the basal ganglia and dopaminergic neurotransmission. ","589":"Adult neurogenesis is dynamically regulated by a tangled web of local signals emanating from the neural stem cell (NSC) microenvironment. Both soluble and membrane-bound niche factors have been identified as determinants of adult neurogenesis, including morphogens. Here, we review our current understanding of the role and mechanisms of short-range morphogen ligands from the Wnt, Notch, Sonic hedgehog, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) families in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. These morphogens are ideally suited to fine-tune stem-cell behavior, progenitor expansion, and differentiation, thereby influencing all stages of the neurogenesis process. We discuss cross talk between their signaling pathways and highlight findings of embryonic development that provide a relevant context for understanding neurogenesis in the adult brain.

In this article, we put transcription factor-induced pluripotency into a historical context, review current methods to generate iPSCs, and discuss mechanistic insights that have been gained into the process of reprogramming. In addition, we focus on potential therapeutic applications of induced pluripotency and emerging technologies to efficiently engineer the genomes of human pluripotent cells for scientific and therapeutic purposes.","591":"In multicellular organisms, cell death is a critical and active process that maintains tissue homeostasis and eliminates potentially harmful cells. There are three major types of morphologically distinct cell death: apoptosis (type I cell death), autophagic cell death (type II), and necrosis (type III). All three can be executed through distinct, and sometimes overlapping, signaling pathways that are engaged in response to specific stimuli. Apoptosis is triggered when cell-surface death receptors such as Fas are bound by their ligands (the extrinsic pathway) or when Bcl2-family proapoptotic proteins cause the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (the intrinsic pathway). Both pathways converge on the activation of the caspase protease family, which is ultimately responsible for the dismantling of the cell. Autophagy defines a catabolic process in which parts of the cytosol and specific organelles are engulfed by a double-membrane structure, known as the autophagosome, and eventually degraded. Autophagy is mostly a survival mechanism; nevertheless, there are a few examples of autophagic cell death in which components of the autophagic signaling pathway actively promote cell death. Necrotic cell death is characterized by the rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity. This form of cell death can result from active signaling pathways, the best characterized of which is dependent on the activity of the protein kinase RIP3.","592":"Seizure activity in the hippocampal region strongly affects stem cell-associated plasticity in the adult dentate gyrus. Here, we describe how seizures in rodent models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) affect multiple steps in the developmental course from the dividing neural stem cell to the migrating and integrating newborn neuron. Furthermore, we discuss recent evidence indicating either that seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis may contribute to the epileptic disease process or that altered neurogenesis after seizures may represent an attempt of the injured brain to repair itself. Last, we describe how dysfunction of adult neurogenesis caused by chronic seizures may play an important role in the cognitive comorbidities associated with mTLE.","593":"Pavlovian conditioning is the process by which we learn relationships between stimuli and thus constitutes a basic building block for how the brain constructs representations of the world. We first review the major concepts of Pavlovian conditioning and point out many of the pervasive misunderstandings about just what conditioning is. This brings us to a modern redefinition of conditioning as the process whereby experience with a conditional relationship between stimuli bestows these stimuli with the ability to promote adaptive behavior patterns that did not occur before the experience. Working from this framework, we provide an in-depth analysis of two examples, fear conditioning and food-based appetitive conditioning, which include a description of the only partially overlapping neural circuitry of each. We also describe how these circuits promote the basic characteristics that define Pavlovian conditioning, such as error-correction-driven regulation of learning. ","594":"Synaptic plasticity serves as a cellular substrate for information storage in the central nervous system. The entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus are interconnected brain areas supporting basic cognitive functions important for the formation and retrieval of declarative memories. Here, we discuss how information flow in the EC-hippocampal loop is organized through circuit design. We highlight recently identified corticohippocampal and intrahippocampal connections and how these long-range and local microcircuits contribute to learning. This review also describes various forms of activity-dependent mechanisms that change the strength of corticohippocampal synaptic transmission. A key point to emerge from these studies is that patterned activity and interaction of coincident inputs gives rise to associational plasticity and long-term regulation of information flow. Finally, we offer insights about how learning-related synaptic plasticity within the corticohippocampal circuit during sensory experiences may enable adaptive behaviors for encoding spatial, episodic, social, and contextual memories. ","595":"Epigenetic mechanisms play an essential role in the germline and imprinting cycle. Germ cells show extensive epigenetic programming in preparation for the generation of the totipotent state, which in turn leads to the establishment of pluripotent cells in blastocysts. The latter are the cells from which pluripotent embryonic stem cells are derived and maintained in culture. Following blastocyst implantation, postimplantation epiblast cells develop, which give rise to all somatic cells as well as primordial germ cells, the precursors of sperm and eggs. Pluripotent stem cells in culture can be induced to undergo differentiation into somatic cells and germ cells in culture. Understanding the natural cycles of epigenetic reprogramming that occur in the germline will allow the generation of better and more versatile stem cells for both therapeutic and research purposes.","596":"A bulk of experimental evidence supports the idea that the stroke-damaged adult brain makes an attempt to repair itself by producing new neurons also in areas where neurogenesis does not normally occur (e.g., the striatum and cerebral cortex). Knowledge about mechanisms regulating the different steps of neurogenesis after stroke is rapidly increasing but still incomplete. The functional consequences of stroke-induced neurogenesis and the level of integration of the new neurons into existing neural circuitries are poorly understood. To have a substantial impact on the recovery after stroke, this potential mechanism for self-repair needs to be enhanced, primarily by increasing the survival and differentiation of the generated neuroblasts. Moreover, for efficient repair, optimization of neurogenesis most likely needs to be combined with promotion of other endogenous neuroregenerative responses (e.g., protection and sprouting of remaining mature neurons, transplantation of neural stem\/progenitor cells [NSPC]-derived neurons and glia cells, and modulation of inflammation). ","597":"Age and activity might be considered the two antagonistic key regulators of adult neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis decreases with age but remains present, albeit at a very low level, even in the oldest individuals. Activity, be it physical or cognitive, increases adult neurogenesis and thereby seems to counteract age effects. It is, thus, proposed that activity-dependent regulation of adult neurogenesis might contribute to some sort of \"neural reserve,\" the brain's ability to compensate functional loss associated with aging or neurodegeneration. Activity can have nonspecific and specific effects on adult neurogenesis. Mechanistically, nonspecific stimuli that largely affect precursor cell stages might be related by the local microenvironment, whereas more specific, survival-promoting effects take place at later stages of neuronal development and require the synaptic integration of the new cell and its particular synaptic plasticity. ","598":"Recombinational DNA repair is a universal aspect of DNA metabolism and is essential for genomic integrity. It is a template-directed process that uses a second chromosomal copy (sister, daughter, or homolog) to ensure proper repair of broken chromosomes. The key steps of recombination are conserved from phage through human, and an overview of those steps is provided in this review. The first step is resection by helicases and nucleases to produce single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that defines the homologous locus. The ssDNA is a scaffold for assembly of the RecA\/RAD51 filament, which promotes the homology search. On finding homology, the nucleoprotein filament catalyzes exchange of DNA strands to form a joint molecule. Recombination is controlled by regulating the fate of both RecA\/RAD51 filaments and DNA pairing intermediates. Finally, intermediates that mature into Holliday structures are disjoined by either nucleolytic resolution or topological dissolution. ","599":"The study of homologous recombination has its historical roots in meiosis. In this context, recombination occurs as a programmed event that culminates in the formation of crossovers, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation and create new combinations of parental alleles. Thus, meiotic recombination underlies both the independent assortment of parental chromosomes and genetic linkage. This review highlights the features of meiotic recombination that distinguish it from recombinational repair in somatic cells, and how the molecular processes of meiotic recombination are embedded and interdependent with the chromosome structures that characterize meiotic prophase. A more in-depth review presents our understanding of how crossover and noncrossover pathways of meiotic recombination are differentiated and regulated. The final section of this review summarizes the studies that have defined defective recombination as a leading cause of pregnancy loss and congenital disease in humans. ","600":"The fact that continuous proliferation of stem cells and progenitors, as well as the production of new neurons, occurs in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) raises several basic questions concerning the number of neurons required in a particular system. Can we observe continued growth of brain regions that sustain neurogenesis? Or does an elimination mechanism exist to maintain a constant number of cells? If so, are old neurons replaced, or are the new neurons competing for limited network access among each other? What signals support their survival and integration and what factors are responsible for their elimination? This review will address these and other questions regarding regulatory mechanisms that control cell-death and cell-survival mechanisms during neurogenesis in the intact adult mammalian brain.","601":"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) originate in the ventricular zones (VZs) of the brain and spinal cord and migrate throughout the developing central nervous system (CNS) before differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). It is not known whether OPCs or OLs from different parts of the VZ are functionally distinct. OPCs persist in the postnatal CNS, where they continue to divide and generate myelinating OLs at a decreasing rate throughout adult life in rodents. Adult OPCs respond to injury or disease by accelerating their cell cycle and increasing production of OLs to replace lost myelin. They also form synapses with unmyelinated axons and respond to electrical activity in those axons by generating more OLs and myelin locally. This experience-dependent \"adaptive\" myelination is important in some forms of plasticity and learning, for example, motor learning. We review the control of OL lineage development, including OL population dynamics and adaptive myelination in the adult CNS. ","602":"Retrieval, the use of learned information, was until recently mostly terra incognita in the neurobiology of memory, owing to shortage of research methods with the spatiotemporal resolution required to identify and dissect fast reactivation or reconstruction of complex memories in the mammalian brain. The development of novel paradigms, model systems, and new tools in molecular genetics, electrophysiology, optogenetics, in situ microscopy, and functional imaging, have contributed markedly in recent years to our ability to investigate brain mechanisms of retrieval. We review selected developments in the study of explicit retrieval in the rodent and human brain. The picture that emerges is that retrieval involves coordinated fast interplay of sparse and distributed corticohippocampal and neocortical networks that may permit permutational binding of representational elements to yield specific representations. These representations are driven largely by the activity patterns shaped during encoding, but are malleable, subject to the influence of time and interaction of the existing memory with novel information.","603":"The process of generating new neurons of different phenotype and function from undifferentiated stem and progenitor cells starts at very early stages of development and continues in discrete regions of the mammalian nervous system throughout life. Understanding mechanisms underlying neuronal cell development, biology, function, and interaction with other cells, especially in the neurogenic niche of fully developed adults, is important in defining and developing new therapeutic regimes in regenerative neuroscience. Studying these complex and dynamic processes in vivo is challenging because of the complexity of the nervous system and the presence of many known and unknown confounding variables. However, the challenges could be overcome with simple and robust in vitro models that more or less recapitulate the in vivo events. In this work, we will present an overview of present available in vitro cell-based models of neurogenesis.","604":"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is engineered to be a highly reliable synapse to carry the control of the motor commands of the nervous system over the muscles. Its development, organization, and synaptic properties are highly structured and regulated to support such reliability and efficacy. Yet, the NMJ is also highly plastic, able to react to injury and adapt to changes. This balance between structural stability and synaptic efficacy on one hand and structural plasticity and repair on another hand is made possible by the intricate regulation of perisynaptic Schwann cells, glial cells at this synapse. They regulate both the efficacy and structural plasticity of the NMJ in a dynamic, bidirectional manner owing to their ability to decode synaptic transmission and by their interactions via trophic-related factors. ","605":"To accommodate genomes in the limited space of the cell nucleus and ensure the correct execution of gene expression programs, genomes are packaged in complex fashion in the three-dimensional cell nucleus. As a consequence of the extensive higher-order organization of chromosomes, distantly located genomic regions on the same or distinct chromosomes undergo long-range interactions. This article discusses the nature of long interactions, mechanisms of their formation, and their emerging functional roles in gene regulation and genome maintenance.","606":"Adult-generated dentate granule neurons have emerged as major contributors to hippocampal plasticity. New neurons are generated from neural stem cells through a complex sequence of proliferation, differentiation, and maturation steps. Development of the new neuron is dependent on the precise temporal activity of transcription factors, which coordinate the expression of stage-specific genetic programs. Here, we review current knowledge in transcription factor-mediated regulation of mammalian neural stem cells and neurogenesis and will discuss potential mechanisms of how transcription factor networks, on one hand, allow for precise execution of the developmental sequence and, on the other hand, allow for adaptation of the rate and timing of adult neurogenesis in response to complex stimuli. Understanding transcription factor-mediated control of neuronal development will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying neurogenesis-dependent plasticity in health and disease. ","607":"Vertebrate reproduction requires a myriad of precisely orchestrated events-in particular, the maternal production of oocytes, the paternal production of sperm, successful fertilization, and initiation of early embryonic cell divisions. These processes are governed by a host of signaling pathways. Protein kinase and phosphatase signaling pathways involving Mos, CDK1, RSK, and PP2A regulate meiosis during maturation of the oocyte. Steroid signals-specifically testosterone-regulate spermatogenesis, as does signaling by G-protein-coupled hormone receptors. Finally, calcium signaling is essential for both sperm motility and fertilization. Altogether, this signaling symphony ensures the production of viable offspring, offering a chance of genetic immortality.","608":"Two decades after the discovery that neural stem cells (NSCs) populate some regions of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), deep knowledge has been accumulated on their capacity to generate new neurons in the adult brain. This constitutive adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life primarily within remnants of the embryonic germinal layers known as \"neurogenic sites.\" Nevertheless, some processes of neurogliogenesis also occur in the CNS parenchyma commonly considered as \"nonneurogenic.\" This \"noncanonical\" cell genesis has been the object of many claims, some of which turned out to be not true. Indeed, it is often an \"incomplete\" process as to its final outcome, heterogeneous by several measures, including regional location, progenitor identity, and fate of the progeny. These aspects also strictly depend on the animal species, suggesting that persistent neurogenic processes have uniquely adapted to the brain anatomy of different mammals. Whereas some examples of noncanonical neurogenesis are strictly parenchymal, others also show stem cell niche-like features and a strong link with the ventricular cavities. This work will review results obtained in a research field that expanded from classic neurogenesis studies involving a variety of areas of the CNS outside of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ). It will be highlighted how knowledge concerning noncanonical neurogenic areas is still incomplete owing to its regional and species-specific heterogeneity, and to objective difficulties still hampering its full identification and characterization. ","609":"What are species? How do they arise? These questions are not easy to answer and have been particularly controversial in microbiology. Yet, for those microbiologists studying environmental questions or dealing with clinical issues, the ability to name and recognize species, widely considered the fundamental units of ecology, can be practically useful. On a more fundamental level, the speciation problem, the focus here, is more mechanistic and conceptual. What is the origin of microbial species, and what evolutionary and ecological mechanisms keep them separate once they begin to diverge? To what extent are these mechanisms universal across diverse types of microbes, and more broadly across the entire the tree of life? Here, we propose that microbial speciation must be viewed in light of gene flow, which defines units of genetic similarity, and of natural selection, which defines units of phenotype and ecological function. We discuss to what extent ecological and genetic units overlap to form cohesive populations in the wild, based on recent evolutionary modeling and population genomics studies. These studies suggest a continuous \"speciation spectrum,\" which microbial populations traverse in different ways depending on their balance of gene flow and natural selection. ","610":"Memory reconsolidation is the process in which reactivated long-term memory (LTM) becomes transiently sensitive to amnesic agents that are effective at consolidation. The phenomenon was first described more than 50 years ago but did not fit the dominant paradigm that posited that consolidation takes place only once per LTM item. Research on reconsolidation was revitalized only more than a decade ago with the demonstration of reconsolidation in a well-defined behavioral protocol (auditory fear conditioning in the rat) subserved by an identified brain circuit (basolateral amygdala). Since then, reconsolidation has been shown in many studies over a range of species, tasks, and amnesic agents, and cellular and molecular correlates of reconsolidation have also been identified. In this review, I will first define the evidence on which reconsolidation is based, and proceed to discuss some of the conceptual issues facing the field in determining when reconsolidation does and does not occur. Last, I will refer to the potential clinical implications of reconsolidation. ","611":"Action potential (AP) propagation in myelinated nerves requires clustered voltage gated sodium and potassium channels. These channels must be specifically localized to nodes of Ranvier where the AP is regenerated. Several mechanisms have evolved to facilitate and ensure the correct assembly and stabilization of these essential axonal domains. This review highlights the current understanding of the axon intrinsic and glial extrinsic mechanisms that control the formation and maintenance of the nodes of Ranvier in both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). ","612":"Microglia, the major myeloid cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are implicated in physiologic processes and in the pathogenesis of several CNS disorders. Since their initial description early in the 20th century, our ability to identify and isolate microglia has significantly improved and new research is providing insight into the functions of these cells in sickness and in health. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the role of microglia in physiological and pathological processes of the CNS with a focus on multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Because of the prominent roles CX3CR1 and its ligand fractalkine played in bringing about these advances, we discuss the physiological and pathological roles of microglia as viewed from the CX3CR1-fractalkine perspective, providing a unique viewpoint. Based on the most recent studies of molecular profiling of microglia, we also propose a molecular and functional definition of microglia that incorporates the properties attributed to these cells in recent years. ","613":"Modern techniques in molecular biology, genomics, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics have identified a large number of novel histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), many of whose functions are still under intense investigation. Here, we catalog histone PTMs under two classes: first, those whose functions have been fairly well studied and, second, those PTMs that have been more recently identified but whose functions remain unclear. We hope that this will be a useful resource for researchers from all biological or technical backgrounds, aiding in their chromatin and epigenetic pursuits.","614":"Human populations, however defined, differ in the distribution and frequency of traits they display and diseases to which individuals are susceptible. These need to be understood with respect to three recent advances. First, these differences are multicausal and a result of not only genetic but also epigenetic and environmental factors. Second, the actions of genes, although crucial, turn out to be quite dynamic and modifiable, which contrasts with the classical view that they are inflexible machines. Third, the diverse human populations across the globe have spent too little time apart from our common origin 50,000 years ago to have developed many individually adapted traits. Human trait and disease differences by continental ancestry are thus as much the result of nongenetic as genetic forces. ","615":"Although our ability to store semantic declarative information can nowadays be readily surpassed by that of simple personal computers, our ability to learn and express procedural memories still outperforms that of supercomputers controlling the most advanced robots. To a large extent, our procedural memories are formed in the cerebellum, which embodies more than two-thirds of all neurons in our brain. In this review, we will focus on the emerging view that different modules of the cerebellum use different encoding schemes to form and express their respective memories. More specifically, zebrin-positive zones in the cerebellum, such as those controlling adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, appear to predominantly form their memories by potentiation mechanisms and express their memories via rate coding, whereas zebrin-negative zones, such as those controlling eyeblink conditioning, appear to predominantly form their memories by suppression mechanisms and express their memories in part by temporal coding using rebound bursting. Together, the different types of modules offer a rich repertoire to acquire and control sensorimotor processes with specific challenges in the spatiotemporal domain. ","616":"Exposure to stress is one of the best-known negative regulators of adult neurogenesis (AN). We discuss changes in neurogenesis in relation to exposure to stress, glucocorticoid hormones, and inflammation, with a particular focus on early development and on lasting effects of stress. Although the effects of acute and mild stress on AN are generally brief and can be quickly overcome, chronic exposure or more severe forms of stress can induce longer lasting reductions in neurogenesis that can, however, in part, be overcome by subsequent exposure to exercise, drugs targeting the stress system, and some antidepressants. Exposure to stress, particularly during the sensitive period of early life, may (re)program brain plasticity, in particular, in the hippocampus. This may increase the risk to develop cognitive or anxiety symptoms, common to brain diseases like dementia and depression in which plasticity changes occur, and a normalization of neurogenesis may be required for a successful treatment response and recovery. ","617":"Of the neurogenic zones in the adult brain, adult hippocampal neurogenesis attracts the most attention, because it is involved in higher cognitive function, most notably memory processes, and certain affective behaviors. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is also found in humans at a considerable level and appears to contribute significantly to hippocampal plasticity across the life span, because it is regulated by activity. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis generates new excitatory granule cells in the dentate gyrus, whose axons form the mossy fiber tract that links the dentate gyrus to CA3. It originates from a population of radial glia-like precursor cells (type 1 cells) that have astrocytic properties, express markers of neural stem cells and divide rarely. They give rise to intermediate progenitor cells with first glial (type 2a) and then neuronal (type 2b) phenotype. Through a migratory neuroblast-like stage (type 3), the newborn, lineage-committed cells exit the cell cycle and enter a maturation stage, during which they extend their dendrites into a the molecular layer and their axon to CA3. They go through a period of several weeks, during which they show increased synaptic plasticity, before finally becoming indistinguishable from the older granule cells. ","618":"Mutation is the engine of evolution in that it generates the genetic variation on which the evolutionary process depends. To understand the evolutionary process we must therefore characterize the rates and patterns of mutation. Starting with the seminal Luria and Delbruck fluctuation experiments in 1943, studies utilizing a variety of approaches have revealed much about mutation rates and patterns and about how these may vary between different bacterial strains and species along the chromosome and between different growth conditions. This work provides a critical overview of the results and conclusions drawn from these studies, of the debate surrounding some of these conclusions, and of the challenges faced when studying mutation and its role in bacterial evolution. ","619":"During mammalian brain development, neural progenitor cells undergo symmetric proliferative divisions followed by asymmetric neurogenic divisions. The division mode of these self-renewing progenitors, together with the cell fate of their progeny, plays critical roles in determining the number of neurons and, ultimately, the size of the adult brain. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made toward identifying various types of neuronal progenitors. Recent technological advances in live imaging and genetic manipulation have enabled us to link dynamic cell biological events to the molecular mechanisms that control the asymmetric divisions of self-renewing progenitors and have provided a fresh perspective on the modes of division of these progenitors. In addition, comparison of progenitor repertoires between species has provided insight into the expansion and the development of the complexity of the brain during mammalian evolution.","620":null,"621":"Growth is a complex process that is intimately linked to the developmental program to form adults with proper size and proportions. Genetics is an important determinant of growth, as exemplified by the role of local diffusible molecules setting up organ proportions. In addition, organisms use adaptive responses allowing modulating the size of individuals according to environmental cues, for example, nutrition. Here, we describe some of the physiological principles participating in the determination of final individual size.","622":"In amphibians, nerve cell size is highly correlated with genome size, and increases in genome and cell size cause a retardation of the rate of development of nervous (as well as nonnervous) tissue leading to secondary simplification. This yields an inverse relationship between genome and cell size on the one hand and morphological complexity of the tectum mesencephali as the main visual center, the size of the torus semicircularis as the main auditory center, the size of the amphibian papilla as an important peripheral auditory structure, and the size of the cerebellum as a major sensorimotor center. Nervous structures developing later (e.g., torus and cerebellum) are more affected by secondary simplification than those that develop earlier (e.g., the tectum). This effect is more prominent in salamanders and caecilians than in frogs owing to larger genome and cells sizes in the former two taxa. We hypothesize that because of intragenomic evolutionary processes, important differences in brain morphology can arise independently of specific environmental selection. ","623":"Size is a primary feature of biological systems that varies at many levels, from the organism to its constituent cells and subcellular structures. Amphibians populate some of the extremes in biological size and have provided insight into scaling mechanisms, upper and lower size limits, and their physiological significance. Body size variation is a widespread evolutionary tactic among amphibians, with miniaturization frequently correlating with direct development that occurs without a tadpole stage. The large genomes of salamanders lead to large cell sizes that necessitate developmental modification and morphological simplification. Amphibian extremes at the cellular level have provided insight into mechanisms that accommodate cell-size differences. Finally, how organelles scale to cell size between species and during development has been investigated at the molecular level, because subcellular scaling can be recapitulated using Xenopus in vitro systems. ","624":"Mechanical forces shape biological tissues. They are the effectors of the developmental programs that orchestrate morphogenesis. A lot of effort has been devoted to understanding morphogenetic processes in mechanical terms. In this review, we focus on the interplay between tissue mechanics and growth. We first describe how tissue mechanics affects growth, by influencing the orientation of cell divisions and the signaling pathways that control the rate of volume increase and proliferation. We then address how the mechanical state of a tissue is affected by the patterns of growth. The forward and reverse interactions between growth and mechanics must be investigated in an integrative way if we want to understand how tissues grow and shape themselves. To illustrate this point, we describe examples in which growth homeostasis is achieved by feedback mechanisms that use mechanical forces. ","625":"Cells of a given type maintain a characteristic cell size to function efficiently in their ecological or organismal context. They achieve this through the regulation of growth rates or by actively sensing size and coupling this signal to cell division. We focus this review on potential size-sensing mechanisms, including geometric, external cue, and titration mechanisms. Mechanisms that titrate proteins against DNA are of particular interest because they are consistent with the robust correlation of DNA content and cell size. We review the literature, which suggests that titration mechanisms may underlie cell-size sensing in Xenopus embryos, budding yeast, and Escherichia coli, whereas alternative mechanisms may function in fission yeast.","626":"Cell size is highly variable among different species across the Tree of Life. For decades, biologists have generated hypotheses to explain this variation, in many cases, drawing on the correlations that exist among cell size, genome size, nucleus size, and various physiological and developmental parameters. In recent years, our understanding of the molecular processes that generate variation in genome size over evolutionary time, as well as the processes that maintain homeostasis in cell size over ontogenetic time, has increased dramatically. The goal of this article is to highlight how information from these fields can be integrated to generate new hypotheses to explain cell-size diversity. ","627":"A requirement that an animal be able to feed to grow constrains how a cell can grow into an animal, and it forces an alternation between growth (increase in mass) and proliferation (increase in cell number). A growth-only phase that transforms a stem cell of ordinary proportions into a huge cell, the oocyte, requires dramatic adaptations to help a nucleus direct a 10(5)-fold expansion of cytoplasmic volume. Proliferation without growth transforms the huge egg into an embryo while still accommodating an impotent nucleus overwhelmed by the voluminous cytoplasm. This growth program characterizes animals that deposit their eggs externally, but it is changed in mammals and in endoparasites. In these organisms, development in a nutritive environment releases the growth constraint, but growth of cells before gastrulation requires a new program to sustain pluripotency during this growth. ","628":"Organelle function is often directly related to organelle size. However, it is not necessarily absolute size but the organelle-to-cell-size ratio that is critical. Larger cells generally have increased metabolic demands, must segregate DNA over larger distances, and require larger cytokinetic rings to divide. Thus, organelles often must scale to the size of the cell. The need for scaling is particularly acute during early development during which cell size can change rapidly. Here, we highlight scaling mechanisms for cellular structures as diverse as centrosomes, nuclei, and the mitotic spindle, and distinguish them from more general mechanisms of size control. In some cases, scaling is a consequence of the underlying mechanism of organelle size control. In others, size-control mechanisms are not obviously related to cell size, implying that scaling results indirectly from cell-size-dependent regulation of size-control mechanisms.","629":"Conscious memory for a new experience is initially dependent on information stored in both the hippocampus and neocortex. Systems consolidation is the process by which the hippocampus guides the reorganization of the information stored in the neocortex such that it eventually becomes independent of the hippocampus. Early evidence for systems consolidation was provided by studies of retrograde amnesia, which found that damage to the hippocampus-impaired memories formed in the recent past, but typically spared memories formed in the more remote past. Systems consolidation has been found to occur for both episodic and semantic memories and for both spatial and nonspatial memories, although empirical inconsistencies and theoretical disagreements remain about these issues. Recent work has begun to characterize the neural mechanisms that underlie the dialogue between the hippocampus and neocortex (e.g., \"neural replay,\" which occurs during sharp wave ripple activity). New work has also identified variables, such as the amount of preexisting knowledge, that affect the rate of consolidation. The increasing use of molecular genetic tools (e.g., optogenetics) can be expected to further improve understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying consolidation. ","630":"After more than a century of work concentrating on the motor functions of the basal ganglia, new ideas have emerged, suggesting that the basal ganglia also have major functions in relation to learning habits and acquiring motor skills. We review the evidence supporting the role of the striatum in optimizing behavior by refining action selection and in shaping habits and skills as a modulator of motor repertoires. These findings challenge the notion that striatal learning processes are limited to the motor domain. The learning mechanisms supported by striatal circuitry generalize to other domains, including cognitive skills and emotion-related patterns of action. ","631":"The involvement of RNA interference (RNAi) in heterochromatin formation has become clear largely through studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and plants like Arabidopsis thaliana. This article discusses how heterochromatic small interfering RNAs are produced and how the RNAi machinery participates in the formation and function of heterochromatin.","632":"To achieve optimal functionality, plant organs like leaves and petals have to grow to a certain size. Beginning with a limited number of undifferentiated cells, the final size of an organ is attained by a complex interplay of cell proliferation and subsequent cell expansion. Regulatory mechanisms that integrate intrinsic growth signals and environmental cues are required to enable optimal leaf and flower development. This review focuses on plant-specific principles of growth reaching from the cellular to the organ level. The currently known genetic pathways underlying these principles are summarized and network connections are highlighted. Putative non-cell autonomously acting mechanisms that might coordinate plant-cell growth are discussed. ","633":"Cell growth is a highly regulated, plastic process. Its control involves balancing positive regulation of anabolic processes with negative regulation of catabolic processes. Although target of rapamycin (TOR) is a major promoter of growth in response to nutrients and growth factors, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppresses anabolic processes in response to energy stress. Both TOR and AMPK are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. Here, we review the fundamentally important roles of these two kinases in the regulation of cell growth with particular emphasis on their mutually antagonistic signaling. ","634":"Over the past several decades, the proliferation and integration of adult-born neurons into existing hippocampal circuitry has been implicated in a wide range of behaviors, including novelty recognition, pattern separation, spatial learning, anxiety behaviors, and antidepressant response. In this review, we suggest that the diversity in behavioral requirements for new neurons may be partly caused by separate functional roles of individual neurogenic niches. Growing evidence shows that the hippocampal formation can be compartmentalized not only along the classic trisynaptic circuit, but also along a longitudinal septotemporal axis. We suggest that subpopulations of hippocampal adult-born neurons may be specialized for distinct mnemonic- or mood-related behavioral tasks. We will examine the literature supporting a functional and anatomical dissociation of the hippocampus along the longitudinal axis and discuss techniques to functionally dissect the roles of adult-born hippocampal neurons in these distinct subregions. ","635":"Stem and progenitor cells of the developing and adult brain can be effectively identified and manipulated using reporter genes, introduced into transgenic reporter mouse lines or recombinant viruses. Such reporters rely on an ever-increasing variety of fluorescent proteins and a continuously expanding list of regulatory elements and of mouse lines engineered for cell- or time-specific recombination. An important extension of stem-cell-based genetic strategies is an opportunity to explore the properties of newly generated neurons and their contribution to synaptic plasticity. Here, we review available strategies for marking and quantifying various classes of stem and progenitor cells in the adult brain, genetically tracing their progeny, and studying the properties of stem cells and new neurons. We compare various experimental approaches to labeling and investigating stem cells and their progeny and discuss caveats and limitations inherent to each approach. ","636":"Recombination is a central process to stably maintain and transmit a genome through somatic cell divisions and to new generations. Hence, recombination needs to be coordinated with other events occurring on the DNA template, such as DNA replication, transcription, and the specialized chromosomal functions at centromeres and telomeres. Moreover, regulation with respect to the cell-cycle stage is required as much as spatiotemporal coordination within the nuclear volume. These regulatory mechanisms impinge on the DNA substrate through modifications of the chromatin and directly on recombination proteins through a myriad of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and additional mechanisms. Although recombination is primarily appreciated to maintain genomic stability, the process also contributes to gross chromosomal arrangements and copy-number changes. Hence, the recombination process itself requires quality control to ensure high fidelity and avoid genomic instability. Evidently, recombination and its regulatory processes have significant impact on human disease, specifically cancer and, possibly, neurodegenerative diseases. ","637":"Stimuli that promote cell migration, such as chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors in metazoans and cyclic AMP in Dictyostelium, activate signaling pathways that control organization of the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion complexes. The Rho-family GTPases are a key convergence point of these pathways. Their effectors include actin regulators such as formins, members of the WASP\/WAVE family and the Arp2\/3 complex, and the myosin II motor protein. Pathways that link to the Rho GTPases include Ras GTPases, TorC2, and PI3K. Many of the molecules involved form gradients within cells, which define the front and rear of migrating cells, and are also established in related cellular behaviors such as neuronal growth cone extension and cytokinesis. The signaling molecules that regulate migration can be integrated to provide a model of network function. The network displays biochemical excitability seen as spontaneous waves of activation that propagate along the cell cortex. These events coordinate cell movement and can be biased by external cues to bring about directed migration.","638":"Although we are used to the idea that many organisms stop growing when they reach a predictable size, in many taxa, growth occurs throughout the life of an organism, a phenomenon referred to as indeterminate growth. Our comparative analysis suggests that indeterminate growth may indeed represent the ancestral condition, whereas the permanent arrest of growth may be a more derived state. Consistent with this idea, in diverse taxa, the basal branches show indeterminate growth, whereas more derived branches arrest their growth. Importantly, in some closely related taxa, the termination of growth has evolved in mechanistically distinct ways. Also, even within a single organism, different organs can differ with respect to whether they terminate their growth or not. Finally, the study of tooth development indicates that, even at the level of a single tissue, multiple determinate patterns of growth can evolve from an ancestral one that is indeterminate. ","639":"The control of organism and organ size is a central question in biology. Despite the attention it has received, our understanding of how adult organ size is determined and maintained is still incomplete. Early work has shown that both autonomous and regulated mechanisms drive vertebrate organ growth, and both intrinsic and extrinsic cues contribute to organ size. The molecular nature of organ-size determinants has been the subject of intense study, and major pathways, which underlie cell interactions controlling cell compartment size, have been identified. In this work, we review these data as well as the future perspectives of research in this important area of study. ","640":"The nervous system comprises a remarkably diverse and complex network of different cell types, which must communicate with one another with speed, reliability, and precision. Thus, the developmental patterning and maintenance of these cell populations and their connections with one another pose a rather formidable task. Emerging data implicate microglia, the resident myeloid-derived cells of the central nervous system (CNS), in the spatial patterning and synaptic wiring throughout the healthy, developing, and adult CNS. Importantly, new tools to specifically manipulate microglia function have revealed that these cellular functions translate, on a systems level, to effects on overall behavior. In this review, we give a historical perspective of work to identify microglia function in the healthy CNS and highlight exciting new work in the field that has identified roles for these cells in CNS development, maintenance, and plasticity. ","641":"Consolidation of implicit memory in the invertebrate Aplysia and explicit memory in the mammalian hippocampus are associated with remodeling and growth of preexisting synapses and the formation of new synapses. Here, we compare and contrast structural components of the synaptic plasticity that underlies these two distinct forms of memory. In both cases, the structural changes involve time-dependent processes. Thus, some modifications are transient and may contribute to early formative stages of long-term memory, whereas others are more stable, longer lasting, and likely to confer persistence to memory storage. In addition, we explore the possibility that trans-synaptic signaling mechanisms governing de novo synapse formation during development can be reused in the adult for the purposes of structural synaptic plasticity and memory storage. Finally, we discuss how these mechanisms set in motion structural rearrangements that prepare a synapse to strengthen the same memory and, perhaps, to allow it to take part in other memories as a basis for understanding how their anatomical representation results in the enhanced expression and storage of memories in the brain.

Within humans, cell size is known to vary by several orders of magnitude, and differences in nuclear DNA content among cells have been frequently observed. Using published data, here we describe how the quantity of nuclear DNA across 19 different human cell types increases with cell volume. This observed increase is similar to intraspecific relationships between DNA content and cell volume in other species, and interspecific relationships between diploid genome size and cell volume. Thus, we speculate that the quantity of nuclear DNA content in somatic cells of humans is perhaps best viewed as a distribution of values that reflects cell size distributions, rather than as a single, immutable quantity.

It was, however, not until recently that quantitative data on the extent of this process became available in humans, largely because of methodological challenges to study this process in man. There is substantial hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans, but humans appear unique among mammals in that there is no detectable olfactory bulb neurogenesis but continuous addition of new neurons in the striatum. ","645":"This article discusses the advances made in epigenetic research using the model organism fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. pombe has been used for epigenetic research since the discovery of position effect variegation (PEV). This is a phenomenon in which a transgene inserted within heterochromatin is variably expressed, but can be stably inherited in subsequent cell generations. PEV occurs at centromeres, telomeres, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, and mating-type regions of S. pombe chromosomes. Heterochromatin assembly in these regions requires enzymes that modify histones and the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. One of the key histone-modifying enzymes is the lysine methyltransferase Clr4, which methylates histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9), a classic hallmark of heterochromatin. The kinetochore is assembled on specialized chromatin in which histone H3 is replaced by the variant CENP-A. Studies in fission yeast have contributed to our understanding of the establishment and maintenance of CENP-A chromatin and the epigenetic activation and inactivation of centromeres.

Proterozoic rocks preserve a rich record of cyanobacteria, including derived forms that differentiate multiple cell types. Stromatolites, in turn, show that microbial communities covered the seafloor from tidal flats to the base of the photic zone. The Archean record is more challenging to interpret, particularly on the question of cyanobacterial antiquity, which remains to be resolved. In the late Neoproterozoic Era, increasing oxygen and radiating eukaryotes altered the biosphere, with planktonic algae gaining ecological prominence in the water column, whereas seaweeds and, eventually, animals spread across shallow seafloors. From a microbial perspective, however, animals, algae, and, later, plants simply provided new opportunities for diversification, and, to this day, microbial metabolisms remain the only essential components of biogeochemical cycles. ","648":"Genital coevolution between the sexes is expected to be common because of the direct interaction between male and female genitalia during copulation. Here we review the diverse mechanisms of genital coevolution that include natural selection, female mate choice, male-male competition, and how their interactions generate sexual conflict that can lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution. Natural selection on genital morphology will result in size coevolution to allow for copulation to be mechanically possible, even as other features of genitalia may reflect the action of other mechanisms of selection. Genital coevolution is explicitly predicted by at least three mechanisms of genital evolution: lock and key to prevent hybridization, female choice, and sexual conflict. Although some good examples exist in support of each of these mechanisms, more data on quantitative female genital variation and studies of functional morphology during copulation are needed to understand more general patterns. A combination of different approaches is required to continue to advance our understanding of genital coevolution. Knowledge of the ecology and behavior of the studied species combined with functional morphology, quantitative morphological tools, experimental manipulation, and experimental evolution have been provided in the best-studied species, all of which are invertebrates. Therefore, attention to vertebrates in any of these areas is badly needed. ","649":"A metaphase spindle is a complex structure consisting of microtubules and a myriad of different proteins that modulate microtubule dynamics together with chromatin and kinetochores. A decade ago, a full description of spindle formation and function seemed a lofty goal. Here, we describe how work in the last 10 years combining cataloging of spindle components, the characterization of their biochemical activities using single-molecule techniques, and theory have advanced our knowledge. Taken together, these advances suggest that a full understanding of spindle assembly and function may soon be possible. ","650":"The field of miRNA biology is relatively young, but its impact on our understanding of the regulation of a wide array of cell functions is far-reaching. The importance of miRNAs in development has become nearly ubiquitous, with miRNAs contributing to development of most cells and organs. Although miRNAs are clearly interwoven into known regulatory networks that control cell development, the specific modalities by which they intersect are often quite distinct and cleverly achieved. The frequently emerging theme of feed-back and feed-forward loops to either counterbalance or reinforce the gene programs that they influence is a common thread. Many of these examples of miRNAs as developmental regulators are presently found in organs with different miRNAs and targets, whereas novel, unexpected themes emerge in the context of mouse development as we learn more about this rapidly developing area of biology. ","651":"Central nervous system (CNS) myelination by oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a highly orchestrated process involving well-defined steps from specification of neural stem cells into proliferative OL precursors followed by terminal differentiation and subsequent maturation of these precursors into myelinating OLs. These specification and differentiation processes are mediated by profound global changes in gene expression, which are in turn subject to control by both extracellular signals and regulatory networks intrinsic to the OL lineage. Recently, basic transcriptional mechanisms that control OL differentiation and myelination have begun to be elucidated at the molecular level and on a genome scale. The interplay between transcription factors activated by differentiation-promoting signals and master regulators likely exerts a crucial role in controlling stage-specific progression of the OL lineage. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge regarding the transcription factors and the epigenetic programs including histone methylation, acetylation, chromatin remodeling, micro-RNAs, and noncoding RNAs that regulate development of OLs and myelination. ","652":"Microglia are the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), which sit in close proximity to neural structures and are intimately involved in brain homeostasis. The microglial population also plays fundamental roles during neuronal expansion and differentiation, as well as in the perinatal establishment of synaptic circuits. Any change in the normal brain environment results in microglial activation, which can be detrimental if not appropriately regulated. Aberrant microglial function has been linked to the development of several neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, microglia also possess potent immunoregulatory and regenerative capacities, making them attractive targets for therapeutic manipulation. Such rationale manipulations will, however, require in-depth knowledge of their origins and the molecular mechanisms underlying their homeostasis. Here, we discuss the latest advances in our understanding of the origin, differentiation, and homeostasis of microglial cells and their myelomonocytic relatives in the CNS. ","653":"Myelinated nerve fibers have evolved to enable fast and efficient transduction of electrical signals in the nervous system. To act as an electric insulator, the myelin sheath is formed as a multilamellar membrane structure by the spiral wrapping and subsequent compaction of the oligodendroglial plasma membrane around central nervous system (CNS) axons. Current evidence indicates that the myelin sheath is more than an inert insulating membrane structure. Oligodendrocytes are metabolically active and functionally connected to the subjacent axon via cytoplasmic-rich myelinic channels for movement of macromolecules to and from the internodal periaxonal space under the myelin sheath. This review summarizes our current understanding of how myelin is generated and also the role of oligodendrocytes in supporting the long-term integrity of myelinated axons. ","654":"The global significance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli as gastrointestinal human pathogens has motivated numerous studies to characterize their population biology and evolution. These bacteria are a common component of the intestinal microbiota of numerous bird and mammal species and cause disease in humans, typically via consumption of contaminated meat products, especially poultry meat. Sequence-based molecular typing methods, such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have been instructive for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of these bacteria and how phenotypic variation relates to the high degree of genetic structuring in C. coli and C. jejuni populations. Here, we describe aspects of the relatively short history of coevolution between humans and pathogenic Campylobacter, by reviewing research investigating how mutation and lateral or horizontal gene transfer (LGT or HGT, respectively) interact to create the observed population structure. These genetic changes occur in a complex fitness landscape with divergent ecologies, including multiple host species, which can lead to rapid adaptation, for example, through frame-shift mutations that alter gene expression or the acquisition of novel genetic elements by HGT. Recombination is a particularly strong evolutionary force in Campylobacter, leading to the emergence of new lineages and even large-scale genome-wide interspecies introgression between C. jejuni and C. coli. The increasing availability of large genome datasets is enhancing understanding of Campylobacter evolution through the application of methods, such as genome-wide association studies, but MLST-derived clonal complex designations remain a useful method for describing population structure.

The most ancient of organisms, their very presence was not appreciated until the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. Initially, viewed as \"bags of enzymes,\" recent advances in imaging, molecular phylogeny, and, most recently, genomics have revealed incredible diversity within this previously invisible realm of life. Here, we review the impact of size on bacterial evolution, physiology, and morphogenesis. ","656":"Myelinated nerve fibers are essential for the rapid propagation of action potentials by saltatory conduction. They form as the result of reciprocal interactions between axons and Schwann cells. Extrinsic signals from the axon, and the extracellular matrix, drive Schwann cells to adopt a myelinating fate, whereas myelination reorganizes the axon for its role in conduction and is essential for its integrity. Here, we review our current understanding of the development, molecular organization, and function of myelinating Schwann cells. Recent findings into the extrinsic signals that drive Schwann cell myelination, their cognate receptors, and the downstream intracellular signaling pathways they activate will be described. Together, these studies provide important new insights into how these pathways converge to activate the transcriptional cascade of myelination and remodel the actin cytoskeleton that is critical for morphogenesis of the myelin sheath. ","657":"Control of organ size is of fundamental importance and is controlled by genetic, environmental, and mechanical factors. Studies in many species have pointed to the existence of both organ-extrinsic and -intrinsic size-control mechanisms, which ultimately must coordinate to regulate organ size. Here, we discuss organ size control by organ patterning and the Hippo pathway, which both act in an organ-intrinsic fashion. The influence of morphogens and other patterning molecules couples growth and patterning, whereas emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway controls growth in response to mechanical stimuli and signals emanating from cell-cell interactions. Several points of cross talk have been reported between signaling pathways that control organ patterning and the Hippo pathway, both at the level of membrane receptors and transcriptional regulators. However, despite substantial progress in the past decade, key questions in the growth-control field remain, including precisely how and when organ patterning and the Hippo pathway communicate to control size, and whether these communication mechanisms are organ specific or general. In addition, elucidating mechanisms by which organ-intrinsic cues, such as patterning factors and the Hippo pathway, interface with extrinsic cues, such as hormones to control organ size, remain unresolved.

The emerging answers are complex because we are overwhelmed by a variety of behavioral tasks that apparently require new neurons to be performed optimally. With few exceptions, the hippocampal memory system seems to use the newly generated neurons for multiple roles. Adult neurogenesis has given the dentate gyrus new capabilities not previously thought possible within the scope of traditional synaptic plasticity. Looking at these new developments from the perspective of past discoveries, the science of adult neurogenesis has emerged from its initial phase of being, first, a surprising oddity and, later, exciting possibility, to the present state of being an integral part of mainstream neuroscience. The answers to many remaining questions regarding adult neurogenesis will come along only with our growing understanding of the functionality of the brain as a whole. This, in turn, will require integration of multiple levels of organization from molecules and cells to circuits and systems, ultimately resulting in comprehension of behavioral outcomes.

The T- and B-cell antigen receptors are coupled to intracellular tyrosine kinases and adaptor molecules to control the metabolism of inositol phospholipids and calcium release. The production of inositol polyphosphates and lipid second messengers directs the activity of downstream guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins and protein and lipid kinases\/phosphatases that control lymphocyte transcriptional and metabolic programs. Lymphocyte activation is modulated by costimulatory molecules and cytokines that elicit intracellular signaling that is integrated with the antigen-receptor-controlled pathways.

Evolution of protein structural classes and protein sequence families. Proc Natl Acad Sci 103: 14056-14061] is a central biological question that has a long and rich history. Extensive work during the last 80 years have shown that new genes that play important roles in lineage-specific phenotypes and adaptation can originate through a multitude of different mechanisms, including duplication, lateral gene transfer, gene fusion\/fission, and de novo origination. In this review, we focus on two main processes as generators of new functions: evolution of new genes by duplication and divergence of pre-existing genes and de novo gene origination in which a whole protein-coding gene evolves from a noncoding sequence. ","662":"Sexual conflict occurs whenever there is sexually antagonistic selection on shared traits. When shared traits result from interactions (e.g., mating rate) and have a different genetic basis in each sex (i.e., interlocus conflict), then sex-specific traits that shift the value of these interaction traits toward the sex-specific optimum will be favored. Male traits can be favored that increase the fitness of their male bearers, but decrease the fitness of interacting females. Likewise, female traits that reduce the costs of interacting with harmful males may simultaneously impose costs on males. If the evolution of these antagonistic traits changes the nature of selection acting on the opposite sex, interesting coevolutionary dynamics will result. Here we examine three current issues in the study of sexually antagonistic interactions: the female side of sexual conflict, the ecological context of sexual conflict, and the strength of evidence for sexually antagonistic coevolution. ","663":"Recombination is a prominent feature of meiosis in which it plays an important role in increasing genetic diversity during inheritance. Additionally, in most organisms, recombination also plays mechanical roles in chromosomal processes, most notably to mediate pairing of homologous chromosomes during prophase and, ultimately, to ensure regular segregation of homologous chromosomes when they separate at the first meiotic division. Recombinational interactions are also subject to important spatial patterning at both early and late stages. Recombination-mediated processes occur in physical and functional linkage with meiotic axial chromosome structure, with interplay in both directions, before, during, and after formation and dissolution of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a highly conserved meiosis-specific structure that links homolog axes along their lengths. These diverse processes also are integrated with recombination-independent interactions between homologous chromosomes, nonhomology-based chromosome couplings\/clusterings, and diverse types of chromosome movement. This review provides an overview of these diverse processes and their interrelationships. ","664":"One of the earliest recognized forms of sexual conflict was infanticide by males, which imposes serious costs on female reproductive success. Here I review two bodies of evidence addressing coevolved strategies of males and females. The original sexual selection hypothesis arguing that infanticide improves male mating success by accelerating the return of females to fertilizable condition has been generally supported in some taxa--notably, some primates, carnivores, rodents, and cetaceans--but not in other taxa. One result of recent research has been to implicate other selective benefits of infanticide by males in various taxa from insects to birds to mammals, such as acquisition of breeding status or improvement of the female breeding condition. In some cases, however, the adaptive significance of male infanticide remains obscure. The second body of data I review is arguably the most important result of recent research: clarifying the possible female counterstrategies to infanticide. These potential counterstrategies span diverse biological systems, ranging from sexual behavior (e.g., polyandrous mating), to physiology (e.g., the Bruce effect), to individual behavior (e.g., maternal aggression), to social strategies (e.g., association with coalitionary defenders of either sex). Although much remains to be studied, these current data provide compelling evidence of sexually antagonistic coevolution surrounding the phenomenon of infanticide.","665":"The inability of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) to undergo spontaneous regeneration has long been regarded as a central tenet of neurobiology. However, although this is largely true of the neuronal elements of the adult mammalian CNS, save for discrete populations of granular neurons, the same is not true of its glial elements. In particular, the loss of oligodendrocytes, which results in demyelination, triggers a spontaneous and often highly efficient regenerative response, remyelination, in which new oligodendrocytes are generated and myelin sheaths are restored to denuded axons. Yet, remyelination in humans is not without limitation, and a variety of demyelinating conditions are associated with sustained and disabling myelin loss. In this review, we will review the biology of remyelination, including the cells and signals involved; describe when remyelination occurs and when and why it fails and the consequences of its failure; and discuss approaches for therapeutically enhancing remyelination in demyelinating diseases of both children and adults, both by stimulating endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and by transplanting these cells into demyelinated brain.

This involves the formation of the Schwann cell precursor and immature Schwann cells, followed by the generation of the myelin and nonmyelin (Remak) cells of mature nerves. This review describes the signals that control the embryonic phase of this process and the organogenesis of peripheral nerves. We also discuss the phenotypic plasticity retained by mature Schwann cells, and explain why this unusual feature is central to the striking regenerative potential of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

What ensures that subcellular components are properly proportioned relative to the whole cell? How does alteration in organelle size affect biochemical function? Answering such fundamental questions requires us to understand how the size of individual organelles and other cellular structures is determined. Knowledge of organelle biogenesis and dynamics has advanced rapidly in recent years. Does this knowledge give us enough information to formulate reasonable models for organelle size control, or are we still missing something? ","668":"This review will discuss adult hippocampal neurogenesis in wild mammals of different taxa and outline similarities with and differences from laboratory animals. It begins with a review of evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis in various mammals, and shows the similar patterns of age-dependent decline in cell proliferation in wild and domesticated mammals. In contrast, the pool of immature neurons that originate from proliferative activity varies between species, implying a selective advantage for mammals that can make use of a large number of these functionally special neurons. Furthermore, rapid adaptation of hippocampal neurogenesis to experimental challenges appears to be a characteristic of laboratory rodents. Wild mammals show species-specific, rather stable hippocampal neurogenesis, which appears related to demands that characterize the niche exploited by a species rather than to acute events in the life of its members. Studies that investigate adult neurogenesis in wild mammals are not numerous, but the findings of neurogenesis under natural conditions can provide new insights, and thereby also address the question to which cognitive demands neurogenesis may respond during selection.","669":"Dosage compensation in Drosophila increases the transcription of genes on the single X chromosome in males to equal that of both X chromosomes in females. Site-specific histone acetylation by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex is thought to play a fundamental role in the increased transcriptional output of the male X. Nucleation and sequence-independent spreading of the complex to active genes serves as a model for understanding the targeting and function of epigenetic chromatin-modifying complexes. Interestingly, two noncoding RNAs are key for MSL assembly and spreading to active genes along the length of the X chromosome.

A comparative approach reveals that similar mechanisms are used to gauge and regulate cell size and proliferation, and shows that these mechanisms share similar modules to measure cell size, cycle status, competence, and number, as well as ploidy levels, nutrient availability, and other variables affecting cell growth. However, this approach also reveals that these modules often use nonhomologous subsystems when viewed at modular or genomic levels; that is, different lineages have evolved functionally analogous, but not genomically homologous, ways of either sensing or regulating cell size and growth, in much the same way that multicellularity has evolved in different lineages using analogous developmental modules.","671":"Most species of insect, and many other plants and animals, carry maternally heritable microorganisms-viruses, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, and fungi that pass from a female host to her progeny. Maternal inheritance establishes a correlation between the fitness of symbiont and host female, which can select for the symbiont to contribute to host fitness. Nevertheless, its lack of transmission through male hosts places the symbiont in conflict with biparentally inherited nuclear genes. In this review, we first examine how this conflict is manifest in selection to promote the production and survival of infected female hosts and gametes. We then examine how the distorted population sex ratios that they produce may affect host reproductive ecology, and thus the intensity of other conflicts associated with sexual reproduction. Finally, we examine evolved host responses to symbiont manipulation. We argue that the unusual intensity of symbiont-host conflict generates extreme selection pressures that can drive changes in sex-determination systems, the basic pathway through which males and females are constructed. ","672":"Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the evolutionary conserved Spo11 protein and accessory factors. DSBs are nonrandomly distributed along the chromosomes displaying a significant (~400-fold) variation of frequencies, which ultimately establishes local and long-range \"hot\" and \"cold\" domains for recombination initiation. This remarkable patterning is set up within the chromatin context, involving multiple layers of biochemical activity. Predisposed chromatin accessibility, but also a range of transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and histone modifiers likely promote local recruitment of DSB proteins, as well as mobilization, sliding, and eviction of nucleosomes before and after the occurrence of meiotic DSBs. Here, we assess our understanding of meiotic DSB formation and methods to change its patterning. We also synthesize current heterogeneous knowledge on how histone modifications and chromatin remodeling may impact this decisive step in meiotic recombination.","673":"Astrocytes contribute to the maintenance of the health and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Thus, it is not surprising that these multifunctional cells have been implicated in the onset and progression of several neurodegenerative diseases. The involvement of astrocytes in the neuropathology of these diseases is likely a consequence of both the loss of normal homeostatic functions and gain of toxic functions. Intracellular aggregates in astrocytes are a common feature of various neurodegenerative diseases, and these aggregates perturb normal astrocytic functions in ways that can be harmful to neuronal viability. Here, we review the role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on their dysfunction in Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ","674":"This work reviews research on neural mechanisms of two types of associative learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia, classical conditioning of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex and operant conditioning of feeding behavior. Basic classical conditioning is caused in part by activity-dependent facilitation at sensory neuron-motor neuron (SN-MN) synapses and involves a hybrid combination of activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and Hebbian potentiation, which are coordinated by trans-synaptic signaling. Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, which might be explained by the known circuit connections in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding. However, for both classical and operant conditioning, adenylyl cyclase is a molecular site of convergence of the two signals that are associated. Learning in other invertebrate preparations also involves many of the same mechanisms, which may contribute to learning in vertebrates as well.","675":"Copulatory wounding (CW) is widespread in the animal kingdom, but likely underreported because of its cryptic nature. We use four case studies (Drosophila flies, Siphopteron slugs, Cimex bugs, and Callosobruchus beetles) to show that CW entails physiological and life-history costs, but can evolve into a routine mating strategy that, in some species, involves insemination through the wound. Although interspecific variation in CW is documented, few data exist on intraspecific and none on individual differences. Although defensive mechanisms evolve in the wound recipient, our review also indicates that mating costs in species with CW are slightly higher than in other species. Whether such costs are dose- or frequency-dependent, and whether defense occurs as resistance or tolerance, decisively affects the evolutionary outcome. In addition to sexual conflict, CW may also become a model system for reproductive isolation. In this context, we put forward a number of predictions, including (1) occasional CW is more costly than routine CW, (2) CW is more costly in between- than within-population matings, and (3) in the presence of CW, selection may favor the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases if they induce resource allocation. Finally, we outline, and briefly discuss, several medical implications of CW in humans.

Alterations in adult neurogenesis appear to be a common hallmark in different neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD). This is remarkable, because the distinct pathological proteins responsible for the different diseases induce the loss of different neural populations. Impaired adult neurogenesis was shown in numerous animal models of neurodegenerative diseases; however, only few postmortem studies have been performed. We will review concepts related to the interplay between cellular plasticity in regions of adult neurogenesis with a specific focus on cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous factors.

Such networks not only receive and transmit signals but also process information. The complexity of these networks requires the use of computational models to understand how information is processed and how input-output relationships are determined. Two major computational approaches used to study signaling networks are graph theory and dynamical modeling. Both approaches are useful; network analysis (application of graph theory) helps us understand how the signaling network is organized and what its information-processing capabilities are, whereas dynamical modeling helps us determine how the system changes in time and space upon receiving stimuli. Computational models have helped us identify a number of emergent properties that signaling networks possess. Such properties include ultrasensitivity, bistability, robustness, and noise-filtering capabilities. These properties endow cell-signaling networks with the ability to ignore small or transient signals and\/or amplify signals to drive cellular machines that spawn numerous physiological functions associated with different cell states.

One of these understudied nerve elements, the perineurium, is a component of the blood-nerve barrier and is essential for protecting axons and their associated Schwann cells from ionic flux, toxins, and infection. However, until recently, it was thought that this vital nerve tissue was derived from the mesoderm and simply served a structural\/barrier function with no other influence on the development, maintenance, or regeneration of peripheral nerves. Recent work in zebrafish using in vivo time-lapse imaging, genetic manipulation, and laser axotomy is shedding light on the origin and roles of this previously ignored glial nerve component and is changing how we view development of the nervous system. ","683":"Neuronal activity results in increased blood flow in the brain, a response named functional hyperemia. Astrocytes play an important role in mediating this response. Neurotransmitters released from active neurons evoke Ca(2+) increases in astrocytes, leading to the release of vasoactive metabolites of arachidonic acid from astrocyte endfeet onto blood vessels. Synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) dilate blood vessels, whereas 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) constricts vessels. The release of K(+) from astrocyte endfeet may also contribute to vasodilation. Oxygen modulates astrocyte regulation of blood flow. Under normoxic conditions, astrocytic Ca(2+) signaling results in vasodilation, whereas under hyperoxic conditions, vasoconstriction is favored. Astrocytes also contribute to the generation of vascular tone. Tonic release of both 20-HETE and ATP from astrocytes constricts vascular smooth muscle cells, generating vessel tone. Under pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and diabetic retinopathy, disruption of normal astrocyte physiology can compromise the regulation of blood flow. ","684":"The ability to remember life's events, and to leverage memory to guide behavior, defines who we are and is critical for everyday functioning. The neural mechanisms supporting such mnemonic experiences are multiprocess and multinetwork in nature, which creates challenges for studying them in humans and animals. Advances in noninvasive neuroimaging techniques have enabled the investigation of how specific neural structures and networks contribute to human memory at its many cognitive and mechanistic levels. In this review, we discuss how functional and anatomical imaging has provided novel insights into the types of information represented in, and the computations performed by, specific medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions, and we consider how interactions between the MTL and other cortical and subcortical structures influence what we learn and remember. By leveraging imaging, researchers have markedly advanced understanding of how the MTL subserves declarative memory and enables navigation of our physical and mental worlds. ","685":"Homologous recombination (HR) and mismatch repair (MMR) are inextricably linked. HR pairs homologous chromosomes before meiosis I and is ultimately responsible for generating genetic diversity during sexual reproduction. HR is initiated in meiosis by numerous programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs; several hundred in mammals). A characteristic feature of HR is the exchange of DNA strands, which results in the formation of heteroduplex DNA. Mismatched nucleotides arise in heteroduplex DNA because the participating parental chromosomes contain nonidentical sequences. These mismatched nucleotides may be processed by MMR, resulting in nonreciprocal exchange of genetic information (gene conversion). MMR and HR also play prominent roles in mitotic cells during genome duplication; MMR rectifies polymerase misincorporation errors, whereas HR contributes to replication fork maintenance, as well as the repair of spontaneous DSBs and genotoxic lesions that affect both DNA strands. MMR suppresses HR when the heteroduplex DNA contains excessive mismatched nucleotides, termed homeologous recombination. The regulation of homeologous recombination by MMR ensures the accuracy of DSB repair and significantly contributes to species barriers during sexual reproduction. This review discusses the history, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, and the current state of studies on the role of MMR in homologous and homeologous recombination from bacteria to humans. ","686":"The idea that memory is not a single mental faculty has a long and interesting history but became a topic of experimental and biologic inquiry only in the mid-20th century. It is now clear that there are different kinds of memory, which are supported by different brain systems. One major distinction can be drawn between working memory and long-term memory. Long-term memory can be separated into declarative (explicit) memory and a collection of nondeclarative (implicit) forms of memory that include habits, skills, priming, and simple forms of conditioning. These memory systems depend variously on the hippocampus and related structures in the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as on the amygdala, the striatum, cerebellum, and the neocortex. This work recounts the discovery of declarative and nondeclarative memory and then describes the nature of declarative memory, working memory, nondeclarative memory, and the relationship between memory systems. ","687":"Many organisms show major chromosomal differences between sexes. In mammals, females have two copies of a large, gene-rich chromosome, the X, whereas males have one X and a small, gene-poor Y. The imbalance in expression of several hundred genes is lethal if not dealt with by dosage compensation. The male-female difference is addressed by silencing of genes on one female X early in development. However, both males and females now have only one active X chromosome. This is compensated by twofold up-regulation of genes on the active X. This complex system continues to provide important insights into mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. ","688":"Homologous recombination provides high-fidelity DNA repair throughout all domains of life. Live cell fluorescence microscopy offers the opportunity to image individual recombination events in real time providing insight into the in vivo biochemistry of the involved proteins and DNA molecules as well as the cellular organization of the process of homologous recombination. Herein we review the cell biological aspects of mitotic homologous recombination with a focus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, but will also draw on findings from other experimental systems. Key topics of this review include the stoichiometry and dynamics of recombination complexes in vivo, the choreography of assembly and disassembly of recombination proteins at sites of DNA damage, the mobilization of damaged DNA during homology search, and the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus with respect to capacity of homologous recombination. ","689":"Blood and lymphatic vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients, remove waste and CO2, and regulate interstitial pressure in tissues and organs. These vessels begin life early in embryogenesis using transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate differentiation, morphogenesis, and proliferation. Here we describe how these vessels develop in the mouse embryo, and the signals that are important to their development. ","690":"The primary goal of mitosis is to partition duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells. Eukaryotic chromosomes are equipped with two distinct classes of intrinsic machineries, cohesin and condensins, that ensure their faithful segregation during mitosis. Cohesin holds sister chromatids together immediately after their synthesis during S phase until the establishment of bipolar attachments to the mitotic spindle in metaphase. Condensins, on the other hand, attempt to \"resolve\" sister chromatids by counteracting cohesin. The products of the balancing acts of cohesin and condensins are metaphase chromosomes, in which two rod-shaped chromatids are connected primarily at the centromere. In anaphase, this connection is released by the action of separase that proteolytically cleaves the remaining population of cohesin. Recent studies uncover how this series of events might be mechanistically coupled with each other and intricately regulated by a number of regulatory factors. ","691":"Molecular genetic approaches in small model organisms like Drosophila have helped to elucidate fundamental principles of neuronal cell biology. Much less is understood about glial cells, although interest in using invertebrate preparations to define their in vivo functions has increased significantly in recent years. This review focuses on our current understanding of the three major neuron-associated glial cell types found in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS)-astrocytes, cortex glia, and ensheathing glia. Together, these cells act like mammalian astrocytes: they surround neuronal cell bodies and proximal neurites, are coupled to the vasculature, and associate closely with synapses. Exciting recent work has shown essential roles for these CNS glial cells in neural circuit formation, function, plasticity, and pathology. As we gain a more firm molecular and cellular understanding of how Drosophila CNS glial cells interact with neurons, it is becoming clear they share significant molecular and functional attributes with mammalian astrocytes. ","692":"The simplicity and tractability of the neural circuits mediating behaviors in invertebrates have facilitated the cellular\/molecular dissection of neural mechanisms underlying learning. The review has a particular focus on the general principles that have emerged from analyses of an example of nonassociative learning, sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia. Learning and memory rely on multiple mechanisms of plasticity at multiple sites of the neuronal circuits, with the relative contribution to memory of the different sites varying as a function of the extent of training and time after training. The same intracellular signaling cascades that induce short-term modifications in synaptic transmission can also be used to induce long-term changes. Although short-term memory relies on covalent modifications of preexisting proteins, long-term memory also requires regulated gene transcription and translation. Maintenance of long-term cellular memory involves both intracellular and extracellular feedback loops, which sustain the regulation of gene expression and the modification of targeted molecules.","693":"Cell division ends with the physical separation of the two daughter cells, a process known as cytokinesis. This final event ensures that nuclear and cytoplasmic contents are accurately partitioned between the two nascent cells. Cytokinesis is one of the most dramatic changes in cell shape and requires an extensive reorganization of the cell's cytoskeleton. Here, we describe the cytoskeletal structures, factors, and signaling pathways that orchestrate this robust and yet highly dynamic process in animal cells. Finally, we discuss possible future directions in this growing area of cell division research and its implications in human diseases, including cancer. ","694":"Brain metabolism is characterized by fuel monodependence, high-energy expenditure, autonomy from the rest of body, local recycling, and marked division of labor between cell types. Although neurons spend most of the brain's energy on signaling, astrocytes bear the brunt of the metabolic load, controlling the composition of the interstitial fluid, supplying neurons with energy substrates and precursors for biosynthesis, and recycling neurotransmitters, oxidized scavengers, and other waste products. Outstanding questions in this field are the role of oligodendrocytes, the metabolic behavior of the different subtypes of astrocytes during development and disease, and the emerging notion that metabolism may participate directly in information processing.","695":"In this article, we will discuss the biochemistry of mitosis in eukaryotic cells. We will focus on conserved principles that, importantly, are adapted to the biology of the organism. It is vital to bear in mind that the structural requirements for division in a rapidly dividing syncytial Drosophila embryo, for example, are markedly different from those in a unicellular yeast cell. Nevertheless, division in both systems is driven by conserved modules of antagonistic protein kinases and phosphatases, underpinned by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, which create molecular switches to drive each stage of division forward. These conserved control modules combine with the self-organizing properties of the subcellular architecture to meet the specific needs of the cell. Our discussion will draw on discoveries in several model systems that have been important in the long history of research on mitosis, and we will try to point out those principles that appear to apply to all cells, compared with those in which the biochemistry has been specifically adapted in a particular organism. ","696":"Astrocytes, through their close associations with synapses, can monitor and alter synaptic function, thus actively controlling synaptic transmission in the adult brain. Besides their important role at adult synapses, in the last three decades a number of critical findings have highlighted the importance of astrocytes in the establishment of synaptic connectivity in the developing brain. In this article, we will review the key findings on astrocytic control of synapse formation, function, and elimination. First, we will summarize our current structural and functional understanding of astrocytes at the synapse. Then, we will discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which developing and mature astrocytes instruct the formation, maturation, and refinement of synapses. Our aim is to provide an overview of astrocytes as important players in the establishment of a functional nervous system. ","697":"The hippocampal system is critical for storage and retrieval of declarative memories, including memories for locations and events that take place at those locations. Spatial memories place high demands on capacity. Memories must be distinct to be recalled without interference and encoding must be fast. Recent studies have indicated that hippocampal networks allow for fast storage of large quantities of uncorrelated spatial information. The aim of the this article is to review and discuss some of this work, taking as a starting point the discovery of multiple functionally specialized cell types of the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit, such as place, grid, and border cells. We will show that grid cells provide the hippocampus with a metric, as well as a putative mechanism for decorrelation of representations, that the formation of environment-specific place maps depends on mechanisms for long-term plasticity in the hippocampus, and that long-term spatiotemporal memory storage may depend on offline consolidation processes related to sharp-wave ripple activity in the hippocampus. The multitude of representations generated through interactions between a variety of functionally specialized cell types in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit may be at the heart of the mechanism for declarative memory formation. ","698":"Despite a growing understanding of how epigenetic marks such as histone modifications locally modify the activity of the chromatin with which they are associated, we know little about how marked regions on different parts of the genome are able to intercommunicate to effect regulation of gene expression programs. Recent advances in methods that systematically map pairwise chromatin interactions have uncovered important principles of chromosome folding, which are tightly linked to the epigenetic mark profiles and, hence, functional state of the underlying chromatin fiber. ","699":"Changes in gene copy number are among the most frequent mutational events in all genomes and were among the mutations for which a physical basis was first known. Yet mechanisms of gene duplication remain uncertain because formation rates are difficult to measure and mechanisms may vary with position in a genome. Duplications are compared here to deletions, which seem formally similar but can arise at very different rates by distinct mechanisms. Methods of assessing duplication rates and dependencies are described with several proposed formation mechanisms. Emphasis is placed on duplications formed in extensively studied experimental situations. Duplications studied in microbes are compared with those observed in metazoan cells, specifically those in genomes of cancer cells. Duplications, and especially their derived amplifications, are suggested to form by multistep processes often under positive selection for increased copy number. ","700":"The formation of heteroduplex DNA is a central step in the exchange of DNA sequences via homologous recombination, and in the accurate repair of broken chromosomes via homology-directed repair pathways. In cells, heteroduplex DNA largely arises through the activities of recombination proteins that promote DNA-pairing and annealing reactions. Classes of proteins involved in pairing and annealing include RecA-family DNA-pairing proteins, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins, recombination mediator proteins, annealing proteins, and nucleases. This review explores the properties of these pairing and annealing proteins, and highlights their roles in complex recombination processes including the double Holliday junction (DhJ) formation, synthesis-dependent strand annealing, and single-strand annealing pathways--DNA transactions that are critical both for genome stability in individual organisms and for the evolution of species.","701":"The centrosome was discovered in the late 19th century when mitosis was first described. Long recognized as a key organelle of the spindle pole, its core component, the centriole, was realized more than 50 or so years later also to comprise the basal body of the cilium. Here, we chart the more recent acquisition of a molecular understanding of centrosome structure and function. The strategies for gaining such knowledge were quickly developed in the yeasts to decipher the structure and function of their distinctive spindle pole bodies. Only within the past decade have studies with model eukaryotes and cultured cells brought a similar degree of sophistication to our understanding of the centrosome duplication cycle and the multiple roles of this organelle and its component parts in cell division and signaling. Now as we begin to understand these functions in the context of development, the way is being opened up for studies of the roles of centrosomes in human disease. ","702":"Signaling pathways regulate contraction of striated (skeletal and cardiac) and smooth muscle. Although these are similar, there are striking differences in the pathways that can be attributed to the distinct functional roles of the different muscle types. Muscles contract in response to depolarization, activation of G-protein-coupled receptors and other stimuli. The actomyosin fibers responsible for contraction require an increase in the cytosolic levels of calcium, which signaling pathways induce by promoting influx from extracellular sources or release from intracellular stores. Rises in cytosolic calcium stimulate numerous downstream calcium-dependent signaling pathways, which can also regulate contraction. Alterations to the signaling pathways that initiate and sustain contraction and relaxation occur as a consequence of exercise and pathophysiological conditions. ","703":"Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that control the migration and positioning of immune cells in tissues and are critical for the function of the innate immune system. Chemokines control the release of innate immune cells from the bone marrow during homeostasis as well as in response to infection and inflammation. They also recruit innate immune effectors out of the circulation and into the tissue where, in collaboration with other chemoattractants, they guide these cells to the very sites of tissue injury. Chemokine function is also critical for the positioning of innate immune sentinels in peripheral tissue and then, following innate immune activation, guiding these activated cells to the draining lymph node to initiate and imprint an adaptive immune response. In this review, we will highlight recent advances in understanding how chemokine function regulates the movement and positioning of innate immune cells at homeostasis and in response to acute inflammation, and then we will review how chemokine-mediated innate immune cell trafficking plays an essential role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses. ","704":"Sexual conflict likely plays a crucial role in the origin and maintenance of homosexuality in our species. Although environmental factors are known to affect human homosexual (HS) preference, sibling concordances and population patterns related to HS indicate that genetic components are also influencing this trait in humans. We argue that multilocus, partially X-linked genetic factors undergoing sexually antagonistic selection that promote maternal female fecundity at the cost of occasional male offspring homosexuality are the best candidates capable of explaining the frequency, familial clustering, and pedigree asymmetries observed in HS male proband families. This establishes male HS as a paradigmatic example of sexual conflict in human biology. HS in females, on the other hand, is currently a more elusive phenomenon from both the empirical and theoretical standpoints because of its fluidity and marked environmental influence. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, the latter involving sexually antagonistic components, have been hypothesized for the propagation and maintenance of female HS in the population. However, further data are needed to truly clarify the evolutionary dynamics of this trait. ","705":"Malignant glioma remains incurable despite tremendous advancement in basic research and clinical practice. The identification of the cell(s) of origin should provide deep insights into leverage points for one to halt disease progression. Here we summarize recent studies that support the notion that neural stem cell (NSC), astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) can all serve as the cell of origin. We also lay out important considerations on technical rigor for further exploring this subject. Finally, we share perspectives on how one could apply the knowledge of cell of origin to develop effective treatment methods. Although it will be a difficult battle, victory should be within reach as along as we continue to assimilate new information and facilitate the collaboration among basic scientists, translational researchers, and clinicians.","706":"Meiosis is the specialized cell division that generates gametes. In contrast to mitosis, molecular mechanisms and regulation of meiosis are much less understood. Meiosis shares mechanisms and regulation with mitosis in many aspects, but also has critical differences from mitosis. This review highlights these differences between meiosis and mitosis. Recent studies using various model systems revealed differences in a surprisingly wide range of aspects, including cell-cycle regulation, recombination, postrecombination events, spindle assembly, chromosome-spindle interaction, and chromosome segregation. Although a great degree of diversity can be found among organisms, meiosis-specific processes, and regulation are generally conserved.","707":"We provide an overview of recent progress on the study of astrocyte intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. We consider the methods that have been used to monitor astrocyte Ca(2+) signals, the various types of Ca(2+) signals that have been discovered (waves, microdomains, and intrinsic fluctuations), the approaches used to broadly trigger and block Ca(2+) signals, and, where possible, the proposed and demonstrated physiological roles for astrocyte Ca(2+) signals within neuronal microcircuits. Although important progress has been made, we suggest that further detailed work is needed to explore the biophysics and molecular mechanisms of Ca(2+) signaling within entire astrocytes, including their fine distal extensions, such as processes that interact spatially with neurons and blood vessels. Improved methods are also needed to mimic and block molecularly defined types of Ca(2+) signals within genetically specified populations of astrocytes. Moreover, it will be essential to study astrocyte Ca(2+) activity in vivo to distinguish between pharmacological and physiological activity, and to study Ca(2+) activity in situ to rigorously explore mechanisms. Once methods to reliably measure, mimic, and block specific astrocyte Ca(2+) signals with high temporal and spatial precision are available, researchers will be able to carefully explore the correlative and causative roles that Ca(2+) signals may play in the functions of astrocytes, blood vessels, neurons, and microcircuits in the healthy and diseased brain. ","708":"The discovery that extrapair copulation (EPC) and extrapair paternity (EPP) are common in birds led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the evolution of mating systems. The prevalence of extrapair matings in pair-bonded species sets the stage for sexual conflict, and a recent focus has been to consider how this conflict can shape variation in extrapair mating rates. Here, we invert the causal arrow and consider the consequences of extrapair matings for sexual conflict. Extrapair matings shift sexual conflict from a simple two-player (male vs. female) game to a game with three or more players, the nature of which we illustrate with simple diagrams that highlight the net costs and benefits of extrapair matings to each player. This approach helps identify the sorts of traits that might be under selection because of sexual conflict. Whether EPP is driven primarily by the extrapair male or the within-pair female profoundly influences which players are in conflict, but the overall pattern of conflict varies little among different mating systems. Different aspects of conflict are manifest at different stages of the breeding cycle and can be profitably considered as distinct episodes of selection caused by conflict. This perspective is illuminating both because conflict between specific players can change across episodes and because the traits that evolve to mediate conflict likely differ between episodes. Although EPP clearly leads to sexual conflict, we suggest that the link between sexual conflict and multiple paternity might be usefully understood by examining how deviations from lifetime sexual monogamy influence sexual conflict. ","709":"Sisters and brothers are completely unrelated with respect to the sex chromosomes they inherit from their heterogametic parent. This has the potential to result in a previously unappreciated form of genetic conflict between the sex chromosomes, called sexually antagonistic zygotic drive (SA-ZD). SA-ZD can arise whenever brothers and sisters compete over limited resources or there is brother-sister mating coupled with inbreeding depression. Although theory predicts that SA-ZD should be common and influence important evolutionary processes, there is little empirical evidence for its existence. Here we discuss the current understanding of SA-ZD, why it would be expected to elude empirical detection when present, and how it relates to other forms of genetic conflict. ","710":null,"711":"The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has served as a fruitful setting for understanding conserved biological processes. The past decade has seen the rise of this model organism as an important tool for uncovering the mysteries of the glial cell, which partners with neurons to generate a functioning nervous system in all animals. C. elegans affords unparalleled single-cell resolution in vivo in examining glia-neuron interactions, and similarities between C. elegans and vertebrate glia suggest that lessons learned from this nematode are likely to have general implications. Here, I summarize what has been gleaned over the past decade since C. elegans glia research became a concerted area of focus. Studies have revealed that glia are essential elements of a functioning C. elegans nervous system and play key roles in its development. Importantly, glial influence on neuronal function appears to be dynamic. Key questions for the field to address in the near- and long-term have emerged, and these are discussed within. ","712":"Blood vessels are critical to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all of the tissues and organs throughout the body. The blood vessels that vascularize the central nervous system (CNS) possess unique properties, termed the blood-brain barrier, which allow these vessels to tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the brain. This precise control of CNS homeostasis allows for proper neuronal function and also protects the neural tissue from toxins and pathogens, and alterations of these barrier properties are an important component of pathology and progression of different neurological diseases. The physiological barrier is coordinated by a series of physical, transport, and metabolic properties possessed by the endothelial cells (ECs) that form the walls of the blood vessels, and these properties are regulated by interactions with different vascular, immune, and neural cells. Understanding how these different cell populations interact to regulate the barrier properties is essential for understanding how the brain functions during health and disease. ","713":"Histones package and compact DNA by assembling into nucleosome core particles. Most histones are synthesized at S phase for rapid deposition behind replication forks. In addition, the replacement of histones deposited during S phase by variants that can be deposited independently of replication provide the most fundamental level of chromatin differentiation. Alternative mechanisms for depositing different variants can potentially establish and maintain epigenetic states. Variants have also evolved crucial roles in chromosome segregation, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and other processes. Investigations into the evolution, structure, and metabolism of histone variants provide a foundation for understanding the participation of chromatin in important cellular processes and in epigenetic memory. ","714":"Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription. Emerging studies, showing that eRNAs function in controlling mRNA transcription, challenge the idea that enhancers are merely sites of transcription factor assembly. Instead, communication between promoters and enhancers can be bidirectional with promoters required to activate enhancer transcription. Reciprocally, eRNAs may then facilitate enhancer-promoter interaction or activate promoter-driven transcription. ","715":null,"716":"Sex chromosome drivers are selfish elements that subvert Mendel's first law of segregation and therefore are overrepresented among the products of meiosis. The sex-biased progeny produced then fuels an extended genetic conflict between the driver and the rest of the genome. Many examples of sex chromosome drive are known, but the occurrence of this phenomenon is probably largely underestimated because of the difficulty to detect it. Remarkably, nearly all sex chromosome drivers are found in two clades, Rodentia and Diptera. Although very little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of drive, epigenetic processes such as chromatin regulation could be involved in many instances. Yet, its evolutionary consequences are far-reaching, from the evolution of mating systems and sex determination to the emergence of new species. ","717":"Work over the past 20 years has implicated electrically nonexcitable astrocytes in complex neural functions. Despite controversies, it is increasingly clear that many, if not all, neural processes involve astrocytes. This review critically examines past work to identify the commonalities among the many published studies of neuroglia signaling. Although several studies have shown that astrocytes can impact short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, further work is required to determine the requirement for astrocytic Ca(2+) and other second messengers in these processes. One of the roadblocks to the field advancing at a rapid pace has been technical. We predict that the novel experimental tools that have emerged in recent years will accelerate the field and likely disclose an entirely novel path of neuroglia signaling within the near future. ","718":"Sexual reproduction requires coordinated contributions from both sexes to proceed efficiently. However, the reproductive strategies that the sexes adopt often have the potential to give rise to sexual conflict because they can result in divergent, sex-specific costs and benefits. These conflicts can occur at many levels, from molecular to behavioral. Here, we consider sexual conflict mediated through the actions of seminal fluid proteins. These proteins provide many excellent examples in which to trace the operation of sexual conflict from molecules through to behavior. Seminal fluid proteins are made by males and provided to females during mating. As agents that can modulate egg production at several steps, as well as reproductive behavior, sperm \"management,\" and female feeding, activity, and longevity, the actions of seminal proteins are prime targets for sexual conflict. We review these actions in the context of sexual conflict. We discuss genomic signatures in seminal protein (and related) genes that are consistent with current or previous sexual conflict. Finally, we note promising areas for future study and highlight real-world practical situations that will benefit from understanding the nature of sexual conflicts mediated by seminal proteins. ","719":"Macrophages are widely distributed throughout the body, performing vital homeostatic and defense functions after local and systemic perturbation within tissues. In concert with closely related dendritic cells and other myeloid and lymphoid cells, which mediate the innate and adaptive immune response, macrophages determine the outcome of the inflammatory and repair processes that accompany sterile and infectious injury and microbial invasion. This article will describe and compare the role of specialized macrophage populations at two critical interfaces between the resident host lymphohematopoietic system and circulating blood and lymph, the carriers of cells, humoral components, microorganisms, and their products. Sinusoidal macrophages in the marginal zone of the spleen and subcapsular sinus and medulla of secondary lymph nodes contribute to the innate and adaptive responses of the host in health and disease. Although historically recognized as major constituents of the reticuloendothelial system, it has only recently become apparent that these specialized macrophages in close proximity to B and T lymphocytes play an indispensable role in recognition and responses to exogenous and endogenous ligands, thus shaping the nature and quality of immunity and inflammation. We review current understanding of these macrophages and identify gaps in our knowledge for further investigation. ","720":"Animal studies are now showing the exciting potential to achieve significant functional recovery following central nervous system (CNS) injury by manipulating both the inefficient intracellular growth machinery in neurons, as well as the extracellular barriers, which further limit their regenerative potential. In this review, we have focused on the three major glial cell types: oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia\/macrophages, in addition to some of their precursors, which form major extrinsic barriers to regrowth in the injured CNS. Although axotomized neurons in the CNS have, at best, a limited capacity to regenerate or sprout, there is accumulating evidence that even in the adult and, especially after boosting their growth motor, neurons possess the capacity for considerable circuit reorganization and even lengthy regeneration when these glial obstacles to neuronal regrowth are modified, eliminated, or overcome. ","721":"De novo transcription of DNA is a fundamental requirement for the formation of long-term memory. It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation. In this article, we provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to this transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation. ","722":"Homology search and DNA strand-exchange reactions are central to homologous recombination in meiosis. During meiosis, these processes are regulated such that the probability of choosing a homolog chromatid as recombination partner is enhanced relative to that of choosing a sister chromatid. This regulatory process occurs as homologous chromosomes pair in preparation for assembly of the synaptonemal complex. Two strand-exchange proteins, Rad51 and Dmc1, cooperate in regulated homology search and strand exchange in most organisms. Here, we summarize studies on the properties of these two proteins and their accessory factors. In addition, we review current models for the assembly of meiotic strand-exchange complexes and the possible mechanisms through which the interhomolog bias of recombination partner choice is achieved. ","723":"The study of epigenetics in plants has a long and rich history, from initial descriptions of non-Mendelian gene behaviors to seminal discoveries of chromatin-modifying proteins and RNAs that mediate gene silencing in most eukaryotes, including humans. Genetic screens in the model plant Arabidopsis have been particularly rewarding, identifying more than 130 epigenetic regulators thus far. The diversity of epigenetic pathways in plants is remarkable, presumably contributing to the phenotypic plasticity of plant postembryonic development and the ability to survive and reproduce in unpredictable environments. ","724":"In cancer, epigenetic proteins are intensely studied targets for therapeutic drug discovery, showing great promise. These proteins include the chromatin-modifying enzymes that \"write\" and \"erase\" histone posttranslational modifications (PTM), and those that \"read\" these marks through binding modules. In an effort to find a compound that could disrupt the protein-protein interactions between a PTM and reader, JQ1 has proven to be a first-in-class, drug-like inhibitor of the \"bromodomain and extraterminal domain\" epigenetic readers (BETs), which recognize histone lysine acetylation marks. JQ1 has facilitated the mechanistic study and therapeutic application in cancer of this kind of epigenetic inhibition. By using this chemical probe, we have discovered that the bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) have compelling activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In particular, BETi down-regulates the MYC, IL-7R, and E2F transcriptional programs. We are continuously integrating the transcriptional consequences of BETi with changes in the epigenomic landscapes of cancer cells to elucidate the mechanisms underlying response to BETi using chemical and genetic perturbations. ","725":"A fundamental challenge for the survival of all organisms is maintaining the integrity of the genome in all cells. Cells must therefore segregate their replicated genome equally during each cell division. Eukaryotic organisms package their genome into a number of physically distinct chromosomes, which replicate during S phase and condense during prophase of mitosis to form paired sister chromatids. During mitosis, cells form a physical connection between each sister chromatid and microtubules of the mitotic spindle, which segregate one copy of each chromatid to each new daughter cell. The centromere is the DNA locus on each chromosome that creates the site of this connection. In this review, we present a brief history of centromere research and discuss our current knowledge of centromere establishment, maintenance, composition, structure, and function in mitosis. ","726":"Astrocytes have many roles within the brain parenchyma, and a subpopulation restricted to germinal niches functions as neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce various types of neuronal progeny in relation to spatiotemporal factors. A growing body of evidence supports the concept of morphological and molecular differences between astrocytes in different brain regions, which might relate to their derivation from regionally patterned radial glia. Indeed, the notion that astrocytes are molecularly and functionally heterogeneous could help explain how the central nervous system (CNS) retains embryonic positional information into adulthood. Here, we discuss recent evidence for regionally encoded functions of astrocytes in the developing and adult CNS to provide an integrated concept of the origin and possible function of astrocyte heterogeneity. We focus on the regionalization of NSCs in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain and emerging evidence for a segmental organization of astrocytes in the developing spinal cord and forebrain. We propose that astrocytes' diversity will provide fundamental clues to understand regional brain organization and function. ","727":"Allergic inflammation is associated closely with parasite infection but also asthma and other common allergic diseases. Despite the engagement of similar immunologic pathways, parasitized individuals often show no outward manifestations of allergic disease. In this perspective, we present the thesis that allergic inflammatory responses play a primary role in regulating circadian and environmental inputs involved with tissue homeostasis and metabolic needs. Parasites feed into these pathways and thus engage allergic inflammation to sustain aspects of the parasitic life cycle. In response to parasite infection, an adaptive and regulated immune response is layered on the host effector response, but in the setting of allergy, the effector response remains unregulated, thus leading to the cardinal features of disease. Further understanding of the homeostatic pressures driving allergic inflammation holds promise to further our understanding of human health and the treatment of these common afflictions. ","728":"The problem of recognizing and disposing of non-self-organisms, whether for nutrients or defense, predates the evolution of multicellularity. Accordingly, the function of the innate immune system is often intimately associated with fundamental aspects of cell biology. Here, we review our current understanding of the links between cell biology and pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system. We highlight the importance of receptor localization for the detection of microbes and for the initiation of antimicrobial signaling pathways. We discuss examples that illustrate how pattern-recognition receptors influence, and are influenced by, the general membrane trafficking machinery of mammalian cells. In the future, cell biological analysis likely will rival pure genetic analysis as a tool to uncover fundamental principles that govern host-microbe interactions. ","729":"The zebrafish is a premier vertebrate model system that offers many experimental advantages for in vivo imaging and genetic studies. This review provides an overview of glial cell types in the central and peripheral nervous system of zebrafish. We highlight some recent work that exploited the strengths of the zebrafish system to increase the understanding of the role of Gpr126 in Schwann cell myelination and illuminate the mechanisms controlling oligodendrocyte development and myelination. We also summarize similarities and differences between zebrafish radial glia and mammalian astrocytes and consider the possibility that their distinct characteristics may represent extremes in a continuum of cell identity. Finally, we focus on the emergence of zebrafish as a model for elucidating the development and function of microglia. These recent studies have highlighted the power of the zebrafish system for analyzing important aspects of glial development and function. ","730":"At the end of the last century, sexual conflict was identified as a powerful engine of speciation, potentially even more important than ecological selection. Earlier work that followed--experimental, comparative, and mathematical--provided strong initial support for this assertion. However, as the field matures, both the power of sexual conflict and constraints on the evolution of reproductive isolation as driven by sexual conflict are becoming better understood. From theoretical studies, we now know that speciation is only one of several possible evolutionary outcomes of sexual conflict. In line with these predictions, both experimental evolution studies and comparative analyses of fertilization proteins and of species richness show that sexual conflict leads to, or is associated with, reproductive isolation and speciation in some cases but not in others. Increased genetic variation (especially in females) without reproductive isolation is an underappreciated consequence of sexually antagonistic selection.","731":"Acute and chronic inflammation is associated with changes in microvascular form and function. At rest, endothelial cells maintain a nonthrombogenic, nonreactive surface at the interface between blood and tissue. However, on activation by proinflammatory mediators, the endothelium becomes a major participant in the generation of the inflammatory response. These functions of endothelium are modified by the other cell populations of the microvessel wall, namely pericytes, and smooth muscle cells. This article reviews recent advances in understanding the roles played by microvessels in inflammation. ","732":"In addition to their many functions in the healthy central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes respond to CNS damage and disease through a process called astrogliosis. For many decades, astrogliosis was sparsely studied and enigmatic. This article examines recent evidence supporting a definition of astrogliosis as a spectrum of heterogeneous potential changes in astrocytes that occur in a context-specific manner as determined by diverse signaling events that vary with the nature and severity of different CNS insults. Astrogliosis is associated with essential beneficial functions, but under specific circumstances can lead to harmful effects. Potential dysfunctions of astrocytes and astrogliosis are being identified that can contribute to, or be primary causes of, CNS disorders, leading to the notion of astrocytopathies. A conceptual framework is presented that allows consideration of normally occurring and dysfunctional astrogliosis and their different roles in CNS disorders. ","733":"Sex-biased gene expression is likely to account for most sexually dimorphic traits because males and females share much of their genome. When fitness optima differ between sexes for a shared trait, sexual dimorphism can allow each sex to express their optimum trait phenotype, and in this way, the evolution of sex-biased gene expression is one mechanism that could help to resolve intralocus sexual conflict. Genome-wide patterns of sex-biased gene expression have been identified in a number of studies, which we review here. However, very little is known about how sex-biased gene expression relates to sex-specific fitness and about how sex-biased gene expression and conflict vary throughout development or across different genotypes, populations, and environments. We discuss the importance of these neglected areas of research and use data from a small-scale experiment on sex-specific expression of genes throughout development to highlight potentially interesting avenues for future research. ","734":"Mammalian immunity evolved by the process of natural selection that produced differential survival and reproduction advantages through combinations of hereditary traits underlying the response to pathogens. Primitive animals sense the presence of microbial pathogens through recognition of pathogen-derived molecules in their rudimentary immune and nervous systems. No molecular biological mechanism assigns primacy of pathogen sensing mechanisms to immune cells over neurons. Rather, in animals as diverse as Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, neural reflexes are activated by the presence of pathogens and transduce neural mechanisms that control the development of immunity. A coming revolution in immunological thinking will require immunologists to incorporate neural circuits into understanding pathogen signal transduction, and the molecular mechanisms of learning, that culminate in immunity. ","735":"Polycomb-group (PcG) genes encode chromatin proteins involved in stable and heritable transcriptional silencing. PcG proteins participate in distinct multimeric complexes that deposit, or bind to, specific histone modifications (e.g., H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1) to prevent gene activation and maintain repressed chromatin domains. PcG proteins are evolutionary conserved and play a role in processes ranging from vernalization and seed development in plants, over X-chromosome inactivation in mammals, to the maintenance of stem cell identity. PcG silencing is medically relevant as it is often observed in human disorders, including cancer, and tissue regeneration, which involve the reprogramming of PcG-controlled target genes. ","736":"","737":"We have come a long way in the 55 years since Edmond Fischer and the late Edwin Krebs discovered that the activity of glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation. Many of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that operate in biological signaling have since been characterized and the vast web of interconnected pathways that make up the cellular signaling network has been mapped in considerable detail. Nonetheless, it is important to consider how fast this field is still moving and the issues at the current boundaries of our understanding. One must also appreciate what experimental strategies have allowed us to attain our present level of knowledge. We summarize here some key issues (both conceptual and methodological), raise unresolved questions, discuss potential pitfalls, and highlight areas in which our understanding is still rudimentary. We hope these wide-ranging ruminations will be useful to investigators who carry studies of signal transduction forward during the rest of the 21st century. ","738":"Mounting of the acute inflammatory response is crucial for host defense and pivotal to the development of chronic inflammation, fibrosis, or abscess formation versus the protective response and the need of the host tissues to return to homeostasis. Within self-limited acute inflammatory exudates, novel families of lipid mediators are identified, named resolvins (Rv), protectins, and maresins, which actively stimulate cardinal signs of resolution, namely, cessation of leukocytic infiltration, counterregulation of proinflammatory mediators, and the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils and cellular debris. The biosynthesis of these resolution-phase mediators in sensu stricto is initiated during lipid-mediator class switching, in which the classic initiators of acute inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes (LTs), switch to produce specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In this work, we review recent evidence on the structure and functional roles of these novel lipid mediators of resolution. Together, these show that leukocyte trafficking and temporal spatial signals govern the resolution of self-limited inflammation and stimulate homeostasis. ","739":"Of the approximately 70 human Rab GTPases, nearly three-quarters are involved in endocytic trafficking. Significant plasticity in endosomal membrane transport pathways is closely coupled to receptor signaling and Rab GTPase-regulated scaffolds. Here we review current literature pertaining to endocytic Rab GTPase localizations, functions, and coordination with regulatory proteins and effectors. The roles of Rab GTPases in (1) compartmentalization of the endocytic pathway into early, recycling, late, and lysosomal routes; (2) coordination of individual transport steps from vesicle budding to fusion; (3) effector interactomes; and (4) integration of GTPase and signaling cascades are discussed. ","740":"The links between recombination and replication have been appreciated for decades and it is now generally accepted that these two fundamental aspects of DNA metabolism are inseparable: Homologous recombination is essential for completion of DNA replication and vice versa. This review focuses on the roles that recombination enzymes play in underpinning genome duplication, aiding replication fork movement in the face of the many replisome barriers that challenge genome stability. These links have many conserved features across all domains of life, reflecting the conserved nature of the substrate for these reactions, DNA.

In this review, I focus on two of the best-studied multicellular groups of green algae: charophytes and volvocines. Charophyte algae are the closest relatives of land plants and encompass the transition from unicellularity to simple multicellularity. Many of the innovations present in land plants have their roots in the cell and developmental biology of charophyte algae. Volvocine algae evolved an independent route to multicellularity that is captured by a graded series of increasing cell-type specialization and developmental complexity. The study of volvocine algae has provided unprecedented insights into the innovations required to achieve multicellularity. ","743":"Meiotic recombination involves the formation and repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the conserved Spo11 protein. This review summarizes recent studies pertaining to the formation of meiotic DSBs, including the mechanism of DNA cleavage by Spo11, proteins required for break formation, and mechanisms that control the location, timing, and number of DSBs. Where appropriate, findings in different organisms are discussed to highlight evolutionary conservation or divergence. ","744":"Recognition of an invading pathogen is critical to elicit protective responses. Certain microbial structures and molecules, which are crucial for their survival and virulence, are recognized by different families of evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). This recognition initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the transcription of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to eliminate pathogens and attract immune cells, thereby perpetuating further adaptive immune responses. Considerable research on the molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions has resulted in the discovery of multifarious PRRs. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in microbial recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular nucleic acid sensors and the signaling pathways initiated by them. ","745":"Traits that increase a male's fertilization success during sperm competition can be harmful to females and therefore represent a source of sexual conflict. In this review, we consider the variety of male adaptations to sperm competition (MASC) that may give rise to sexual conflict-including mate guarding, prolonged copulations, the transfer of large numbers of sperm, and the manipulation of females through nonsperm components of the ejaculate. We then reflect on the fitness economics influencing the escalation of these sexual conflicts, considering the likelihood of females evolving traits to offset the negative effects of MASC when compared with the strong selection on males that lead to MASC. We conclude by discussing the potential evolutionary outcomes of sexual conflict arising from MASC, including the opportunities for females to mitigate conflict costs and the prospects for conflict resolution. ","746":"Homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange are at the core of homologous recombination. These reactions are promoted by a DNA-strand-exchange protein assembled into a nucleoprotein filament comprising the DNA-pairing protein, ATP, and single-stranded DNA. The catalytic activity of this molecular machine depends on control of its dynamic instability by accessory factors. Here we discuss proteins known as recombination mediators that facilitate formation and functional activation of the DNA-strand-exchange protein filament. Although the basics of homologous pairing and DNA-strand exchange are highly conserved in evolution, differences in mediator function are required to cope with differences in how single-stranded DNA is packaged by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein in different species, and the biochemical details of how the different DNA-strand-exchange proteins nucleate and extend into a nucleoprotein filament. The set of (potential) mediator proteins has apparently expanded greatly in evolution, raising interesting questions about the need for additional control and coordination of homologous recombination in more complex organisms. ","747":"Up to 60 different proteins are recruited to the site of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in an ordered sequence. These accessory proteins have roles during all the different stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. First, they participate in the initiation of the endocytic event, thereby determining when and where endocytic vesicles are made; later they are involved in the maturation of the clathrin coat, recruitment of specific cargo molecules, bending of the membrane, and finally in scission and uncoating of the nascent vesicle. In addition, many of the accessory components are involved in regulating and coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the endocytic membrane. We will discuss the different accessory components and their various roles. Most of the data comes from studies performed with cultured mammalian cells or yeast cells. The process of endocytosis is well conserved between these different organisms, but there are also many interesting differences that may shed light on the mechanistic principles of endocytosis. ","748":"Intralocus sexual conflict and intragenomic conflict both affect sex chromosome evolution and can in extreme cases even cause the complete turnover of sex chromosomes. Additionally, established sex chromosomes often become the focus of heightened conflict. This creates a tangled relationship between sex chromosomes and conflict with respect to cause and effect. To further complicate matters, sexual and intragenomic conflict may exacerbate one another and thereby further fuel sex chromosome change. Different magnitudes and foci of conflict offer potential explanations for lineage-specific variation in sex chromosome evolution and answer long-standing questions as to why some sex chromosomes are remarkably stable, whereas others show rapid rates of evolutionary change. ","749":"Animals evolved in seas teeming with bacteria, yet the influences of bacteria on animal origins are poorly understood. Comparisons among modern animals and their closest living relatives, the choanoflagellates, suggest that the first animals used flagellated collar cells to capture bacterial prey. The cell biology of prey capture, such as cell adhesion between predator and prey, involves mechanisms that may have been co-opted to mediate intercellular interactions during the evolution of animal multicellularity. Moreover, a history of bacterivory may have influenced the evolution of animal genomes by driving the evolution of genetic pathways for immunity and facilitating lateral gene transfer. Understanding the interactions between bacteria and the progenitors of animals may help to explain the myriad ways in which bacteria shape the biology of modern animals, including ourselves. ","750":"The trithorax group of genes (trxG) was identified in mutational screens that examined developmental phenotypes and suppression of Polycomb mutant phenotypes. The protein products of these genes are primarily involved in gene activation, although some can also have repressive effects. There is no central function for these proteins. Some move nucleosomes about on the genome in an ATP-dependent manner, some covalently modify histones such as methylating lysine 4 of histone H3, and some directly interact with the transcription machinery or are a part of that machinery. It is interesting to consider why these specific members of large families of functionally related proteins have strong developmental phenotypes. ","751":"Methylation of the base cytosine in DNA is critical for silencing endogenous retroviruses, regulating gene expression, and establishing cellular identity, and has long been regarded as an indelible epigenetic mark. The recent discovery that the ten eleven translocation (TET) proteins can oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and other oxidized cytosine variants in the genome has triggered a paradigm shift in our understanding of how dynamic changes in DNA methylation regulate transcription and cellular differentiation, thus influencing normal development and disease. ","752":"Strict maternal transmission creates an \"asymmetric sieve\" favoring the spread of mutations in organelle genomes that increase female fitness, but diminish male fitness. This phenomenon, called \"Mother's Curse,\" can be viewed as an asymmetrical case of intralocus sexual conflict. The evolutionary logic of Mother's Curse applies to each member of the offspring microbiome, the community of maternally provisioned microbes, believed to number in the hundreds, if not thousands, of species for host vertebrates, including humans. Taken together, these observations pose a compelling evolutionary paradox: How has maternal transmission of an offspring microbiome become a near universal characteristic of the animal kingdom when the genome of each member of that community poses a potential evolutionary threat to the fitness of host males? I review features that limit or reverse Mother's Curse and contribute to resolving this paradox. I suggest that the evolution of vertical symbiont transmission requires conditions that mitigate the evolutionary threat to host males. ","753":"The generation of haploid gametes by meiosis is a highly conserved process for sexually reproducing organisms that, in almost all cases, involves the extensive breakage of chromosomes. These chromosome breaks occur during meiotic prophase and are essential for meiotic recombination as well as the subsequent segregation of homologous chromosomes. However, their formation and repair must be carefully monitored and choreographed with nuclear dynamics and the cell division program to avoid the creation of aberrant chromosomes and defective gametes. It is becoming increasingly clear that an intricate checkpoint-signaling network related to the canonical DNA damage response is deeply interwoven with the meiotic program and preserves order during meiotic prophase. This meiotic checkpoint network (MCN) creates a wide range of dependent relationships controlling chromosome movement, chromosome pairing, chromatin structure, and double-strand break (DSB) repair. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the MCN. We discuss commonalities and differences in different experimental systems, with a particular emphasis on the emerging design principles that control and limit cross talk between signals to ultimately ensure the faithful inheritance of chromosomes by the next generation.

Evolutionary cell biological studies have been unraveling the history of proteins responsible for vesicle transport and organelle identity revealing both highly conserved components and lineage-specific innovations. Recently, endomembrane components with a broad, but patchy, distribution have been observed as well, pieces that are missing from our cell biological and evolutionary models of membrane trafficking. These data together allow for new insights into the history and forces that shape the evolution of this critical cell biological system. ","755":null,"756":"Parental care is an immensely variable social behavior, and sexual conflict offers a powerful paradigm to understand this diversity. Conflict over care (usually considered as a type of postzygotic sexual conflict) is common, because the evolutionary interests of male and female parents are rarely identical. I investigate how sexual conflict over care may facilitate the emergence and maintenance of diverse parenting strategies and argue that researchers should combine two fundamental concepts in social behavior to understand care patterns: cooperation and conflict. Behavioral evidence of conflict over care is well established, studies have estimated specific fitness implications of conflict for males or females, and experiments have investigated specific components of conflict. However, studies are long overdue to reveal the full implications of conflict for both males and females. Manipulating (or harming) the opposite sex seems less common in postzygotic conflicts than in prezygotic conflicts because by manipulating, coercing, or harming the opposite sex, the reproductive interest of the actor is also reduced. Parental care is a complex trait, although few studies have yet considered the implications of multidimensionality for parental conflict. Future research in parental conflict will benefit from understanding the behavioral interactions between male and female parents (e.g., negotiation, learning, and coercion), the genetic and neurogenomic bases of parental behavior, and the influence of social environment on parental strategies. Empirical studies are needed to put sexual conflict in a population context and reveal feedback between mate choice, pair bonds and parenting strategies, and their demographic consequences for the population such as mortalities and sex ratios. Taken together, sexual conflict offers a fascinating avenue for understanding the causes and consequences of parenting behavior, sex roles, and breeding system evolution. ","757":"Hermaphrodites combine the male and female sex functions into a single individual, either sequentially or simultaneously. This simple fact means that they exhibit both similarities and differences in the way in which they experience, and respond to, sexual conflict compared to separate-sexed organisms. Here, we focus on clarifying how sexual conflict concepts can be adapted to apply to all anisogamous sexual systems and review unique (or especially important) aspects of sexual conflict in hermaphroditic animals. These include conflicts over the timing of sex change in sequential hermaphrodites, and in simultaneous hermaphrodites, over both sex roles and the postmating manipulation of the sperm recipient by the sperm donor. Extending and applying sexual conflict thinking to hermaphrodites can identify general evolutionary principles and help explain some of the unique reproductive diversity found among animals exhibiting this widespread but to date understudied sexual system. ","758":"Aneuploidy, defined as an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a hallmark of cancer. Paradoxically, aneuploidy generally has a negative impact on cell growth and fitness in nontransformed cells. In this work, we review recent progress in identifying how aneuploidy leads to genomic and chromosomal instability, how cells can adapt to the deleterious effects of aneuploidy, and how aneuploidy contributes to tumorigenesis in different genetic contexts. Finally, we also discuss how aneuploidy might be a target for anticancer therapies. ","759":"Telomeres have evolved to protect the ends of linear chromosomes from the myriad of threats posed by the cellular DNA damage signaling and repair pathways. Mammalian telomeres have to block nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), thus preventing chromosome fusions; they need to control homologous recombination (HR), which could change telomere lengths; they have to avoid activating the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related) kinase pathways, which could induce cell cycle arrest; and they have to protect chromosome ends from hyperresection. Recent studies of telomeres have provided insights into the mechanisms of NHEJ and HR, how these double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways can be thwarted, and how telomeres have co-opted DNA repair factors to help in the protection of chromosome ends. These aspects of telomere biology are reviewed here with particular emphasis on recombination, the main focus of this collection. ","760":"Sexual cannibalism is a well-known example for sexual conflict and has many facets that determine the costs and benefits for the cannibal and the victim. Here, I focus on species in which sexual cannibalism is a general component of a mating system in which males invest maximally in mating with a single (monogyny) or two (bigyny) females. Sexual cannibalism can be a male strategy to maximize paternity and a female strategy to prevent paternity monopolization by any or a particular male. Considerable variation exists between species (1) in the potential of males to monopolize females, and (2) in the success of females in preventing monopolization by males. This opens up exciting future possibilities to investigate sexually antagonistic coevolution in a largely unstudied mating system. ","761":"The inflammatory response requires the activation of a complex transcriptional program that is both cell-type- and stimulus-specific and involves the dynamic regulation of hundreds of genes. In the context of an inflamed tissue, extensive changes in gene expression occur in both parenchymal cells and infiltrating cells of the immune system. Recently, basic transcriptional mechanisms that control inflammation have been clarified at a genome scale, particularly in macrophages and conventional dendritic cells. The regulatory logic of distinct groups of inflammatory genes can be explained to some extent by identifiable sequence-encoded features of their chromatin organization, which impact on transcription factor (TF) accessibility and impose different requirements for gene activation. Moreover, it has become apparent that the interplay between TFs activated by inflammatory stimuli and master regulators exerts a crucial role in controlling cell-type-specific transcriptional outputs. ","762":"Interleukin 6 (IL-6), promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and tissue injuries, contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions. Although its expression is strictly controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, dysregulated continual synthesis of IL-6 plays a pathological effect on chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. For this reason, tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was developed. Various clinical trials have since shown the exceptional efficacy of tocilizumab, which resulted in its approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Moreover, tocilizumab is expected to be effective for other intractable immune-mediated diseases. In this context, the mechanism for the continual synthesis of IL-6 needs to be elucidated to facilitate the development of more specific therapeutic approaches and analysis of the pathogenesis of specific diseases. ","763":"Homologous recombination (HR) is a major mechanism for eliminating DNA double-strand breaks from chromosomes. In this process, the break termini are resected nucleolytically to form 3' ssDNA (single-strand DNA) overhangs. A recombinase (i.e., a protein that catalyzes homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange) assembles onto the ssDNA and promotes pairing with a homologous duplex. DNA synthesis then initiates from the 3' end of the invading strand, and the extended DNA joint is resolved via one of several pathways to restore the integrity of the injured chromosome. It is crucial that HR be carefully orchestrated because spurious events can create cytotoxic intermediates or cause genomic rearrangements and loss of gene heterozygosity, which can lead to cell death or contribute to the development of cancer. In this review, we will discuss how DNA motor proteins regulate HR via a dynamic balance of the recombination-promoting and -attenuating activities that they possess. ","764":"Four-way DNA intermediates, called Holliday junctions (HJs), can form during meiotic and mitotic recombination, and their removal is crucial for chromosome segregation. A group of ubiquitous and highly specialized structure-selective endonucleases catalyze the cleavage of HJs into two disconnected DNA duplexes in a reaction called HJ resolution. These enzymes, called HJ resolvases, have been identified in bacteria and their bacteriophages, archaea, and eukaryotes. In this review, we discuss fundamental aspects of the HJ structure and their interaction with junction-resolving enzymes. This is followed by a brief discussion of the eubacterial RuvABC enzymes, which provide the paradigm for HJ resolvases in other organisms. Finally, we review the biochemical and structural properties of some well-characterized resolvases from archaea, bacteriophage, and eukaryotes. ","765":"In this article, we review environmentally mediated epigenetic regulation in plants using two case histories. One of these, vernalization, mediates adaptation of plants to different environments and it exemplifies processes that are reset in each generation. The other, virus-induced silencing, involves transgenerationally inherited epigenetic modifications. Heritable epigenetic marks may result in heritable phenotypic variation, influencing fitness, and so be subject to natural selection. However, unlike genetic inheritance, the epigenetic modifications show instability and are influenced by the environment. These two case histories are then compared with other phenomena in plant biology that are likely to represent epigenetic regulation in response to the environment. ","766":"The roles of clathrin, its regulators, and the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins are well defined in endocytosis. These proteins can also participate in intracellular pathways that are independent of endocytosis and even independent of the membrane trafficking function of these proteins. These nonendocytic functions involve unconventional biochemical interactions for some endocytic regulators, but can also exploit known interactions for nonendocytic functions. The molecular basis for the involvement of endocytic regulators in unconventional functions that influence the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, signaling, and gene regulation are described here. Through these additional functions, endocytic regulators participate in pathways that affect infection, glucose metabolism, development, and cellular transformation, expanding their significance in human health and disease. ","767":"Lysosomes were once considered the end point of endocytosis, simply used for macromolecule degradation. They are now recognized to be dynamic organelles, able to fuse with a variety of targets and to be re-formed after fusion events. They are also now known to be the site of nutrient sensing and signaling to the cell nucleus. In addition, lysosomes are secretory organelles, with specialized machinery for regulated secretion of proteins in some cell types. The biogenesis of lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles is discussed, taking into account their dynamic nature and multiple roles. ","768":"The eukaryotic cytoskeleton evolved from prokaryotic cytomotive filaments. Prokaryotic filament systems show bewildering structural and dynamic complexity and, in many aspects, prefigure the self-organizing properties of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Here, the dynamic properties of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoskeleton are compared, and how these relate to function and evolution of organellar networks is discussed. The evolution of new aspects of filament dynamics in eukaryotes, including severing and branching, and the advent of molecular motors converted the eukaryotic cytoskeleton into a self-organizing \"active gel,\" the dynamics of which can only be described with computational models. Advances in modeling and comparative genomics hold promise of a better understanding of the evolution of the self-organizing cytoskeleton in early eukaryotes, and its role in the evolution of novel eukaryotic functions, such as amoeboid motility, mitosis, and ciliary swimming.

I combine evidence from multigene trees, palaeontology, and cell biology to show that eukaryotes and archaebacteria are sisters, forming the clade neomura that evolved ~1.2 Gy ago from a posibacterium, whose DNA segregation and cell division were destabilized by murein wall loss and rescued by the evolving novel neomuran endoskeleton, histones, cytokinesis, and glycoproteins. Phagotrophy then induced coevolving serial major changes making eukaryote cells, culminating in two dissimilar cilia via a novel gliding-fishing-swimming scenario. I transfer Chloroflexi to Posibacteria, root the universal tree between them and Heliobacteria, and argue that Negibacteria are a clade whose OM, evolving in a green posibacterium, was never lost.","770":"Mitosis is a cell-cycle stage during which condensed chromosomes migrate to the middle of the cell and segregate into two daughter nuclei before cytokinesis (cell division) with the aid of a dynamic mitotic spindle. The history of mitosis research is quite long, commencing well before the discovery of DNA as the repository of genetic information. However, great and rapid progress has been made since the introduction of recombinant DNA technology and discovery of universal cell-cycle control. A large number of conserved eukaryotic genes required for the progression from early to late mitotic stages have been discovered, confirming that DNA replication and mitosis are the two main events in the cell-division cycle. In this article, a historical overview of mitosis is given, emphasizing the importance of diverse model organisms that have been used to solve fundamental questions about mitosis.

Live-cell imaging has revealed a remarkable heterogeneity in CCP assembly kinetics, which can be used as an intrinsic source of mechanistic information on CCP regulation but also poses several major problems for unbiased analysis of CME dynamics. The backbone of unveiling the molecular control of CME is an imaging-based inventory of the full diversity of individual CCP behaviors, which requires detection and tracking of structural fiduciaries and regulatory proteins with an accuracy of &gt;99.9%, despite very low signals. This level of confidence can only be achieved by combining appropriate imaging modalities with self-diagnostic computational algorithms for image analysis and data mining. ","772":"After brief historic overviews of sexual selection and sexual conflict, I argue that pre-ejaculatory sexual selection (the form of sexual selection discussed by Darwin) arose at a late stage in an inevitable succession of transitions flowing from the early evolution of syngamy to the evolution of copulation and sex roles. If certain conditions were met, this \"sexual cascade\" progressed inevitably, if not, sexual strategy remained fixed at a given stage. Prolonged evolutionary history of intense sperm competition\/selection under external fertilization preceded the rise of advanced mobility, which generated pre-ejaculatory sexual selection, followed on land by internal fertilization and reduced sperm competition in the form of postcopulatory sexual selection. I develop a prospective model of the early evolution of mobility, which, as Darwin realized, was the catalyst for pre-ejaculatory sexual selection. Stages in the cascade should be regarded as consequential rather than separate phenomena and, as such, invalidate much current opposition to Darwin-Bateman sex roles. Potential for sexual conflict occurs throughout, greatly increasing later in the cascade, reaching its peak under precopulatory sexual selection when sex roles become highly differentiated. ","773":"Recent advances in molecular and statistical genetics have enabled the reconstruction of human history by studying living humans. The ability to sequence and study DNA by calibrating the rate of accumulation of changes with evolutionary time has enabled robust inferences about how humans have evolved. These data indicate that modern humans evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago and, consistent with paleontological evidence, migrated out of Africa. And through a series of settlements, demographic expansions, and further migrations, they populated the entire world. One of the first waves of migration from Africa was into India. Subsequent, more recent, waves of migration from other parts of the world have resulted in India being a genetic melting pot. Contemporary India has a rich tapestry of cultures and ecologies. There are about 400 tribal groups and more than 4000 groups of castes and subcastes, speaking dialects of 22 recognized languages belonging to four major language families. The contemporary social structure of Indian populations is characterized by endogamy with different degrees of porosity. The social structure, possibly coupled with large ecological heterogeneity, has resulted in considerable genetic diversity and local genetic differences within India. In this essay, we provide genetic evidence of how India may have been peopled, the nature and extent of its genetic diversity, and genetic structure among the extant populations of India. ","774":"The establishment and maintenance of polarized plasma membrane domains is essential for cellular function and proper development of organisms. Epithelial cells polarize along two fundamental axes, the apicobasal and the planar, both depending on finely regulated protein trafficking mechanisms. Newly synthesized proteins destined for either surface domain are processed along the biosynthetic pathway and segregated into distinct subsets of transport carriers emanating from the trans-Golgi network or endosomes. This exocytic trafficking has been identified as essential for proper epithelial polarization. Accumulating evidence now reveals that endocytosis and endocytic recycling play an equally important role in epithelial polarization and the appropriate localization of key polarity proteins. Here, we review recent work in metazoan systems illuminating the connections between endocytosis, postendocytic trafficking, and cell polarity, both apicobasal and planar, in the formation of differentiated epithelial cells, and how these processes regulate tissue dynamics.

Research since has shown that lncRNAs constitute an important layer of genome regulation in diverse biological processes and disease. Here, we discuss the common emerging theme of lncRNAs interfacing with epigenetic machinery. This, in turn, modulates the activity and localization of the epigenetic machinery during cell fate specification. ","778":"Of the many pathogens that infect humans and animals, a large number use cells of the host organism as protected sites for replication. To reach the relevant intracellular compartments, they take advantage of the endocytosis machinery and exploit the network of endocytic organelles for penetration into the cytosol or as sites of replication. In this review, we discuss the endocytic entry processes used by viruses and bacteria and compare the strategies used by these dissimilar classes of pathogens. ","779":"The endocytic network comprises a vast and intricate system of membrane-delimited cell entry and cargo sorting routes running between biochemically and functionally distinct intracellular compartments. The endocytic network caters to the organization and redistribution of diverse subcellular components, and mediates appropriate shuttling and processing of materials acquired from neighboring cells or the extracellular milieu. Such trafficking logistics, despite their importance, represent only one facet of endocytic function. The endocytic network also plays a key role in organizing, mediating, and regulating cellular signal transduction events. Conversely, cellular signaling processes tightly control the endocytic pathway at different steps. The present article provides a perspective on the intimate relationships that exist between particular endocytic and cellular signaling processes in mammalian cells, within the context of understanding the impact of this nexus on integrated physiology. ","780":"A particularly relevant phenomenon in cell physiology and proliferation is the fact that spontaneous mitotic recombination is strongly enhanced by transcription. The most accepted view is that transcription increases the occurrence of double-strand breaks and\/or single-stranded DNA gaps that are repaired by recombination. Most breaks would arise as a consequence of the impact that transcription has on replication fork progression, provoking its stalling and\/or breakage. Here, we discuss the mechanisms responsible for the cross talk between transcription and recombination, with emphasis on (1) the transcription-replication conflicts as the main source of recombinogenic DNA breaks, and (2) the formation of cotranscriptional R-loops as a major cause of such breaks. The new emerging questions and perspectives are discussed on the basis of the interference between transcription and replication, as well as the way RNA influences genome dynamics. ","781":"RecA\/Rad51 catalyzed pairing of homologous DNA strands, initiated by polymerization of the recombinase on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), is a universal feature of homologous recombination (HR). Generation of ssDNA from a double-strand break (DSB) requires nucleolytic degradation of the 5'-terminated strands to generate 3'-ssDNA tails, a process referred to as 5'-3' end resection. The RecBCD helicase-nuclease complex is the main end-processing machine in Gram-negative bacteria. Mre11-Rad50 and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2\/Nbs1 can play a direct role in end resection in archaea and eukaryota, respectively, by removing end-blocking lesions and act indirectly by recruiting the helicases and nucleases responsible for extensive resection. In eukaryotic cells, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical regulatory step to differentiate between homology-dependent and end-joining repair of DSBs. ","782":"Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among eukaryotic lineages has improved dramatically over the few past decades thanks to the development of sophisticated phylogenetic methods and models of evolution, in combination with the increasing availability of sequence data for a variety of eukaryotic lineages. Concurrently, efforts have been made to infer the age of major evolutionary events along the tree of eukaryotes using fossil-calibrated molecular clock-based methods. Here, we review the progress and pitfalls in estimating the age of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and major lineages. After reviewing previous attempts to date deep eukaryote divergences, we present the results of a Bayesian relaxed-molecular clock analysis of a large dataset (159 proteins, 85 taxa) using 19 fossil calibrations. We show that for major eukaryote groups estimated dates of divergence, as well as their credible intervals, are heavily influenced by the relaxed molecular clock models and methods used, and by the nature and treatment of fossil calibrations. Whereas the estimated age of LECA varied widely, ranging from 1007 (943-1102) Ma to 1898 (1655-2094) Ma, all analyses suggested that the eukaryotic supergroups subsequently diverged rapidly (i.e., within 300 Ma of LECA). The extreme variability of these and previously published analyses preclude definitive conclusions regarding the age of major eukaryote clades at this time. As more reliable fossil data on eukaryotes from the Proterozoic become available and improvements are made in relaxed molecular clock modeling, we may be able to date the age of extant eukaryotes more precisely. ","783":"With increasing intracellular complexity, a new cell-biological problem that is the allocation of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins to their final destinations within the cell emerged. A special challenge is thereby the translocation of proteins into or across cellular membranes. The underlying mechanisms are only in parts well understood, but it can be assumed that the course of cellular evolution had a deep impact on the design of the required molecular machines. In this article, we aim to summarize the current knowledge and concepts of the evolutionary development of protein trafficking as a necessary premise and consequence of increased cellular complexity. ","784":"DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by two major pathways, homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining. The commitment to one or the other pathway proceeds via different steps of resection of the DNA ends, which is controlled and executed by a set of DNA double-strand break sensors, endo- and exonucleases, helicases, and DNA damage response factors. The molecular choreography of the underlying protein machinery is beginning to emerge. In this review, we discuss the early steps of genetic recombination and double-strand break sensing with an emphasis on structural and molecular studies. ","785":"Currently, the best scenario for earliest forms of life is based on RNA molecules as they have the proven ability to catalyze enzymatic reactions and harbor genetic information. Evolutionary principles valid today become apparent in such models already. Furthermore, many features of eukaryotic genome architecture might have their origins in an RNA or RNA\/protein (RNP) world, including the onset of a further transition, when DNA replaced RNA as the genetic bookkeeper of the cell. Chromosome maintenance, splicing, and regulatory function via RNA may be deeply rooted in the RNA\/RNP worlds. Mostly in eukaryotes, conversion from RNA to DNA is still ongoing, which greatly impacts the plasticity of extant genomes. Raw material for novel genes encoding protein or RNA, or parts of genes including regulatory elements that selection can act on, continues to enter the evolutionary lottery. ","786":"Sexual antagonism occurs when an allele is beneficial in one sex but costly in the other. Parental antagonism occurs when an allele is beneficial when inherited from one sex but costly when inherited from the other because of fitness interactions among kin. Sexual and parental antagonisms together define four genetic niches within the genome that favor different patterns of gene expression. Natural selection generates linkage disequilibrium among sexually and parentally antagonistic loci with male-beneficial alleles coupled to alleles that are beneficial when inherited from males and female-beneficial alleles coupled to alleles that are beneficial when inherited from females. Linkage disequilibrium also develops between sexually and parentally antagonistic loci and loci that influence sex determination. Genes evolve sex-specific expression to resolve sexual antagonism and evolve imprinted expression to resolve parental antagonism. Sex-specific chromosomes allow a gene to specialize in a single niche. ","787":"Europeans have been the focus of some of the largest studies of genetic diversity in any species to date. Recent genome-wide data have reinforced the hypothesis that present-day European genetic diversity is strongly correlated with geography. The remaining challenge now is to understand more precisely how patterns of diversity in Europe reflect ancient demographic events such as postglacial expansions or the spread of farming. It is likely that recent advances in paleogenetics will give us some of these answers. There has also been progress in identifying specific segments of European genomes that reflect adaptations to selective pressures from the physical environment, disease, and dietary shifts. A growing understanding of how modern European genetic diversity has been shaped by demographic and evolutionary forces is not only of basic historical and anthropological interest but also aids genetic studies of disease. ","788":"Evolutionary conflicts of interest arise whenever genetically different individuals interact and their routes to fitness maximization differ. Sexual selection favors traits that increase an individual's competitiveness to acquire mates and fertilizations. Sexual conflict occurs if an individual of sex A's relative fitness would increase if it had a \"tool\" that could alter what an individual of sex B does (including the parental genes transferred), at a cost to B's fitness. This definition clarifies several issues: Conflict is very common and, although it extends outside traits under sexual selection, sexual selection is a ready source of sexual conflict. Sexual conflict and sexual selection should not be presented as alternative explanations for trait evolution. Conflict is closely linked to the concept of a lag load, which is context-dependent and sex-specific. This makes it possible to ask if one sex can \"win.\" We expect higher population fitness if females win. ","789":"Comparative genomics has revealed that the last eukaryotic common ancestor possessed the hallmark cellular architecture of modern eukaryotes. However, the remarkable success of such analyses has created a dilemma. If key eukaryotic features are ancestral to this group, then establishing the relative timing of their origins becomes difficult. In discussions of eukaryote origins, special significance has been placed on the timing of mitochondrial acquisition. In one view, mitochondrial acquisition was the trigger for eukaryogenesis. Others argue that development of phagocytosis was a prerequisite to acquisition. Results from comparative genomics and molecular phylogeny are often invoked to support one or the other scenario. We show here that the associations between specific cell biological models of eukaryogenesis and evolutionary genomic data are not as strong as many suppose. Disentangling these eliminates many of the arguments that polarize current debate. ","790":"The diversity and patchy phylogenetic distribution of genetic sex-determining mechanisms observed in some taxa is thought to have arisen by the addition, modification, or replacement of regulators at the upstream end of the sex-determining pathway. Here, I review the various evolutionary forces acting on upstream regulators of sexual development that can cause transitions between sex-determining systems. These include sex-ratio selection and pleiotropic benefits, as well as indirect selection mechanisms involving sex-linked sexually antagonistic loci or recessive deleterious mutations. Most of the current theory concentrates on the population-genetic aspects of sex-determination transitions, using models that do not reflect the developmental mechanisms involved in sex determination. However, the increasing availability of molecular data creates opportunities for the development of mechanistic models that can clarify how selection and developmental architecture interact to direct the evolution of sex-determination genes. ","791":"The origin of the eukaryotic cell can be regarded as one of the hallmarks in the history of life on our planet. The apparent genomic chimerism in eukaryotic genomes is currently best explained by invoking a cellular fusion at the root of the eukaryotes that involves one archaeal and one or more bacterial components. Here, we use a phylogenomics approach to reevaluate the evolutionary affiliation between Archaea and eukaryotes, and provide further support for scenarios in which the nuclear lineage in eukaryotes emerged from within the archaeal radiation, displaying a strong phylogenetic affiliation with, or even within, the archaeal TACK superphylum. Further taxonomic sampling of archaeal genomes in this superphylum will certainly provide a better resolution in the events that have been instrumental for the emergence of the eukaryotic lineage. ","792":"Histone acetylation marks are written by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and read by bromodomains (BrDs), and less commonly by other protein modules. These proteins regulate many transcription-mediated biological processes, and their aberrant activities are correlated with several human diseases. Consequently, small molecule HAT and BrD inhibitors with therapeutic potential have been developed. Structural and biochemical studies of HATs and BrDs have revealed that HATs fall into distinct subfamilies containing a structurally related core for cofactor binding, but divergent flanking regions for substrate-specific binding, catalysis, and autoregulation. BrDs adopt a conserved left-handed four-helix bundle to recognize acetyllysine; divergent loop residues contribute to substrate-specific acetyllysine recognition. ","793":"The cellular uptake of many nutrients and micronutrients governs both their cellular availability and their systemic homeostasis. The cellular rate of nutrient or ion uptake (e.g., glucose, Fe(3+), K(+)) or efflux (e.g., Na(+)) is governed by a complement of membrane transporters and receptors that show dynamic localization at both the plasma membrane and defined intracellular membrane compartments. Regulation of the rate and mechanism of endocytosis controls the amounts of these proteins on the cell surface, which in many cases determines nutrient uptake or secretion. Moreover, the metabolic action of diverse hormones is initiated upon binding to surface receptors that then undergo regulated endocytosis and show distinct signaling patterns once internalized. Here, we examine how the endocytosis of nutrient transporters and carriers as well as signaling receptors governs cellular metabolism and thereby systemic (whole-body) metabolite homeostasis. ","794":"Morphogens are signaling molecules that are secreted by a localized source and spread in a target tissue where they are involved in the regulation of growth and patterning. Both the activity of morphogenetic signaling and the kinetics of ligand spreading in a tissue depend on endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. Here, we review quantitative approaches to study how large-scale morphogen profiles and signals emerge in a tissue from cellular trafficking processes and endocytic pathways. Starting from the kinetics of endosomal networks, we discuss the role of cellular trafficking and receptor dynamics in the formation of morphogen gradients. These morphogen gradients scale during growth, which implies that overall tissue size influences cellular trafficking kinetics. Finally, we discuss how such morphogen profiles can be used to control tissue growth. We emphasize the role of theory in efforts to bridge between scales. ","795":null,"796":"Epigenetic information, which plays a major role in eukaryotic biology, is transmitted by covalent modifications of nuclear proteins (e.g., histones) and DNA, along with poorly understood processes involving cytoplasmic\/secreted proteins and RNAs. The origin of eukaryotes was accompanied by emergence of a highly developed biochemical apparatus for encoding, resetting, and reading covalent epigenetic marks in proteins such as histones and tubulins. The provenance of this apparatus remained unclear until recently. Developments in comparative genomics show that key components of eukaryotic epigenetics emerged as part of the extensive biochemical innovation of secondary metabolism and intergenomic\/interorganismal conflict systems in prokaryotes, particularly bacteria. These supplied not only enzymatic components for encoding and removing epigenetic modifications, but also readers of some of these marks. Diversification of these prokaryotic systems and subsequently eukaryotic epigenetics appear to have been considerably influenced by the great oxygenation event in the Earth's history. ","797":"Eukaryotic genomes are composed of genes of different evolutionary origins. This is especially true in the case of photosynthetic eukaryotes, which, in addition to typical eukaryotic genes and genes of mitochondrial origin, also contain genes coming from the primary plastids and, in the case of secondary photosynthetic eukaryotes, many genes provided by the nuclei of red or green algal endosymbionts. Phylogenomic analyses have been applied to detect those genes and, in some cases, have led to proposing the existence of cryptic, no longer visible endosymbionts. However, detecting them is a very difficult task because, most often, those genes were acquired a long time ago and their phylogenetic signal has been heavily erased. We revisit here two examples, the putative cryptic endosymbiosis of green algae in diatoms and chromerids and of Chlamydiae in the first photosynthetic eukaryotes. We show that the evidence sustaining them has been largely overestimated, and we insist on the necessity of careful, accurate phylogenetic analyses to obtain reliable results. ","798":"A critical requirement for mitosis is the distribution of genetic material to the two daughter cells. The central player in this process is the macromolecular kinetochore structure, which binds to both chromosomal DNA and spindle microtubule polymers to direct chromosome alignment and segregation. This review will discuss the key kinetochore activities required for mitotic chromosome segregation, including the recognition of a specific site on each chromosome, kinetochore assembly and the formation of kinetochore-microtubule connections, the generation of force to drive chromosome segregation, and the regulation of kinetochore function to ensure that chromosome segregation occurs with high fidelity. ","799":"Because modern humans originated in Africa and have adapted to diverse environments, African populations have high levels of genetic and phenotypic diversity. Thus, genomic studies of diverse African ethnic groups are essential for understanding human evolutionary history and how this leads to differential disease risk in all humans. Comparative studies of genetic diversity within and between African ethnic groups creates an opportunity to reconstruct some of the earliest events in human population history and are useful for identifying patterns of genetic variation that have been influenced by recent natural selection. Here we describe what is currently known about genetic variation and evolutionary history of diverse African ethnic groups. We also describe examples of recent natural selection in African genomes and how these data are informative for understanding the frequency of many genetic traits, including those that cause disease susceptibility in African populations and populations of recent African descent. ","800":"SUMMARYOver the past two decades, our understanding of mouse development from implantation to gastrulation has grown exponentially with an upsurge of genetic, molecular, cellular, and morphogenetic information. New discoveries have exalted the role of extraembryonic tissues in orchestrating embryonic patterning and axial specification. At the same time, the identification of unexpected morphogenetic processes occurring during mouse gastrulation has challenged established dogmas and brought new insights into the mechanisms driving germ layer formation. In this article, we summarize the key findings that have reinvigorated the contemporary view of early postimplantation mammalian development. ","801":"Attempts have been made recently to determine the identity of the so-called \"Aryans\" as components of the Indian population by using DNA analysis. This is largely to ascertain whether they were indigenous to India or were foreign arrivals. Similar attempts have been made to trace the origins of caste groups on the basis of varna identities and record their distribution. The results so far have been contradictory and, therefore, not of much help to social historians. There are problems in the defining of categories and the techniques of analysis. Aryan is a linguistic and cultural category and not a biological one. Caste groups have no well-defined and invariable boundaries despite marriage codes. Various other categories have been assimilated into particular castes as part of the evolution of social history on the subcontinent. A few examples of these are discussed. The problems with using DNA analysis are also touched on. ","802":"The potential for sexual conflict to influence the evolution of life span and aging has been recognized for more than a decade, and recent work also suggests that variation in life span and aging can influence sexually antagonistic coevolution. However, empirical exploration of these ideas is only beginning. Here, we provide an overview of the ideas and evidence linking inter- and intralocus sexual conflicts with life span and aging. We aim to clarify the conceptual basis of this research program, examine the current state of knowledge, and suggest key questions for further investigation. ","803":"The CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) is activated by the homodimeric growth factors colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). It plays important roles in development and in innate immunity by regulating the development of most tissue macrophages and osteoclasts, of Langerhans cells of the skin, of Paneth cells of the small intestine, and of brain microglia. It also regulates the differentiation of neural progenitor cells and controls functions of oocytes and trophoblastic cells in the female reproductive tract. Owing to this broad tissue expression pattern, it plays a central role in neoplastic, inflammatory, and neurological diseases. In this review we summarize the evolution, structure, and regulation of expression of the CSF-1R gene. We discuss the structures of CSF-1, IL-34, and the CSF-1R and the mechanism of ligand binding to and activation of the receptor. We further describe the pathways regulating macrophage survival, proliferation, differentiation, and chemotaxis downstream from the CSF-1R.","804":"Immunity relies on the heterogeneity of immune cells and their ability to respond to pathogen challenges. In the adaptive immune system, lymphocytes display a highly diverse antigen receptor repertoire that matches the vast diversity of pathogens. In the innate immune system, the cell's heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity enable flexible responses to changes in tissue homeostasis caused by infection or damage. The immune responses are calibrated by the graded activity of immune cells that can vary from yeast-like proliferation to lifetime dormancy. This article describes key epigenetic processes that contribute to the function of immune cells during health and disease.","805":"Inflammation is associated with the activation of genes that contribute to immune defense and tissue repair. The bromodomain-containing proteins of the BET family, which recognize histone lysine acetylation, play a key role in the transcriptional control of inflammatory genes. Inhibition of BET proteins by the small-molecule inhibitor I-BET affects the expression of a particular subset of inflammatory genes-namely, ones that follow an \"analog-like,\" but not \"digital-like\" activation pattern. This ability of I-BET to target genes based on the dynamic pattern of their activation may facilitate the further development of anti-inflammatory treatment protocols that are tuned to the individual or to disease-specific patterns of gene expression.","806":"There are many pathways of endocytosis at the cell surface that apparently operate at the same time. With the advent of new molecular genetic and imaging tools, an understanding of the different ways by which a cell may endocytose cargo is increasing by leaps and bounds. In this review we explore pathways of endocytosis that occur in the absence of clathrin. These are referred to as clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). Here we primarily focus on those pathways that function at the small scale in which some have distinct coats (caveolae) and others function in the absence of specific coated intermediates. We follow the trafficking itineraries of the material endocytosed by these pathways and finally discuss the functional roles that these pathways play in cell and tissue physiology. It is likely that these pathways will play key roles in the regulation of plasma membrane area and tension and also control the availability of membrane during cell migration.","807":"DNA is one of the most essential molecules in organisms, containing all the information necessary for organisms to live. It replicates and provides a mechanism for heredity and evolution. Various events cause the degradation of DNA into nucleotides. DNA also has a darker side that has only recently been recognized; DNA that is not properly degraded causes various diseases. In this review, we discuss four deoxyribonucleases that function in the nucleus, cytosol, and lysosomes, and how undigested DNA causes such diseases as cancer, cataract, and autoinflammation. Studies on the biochemical and physiological functions of deoxyribonucleases should continue to increase our understanding of cellular functions and human diseases.","808":"In this work we review the current knowledge on the prehistory, origins, and evolution of spliceosomal introns. First, we briefly outline the major features of the different types of introns, with particular emphasis on the nonspliceosomal self-splicing group II introns, which are widely thought to be the ancestors of spliceosomal introns. Next, we discuss the main scenarios proposed for the origin and proliferation of spliceosomal introns, an event intimately linked to eukaryogenesis. We then summarize the evidence that suggests that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had remarkably high intron densities and many associated characteristics resembling modern intron-rich genomes. From this intron-rich LECA, the different eukaryotic lineages have taken very distinct evolutionary paths leading to profoundly diverged modern genome structures. Finally, we discuss the origins of alternative splicing and the qualitative differences in alternative splicing forms and functions across lineages.","809":"Systematics balances uneasily between realism and nominalism, uncommitted as to whether biological taxa are discoveries or inventions. If the former, they might be taken as natural kinds. I briefly review some philosophers' concepts of natural kinds and then argue that several of these apply well enough to \"eukaryote.\" Although there are some sticky issues around genomic chimerism and when eukaryotes first appeared, if we allow for degrees in the naturalness of kinds, existing eukaryotes rank highly, higher than prokaryotes. Most biologists feel this intuitively: All I attempt to do here is provide some conceptual justification.","810":"Live-cell imaging reveals the endolysosomal system as a complex and highly dynamic network of interacting compartments. Distinct types of endosomes are discerned by kinetic, molecular, and morphological criteria. Although none of these criteria, or combinations thereof, can capture the full complexity of the endolysosomal system, they are extremely useful for experimental purposes. Some membrane domain specializations and specific morphological characteristics can only be seen by ultrastructural analysis after preparation for electron microscopy (EM). Immuno-EM allows a further discrimination of seemingly identical compartments by their molecular makeup. In this review we provide an overview of the ultrastructural characteristics and membrane organization of endosomal compartments, along with their organizing machineries. ","811":"Recent evidence indicates that the importance of the lysosome in cell metabolism and organism physiology goes far beyond the simple disposal of cellular garbage. This dynamic organelle is situated at the crossroad of the most important cellular pathways and is involved in sensing, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that respond to environmental cues, such as nutrients. Two main mediators of these lysosomal adaptation mechanisms are the mTORC1 kinase complex and the transcription factor EB (TFEB). These two factors are linked in a lysosome-to-nucleus signaling pathway that provides the lysosome with the ability to adapt to extracellular cues and control its own biogenesis. Modulation of lysosomal function by acting on TFEB has a profound impact on cellular clearance and energy metabolism and is a promising therapeutic target for a large variety of disease conditions.","812":"Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was discovered in 1979, but this posttranslational modification had been \"invented\" by evolution more than a billion years ago in single-celled eukaryotic organisms that were the antecedents of the first multicellular animals. Because sophisticated cell-cell communication is a sine qua non for the existence of multicellular organisms, the development of cell-surface receptor systems that use tyrosine phosphorylation for transmembrane signal transduction and intracellular signaling seems likely to have been a crucial event in the evolution of metazoans. Like all types of protein phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation serves to regulate proteins in multiple ways, including causing electrostatic repulsion and inducing allosteric transitions, but the most important function of phosphotyrosine (P.Tyr) is to serve as a docking site that promotes a specific interaction between a tyrosine phosphorylated protein and another protein that contains a P.Tyr-binding domain, such as an SH2 or PTB domain. Such docking interactions are essential for signal transduction downstream from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on the cell surface, which are activated on binding a cognate extracellular ligand, and, as a consequence, elicit specific cellular outcomes. ","813":"DNA methylation is one of the best characterized epigenetic modifications. In mammals it is involved in various biological processes including the silencing of transposable elements, regulation of gene expression, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. This article describes how DNA methylation serves as a cellular memory system and how it is dynamically regulated through the action of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. Its role in the regulation of gene expression, through its interplay with histone modifications, is also described, and its implication in human diseases discussed. The exciting areas of investigation that will likely become the focus of research in the coming years are outlined in the summary. ","814":"Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated degradative system that is a highly conserved pathway present in all eukaryotes. In all cells, double-membrane autophagosomes form and engulf cytoplasmic components, delivering them to the lysosome for degradation. Autophagy is essential for cell health and can be activated to function as a recycling pathway in the absence of nutrients or as a quality-control pathway to eliminate damaged organelles or even to eliminate invading pathogens. Autophagy was first identified as a pathway in mammalian cells using morphological techniques, but the Atg (autophagy-related) genes required for autophagy were identified in yeast genetic screens. Despite tremendous advances in elucidating the function of individual Atg proteins, our knowledge of how autophagosomes form and subsequently interact with the endosomal pathway has lagged behind. Recent progress toward understanding where and how both the endocytotic and autophagic pathways overlap is reviewed here. ","815":"In addition to their roles in normal cell physiology, endocytic processes play a key role in many diseases. In this review, three diseases are discussed as examples of the role of endocytic processes in disease. The uptake of cholesterol via LDL is central to our understanding of atherosclerosis, and the study of this disease led to many of the key breakthroughs in understanding receptor-mediated endocytosis. Alzheimer's disease is a growing burden as the population ages. Endosomes and lysosomes play important but only partially understood roles in both the formation and the degradation of the amyloid fibrils that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Inherited lysosomal storage diseases are individually rare, but collectively they affect many individuals. Recent advances are leading to improved enzyme replacement therapy and are also leading to small-molecule drugs to treat some of these diseases. ","816":"Clathrin is a molecular scaffold for vesicular uptake of cargo at the plasma membrane, where its assembly into cage-like lattices underlies the clathrin-coated pits of classical endocytosis. This review describes the structures of clathrin, major cargo adaptors, and other proteins that participate in forming a clathrin-coated pit, loading its contents, pinching off the membrane as a lattice-enclosed vesicle, and recycling the components. It integrates as much of the structural information as possible at the time of writing into a sketch of the principal steps in coated-pit and coated-vesicle formation. ","817":"Molecular phylogenetics has revolutionized our knowledge of the eukaryotic tree of life. With the advent of genomics, a new discipline of phylogenetics has emerged: phylogenomics. This method uses large alignments of tens to hundreds of genes to reconstruct evolutionary histories. This approach has led to the resolution of ancient and contentious relationships, notably between the building blocks of the tree (the supergroups), and allowed to place in the tree enigmatic yet important protist lineages for understanding eukaryote evolution. Here, I discuss the pros and cons of phylogenomics and review the eukaryotic supergroups in light of earlier work that laid the foundation for the current view of the tree, including the position of the root. I conclude by presenting a picture of eukaryote evolution, summarizing the most recent progress in assembling the global tree. ","818":"All morphologically complex life on Earth, beyond the level of cyanobacteria, is eukaryotic. All eukaryotes share a common ancestor that was already a complex cell. Despite their biochemical virtuosity, prokaryotes show little tendency to evolve eukaryotic traits or large genomes. Here I argue that prokaryotes are constrained by their membrane bioenergetics, for fundamental reasons relating to the origin of life. Eukaryotes arose in a rare endosymbiosis between two prokaryotes, which broke the energetic constraints on prokaryotes and gave rise to mitochondria. Loss of almost all mitochondrial genes produced an extreme genomic asymmetry, in which tiny mitochondrial genomes support, energetically, a massive nuclear genome, giving eukaryotes three to five orders of magnitude more energy per gene than prokaryotes. The requirement for endosymbiosis radically altered selection on eukaryotes, potentially explaining the evolution of unique traits, including the nucleus, sex, two sexes, speciation, and aging. ","819":"Humans are both similar and diverse in such a vast number of dimensions that for human geneticists and social scientists to decide which of these dimensions is a worthy focus of empirical investigation is a formidable challenge. For geneticists, one vital question, of course, revolves around hypothesizing which kind of social diversity might illuminate genetic variation-and vice versa (i.e., what genetic variation illuminates human social diversity). For example, are there health outcomes that can be best explained by genetic variation-or for social scientists, are health outcomes mainly a function of the social diversity of lifestyles and social circumstances of a given population? Indeed, what is a \"population,\" how is it bounded, and are those boundaries most appropriate or relevant for human genetic research, be they national borders, religious affiliation, ethnic or racial identification, or language group, to name but a few? For social scientists, the matter of what constitutes the relevant borders of a population is equally complex, and the answer is demarcated by the goal of the research project. Although race and caste are categories deployed in both human genetics and social science, the social meaning of race and caste as pathways to employment, health, or education demonstrably overwhelms the analytic and explanatory power of genetic markers of difference between human aggregates. ","820":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was among the first receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) for which ligand binding was studied and for which the importance of ligand-induced dimerization was established. As a result, EGFR and its relatives have frequently been termed \"prototypical\" RTKs. Many years of mechanistic studies, however, have revealed that--far from being prototypical--the EGFR family is quite unique. As we discuss in this review, the EGFR family uses a distinctive \"receptor-mediated\" dimerization mechanism, with ligand binding inducing a dramatic conformational change that exposes a dimerization arm. Intracellular kinase domain regulation in this family is also unique, being driven by allosteric changes induced by asymmetric dimer formation rather than the more typical activation-loop phosphorylation. EGFR family members also distinguish themselves from other RTKs in having an intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) domain that activates (rather than autoinhibits) the receptor and a very large carboxy-terminal tail that contains autophosphorylation sites and serves an autoregulatory function. We discuss recent advances in mechanistic aspects of all of these components of EGFR family members, attempting to integrate them into a view of how RTKs in this important class are regulated at the cell surface.","821":"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl functional groups from the lysine residues of both histone and nonhistone proteins. In humans, there are 18 HDAC enzymes that use either zinc- or NAD(+)-dependent mechanisms to deacetylate acetyl lysine substrates. Although removal of histone acetyl epigenetic modification by HDACs regulates chromatin structure and transcription, deacetylation of nonhistones controls diverse cellular processes. HDAC inhibitors are already known potential anticancer agents and show promise for the treatment of many diseases. ","822":"Until recently, mutations in histones had not been described in any human disease. However, genome-wide sequencing of pediatric high-grade gliomas revealed somatic heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding histones H3.1 and H3.3, as well as mutations in the chromatin modifiers ATRX and DAXX. The functional significance and mechanistic details of how these mutations affect the tumors is currently under intensive investigation. The information gained from these studies will shed new light on normal brain development as well as increase our understanding of the tumorigenic processes that drive pediatric high-grade gliomas. ","823":"In mammalian cells, endocytosis plays a pivotal role in regulating several basic cellular functions. Up to now, the dynamics and the organization of the endocytic pathways have been primarily investigated in reductionist model systems such as cell and organ cultures. Although these experimental models have been fully successful in unraveling the endocytic machinery at a molecular level, our understanding of the regulation and the role of endocytosis in vivo has been limited. Recently, advancements in intravital microscopy have made it possible to extend imaging in live animals to subcellular structures, thus revealing new aspects of the molecular machineries regulating membrane trafficking that were not previously appreciated in vitro. Here, we focus on the use of intravital microscopy to study endocytosis in vivo, and discuss how this approach will allow addressing two fundamental questions: (1) how endocytic processes are organized in mammalian tissues, and (2) how they contribute to organ physiopathology.

Establishing when during geological time the endosymbiosis occurred remains elusive, but progress has been made in defining the cyanobacterial lineage most closely related to plastids, and some mechanistic insight into the possible existence of cryptic endosymbioses perhaps involving Chlamydia-like infections of the host have also been presented. The phylogenetic affinities of the host remain obscure. The existence of a second lineage of primary plastids in euglyphid amoebae has now been confirmed, but the quasipermanent acquisition of plastids by animals has been shown to be more ephemeral than initially suspected. A new understanding of how plastids have been integrated into their hosts by transfer of photosynthate, by endosymbiotic gene transfer and repatriation of gene products back to the endosymbiont, and by regulation of endosymbiont division is presented in context. ","826":"We review the states of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), primarily the EGF receptor (EGFR, ErbB1, HER1) and the orphan receptor ErbB2 as they exist in living mammalian cells, focusing on four main aspects: (1) aggregation state and distribution in the plasma membrane; (2) conformational features of the receptors situated in the plasma membrane, compared to the crystallographic structures of the isolated extracellular domains; (3) coupling of receptor disposition on filopodia with the transduction of signaling ligand gradients; and (4) ligand-independent receptor activation by application of a magnetic field. ","827":"Dosage compensation, which regulates the expression of genes residing on the sex chromosomes, has provided valuable insights into chromatin-based mechanisms of gene regulation. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has adopted various strategies to down-regulate and even nearly silence the X chromosomes. This article discusses the different chromatin-based strategies used in somatic tissues and in the germline to modulate gene expression from the C. elegans X chromosomes and compares these strategies to those used by other organisms to cope with similar X-chromosome dosage differences. ","828":"The development of multicellular organisms relies on an intricate choreography of intercellular communication events that pattern the embryo and coordinate the formation of tissues and organs. It is therefore not surprising that developmental biology, especially using genetic model organisms, has contributed significantly to the discovery and functional dissection of the associated signal-transduction cascades. At the same time, biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches have provided us with insights into the underlying cell biological machinery. Here we focus on how endocytic trafficking of signaling components (e.g., ligands or receptors) controls the generation, propagation, modulation, reception, and interpretation of developmental signals. A comprehensive enumeration of the links between endocytosis and signal transduction would exceed the limits of this review. We will instead use examples from different developmental pathways to conceptually illustrate the various functions provided by endocytic processes during key steps of intercellular signaling. ","829":"Organelles within the endomembrane system are connected via vesicle flux. Along the endocytic pathway, endosomes are among the most versatile organelles. They sort cargo through tubular protrusions for recycling or through intraluminal vesicles for degradation. Sorting involves numerous machineries, which mediate fission of endosomal transport intermediates and fusion with other endosomes or eventually with lysosomes. Here we review the recent advances in our understanding of these processes with a particular focus on the Rab GTPases, tethering factors, and retromer. The cytoskeleton has also been recently recognized as a central player in membrane dynamics of endosomes, and this review covers the regulation of the machineries that govern the formation of branched actin networks through the WASH and Arp2\/3 complexes in relation with cargo recycling and endosomal fission. ","830":"Sexual reproduction is a nearly universal feature of eukaryotic organisms. Given its ubiquity and shared core features, sex is thought to have arisen once in the last common ancestor to all eukaryotes. Using the perspectives of molecular genetics and cell biology, we consider documented and hypothetical scenarios for the instantiation and evolution of meiosis, fertilization, sex determination, uniparental inheritance of organelle genomes, and speciation.

Aberrations in their activation or signaling leads to many pathologies, especially cancers, motivating the development of a variety of drugs that block RTK signaling that have been successfully applied for the treatment of many cancers. As the current field of RTKs and their signaling pathways are covered by a very large amount of literature, spread over half a century, I am focusing the scope of this review on seminal discoveries made before tyrosine phosphorylation was discovered, and on the early days of research into RTKs and their cellular signaling pathways. I review the history of the early days of research in the field of RTKs. I emphasize key early findings, which provided conceptual frameworks for addressing the questions of how RTKs are activated and how they regulate intracellular signaling pathways. ","833":"The distinctive morphology of neurons, with complex dendritic arbors and extensive axons, presents spatial challenges for intracellular signal transduction. The endosomal system provides mechanisms that enable signaling molecules initiated by extracellular cues to be trafficked throughout the expanse of the neuron, allowing intracellular signals to be sustained over long distances. Therefore endosomes are critical for many aspects of neuronal signaling that regulate cell survival, axonal growth and guidance, dendritic branching, and cell migration. An intriguing characteristic of neuronal signal transduction is that endosomal trafficking enables physiological responses that vary based on the subcellular location of signal initiation. In this review, we will discuss the specialized mechanisms and the functional significance of endosomal signaling in neurons, both during normal development and in disease. ","834":"Nuclear reprogramming technology was first established more than 50 years ago. It can rejuvenate somatic cells by erasing the epigenetic memories and reconstructing a new pluripotent order. The recent discovery reviewed here that induced pluripotency can be achieved by a small set of transcription factors has opened up unprecedented opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, the clinic, and laboratories. This technology allows us to access pathological studies by using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. In addition, iPS cells are also expected to be a rising star for regenerative medicine, as sources of transplantation therapy. ","835":"Genomic imprinting affects a subset of genes in mammals and results in a monoallelic, parental-specific expression pattern. Most of these genes are located in clusters that are regulated through the use of insulators or long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To distinguish the parental alleles, imprinted genes are epigenetically marked in gametes at imprinting control elements through the use of DNA methylation at the very least. Imprinted gene expression is subsequently conferred through lncRNAs, histone modifications, insulators, and higher-order chromatin structure. Such imprints are maintained after fertilization through these mechanisms despite extensive reprogramming of the mammalian genome. Genomic imprinting is an excellent model for understanding mammalian epigenetic regulation. ","836":"The endosomal network comprises an interconnected network of membranous compartments whose primary function is to receive, dissociate, and sort cargo that originates from the plasma membrane and the biosynthetic pathway. A major challenge in cell biology is to achieve a thorough molecular description of how this network operates, and in so doing, how defects contribute to the etiology and pathology of human disease. We discuss the increasing body of evidence that implicates an ancient evolutionary conserved complex, termed \"retromer,\" as a master conductor in the complex orchestration of multiple cargo-sorting events within the endosomal network. ","837":"Evolutionary hypotheses are correctly interpreted as products of the data they set out to explain, but they are less often recognized as being heavily influenced by other factors. One of these is the history of preceding thought, and here I look back on historically important changes in our thinking about the role of endosymbiosis in the origin of eukaryotic cells. Specifically, the modern emphasis on endosymbiotic explanations for numerous eukaryotic features, including the cell itself (the so-called chimeric hypotheses), can be seen not only as resulting from the advent of molecular and genomic data, but also from the intellectual acceptance of the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and plastids. This transformative idea may have unduly affected how other aspects of the eukaryotic cell are explained, in effect priming us to accept endosymbiotic explanations for endogenous processes. Molecular and genomic data, which were originally harnessed to answer questions about cell evolution, now so dominate our thinking that they largely define the question, and the original questions about how eukaryotic cellular architecture evolved have been neglected. This is unfortunate because, as Roger Stanier pointed out, these cellular changes represent life's \"greatest single evolutionary discontinuity,\" and on this basis I advocate a return to emphasizing evolutionary cell biology when thinking about the origin of eukaryotes, and suggest that endogenous explanations will prevail when we refocus on the evolution of the cell. ","838":"Eukaryotes have evolved and diversified in the context of persistent colonization by non-pathogenic microorganisms. Various resident microorganisms provide a metabolic capability absent from the host, resulting in increased ecological amplitude and often evolutionary diversification of the host. Some microorganisms confer primary metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis and cellulose degradation, and others expand the repertoire of secondary metabolism, including the synthesis of toxins that confer protection against natural enemies. A further route by which microorganisms affect host fitness arises from their modulation of the eukaryotic-signaling networks that regulate growth, development, behavior, and other functions. These effects are not necessarily based on interactions beneficial to the host, but can be a consequence of either eukaryotic utilization of microbial products as cues or host-microbial conflict. By these routes, eukaryote-microbial interactions play an integral role in the function and evolutionary diversification of eukaryotes. ","839":"Evolutionary cell biology can afford an interdisciplinary comparative view that gives insights into both the functioning of modern cells and the origins of cellular systems, including the endocytic organelles. Here, we explore several recent evolutionary cell biology studies, highlighting investigations into the origin and diversity of endocytic systems in eukaryotes. Beginning with a brief overview of the eukaryote tree of life, we show how understanding the endocytic machinery in a select, but diverse, array of organisms provides insights into endocytic system origins and predicts the likely configuration in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Next, we consider three examples in which a comparative approach yielded insight into the function of modern cellular systems. First, using ESCRT-0 as an example, we show how comparative cell biology can discover both lineage-specific novelties (ESCRT-0) as well as previously ignored ancient proteins (Tom1), likely of both evolutionary and functional importance. Second, we highlight the power of comparative cell biology for discovery of previously ignored but potentially ancient complexes (AP5). Finally, using examples from ciliates and trypanosomes, we show that not all organisms possess canonical endocytic pathways, but instead likely evolved lineage-specific mechanisms. Drawing from these case studies, we conclude that a comparative approach is a powerful strategy for advancing knowledge about the general mechanisms and functions of endocytic systems. ","840":"The Eph and Tie cell surface receptors mediate a variety of signaling events during development and in the adult organism. As other receptor tyrosine kinases, they are activated on binding of extracellular ligands and their catalytic activity is tightly regulated on multiple levels. The Eph and Tie receptors display some unique characteristics, including the requirement of ligand-induced receptor clustering for efficient signaling. Interestingly, both Ephs and Ties can mediate different, even opposite, biological effects depending on the specific ligand eliciting the response and on the cellular context. Here we discuss the structural features of these receptors, their interactions with various ligands, as well as functional implications for downstream signaling initiation. The Eph\/ephrin structures are already well reviewed and we only provide a brief overview on the initial binding events. We go into more detail discussing the Tie-angiopoietin structures and recognition. ","841":"People around the world have folk origin myths, stories that explain where they came from and account for their place in the world and their differences from other peoples. As scientists, however, we claim to be seeking literal historical truth. In Western culture, typological ideas about human variation are at least as ancient as written discussion of the subject, and have dominated both social and scientific thinking about race. From Herodotus to the Biblical lost tribes of Israel, and surprisingly even to today, it has been common to view our species as composed of distinct, or even discrete groups, types, or \"races,\" with other individuals admixed from among those groups. Such rhetoric goes so much against the well-known evolutionary realities that it must reflect something deep about human thought, at least in Western culture. Typological approaches can be convenient for some pragmatic aspects of scientific analysis, but they can be seductively deceiving. We know how to think differently and should do so, given the historical abuses that have occurred as a result of typological thinking that seem always to lurk in the human heart. ","842":"The term \"epigenetics\" was originally used to denote the poorly understood processes by which a fertilized zygote developed into a mature, complex organism. With the understanding that all cells of an organism carry the same DNA, and with increased knowledge of mechanisms of gene expression, the definition was changed to focus on ways in which heritable traits can be associated not with changes in nucleotide sequence, but with chemical modifications of DNA, or of the structural and regulatory proteins bound to it. Recent discoveries about the role of these mechanisms in early development may make it desirable to return to the original definition of epigenetics. ","843":"When ubiquitin (Ub) is attached to membrane proteins on the plasma membrane, it directs them through a series of sorting steps that culminate in their delivery to the lumen of the lysosome where they undergo complete proteolysis. Ubiquitin is recognized by a series of complexes that operate at a number of vesicle transport steps. Ubiquitin serves as a sorting signal for internalization at the plasma membrane and is the major signal for incorporation into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular late endosomes. The sorting machineries that catalyze these steps can bind Ub via a variety of Ub-binding domains. At the same time, many of these complexes are themselves ubiquitinated, thus providing a plethora of potential mechanisms to regulate their activity. Here we provide an overview of how membrane proteins are selected for ubiquitination and deubiquitination within the endocytic pathway and how that ubiquitin signal is interpreted by endocytic sorting machineries. ","844":"Numerous biological processes rely on endocytosis. The construction of endocytic pits is achieved by a bewildering complexity of biochemical factors that function in clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways. In this review, we argue that this complexity can be conceptualized by a deceptively small number of physical principles that fall into two broad categories: passive mechanisms, such as asymmetric transbilayer stress, scaffolding, line tension, and crowding, and active mechanisms driven by mechanochemical enzymes and\/or cytoskeleton. We illustrate how the functional identity of biochemical modules depends on system parameters such as local protein density on membranes, thus explaining some of the controversy in the field. Different modules frequently operate in parallel in the same step and often are shared by apparently divergent uptake processes. The emergence of a novel endocytic classification system may thus be envisioned in which functional modules are the elementary bricks. ","845":"Eukaryotic organisms radiated in Proterozoic oceans with oxygenated surface waters, but, commonly, anoxia at depth. Exceptionally preserved fossils of red algae favor crown group emergence more than 1200 million years ago, but older (up to 1600-1800 million years) microfossils could record stem group eukaryotes. Major eukaryotic diversification ~800 million years ago is documented by the increase in the taxonomic richness of complex, organic-walled microfossils, including simple coenocytic and multicellular forms, as well as widespread tests comparable to those of extant testate amoebae and simple foraminiferans and diverse scales comparable to organic and siliceous scales formed today by protists in several clades. Mid-Neoproterozoic establishment or expansion of eukaryophagy provides a possible mechanism for accelerating eukaryotic diversification long after the origin of the domain. Protists continued to diversify along with animals in the more pervasively oxygenated oceans of the Phanerozoic Eon.","846":"In the wake of the worldwide increase in type-2 diabetes, a major focus of research is understanding the signaling pathways impacting this disease. Insulin signaling regulates glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis, predominantly via action on liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Precise modulation of this pathway is vital for adaption as the individual moves from the fed to the fasted state. The positive and negative modulators acting on different steps of the signaling pathway, as well as the diversity of protein isoform interaction, ensure a proper and coordinated biological response to insulin in different tissues. Whereas genetic mutations are causes of rare and severe insulin resistance, obesity can lead to insulin resistance through a variety of mechanisms. Understanding these pathways is essential for development of new drugs to treat diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and their complications. ","847":"A primary mode of regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is to control access of ligand to its receptor. Many RTK ligands are synthesized as transmembrane proteins. Frequently, the active ligand must be released from the membrane by proteolysis before signaling can occur. Here, we discuss RTK ligand shedding and describe the proteases that catalyze it in flies and mammals. We focus principally on the control of EGF receptor ligand shedding, but also refer to ligands of other RTKs. Two prominent themes emerge. First, control by regulated trafficking and cellular compartmentalization of the proteases and their ligand substrates plays a key role in shedding. Second, many external signals converge on the shedding proteases and their control machinery. Proteases therefore act as regulatory hubs that integrate information that the cell receives and translate it into precise outgoing signals. The activation of signaling by proteases is therefore an essential element of the cellular communication machinery. ","848":"Learning and memory require the formation of new neural networks in the brain. A key mechanism underlying this process is synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses, which connect neurons into networks. Excitatory synaptic transmission happens when glutamate, the excitatory neurotransmitter, activates receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Synaptic plasticity is a higher-level process in which the strength of excitatory synapses is altered in response to the pattern of activity at the synapse. It is initiated in the postsynaptic compartment, where the precise pattern of influx of calcium through activated glutamate receptors leads either to the addition of new receptors and enlargement of the synapse (long-term potentiation) or the removal of receptors and shrinkage of the synapse (long-term depression). Calcium\/calmodulin-regulated enzymes and small GTPases collaborate to control this highly tuned mechanism.","849":"Receptor tyrosine kinases of the Ryk and Ror families were initially classified as orphan receptors because their ligands were unknown. They are now known to contain functional extracellular Wnt-binding domains and are implicated in Wnt-signal transduction in multiple species. Although their signaling mechanisms still remain to be resolved in detail, both Ryk and Ror control important developmental processes in different tissues. However, whereas many other Wnt-signaling responses affect cell proliferation and differentiation, Ryk and Ror are mostly associated with controlling processes that rely on the polarized migration of cells. Here we discuss what is currently known about the involvement of this exciting class of receptors in development and disease. ","850":"Signal transduction is regulated by protein-protein interactions. In the case of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the precise nature of these interactions remains a topic of debate. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art imaging techniques that are providing new details into receptor dynamics, clustering, and interactions. We present the general principles of these techniques, their limitations, and the unique observations they provide about ErbB spatiotemporal organization. ","851":"DNA damage is one of many possible perturbations that challenge the mechanisms that preserve genetic stability during the copying of the eukaryotic genome in S phase. This short review provides, in the first part, a general introduction to the topic and an overview of checkpoint responses. In the second part, the mechanisms of error-free tolerance in response to fork-arresting DNA damage will be discussed in some detail. ","852":"Research using ciliates revealed early examples of epigenetic phenomena and continues to provide novel findings. These protozoans maintain separate germline and somatic nuclei that carry transcriptionally silent and active genomes, respectively. Examining the differences in chromatin within distinct nuclei of Tetrahymena identified histone variants and established that transcriptional regulators act by modifying histones. Formation of somatic nuclei requires both transcriptional activation of silent chromatin and large-scale DNA elimination. This somatic genome remodeling is directed by homologous RNAs, acting with an RNA interference (RNAi)-related machinery. Furthermore, the content of the parental somatic genome provides a homologous template to guide this genome restructuring. The mechanisms regulating ciliate DNA rearrangements reveal the surprising power of homologous RNAs to remodel the genome and transmit information transgenerationally. ","853":"Endocytosis entails selective packaging of cell-surface proteins, such as receptors for cytokines and adhesion components, in cytoplasmic vesicles (endosomes). The series of sorting events that determines the fate of internalized proteins, either degradation in lysosomes or recycling back to the plasma membrane, relies on intrinsic sequence motifs, posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and ubiquitination), and transient assemblies of both Rab GTPases and phosphoinositide-binding proteins. This multicomponent process is enhanced and skewed in cancer cells; we review mechanisms enabling both major drivers of cancer, p53 and Ras, to bias recycling of integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Likewise, cadherins and other junctional proteins of cancer cells are constantly removed from the cell surface, thereby disrupting tissue polarity and instigating motile phenotypes. Mutant forms of RTKs able to evade Cbl-mediated ubiquitination, along with overexpression of the wild-type forms and a variety of defective feedback regulatory loops, are frequently detected in tumors. Finally, we describe pharmacological attempts to harness the peculiar endocytic system of cancer, in favor of effective patient treatment.

The conceptually simplest procedure to bypass lesions during DNA replication is translesion synthesis (TLS), whereby the replicative polymerase is transiently replaced by a specialized DNA polymerase that synthesizes a short patch of DNA across the site of damage. This process is inherently error prone and is the main source of point mutations. The diversity of existing DNA lesions and the biochemical properties of Escherichia coli DNA polymerases will be presented. Our main goal is to deliver an integrated view of TLS pathways involving the multiple switches between replicative and specialized DNA polymerases and their interaction with key accessory factors. Finally, a brief glance at how other bacteria deal with TLS and mutagenesis is presented. ","856":"RET (rearranged during transfection) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the development of neural crest derived cell lineages, kidney, and male germ cells. Different human cancers, including papillary and medullary thyroid carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, and myeloproliferative disorders display gain-of-function mutations in RET. Accordingly, RET protein has become a promising molecular target for cancer treatment. ","857":"Intracellular signaling is mediated by reversible posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, among others. In response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically dimerize and initiate signaling through phosphorylation of their cytoplasmic tails and downstream scaffolds. Signaling effectors are recruited to these phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites primarily through Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and pTyr-binding (PTB) domains. This review describes how these conserved domains specifically recognize pTyr residues and play a major role in mediating precise downstream signaling events.

The maternally inherited mtDNA codes for essential energy genes, is present in thousands of copies per cell, and has a very high mutation rate. New mtDNA mutations arise among thousands of other mtDNAs. The mechanisms by which these \"heteroplasmic\" mtDNA mutations come to predominate in the female germline and somatic tissues is poorly understood, but essential for understanding the clinical variability of a range of diseases. Maternal inheritance and heteroplasmy also pose major challengers for the diagnosis and prevention of mtDNA disease. ","859":"Most mammalian gene promoters are embedded within genomic regions called CpG islands, characterized by elevated levels of nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides. Here, we describe recent work demonstrating that CpG islands act as specific nucleation sites for the zinc finger CxxC domain-containing proteins CFP1 and KDM2A. Importantly, both CFP1 and KDM2A are associated with enzymatic activities that modulate specific histone lysine methylation marks. The action of these zinc finger CxxC domain proteins therefore imposes a defined chromatin architecture on CpG islands that distinguishes these important regulatory elements from the surrounding genome. The functional consequence of this CpG island-directed chromatin environment is discussed. ","860":"Much of what we know about the role of epigenetics in the determination of phenotype has come from studies of inbred mice. Some unusual expression patterns arising from endogenous and transgenic murine alleles, such as the Agouti coat color alleles, have allowed the study of variegation, variable expressivity, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, parent-of-origin effects, and position effects. These phenomena have taught us much about gene silencing and the probabilistic nature of epigenetic processes. Based on some of these alleles, large-scale mutagenesis screens have broadened our knowledge of epigenetic control by identifying and characterizing novel genes involved in these processes.

A more detailed description of these pathways is presented in the literature. We then focus on the endocytosis of nanomedicines and present how various nanomaterial parameters impact these endocytic processes. This topic is an area of active research, motivated by the recognition that an improved understanding of how nanomaterials interact at the molecular, cellular, and whole-organism level will lead to the design of better nanomedicines in the future. Next, we briefly review some of the important nanomedicines already on the market or in clinical development that serve to exemplify how endocytosis can be exploited for medical benefit. Finally, we present some key unanswered questions and remaining challenges to be addressed by the field. ","862":"The endosomal system is expansive and complex, characterized by swift morphological transitions, dynamic remodeling of membrane constituents, and intracellular positioning changes. To properly navigate this ever-altering membrane labyrinth, transmembrane protein cargoes typically require specific sorting signals that are decoded by components of protein coats. The best-characterized sorting process within the endosomal system is the rapid internalization of select transmembrane proteins within clathrin-coated vesicles. Endocytic signals consist of linear motifs, conformational determinants, or covalent modifications in the cytosolic domains of transmembrane cargo. These signals are interpreted by a diverse set of clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) that translocate from the cytosol to the inner face of the plasma membrane. Signal recognition by CLASPs is highly cooperative, involving additional interactions with phospholipids, Arf GTPases, other CLASPs, and clathrin, and is regulated by large conformational changes and covalent modifications. Related sorting events occur at other endosomal sorting stations. ","863":"The TAM receptors--Tyro3, Axl, and Mer--comprise a unique family of receptor tyrosine kinases, in that as a group they play no essential role in embryonic development. Instead, they function as homeostatic regulators in adult tissues and organ systems that are subject to continuous challenge and renewal throughout life. Their regulatory roles are prominent in the mature immune, reproductive, hematopoietic, vascular, and nervous systems. The TAMs and their ligands--Gas6 and Protein S--are essential for the efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and membranes in these tissues; and in the immune system, they act as pleiotropic inhibitors of the innate inflammatory response to pathogens. Deficiencies in TAM signaling are thought to contribute to chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease in humans, and aberrantly elevated TAM signaling is strongly associated with cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to targeted therapies.","864":"The intracellular trafficking machinery contributes to the spatial and temporal control of signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The primary role in this process is played by endocytic trafficking, which regulates the localization of RTKs and their downstream effectors, as well as the duration and the extent of their activity. The key regulatory points along the endocytic pathway are internalization of RTKs from the plasma membrane, their sorting to degradation or recycling, and their residence in various endosomal compartments. Here I will review factors and mechanisms that modulate RTK signaling by (1) affecting receptor internalization, (2) regulating the balance between degradation and recycling of RTK, and (3) compartmentalization of signals in endosomes and other organelles. Cumulatively, these mechanisms illustrate a multilayered control of RTK signaling exerted by the trafficking machinery.

We provide a historical context for the current view of HR and describe how DSBs are processed during HR as well as interactions with other DSB repair pathways. We discuss the enzymology of the process, followed by studies on DSB repair in living cells. Whenever possible, we cite both original articles and reviews to aid the reader for further studies. ","866":"Recent advances in the area of bacterial DNA damage responses are reviewed here. The SOS pathway is still the major paradigm of bacterial DNA damage response, and recent studies have clarified the mechanisms of SOS induction and key physiological roles of SOS including a very major role in genetic exchange and variation. When considering diverse bacteria, it is clear that SOS is not a uniform pathway with one purpose, but rather a platform that has evolved for differing functions in different bacteria. Relating in part to the SOS response, the field has uncovered multiple apparent cell-cycle checkpoints that assist cell survival after DNA damage and remarkable pathways that induce programmed cell death in bacteria. Bacterial DNA damage responses are also much broader than SOS, and several important examples of LexA-independent regulation will be reviewed. Finally, some recent advances that relate to the replication and repair of damaged DNA will be summarized.

Neurospora sports features found in higher eukaryotes but absent in both budding and fission yeast, including DNA methylation and H3K27 methylation, and also has distinct RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing mechanisms operating in mitotic and meiotic cells. This has provided an unexpected wealth of information on gene silencing systems. One silencing mechanism, named repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), has both epigenetic and genetic aspects and provided the first example of a homology-based genome defense system. A second silencing mechanism, named quelling, is an RNAi-based mechanism that results in silencing of transgenes and their native homologs. A third, named meiotic silencing, is also RNAi-based but is distinct from quelling in its time of action, targets, and apparent purpose.

To meet these architectural and functional synaptic demands, it follows that there should be diversity in the mechanisms that control their secretion and retrieval and possibly in the composition of synaptic vesicles within the same terminal. Here we pay particular attention to areas where such diversity is generated, such as the variance in exocytosis\/endocytosis coupling, SNAREs defining functionally diverse synaptic vesicle populations and the adaptor-dependent sorting machineries capable of generating vesicle diversity. We argue that there are various synaptic vesicle recycling pathways at any given synapse and discuss several lines of evidence that support the role of the endosome in synaptic vesicle recycling.

It is becoming clear from the work of many laboratories that the mechanisms necessary to achieve such lipid segregation can operate at very different levels, including the membrane biophysical properties, the interactions with other lipids and proteins, and the turnover rates or distribution of metabolic enzymes. In turn, lipids can directly influence the organelle membrane properties by changing biophysical parameters and by recruiting partner effector proteins involved in protein sorting and membrane dynamics. In this review, we will discuss how lipids are sorted in endosomal membranes and how they impact on endosome functions. ","870":"DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are lesions caused by a variety of endogenous metabolites, environmental exposures, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents that have two reactive groups. The common feature of these diverse lesions is that two nucleotides on opposite strands are covalently joined. ICLs prevent the separation of two DNA strands and therefore essential cellular processes including DNA replication and transcription. ICLs are mainly detected in S phase when a replication fork stalls at an ICL. Damage signaling and repair of ICLs are promoted by the Fanconi anemia pathway and numerous posttranslational modifications of DNA repair and chromatin structural proteins. ICLs are also detected and repaired in nonreplicating cells, although the mechanism is less clear. A unique feature of ICL repair is that both strands of DNA must be incised to completely remove the lesion. This is accomplished in sequential steps to prevent creating multiple double-strand breaks. Unhooking of an ICL from one strand is followed by translesion synthesis to fill the gap and create an intact duplex DNA, harboring a remnant of the ICL. Removal of the lesion from the second strand is likely accomplished by nucleotide excision repair. Inadequate repair of ICLs is particularly detrimental to rapidly dividing cells, explaining the bone marrow failure characteristic of Fanconi anemia and why cross-linking agents are efficacious in cancer therapy. Herein, recent advances in our understanding of ICLs and the biological responses they trigger are discussed.

Deficiencies in NER are associated with the extremely skin cancer-prone inherited disorder xeroderma pigmentosum. Although the core NER reaction and the factors that execute it have been known for some years, recent studies have led to a much more detailed understanding of the NER mechanism, how NER operates in the context of chromatin, and how it is connected to other cellular processes such as DNA damage signaling and transcription.

Consistent with their helicase ancestry, these enzymes experience conformation changes as they bind and hydrolyze ATP. At the same time they interact with DNA and histones, which alters histone-DNA interactions in target nucleosomes. Their action may lead to complete or partial disassembly of nucleosomes, the exchange of histones for variants, the assembly of nucleosomes, or the movement of histone octamers on DNA. \"Remodeling\" may render DNA sequences accessible to interacting proteins or, conversely, promote packing into tightly folded structures. Remodeling processes participate in every aspect of genome function. Remodeling activities are commonly integrated with other mechanisms such as histone modifications or RNA metabolism to assemble stable, epigenetic states.","877":"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) drive multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis and cytokinetic abscission. Originally identified through genetics and cell biology, more recent work has begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ESCRT-mediated membrane remodeling, with special focus on the ESCRT-III complex. In particular, several light and electron microscopic studies provide high-resolution imaging of ESCRT-III rings and spirals that purportedly drive MVB morphogenesis and abscission. These studies highlight unifying principles to ESCRT-III function, in particular: (1) the ordered assembly of the ESCRT-III monomers into a heteropolymer, (2) ESCRT-III as a dynamic complex, and (3) the role of the AAA ATPase Vps4 as a contributing factor in membrane scission. Mechanistic comparisons of ESCRT-III function in MVB morphogenesis and cytokinesis suggest common mechanisms in membrane remodeling.","878":"In eukaryotic cells, maintenance of genomic stability relies on the coordinated action of a network of cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, and others. The DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway orchestrated by the ATM and ATR kinases is the central regulator of this network in response to DNA damage. Both ATM and ATR are activated by DNA damage and DNA replication stress, but their DNA-damage specificities are distinct and their functions are not redundant. Furthermore, ATM and ATR often work together to signal DNA damage and regulate downstream processes. Here, we will discuss the recent findings and current models of how ATM and ATR sense DNA damage, how they are activated by DNA damage, and how they function in concert to regulate the DDR.","879":"By some estimates, a eukaryotic cell must repair up to 10,000 DNA lesions per cell cycle to counteract endogenous sources of DNA damage. Exposure to environmental toxins, UV sources, or other radiations only increases this enormous number. Failure to repair such lesions can lead to a deleterious mutation rate, genomic instability, or cell death. The timely and efficient repair of eukaryotic DNA damage is further complicated by the realization that DNA lesions must be detected and repaired in the context of chromatin with its complex organization within the nucleus. Numerous studies have shown that chromatin packaging can inhibit nearly all repair pathways, and recent work has defined specific mechanisms that facilitate DNA repair within the chromatin context. In this review, we provide a broad overview of chromatin regulatory mechanisms, mainly at the nucleosomal level, and then focus on recent work that elucidates the role of chromatin structure in regulating the timely and efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).","880":"The endothelial cell is the essential cell type forming the inner layer of the vasculature. Two families of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are almost completely endothelial cell specific: the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFR1-3) and the Tie receptors (Tie1 and Tie2). Both are key players governing the generation of blood and lymphatic vessels during embryonic development. Because the growth of new blood and lymphatic vessels (or the lack thereof) is a central element in many diseases, the VEGF and the Tie receptors provide attractive therapeutic targets in various diseases. Indeed, several drugs directed to these RTK signaling pathways are already on the market, whereas many are in clinical trials. Here we review the VEGFR and Tie families, their involvement in developmental and pathological angiogenesis, and the different possibilities for targeting them to either block or enhance angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.","881":"The Eph receptors are the largest of the RTK families. Like other RTKs, they transduce signals from the cell exterior to the interior through ligand-induced activation of their kinase domain. However, the Eph receptors also have distinctive features. Instead of binding soluble ligands, they generally mediate contact-dependent cell-cell communication by interacting with surface-associated ligands-the ephrins-on neighboring cells. Eph receptor-ephrin complexes emanate bidirectional signals that affect both receptor- and ephrin-expressing cells. Intriguingly, ephrins can also attenuate signaling by Eph receptors coexpressed in the same cell. Additionally, Eph receptors can modulate cell behavior independently of ephrin binding and kinase activity. The Eph\/ephrin system regulates many developmental processes and adult tissue homeostasis. Its abnormal function has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer. Thus, Eph receptors represent promising therapeutic targets. However, more research is needed to better understand the many aspects of their complex biology that remain mysterious.","882":"Although required for life, paradoxically, mitochondria are often essential for initiating apoptotic cell death. Mitochondria regulate caspase activation and cell death through an event termed mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP); this leads to the release of various mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins that activate caspases, resulting in apoptosis. MOMP is often considered a point of no return because it typically leads to cell death, even in the absence of caspase activity. Because of this pivotal role in deciding cell fate, deregulation of MOMP impacts on many diseases and represents a fruitful site for therapeutic intervention. Here we discuss the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial permeabilization and how this key event leads to cell death through caspase-dependent and -independent means. We then proceed to explore how the release of mitochondrial proteins may be regulated following MOMP. Finally, we discuss mechanisms that enable cells sometimes to survive MOMP, allowing them, in essence, to return from the point of no return.","883":"Position-effect variegation (PEV) results when a gene normally in euchromatin is juxtaposed with heterochromatin by rearrangement or transposition. When heterochromatin packaging spreads across the heterochromatin\/euchromatin border, it causes transcriptional silencing in a stochastic pattern. PEV is intensely studied in Drosophila using the white gene. Screens for dominant mutations that suppress or enhance white variegation have identified many conserved epigenetic factors, including the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9. Heterochromatin protein HP1a binds H3K9me2\/3 and interacts with SU(VAR)3-9, creating a core memory system. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical analysis of PEV in Drosophila has contributed many key findings concerning establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin with concomitant gene silencing. ","884":"Hundreds of eukaryotic membrane proteins are anchored to membranes by a single transmembrane domain at their carboxyl terminus. Many of these tail-anchored (TA) proteins are posttranslationally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for insertion by the guided-entry of TA protein insertion (GET) pathway. In recent years, most of the components of this conserved pathway have been biochemically and structurally characterized. Get3 is the pathway-targeting factor that uses nucleotide-linked conformational changes to mediate the delivery of TA proteins between the GET pretargeting machinery in the cytosol and the transmembrane pathway components in the ER. Here we focus on the mechanism of the yeast GET pathway and make a speculative analogy between its membrane insertion step and the ATPase-driven cycle of ABC transporters. ","885":"Transcriptional arrest caused by DNA damage is detrimental for cells and organisms as it impinges on gene expression and thereby on cell growth and survival. To alleviate transcriptional arrest, cells trigger a transcription-dependent genome surveillance pathway, termed transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) that ensures rapid removal of such transcription-impeding DNA lesions and prevents persistent stalling of transcription. Defective TC-NER is causatively linked to Cockayne syndrome, a rare severe genetic disorder with multisystem abnormalities that results in patients' death in early adulthood. Here we review recent data on how damage-arrested transcription is actively coupled to TC-NER in mammals and discuss new emerging models concerning the role of TC-NER-specific factors in this process. ","886":"Iron-sulfur (Fe\/S) clusters belong to the most ancient protein cofactors in life, and fulfill functions in electron transport, enzyme catalysis, homeostatic regulation, and sulfur activation. The synthesis of Fe\/S clusters and their insertion into apoproteins requires almost 30 proteins in the mitochondria and cytosol of eukaryotic cells. This review summarizes our current biochemical knowledge of mitochondrial Fe\/S protein maturation. Because this pathway is essential for various extramitochondrial processes, we then explain how mitochondria contribute to the mechanism of cytosolic and nuclear Fe\/S protein biogenesis, and to other connected processes including nuclear DNA replication and repair, telomere maintenance, and transcription. We next describe how the efficiency of mitochondria to assemble Fe\/S proteins is used to regulate cellular iron homeostasis. Finally, we briefly summarize a number of mitochondrial \"Fe\/S diseases\" in which various biogenesis components are functionally impaired owing to genetic mutations. The thorough understanding of the diverse biochemical disease phenotypes helps with testing the current working model for the molecular mechanism of Fe\/S protein biogenesis and its connected processes. ","887":"The receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) are members of the type III class of PTK receptors, which are characterized by five Ig-like domains extracellularly and a split kinase domain intracellularly. The receptors are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, leading to autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues. Thereby the kinase activities of the receptors are activated and docking sites for downstream SH2 domain signal transduction molecules are created; activation of these pathways promotes cell growth, survival, and migration. These receptors mediate important signals during the embryonal development, and control tissue homeostasis in the adult. Their overactivity is seen in malignancies and other diseases involving excessive cell proliferation, such as atherosclerosis and fibrotic diseases. In cancer, mutations of PDGF and SCF receptors-including gene fusions, point mutations, and amplifications-drive subpopulations of certain malignancies, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, glioblastoma, acute myeloid leukemia, mastocytosis, and melanoma. ","888":"Our knowledge of molecular mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling advances with ever-increasing pace. Yet our understanding of how the spatiotemporal dynamics of RTK signaling control specific cellular outcomes has lagged behind. Systems-centered experimental and computational approaches can help reveal how overlapping networks of signal transducers downstream of RTKs orchestrate specific cell-fate decisions. We discuss how RTK network regulatory structures, which involve the immediate posttranslational and delayed transcriptional controls by multiple feed forward and feedback loops together with pathway cross talk, adapt cells to the combinatorial variety of external cues and conditions. This intricate network circuitry endows cells with emerging capabilities for RTK signal processing and decoding. We illustrate how mathematical modeling facilitates our understanding of RTK network behaviors by unraveling specific systems properties, including bistability, oscillations, excitable responses, and generation of intricate landscapes of signaling activities. ","889":"The eukaryotic replicative helicase, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, is composed of six distinct, but related, subunits MCM(2-7). The relationship between the sequences of the subunits indicates that they are derived from a common ancestor and indeed, present-day archaea possess a homohexameric MCM. Recent progress in the biochemical and structural studies of both eukaryal and archaeal MCM complexes are beginning to shed light on the mechanisms of action of this key component of the replisome. ","890":"Recent advances in the characterization of the archaeal DNA replication system together with comparative genomic analysis have led to the identification of several previously uncharacterized archaeal proteins involved in replication and currently reveal a nearly complete correspondence between the components of the archaeal and eukaryotic replication machineries. It can be inferred that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes and even the last common ancestor of all extant archaea possessed replication machineries that were comparable in complexity to the eukaryotic replication system. The eukaryotic replication system encompasses multiple paralogs of ancestral components such that heteromeric complexes in eukaryotes replace archaeal homomeric complexes, apparently along with subfunctionalization of the eukaryotic complex subunits. In the archaea, parallel, lineage-specific duplications of many genes encoding replication machinery components are detectable as well; most of these archaeal paralogs remain to be functionally characterized. The archaeal replication system shows remarkable plasticity whereby even some essential components such as DNA polymerase and single-stranded DNA-binding protein are displaced by unrelated proteins with analogous activities in some lineages. ","891":"In this article, we discuss the significance of DNA replication proteins in human disease. There is a broad range of mutations in genes encoding replication proteins, which result in several distinct clinical disorders that share common themes. One group of replication proteins, the MCMs, has emerged as effective biomarkers for early detection of a range of common cancers. They offer practical and theoretical advantages over other replication proteins and have been developed for widespread clinical use. ","892":"Recombination-dependent DNA replication, often called break-induced replication (BIR), was initially invoked to explain recombination events in bacteriophage but it has recently been recognized as a fundamentally important mechanism to repair double-strand chromosome breaks in eukaryotes. This mechanism appears to be critically important in the restarting of stalled and broken replication forks and in maintaining the integrity of eroded telomeres. Although BIR helps preserve genome integrity during replication, it also promotes genome instability by the production of loss of heterozygosity and the formation of nonreciprocal translocations, as well as in the generation of complex chromosomal rearrangements. ","893":"The proliferation of all organisms depends on the coordination of enzymatic events within large multiprotein replisomes that duplicate chromosomes. Whereas the structure and function of many core replisome components have been clarified, the timing and order of molecular events during replication remains obscure. To better understand the replication mechanism, new methods must be developed that allow for the observation and characterization of short-lived states and dynamic events at single replication forks. Over the last decade, great progress has been made toward this goal with the development of novel DNA nanomanipulation and fluorescence imaging techniques allowing for the direct observation of replication-fork dynamics both reconstituted in vitro and in live cells. This article reviews these new single-molecule approaches and the revised understanding of replisome operation that has emerged. ","894":"Many replication proteins assemble on the pre-RC-formed replication origins and constitute the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC). This complex formation facilitates the conversion of Mcm2-7 in the pre-RC to an active DNA helicase, the Cdc45-Mcm-GINS (CMG) complex. Two protein kinases, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), work to complete the formation of the pre-IC. Each kinase is responsible for a distinct step of the process in yeast; Cdc45 associates with origins in a DDK-dependent manner, whereas the association of GINS with origins depends on CDK. These associations with origins also require specific initiation proteins: Sld3 for Cdc45; and Dpb11, Sld2, and Sld3 for GINS. Functional homologs of these proteins exist in metazoa, although pre-IC formation cannot be separated by requirement of DDK and CDK because of experimental limitations. Once the replicative helicase is activated, the origin DNA is unwound, and bidirectional replication forks are established. ","895":"Living cells are continually exposed to DNA-damaging agents that threaten their genomic integrity. Although DNA repair processes rapidly target the damaged DNA for repair, some lesions nevertheless persist and block genome duplication by the cell's replicase. To avoid the deleterious consequence of a stalled replication fork, cells use specialized polymerases to traverse the damage. This process, termed \"translesion DNA synthesis\" (TLS), affords the cell additional time to repair the damage before the replicase returns to complete genome duplication. In many cases, this damage-tolerance mechanism is error-prone, and cell survival is often associated with an increased risk of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Despite being tightly regulated by a variety of transcriptional and posttranslational controls, the low-fidelity TLS polymerases also gain access to undamaged DNA where their inaccurate synthesis may actually be beneficial for genetic diversity and evolutionary fitness. ","896":"Poxviruses are large, enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm and encode proteins for DNA replication and gene expression. Hairpin ends link the two strands of the linear, double-stranded DNA genome. Viral proteins involved in DNA synthesis include a 117-kDa polymerase, a helicase-primase, a uracil DNA glycosylase, a processivity factor, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, a protein kinase, and a DNA ligase. A viral FEN1 family protein participates in double-strand break repair. The DNA is replicated as long concatemers that are resolved by a viral Holliday junction endonuclease. ","897":"Patterns of replication within eukaryotic genomes correlate with gene expression, chromatin structure, and genome evolution. Recent advances in genome-scale mapping of replication kinetics have allowed these correlations to be explored in many species, cell types, and growth conditions, and these large data sets have allowed quantitative and computational analyses. One striking new correlation to emerge from these analyses is between replication timing and the three-dimensional structure of chromosomes. This correlation, which is significantly stronger than with any single histone modification or chromosome-binding protein, suggests that replication timing is controlled at the level of chromosomal domains. This conclusion dovetails with parallel work on the heterogeneity of origin firing and the competition between origins for limiting activators to suggest a model in which the stochastic probability of individual origin firing is modulated by chromosomal domain structure to produce patterns of replication. Whether these patterns have inherent biological functions or simply reflect higher-order genome structure is an open question. ","898":"The onset of genomic DNA synthesis requires precise interactions of specialized initiator proteins with DNA at sites where the replication machinery can be loaded. These sites, defined as replication origins, are found at a few unique locations in all of the prokaryotic chromosomes examined so far. However, replication origins are dispersed among tens of thousands of loci in metazoan chromosomes, thereby raising questions regarding the role of specific nucleotide sequences and chromatin environment in origin selection and the mechanisms used by initiators to recognize replication origins. Close examination of bacterial and archaeal replication origins reveals an array of DNA sequence motifs that position individual initiator protein molecules and promote initiator oligomerization on origin DNA. Conversely, the need for specific recognition sequences in eukaryotic replication origins is relaxed. In fact, the primary rule for origin selection appears to be flexibility, a feature that is modulated either by structural elements or by epigenetic mechanisms at least partly linked to the organization of the genome for gene expression. ","899":"DNA replication is tightly controlled in eukaryotic cells to ensure that an exact copy of the genetic material is inherited by both daughter cells. Oscillating waves of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and anaphase-promoting complex\/cyclosome (APC\/C) activities provide a binary switch that permits the replication of each chromosome exactly once per cell cycle. Work from several organisms has revealed a conserved strategy whereby inactive replication complexes are assembled onto DNA during periods of low CDK and high APC activity but are competent to execute genome duplication only when these activities are reversed. Periods of high CDK and low APC\/C serve an essential function by blocking reassembly of replication complexes, thereby preventing rereplication. Higher eukaryotes have evolved additional CDK-independent mechanisms for preventing rereplication.","900":"A fundamental role of the mammalian immune system is to eradicate pathogens while minimizing immunopathology. Instigating and maintaining immunological tolerance within the intestine represents a unique challenge to the mucosal immune system. Regulatory T cells are critical for continued immune tolerance in the intestine through active control of innate and adaptive immune responses. Dynamic adaptation of regulatory T-cell populations to the intestinal tissue microenvironment is key in this process. Here, we discuss specialization of regulatory T-cell responses in the intestine, and how a breakdown in these processes can lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. ","901":"In plants, RNA silencing is a fundamental regulator of gene expression, heterochromatin formation, suppression of transposable elements, and defense against viruses. The sequence specificity of these processes relies on small noncoding RNA (sRNA) molecules. Although the spreading of RNA silencing across the plant has been recognized for nearly two decades, only recently have sRNAs been formally demonstrated as the mobile silencing signals. Here, we discuss the various types of mobile sRNA molecules, their short- and long-range movement, and their function in recipient cells. ","902":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a well-studied model system for heritable silent chromatin, in which a nonhistone protein complex--the SIR complex--represses genes by spreading in a sequence-independent manner, much like heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes. The ability to study mutations in histones and to screen genome-wide for mutations that impair silencing has yielded an unparalleled depth of detail about this system. Recent advances in the biochemistry and structural biology of the SIR-chromatin complex bring us much closer to a molecular understanding of how Sir3 selectively recognizes the deacetylated histone H4 tail and demethylated histone H3 core. The existence of appropriate mutants has also shown how components of the silencing machinery affect physiological processes beyond transcriptional repression.","903":"The dynamics of mitochondrial biogenesis and function is a complex interplay of cellular and molecular processes that ultimately shape bioenergetics capacity. Mitochondrial mass, by itself, represents the net balance between rates of biogenesis and degradation. Mitochondrial biogenesis is dependent on different signaling cascades and transcriptional complexes that promote the formation and assembly of mitochondria--a process that is heavily dependent on timely and coordinated transcriptional control of genes encoding for mitochondrial proteins. In this article, we discuss the major signals and transcriptional complexes, programming mitochondrial biogenesis, and bioenergetic activity. This regulatory network represents a new therapeutic window into the treatment of the wide spectrum of mitochondrial and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetic deficiencies.","904":"The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is a champion of extreme radiation resistance that is accounted for by a highly efficient protection against proteome, but not genome, damage. A well-protected functional proteome ensures cell recovery from extensive radiation damage to other cellular constituents by molecular repair and turnover processes, including an efficient repair of disintegrated DNA. Therefore, cell death correlates with radiation-induced protein damage, rather than DNA damage, in both robust and standard species. From the reviewed biology of resistance to radiation and other sources of oxidative damage, we conclude that the impact of protein damage on the maintenance of life has been largely underestimated in biology and medicine. ","905":"The accurate copying of genetic information in the double helix of DNA is essential for inheritance of traits that define the phenotype of cells and the organism. The core machineries that copy DNA are conserved in all three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. This article outlines the general nature of the DNA replication machinery, but also points out important and key differences. The most complex organisms, eukaryotes, have to coordinate the initiation of DNA replication from many origins in each genome and impose regulation that maintains genomic integrity, not only for the sake of each cell, but for the organism as a whole. In addition, DNA replication in eukaryotes needs to be coordinated with inheritance of chromatin, developmental patterning of tissues, and cell division to ensure that the genome replicates once per cell division cycle. ","906":"Since its discovery more than 25 years ago, numerous studies have established that the MET receptor is unique among tyrosine kinases. Signaling through MET is necessary for normal development and for the progression of a wide range of human cancers. MET activation has been shown to drive numerous signaling pathways; however, it is not clear how MET signaling mediates diverse cellular responses such as motility, invasion, growth, and angiogenesis. Great strides have been made in understanding the pleotropic aspects of MET signaling using three-dimensional molecular structures, cell culture systems, human tumors, and animal models. These combined approaches have driven the development of MET-targeted therapeutics that have shown promising results in the clinic. Here we examine the unique features of MET and hepatocyte growth factor\/scatter factor (HGF\/SF) structure and signaling, mutational activation, genetic mouse models of MET and HGF\/SF, and MET-targeted therapeutics. ","907":"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were believed until recently to act at the cell membrane in a singular fashion (i.e., binding of ligands on the extracellular domain would activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the intracellular domain), which would then start a cascade involving other intracellular signaling molecules that would act as effectors. However, new evidence indicates that some RTKs can signal through a different modality; they can move into the nucleus where they directly exert their actions. Although some studies have showed that the proteolytically released intracellular domain of several RTKs can move to the nucleus where they influence gene expression and cell function, others suggest that RTKs can also move to the nucleus as holoproteins. The identification of this novel signaling mechanism calls for a critical reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of RTKs and their biological roles. ","908":"Genome integrity is challenged by DNA damage from both endogenous and environmental sources. This damage must be repaired to allow both RNA and DNA polymerases to accurately read and duplicate the information in the genome. Multiple repair enzymes scan the DNA for problems, remove the offending damage, and restore the DNA duplex. These repair mechanisms are regulated by DNA damage response kinases including DNA-PKcs, ATM, and ATR that are activated at DNA lesions. These kinases improve the efficiency of DNA repair by phosphorylating repair proteins to modify their activities, by initiating a complex series of changes in the local chromatin structure near the damage site, and by altering the overall cellular environment to make it more conducive to repair. In this review, we focus on these three levels of regulation to illustrate how the DNA damage kinases promote efficient repair to maintain genome integrity and prevent disease. ","909":"Caspases are proteases at the heart of networks that govern apoptosis and inflammation. The past decade has seen huge leaps in understanding the biology and chemistry of the caspases, largely through the development of synthetic substrates and inhibitors. Such agents are used to define the role of caspases in transmitting life and death signals, in imaging caspases in situ and in vivo, and in deconvoluting the networks that govern cell behavior. Additionally, focused proteomics methods have begun to reveal the natural substrates of caspases in the thousands. Together, these chemical and proteomics technologies are setting the scene for designing and implementing control of caspase activity as appropriate targets for disease therapy. ","910":"The size of a eukaryotic genome presents a unique challenge to the cell: package and organize the DNA to fit within the confines of the nucleus while at the same time ensuring sufficient dynamics to allow access to specific sequences and features such as genes and regulatory elements. This is achieved via the dynamic nucleoprotein organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, comprises a core particle with 147 bp of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around an octamer of histones. The nucleosome is a highly versatile and modular structure, both in its composition, with the existence of various histone variants, and through the addition of a series of posttranslational modifications on the histones. This versatility allows for both short-term regulatory responses to external signaling, as well as the long-term and multigenerational definition of large functional chromosomal domains within the nucleus, such as the centromere. Chromatin organization and its dynamics participate in essentially all DNA-templated processes, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair. Here we will focus mainly on nucleosomal organization and describe the pathways and mechanisms that contribute to assembly of this organization and the role of chromatin in regulating the DNA replication program. ","911":"The attachment of glycans to asparagine residues of proteins is an abundant and highly conserved essential modification in eukaryotes. The N-glycosylation process includes two principal phases: the assembly of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) and the transfer of the oligosaccharide to selected asparagine residues of polypeptide chains. Biosynthesis of the LLO takes place at both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and it involves a series of specific glycosyltransferases that catalyze the assembly of the branched oligosaccharide in a highly defined way. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) selects the Asn-X-Ser\/Thr consensus sequence on polypeptide chains and generates the N-glycosidic linkage between the side-chain amide of asparagine and the oligosaccharide. This ER-localized pathway results in a systemic modification of the proteome, the basis for the Golgi-catalyzed modification of the N-linked glycans, generating the large diversity of N-glycoproteome in eukaryotic cells. This article focuses on the processes in the ER. Based on the highly conserved nature of this pathway we concentrate on the mechanisms in the eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ","912":"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) signal in a paracrine or endocrine fashion to mediate a myriad of biological activities, ranging from issuing developmental cues, maintaining tissue homeostasis, and regulating metabolic processes. FGFs carry out their diverse functions by binding and dimerizing FGF receptors (FGFRs) in a heparan sulfate (HS) cofactor- or Klotho coreceptor-assisted manner. The accumulated wealth of structural and biophysical data in the past decade has transformed our understanding of the mechanism of FGF signaling in human health and development, and has provided novel concepts in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. Among these contributions are the elucidation of HS-assisted receptor dimerization, delineation of the molecular determinants of ligand-receptor specificity, tyrosine kinase regulation, receptor cis-autoinhibition, and tyrosine trans-autophosphorylation. These structural studies have also revealed how disease-associated mutations highjack the physiological mechanisms of FGFR regulation to contribute to human diseases. In this paper, we will discuss the structurally and biophysically derived mechanisms of FGF signaling, and how the insights gained may guide the development of therapies for treatment of a diverse array of human diseases.","913":"Proteins to be secreted are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. The transport of these proteins requires the localization and activity of proteins that create ER exit sites, coat proteins to collect cargo and to reshape the membrane into a transport container, and address labels--SNARE proteins--to target the vesicles specifically to the Golgi apparatus. In addition some proteins may need export chaperones or export receptors to enable their exit into transport vesicles. ER export factors, SNAREs, and misfolded Golgi-resident proteins must all be retrieved from the Golgi to the ER again. This retrieval is also part of the organellar homeostasis pathway essential to maintaining the identity of the ER and of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I will discuss the different processes in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER and highlight the mechanistic insights we have obtained in the last couple of years.","914":"Mitochondria are partially autonomous organelles that depend on the import of certain proteins and lipids to maintain cell survival and membrane formation. Although phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylethanolamine are synthesized by mitochondrial enzymes, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and sterols need to be imported from other organelles. The origin of most lipids imported into mitochondria is the endoplasmic reticulum, which requires interaction of these two subcellular compartments. Recently, protein complexes that are involved in membrane contact between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were identified, but their role in lipid transport is still unclear. In the present review, we describe components involved in lipid translocation between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and discuss functional as well as regulatory aspects that are important for lipid homeostasis.","915":"In 1959, Arthur Kornberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on the principles by which DNA is duplicated by DNA polymerases. Since then, it has been confirmed in all branches of life that replicative DNA polymerases require a single-stranded template to build a complementary strand, but they cannot start a new DNA strand de novo. Thus, they also depend on a primase, which generally assembles a short RNA primer to provide a 3'-OH that can be extended by the replicative DNA polymerase. The general principles that (1) a helicase unwinds the double-stranded DNA, (2) single-stranded DNA-binding proteins stabilize the single-stranded DNA, (3) a primase builds a short RNA primer, and (4) a clamp loader loads a clamp to (5) facilitate the loading and processivity of the replicative polymerase, are well conserved among all species. Replication of the genome is remarkably robust and is performed with high fidelity even in extreme environments. Work over the last decade or so has confirmed (6) that a common two-metal ion-promoted mechanism exists for the nucleotidyltransferase reaction that builds DNA strands, and (7) that the replicative DNA polymerases always act as a key component of larger multiprotein assemblies, termed replisomes. Furthermore (8), the integrity of replisomes is maintained by multiple protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, many of which are inherently weak. This enables large conformational changes to occur without dissociation of replisome components, and also means that in general replisomes cannot be isolated intact.","916":"The molecular era of telomere biology began with the discovery that telomeres usually consist of G-rich simple repeats and end with 3' single-stranded tails. Enormous progress has been made in identifying the mechanisms that maintain and replenish telomeric DNA and the proteins that protect them from degradation, fusions, and checkpoint activation. Although telomeres in different organisms (or even in the same organism under different conditions) are maintained by different mechanisms, the disparate processes have the common goals of repairing defects caused by semiconservative replication through G-rich DNA, countering the shortening caused by incomplete replication, and postreplication regeneration of G tails. In addition, standard DNA repair mechanisms must be suppressed or modified at telomeres to prevent their being recognized and processed as DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we discuss the players and processes that maintain and regenerate telomere structure.","917":"Neurons, perhaps more than any other cell type, depend on mitochondrial trafficking for their survival. Recent studies have elucidated a motor\/adaptor complex on the mitochondrial surface that is shared between neurons and other animal cells. In addition to kinesin and dynein, this complex contains the proteins Miro (also called RhoT1\/2) and milton (also called TRAK1\/2) and is responsible for much, although not necessarily all, mitochondrial movement. Elucidation of the complex has permitted inroads for understanding how this movement is regulated by a variety of intracellular signals, although many mysteries remain. Regulating mitochondrial movement can match energy demand to energy supply throughout the extraordinary architecture of these cells and can control the clearance and replenishing of mitochondria in the periphery. Because the extended axons of neurons contain uniformly polarized microtubules, they have been useful for studying mitochondrial motility in conjunction with biochemical assays in many cell types.","918":"Mitochondria continually change shape through the combined actions of fission, fusion, and movement along cytoskeletal tracks. The lengths of mitochondria and the degree to which they form closed networks are determined by the balance between fission and fusion rates. These rates are influenced by metabolic and pathogenic conditions inside mitochondria and by their cellular environment. Fission and fusion are important for growth, for mitochondrial redistribution, and for maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial network. In addition, mitochondrial fission and fusion play prominent roles in disease-related processes such as apoptosis and mitophagy. Three members of the Dynamin family are key components of the fission and fusion machineries. Their functions are controlled by different sets of adaptor proteins on the surface of mitochondria and by a range of regulatory processes. Here, we review what is known about these proteins and the processes that regulate their actions.","919":"Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes. The Drosophila genome encodes more than 20 receptor tyrosine kinases and extensive studies in the past 20 years have illustrated their diverse roles and complex signaling mechanisms. Although some receptor tyrosine kinases have highly specific functions, others strikingly are used in rather ubiquitous manners. Receptor tyrosine kinases regulate a broad expanse of processes, ranging from cell survival and proliferation to differentiation and patterning. Remarkably, different receptor tyrosine kinases share many of the same effectors and their hierarchical organization is retained in disparate biological contexts. In this comprehensive review, we summarize what is known regarding each receptor tyrosine kinase during Drosophila development. Astonishingly, very little is known for approximately half of all Drosophila receptor tyrosine kinases.","920":"Caspases are the primary drivers of apoptotic cell death, cleaving cellular proteins that are critical for dismantling the dying cell. Initially translated as inactive zymogenic precursors, caspases are activated in response to a variety of cell death stimuli. In addition to factors required for their direct activation (e.g., dimerizing adaptor proteins in the case of initiator caspases that lie at the apex of apoptotic signaling cascades), caspases are regulated by a variety of cellular factors in a myriad of physiological and pathological settings. For example, caspases may be modified posttranslationally (e.g., by phosphorylation or ubiquitylation) or through interaction of modulatory factors with either the zymogenic or active form of a caspase, altering its activation and\/or activity. These regulatory events may inhibit or enhance enzymatic activity or may affect activity toward particular cellular substrates. Finally, there is emerging literature to suggest that caspases can participate in a variety of cellular processes unrelated to apoptotic cell death. In these settings, it is particularly important that caspases are maintained under stringent control to avoid inadvertent cell death. It is likely that continued examination of these processes will reveal new mechanisms of caspase regulation with implications well beyond control of apoptotic cell death.","921":"Under favorable conditions DNA can survive for thousands of years in the remains of dead organisms. The DNA extracted from such remains is invariably degraded to a small average size by processes that at least partly involve depurination. It also contains large amounts of deaminated cytosine residues that are accumulated toward the ends of the molecules, as well as several other lesions that are less well characterized. ","922":"The nuclear envelope (NE) is a specific extension of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that wraps around the nucleus and enables the spatial separation of gene transcription and protein translation, one of the signature features of eukaryotes. Rather than being completely closed, the double lipid bilayer of the NE is perforated at sites where the inner and outer nuclear membranes fuse, resulting in circular openings lined with sharply bent membranes. These openings are filled with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), enormous protein assemblies that facilitate nuclear transport. The scaffold components of the NPC surprisingly share interesting similarities with elements of coat protein complexes, which have general implications for function and evolution of these membrane-coating complexes. Here I discuss, from a structural perspective, what these findings might teach us. ","923":"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are prevalent pathogens of mucosal and cutaneous epithelia. Productive infections of squamous epithelia lead to benign hyperproliferative warts, condylomata, or papillomas. Persistent infections of the anogenital mucosa by high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 and closely related types can infrequently progress to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias, carcinomas-in-situ, and invasive cancers in women and men. HPV-16 is also associated with a fraction of head and neck cancers. We discuss the interactions of the mucosotropic HPVs with the host regulatory proteins and pathways that lead to benign coexistence and enable HPV DNA amplification or, alternatively, to cancers that no longer support viral production. ","924":"Alternative excision repair (AER) is a category of excision repair initiated by a single nick, made by an endonuclease, near the site of DNA damage, and followed by excision of the damaged DNA, repair synthesis, and ligation. The ultraviolet (UV) damage endonuclease in fungi and bacteria introduces a nick immediately 5' to various types of UV damage and initiates its excision repair that is independent of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Endo IV-type apurinic\/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases from Escherichia coli and yeast and human Exo III-type AP endonuclease APEX1 introduce a nick directly and immediately 5' to various types of oxidative base damage besides the AP site, initiating excision repair. Another endonuclease, endonuclease V from bacteria to humans, binds deaminated bases and cleaves the phosphodiester bond located 1 nucleotide 3' of the base, leading to excision repair. A single-strand break in DNA is one of the most frequent types of DNA damage within cells and is repaired efficiently. AER makes use of such repair capability of single-strand breaks, removes DNA damage, and has an important role in complementing BER and NER.","925":"Endocytosis is the major regulator of signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The canonical model of RTK endocytosis involves rapid internalization of an RTK activated by ligand binding at the cell surface and subsequent sorting of internalized ligand-RTK complexes to lysosomes for degradation. Activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RTKs results in autophosphorylation, which is mechanistically coupled to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and conjugation of ubiquitin to RTKs. Ubiquitination serves to mediate interactions of RTKs with sorting machineries both at the cell surface and on endosomes. The pathways and kinetics of RTK endocytic trafficking, molecular mechanisms underlying sorting processes, and examples of deviations from the standard trafficking itinerary in the RTK family are discussed in this work.","926":"Peroxisomes are essential cellular organelles involved in lipid metabolism. Patients affected by severe peroxisome biogenesis disorders rarely survive their first year. Genetic screens in several model organisms have identified more than 30 PEX genes that are required for the formation of functional peroxisomes. Despite significant work on the PEX genes, the biogenic origin of peroxisomes remains controversial. For at least two decades, the prevailing model postulated that peroxisomes propagate by growth and fission of preexisting peroxisomes. In this review, we focus on the recent evidence supporting a new, semiautonomous model of peroxisomal biogenesis. According to this model, peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the peroxisome by a vesicular budding, targeting, and fusion process while peroxisomal matrix proteins are imported into the organelle by an autonomous, posttranslational mechanism. We highlight the contradictory conclusions reached to answer the question of how PMPs are inserted into the ER. We then review what we know and what still remains to be elucidated about the mechanism of PMP exit from the ER and the contribution of preperoxisomal vesicles to mature peroxisomes. Finally, we discuss discrepancies in our understanding of de novo peroxisome biogenesis in wild-type cells. We anticipate that resolving these key issues will lead to a more complete picture of peroxisome biogenesis.","927":"In this article, we will cover the folding of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including the role of three types of covalent modifications: signal peptide removal, N-linked glycosylation, and disulfide bond formation, as well as the function and importance of resident ER folding factors. These folding factors consist of classical chaperones and their cochaperones, the carbohydrate-binding chaperones, and the folding catalysts of the PDI and proline cis-trans isomerase families. We will conclude with the perspective of the folding protein: a comparison of characteristics and folding and exit rates for proteins that travel through the ER as clients of the ER machinery.","928":"In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that prokaryotes and eukaryotes are armed with sophisticated mechanisms to restart stalled or collapsed replication forks. Although these processes are better understood in bacteria, major breakthroughs have also been made to explain how fork restart mechanisms operate in eukaryotic cells. In particular, repriming on the leading strand and fork regression are now established as critical for the maintenance and recovery of stalled forks in both systems. Despite the lack of conservation between the factors involved, these mechanisms are strikingly similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, they differ in that fork restart occurs in the context of chromatin in eukaryotes and is controlled by multiple regulatory pathways.","929":"Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) refers to a set of genome maintenance pathways in which two DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends are (re)joined by apposition, processing, and ligation without the use of extended homology to guide repair. Canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) is a well-defined pathway with clear roles in protecting the integrity of chromosomes when DSBs arise. Recent advances have revealed much about the identity, structure, and function of c-NHEJ proteins, but many questions exist regarding their concerted action in the context of chromatin. Alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) refers to more recently described mechanism(s) that repair DSBs in less-efficient backup reactions. There is great interest in defining alt-NHEJ more precisely, including its regulation relative to c-NHEJ, in light of evidence that alt-NHEJ can execute chromosome rearrangements. Progress toward these goals is reviewed.","930":"DNA molecules in mitochondria, just like those in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, are constantly damaged by noxious agents. Eukaryotic cells have developed efficient mechanisms to deal with this assault. The process of DNA repair in mitochondria, initially believed nonexistent, has now evolved into a mature area of research. In recent years, it has become increasingly appreciated that mitochondria possess many of the same DNA repair pathways that the nucleus does. Moreover, a unique pathway that is enabled by high redundancy of the mitochondrial DNA and allows for the disposal of damaged DNA molecules operates in this organelle. In this review, we attempt to present a unified view of our current understanding of the process of DNA repair in mitochondria with an emphasis on issues that appear controversial.","931":"The packaging of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into DNA-protein assemblies called nucleoids provides an efficient segregating unit of mtDNA, coordinating mtDNA's involvement in cellular metabolism. From the early discovery of mtDNA as \"extranuclear\" genetic material, its organization into nucleoids and integration into both the mitochondrial organellar network and the cell at large via a variety of signal transduction pathways, mtDNA is a crucial component of the cell's homeostatic network. The mitochondrial nucleoid is composed of a set of DNA-binding core proteins involved in mtDNA maintenance and transcription, and a range of peripheral factors, which are components of signaling pathways controlling mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolism, apoptosis, and retrograde mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling. The molecular interactions of nucleoid components with the organellar network and cellular signaling pathways provide exciting clues to the dynamic integration of mtDNA into cellular metabolic homeostasis.","932":"Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is essential for each step in neuromuscular synapse formation. Before innervation, MuSK initiates postsynaptic differentiation, priming the muscle for synapse formation. Approaching motor axons recognize the primed, or prepatterned, region of muscle, causing motor axons to stop growing and differentiate into specialized nerve terminals. MuSK controls presynaptic differentiation by causing the clustering of Lrp4, which functions as a direct retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation. Developing synapses are stabilized by neuronal Agrin, which is released by motor nerve terminals and binds to Lrp4, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, stimulating further association between Lrp4 and MuSK and increasing MuSK kinase activity. In addition, MuSK phosphorylation is stimulated by an inside-out ligand, docking protein-7 (Dok-7), which is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated MuSK and increases MuSK kinase activity. Mutations in MuSK and in genes that function in the MuSK signaling pathway, including Dok-7, cause congenital myasthenia, and autoantibodies to MuSK, Lrp4, and acetylcholine receptors are responsible for myasthenia gravis.","933":"The discovery of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) marked the beginning of one of the most fascinating journeys in modern biomedical research. For the moment, this journey has culminated in the development of drugs that inhibit TNF. TNF blockers have revolutionized the treatment of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Yet, the journey seems far from over. TNF is the founding member of a family of cytokines with crucial functions in cell death, inflammation, and cancer. Some of these factors, most prominently TNF, CD95L, and TRAIL, can induce cell death. The receptors that mediate this signal are therefore referred to as death receptors, even though they also activate other signals. Here I will take you on a journey into the discovery and study of death receptor-ligand systems and how this inspired new concepts in cancer therapy and our current understanding of the interplay between cell death and inflammation.","934":"Loading of the replicative DNA helicase at origins of replication is of central importance in DNA replication. As the first of the replication fork proteins assemble at chromosomal origins of replication, the loaded helicase is required for the recruitment of the rest of the replication machinery. In this work, we review the current knowledge of helicase loading at Escherichia coli and eukaryotic origins of replication. In each case, this process requires both an origin recognition protein as well as one or more additional proteins. Comparison of these events shows intriguing similarities that suggest a similar underlying mechanism, as well as critical differences that likely reflect the distinct processes that regulate helicase loading in bacterial and eukaryotic cells.","935":"Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem Myopathy (BM), and Congenital Myosclerosis are diseases caused by mutations in the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI. A dystrophic mouse model, where collagen VI synthesis was prevented by targeted inactivation of the Col6a1 gene, allowed the investigation of pathogenesis, which revealed the existence of a Ca(2+)-mediated dysfunction of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of defective autophagy. Key events are dysregulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, an inner membrane high-conductance channel that for prolonged open times causes mitochondrial dysfunction, and inadequate removal of defective mitochondria, which amplifies the damage. Consistently, the Col6a1(-\/-) myopathic mice could be cured through inhibition of cyclophilin D, a matrix protein that sensitizes the pore to opening, and through stimulation of autophagy. Similar defects contribute to disease pathogenesis in patients irrespective of the genetic lesion causing the collagen VI defect. These studies indicate that permeability transition pore opening and defective autophagy represent key elements for skeletal muscle fiber death, and provide a rationale for the use of cyclosporin A and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives in patients affected by collagen VI myopathies, a strategy that holds great promise for treatment.","936":"Sphingolipids are a diverse group of lipids that have essential cellular roles as structural components of membranes and as potent signaling molecules. In recent years, a detailed picture has emerged of the basic biochemistry of sphingolipids-from their initial synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to their elaboration into complex glycosphingolipids, to their turnover and degradation. However, our understanding of how sphingolipid metabolism is regulated in response to metabolic demand and physiologic cues remains incomplete. Here I discuss new insights into the mechanisms that ensure sphingolipid homeostasis, with an emphasis on the ER as a critical regulatory site in sphingolipid metabolism. In particular, Orm family proteins have recently emerged as key ER-localized mediators of sphingolipid homeostasis. A detailed understanding of how cells sense and control sphingolipid production promises to provide key insights into membrane function in health and disease.","937":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large, continuous membrane-bound organelle comprised of functionally and structurally distinct domains including the nuclear envelope, peripheral tubular ER, peripheral cisternae, and numerous membrane contact sites at the plasma membrane, mitochondria, Golgi, endosomes, and peroxisomes. These domains are required for multiple cellular processes, including synthesis of proteins and lipids, calcium level regulation, and exchange of macromolecules with various organelles at ER-membrane contact sites. The ER maintains its unique overall structure regardless of dynamics or transfer at ER-organelle contacts. In this review, we describe the numerous factors that contribute to the structure of the ER.","938":"The mismatch repair (MMR) system detects non-Watson-Crick base pairs and strand misalignments arising during DNA replication and mediates their removal by catalyzing excision of the mispair-containing tract of nascent DNA and its error-free resynthesis. In this way, MMR improves the fidelity of replication by several orders of magnitude. It also addresses mispairs and strand misalignments arising during recombination and prevents synapses between nonidentical DNA sequences. Unsurprisingly, MMR malfunction brings about genomic instability that leads to cancer in mammals. But MMR proteins have recently been implicated also in other processes of DNA metabolism, such as DNA damage signaling, antibody diversification, and repair of interstrand cross-links and oxidative DNA damage, in which their functions remain to be elucidated. This article reviews the progress in our understanding of the mechanism of replication error repair made during the past decade.","939":"Base excision repair (BER) corrects DNA damage from oxidation, deamination and alkylation. Such base lesions cause little distortion to the DNA helix structure. BER is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that recognizes and removes the damaged base, leaving an abasic site that is further processed by short-patch repair or long-patch repair that largely uses different proteins to complete BER. At least 11 distinct mammalian DNA glycosylases are known, each recognizing a few related lesions, frequently with some overlap in specificities. Impressively, the damaged bases are rapidly identified in a vast excess of normal bases, without a supply of energy. BER protects against cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration and takes place both in nuclei and mitochondria. More recently, an important role of uracil-DNA glycosylase UNG2 in adaptive immunity was revealed. Furthermore, other DNA glycosylases may have important roles in epigenetics, thus expanding the repertoire of BER proteins.","940":null,"941":"To achieve the high degree of processivity required for DNA replication, DNA polymerases associate with ring-shaped sliding clamps that encircle the template DNA and slide freely along it. The closed circular structure of sliding clamps necessitates an enzyme-catalyzed mechanism, which not only opens them for assembly and closes them around DNA, but specifically targets them to sites where DNA synthesis is initiated and orients them correctly for replication. Such a feat is performed by multisubunit complexes known as clamp loaders, which use ATP to open sliding clamp rings and place them around the 3' end of primer-template (PT) junctions. Here we discuss the structure and composition of sliding clamps and clamp loaders from the three domains of life as well as T4 bacteriophage, and provide our current understanding of the clamp-loading process.","942":"The Bcl-2 family of proteins controls a critical step in commitment to apoptosis by regulating permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). The family is divided into three classes: multiregion proapoptotic proteins that directly permeabilize the MOM; BH3 proteins that directly or indirectly activate the pore-forming class members; and the antiapoptotic proteins that inhibit this process at several steps. Different experimental approaches have led to several models, each proposed to explain the interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins. The discovery that many of these interactions occur at or in membranes as well as in the cytoplasm, and are governed by the concentrations and relative binding affinities of the proteins, provides a new basis for rationalizing these models. Furthermore, these dynamic interactions cause conformational changes in the Bcl-2 proteins that modulate their apoptotic function, providing additional potential modes of regulation.","943":"Caspases are a family of endoproteases that provide critical links in cell regulatory networks controlling inflammation and cell death. The activation of these enzymes is tightly controlled by their production as inactive zymogens that gain catalytic activity following signaling events promoting their aggregation into dimers or macromolecular complexes. Activation of apoptotic caspases results in inactivation or activation of substrates, and the generation of a cascade of signaling events permitting the controlled demolition of cellular components. Activation of inflammatory caspases results in the production of active proinflammatory cytokines and the promotion of innate immune responses to various internal and external insults. Dysregulation of caspases underlies human diseases including cancer and inflammatory disorders, and major efforts to design better therapies for these diseases seek to understand how these enzymes work and how they can be controlled.","944":"Telomeres are the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They protect chromosome ends from DNA degradation, recombination, and DNA end fusions, and they are important for nuclear architecture. Telomeres provide a mechanism for their replication by semiconservative DNA replication and length maintenance by telomerase. Through telomerase repression and induced telomere shortening, telomeres provide the means to regulate cellular life span. In this review, we introduce the current knowledge on telomere composition and structure. We then discuss in depth the current understanding of how telomere components mediate their function during semiconservative DNA replication and how telomerase is regulated at the end of the chromosome. We focus our discussion on the telomeres from mammals and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.","945":"The replication origin and the initiator protein DnaA are the main targets for regulation of chromosome replication in bacteria. The origin bears multiple DnaA binding sites, while DnaA contains ATP\/ADP-binding and DNA-binding domains. When enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated in the cell, an active initiation complex can be formed at the origin resulting in strand opening and recruitment of the replicative helicase. In Escherichia coli, oriC activity is directly regulated by DNA methylation and specific oriC-binding proteins. DnaA activity is regulated by proteins that stimulate ATP-DnaA hydrolysis, yielding inactive ADP-DnaA in a replication-coupled negative-feedback manner, and by DnaA-binding DNA elements that control the subcellular localization of DnaA or stimulate the ADP-to-ATP exchange of the DnaA-bound nucleotide. Regulation of dnaA gene expression is also important for initiation. The principle of replication-coupled negative regulation of DnaA found in E. coli is conserved in eukaryotes as well as in bacteria. Regulations by oriC-binding proteins and dnaA gene expression are also conserved in bacteria.","946":"","947":"The structural features that enable replicative DNA polymerases to synthesize DNA rapidly and accurately also limit their ability to copy damaged DNA. Direct replication of DNA damage is termed translesion synthesis (TLS), a mechanism conserved from bacteria to mammals and executed by an array of specialized DNA polymerases. This chapter examines how these translesion polymerases replicate damaged DNA and how they are regulated to balance their ability to replicate DNA lesions with the risk of undesirable mutagenesis. It also discusses how TLS is co-opted to increase the diversity of the immunoglobulin gene hypermutation and the contribution it makes to the mutations that sculpt the genome of cancer cells.","948":"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) has allowed bacteria to flourish in many different niches around the globe that inflict harsh environmental damage to their genetic material. NER is remarkable because of its diverse substrate repertoire, which differs greatly in chemical composition and structure. Recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule studies have given great insight into the structure and function of NER components. This ensemble of proteins orchestrates faithful removal of toxic DNA lesions through a multistep process. The damaged nucleotide is recognized by dynamic probing of the DNA structure that is then verified and marked for dual incisions followed by excision of the damage and surrounding nucleotides. The opposite DNA strand serves as a template for repair, which is completed after resynthesis and ligation.","949":null,"950":"Cells decide to proliferate or remain quiescent using signaling pathways that link information about the cellular environment to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Progression through G1 phase is controlled by pRB proteins, which function to repress the activity of E2F transcription factors in cells exiting mitosis and in quiescent cells. Phosphorylation of pRB proteins by the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) releases E2F factors, promoting the transition to S phase. CDK activity is primarily regulated by the binding of CDK catalytic subunits to cyclin partners and CDK inhibitors. Consequently, both mitogenic and antiproliferative signals exert their effects on cell proliferation through the transcriptional regulation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclins and CDK inhibitors.","951":"The number of available eukaryotic genomes has expanded to the point where we can evaluate the complete evolutionary history of many cellular processes. Such analyses for the apoptosis regulatory networks suggest that this network already existed in the ancestor of the entire animal kingdom (Metazoa) in a form more complex than in some popular animal model organisms. This supports the growing realization that regulatory networks do not necessarily evolve from simple to complex and that the relative simplicity of these networks in nematodes and insects does not represent an ancestral state, but is the result of secondary simplifications. Network evolution is not a process of monotonous increase in complexity, but a dynamic process that includes lineage-specific gene losses and expansions, protein domain reshuffling, and emergence\/reemergence of similar protein architectures by parallel evolution. Studying the evolution of such networks is a challenging yet interesting subject for research and investigation, and such studies on the apoptosis networks provide us with interesting hints of how these networks, critical in so many human diseases, have developed.","952":"The mammalian heart is the first functional organ, the first indicator of life. Its normal formation and function are essential for fetal life. Defects in heart formation lead to congenital heart defects, underscoring the finesse with which the heart is assembled. Understanding the regulatory networks controlling heart development have led to significant insights into its lineage origins and morphogenesis and illuminated important aspects of mammalian embryology, while providing insights into human congenital heart disease. The mammalian heart has very little regenerative potential, and thus, any damage to the heart is life threatening and permanent. Knowledge of the developing heart is important for effective strategies of cardiac regeneration, providing new hope for future treatments for heart disease. Although we still have an incomplete picture of the mechanisms controlling development of the mammalian heart, our current knowledge has important implications for embryology and better understanding of human heart disease.","953":"The commensal microbiota affects many aspects of mammalian health including control of the immune system to such a extent that a \"commensalocentric\" view of the maintenance of overall health could be suggested. Autoimmunity is a case of mistaken identity: The immune system reacts to self-tissues and cells as if they were pathogens. Autoimmune reactions can be both advanced or blocked by the commensal microbiota, which can affect innate and adaptive arms of immune responses as well as the mechanisms of \"innate-adaptive connection.\" Whether specific microbial lineages affect immunity and autoimmunity (the \"specific lineage hypothesis\") or multiple lineages can tip the homeostatic balance that regulates host\/microbiota homeostasis toward reduced or enhanced host reactivity (the \"balanced signal hypothesis\") is yet unknown. The complexity of host\/microbiota interactions needs to be fully appreciated in order to find the means for prophylaxis and treatment of autoimmune disorders.","954":"The folding biology common to all three kingdoms of life (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) is proteostasis. The proteostasis network (PN) functions as a \"cloud\" to generate, protect, and degrade the proteome. Whereas microbes (Bacteria, Archaea) have a single compartment, Eukarya have numerous subcellular compartments. We examine evidence that Eukarya compartments use coat, tether, and fusion (CTF) membrane trafficking components to form an evolutionarily advanced arm of the PN that we refer to as the \"trafficking PN\" (TPN). We suggest that the TPN builds compartments by generating a mosaic of integrated cargo-specific trafficking signatures (TRaCKS). TRaCKS control the temporal and spatial features of protein-folding biology based on the Anfinsen principle that the local environment plays a critical role in managing protein structure. TPN-generated endomembrane compartments apply a \"quinary\" level of structural control to modify the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures defined by the primary polypeptide-chain sequence. The development of Anfinsen compartments provides a unifying foundation for understanding the purpose of endomembrane biology and its capacity to drive extant Eukarya function and diversity. ","955":"Secretory and transmembrane proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as unfolded proteins and exit as either folded proteins in transit to their target organelles or as misfolded proteins targeted for degradation. The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains the protein-folding homeostasis within the ER, ensuring that the protein-folding capacity of the ER meets the load of client proteins. Activation of the UPR depends on three ER stress sensor proteins, Ire1, PERK, and ATF6. Although the consequences of activation are well understood, how these sensors detect ER stress remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that yeast Ire1 directly binds to unfolded proteins, which induces its oligomerization and activation. BiP dissociation from Ire1 regulates this oligomeric equilibrium, ultimately modulating Ire1's sensitivity and duration of activation. The mechanistic principles of ER stress sensing are the focus of this review.","956":"Adenoviruses have attracted much attention as probes to study biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, splicing, and cellular transformation. More recently these viruses have been used as gene-transfer vectors and oncolytic agents. On the other hand, adenoviruses are notorious pathogens in people with compromised immune functions. This article will briefly summarize the basic replication strategy of adenoviruses and the key proteins involved and will deal with the new developments since 2006. In addition, we will cover the development of antivirals that interfere with human adenovirus (HAdV) replication and the impact of HAdV on human disease.","957":"Cell polarity is fundamental for the architecture and function of epithelial tissues. Epithelial polarization requires the intervention of several fundamental cell processes, whose integration in space and time is only starting to be elucidated. To understand what governs the building of epithelial tissues during development, it is essential to consider the polarization process in the context of the whole tissue. To this end, the development of three-dimensional organotypic cell culture models has brought new insights into the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of higher-order epithelial tissue architecture, and in the dynamic remodeling of cell polarity that often occurs during development of epithelial organs. Here we discuss some important aspects of mammalian epithelial morphogenesis, from the establishment of cell polarity to epithelial tissue generation.","958":"Protein egress from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is driven by a conserved cytoplasmic coat complex called the COPII coat. The COPII coat complex contains an inner shell (Sec23\/Sec24) that sorts cargo into ER-derived vesicles and an outer cage (Sec13\/Sec31) that leads to coat polymerization. Once released from the ER, vesicles must tether to and fuse with the target membrane to deliver their protein and lipid contents. This delivery step also depends on the COPII coat, with coat proteins binding directly to tethering and regulatory factors. Recent findings have yielded new insight into how COPII-mediated vesicle traffic is regulated. Here we discuss the molecular basis of COPII-mediated ER-Golgi traffic, focusing on the surprising complexity of how ER-derived vesicles form, package diverse cargoes, and correctly target these cargoes to their destination.","959":"Emphasis has been placed in this article dedicated to DNA damage on recent aspects of the formation and measurement of oxidatively generated damage in cellular DNA in order to provide a comprehensive and updated survey. This includes single pyrimidine and purine base lesions, intrastrand cross-links, purine 5',8-cyclonucleosides, DNA-protein adducts and interstrand cross-links formed by the reactions of either the nucleobases or the 2-deoxyribose moiety with the hydroxyl radical, one-electron oxidants, singlet oxygen, and hypochlorous acid. In addition, recent information concerning the mechanisms of formation, individual measurement, and repair-rate assessment of bipyrimidine photoproducts in isolated cells and human skin upon exposure to UVB radiation, UVA photons, or solar simulated light is critically reviewed.","960":"Internal ribosome entry sites\/segments (IRESs) were first discovered over 20 years ago in picornaviruses, followed by the discovery of two other types of IRES in hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the dicistroviruses, which infect invertebrates. In the meantime, reports of IRESs in eukaryotic cellular mRNAs started to appear, and the list of such putative IRESs continues to grow to the point in which it now stands at ~100, 80% of them in vertebrate mRNAs. Despite initial skepticism from some quarters, there now seems universal agreement that there is genuine internal ribosome entry on the viral IRESs. However, the same cannot be said for cellular mRNA IRESs, which continue to be shrouded in controversy. The aim of this article is to explain why vertebrate mRNA IRESs remain controversial, and to discuss ways in which these controversies might be resolved.","961":null,"962":"Cellular DNA replication requires efficient copying of the double-stranded chromosomal DNA. The leading strand is elongated continuously in the direction of fork opening, whereas the lagging strand is made discontinuously in the opposite direction. The lagging strand needs to be processed to form a functional DNA segment. Genetic analyses and reconstitution experiments identified proteins and multiple pathways responsible for maturation of the lagging strand. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the lagging-strand fragments are initiated by RNA primers, which are removed by a joining mechanism involving strand displacement of the primer into a flap, flap removal, and then ligation. Although the prokaryotic fragments are ~1200 nucleotides long, the eukaryotic fragments are much shorter, with lengths determined by nucleosome periodicity. The prokaryotic joining mechanism is simple and efficient. The eukaryotic maturation mechanism involves many enzymes, possibly three pathways, and regulation that can shift from high efficiency to high fidelity.","963":"The identification of the ret oncogene by Masahide Takahashi and Geoffrey Cooper in 1985 was both serendipitous and paradigmatic (  Takahashi et al. 1985). By transfecting total DNA from a human lymphoma into mouse NIH3T3 cells, they obtained one clone, which in secondary transformants yielded more than 100-fold improvement in transformation efficiency. Subsequent investigations revealed that the ret oncogene was not present as such in the primary lymphoma, but was derived by DNA rearrangement during transfection from normal human sequences of the ret locus. At the time, activation by DNA rearrangement had not been previously described for a transforming gene with the NIH3T3 transfection assay. The discovery of ret opened a field of study that has had a profound impact in cancer research, developmental biology, and neuroscience, and that continues to yield surprises and important insights to this day.","964":null,"965":"BCL-2 family proteins are the regulators of apoptosis, but also have other functions. This family of interacting partners includes inhibitors and inducers of cell death. Together they regulate and mediate the process by which mitochondria contribute to cell death known as the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. This pathway is required for normal embryonic development and for preventing cancer. However, before apoptosis is induced, BCL-2 proteins have critical roles in normal cell physiology related to neuronal activity, autophagy, calcium handling, mitochondrial dynamics and energetics, and other processes of normal healthy cells. The relative importance of these physiological functions compared to their apoptosis functions in overall organismal physiology is difficult to decipher. Apoptotic and noncanonical functions of these proteins may be intertwined to link cell growth to cell death. Disentanglement of these functions may require delineation of biochemical activities inherent to the characteristic three-dimensional shape shared by distantly related viral and cellular BCL-2 family members.","966":"Neural crest cells (NCCs) comprise a multipotent, migratory cell population that generates a diverse array of cell and tissue types during vertebrate development. These include cartilage and bone, tendons, and connective tissue, as well as neurons, glia, melanocytes, and endocrine and adipose cells; this remarkable lineage potential persists into adult life. Taken together with a limited capacity for self-renewal, neural crest cells bear the hallmarks of stem and progenitor cells and are considered to be synonymous with vertebrate evolution. The neural crest has provided a system for exploring the mechanisms that govern developmental processes such as morphogenetic induction, cell migration, and fate determination. Today, much of the focus on neural crest cells revolves around their stem cell-like characteristics and potential for use in regenerative medicine. A thorough understanding of the signals and switches that govern mammalian neural crest patterning is central to potential therapeutic application of these cells and better appreciation of the role that neural crest cells play in vertebrate evolution, development, and disease.","967":"One of the most remarkable characteristics of stem cells is their ability to perpetuate themselves through self-renewal while concomitantly generating differentiated cells. In the hematopoietic system, stem cells balance these mechanisms to maintain steady-state hematopoiesis for the lifetime of the organism, and to effectively regenerate the system following injury. Defects in the proper control of self-renewal and differentiation can be potentially devastating and contribute to the development of malignancies. In this review, we trace the emerging role of Wnt signaling as a critical regulator of distinct aspects of self-renewal and differentiation, its contribution to the maintenance of homeostasis and regeneration, and how the pathway can be hijacked to promote leukemia development. A better understanding of these processes could pave the way to enhancing recovery after injury and to developing better therapeutic approaches for hematologic malignancies.","968":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a complex organelle responsible for a range of functions including protein folding and secretion, lipid biosynthesis, and ion homeostasis. Despite its central and essential roles in eukaryotic cells during development, growth, and disease, many ER proteins are poorly characterized. Moreover, the range of biochemical reactions that occur within the ER membranes, let alone how these different activities are coordinated, is not yet defined. In recent years, focused studies on specific ER functions have been complemented by systematic approaches and innovative technologies for high-throughput analysis of the location, levels, and biological impact of given components. This article focuses on the recent progress of these efforts, largely pioneered in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also addresses how future systematic studies can be geared to uncover the \"dark matter\" of uncharted ER functions.","969":"One of the fundamental challenges facing the cell is to accurately copy its genetic material to daughter cells. When this process goes awry, genomic instability ensues in which genetic alterations ranging from nucleotide changes to chromosomal translocations and aneuploidy occur. Organisms have developed multiple mechanisms that can be classified into two major classes to ensure the fidelity of DNA replication. The first class includes mechanisms that prevent premature initiation of DNA replication and ensure that the genome is fully replicated once and only once during each division cycle. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-dependent mechanisms and CDK-independent mechanisms. Although CDK-dependent mechanisms are largely conserved in eukaryotes, higher eukaryotes have evolved additional mechanisms that seem to play a larger role in preventing aberrant DNA replication and genome instability. The second class ensures that cells are able to respond to various cues that continuously threaten the integrity of the genome by initiating DNA-damage-dependent \"checkpoints\" and coordinating DNA damage repair mechanisms. Defects in the ability to safeguard against aberrant DNA replication and to respond to DNA damage contribute to genomic instability and the development of human malignancy. In this article, we summarize our current knowledge of how genomic instability arises, with a particular emphasis on how the DNA replication process can give rise to such instability.","970":null,"971":"Enriched endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes subjected to mass spectrometry have uncovered over a thousand different proteins assigned to the ER and Golgi apparatus of rat liver. This, in turn, led to the uncovering of several hundred proteins of poorly understood function and, through hierarchical clustering, showed that proteins distributed in patterns suggestive of microdomains in cognate organelles. This has led to new insights with respect to their intracellular localization and function. Another outcome has been the critical testing of the cisternal maturation hypothesis showing overwhelming support for a predominant role of COPI vesicles in the transport of resident proteins of the ER and Golgi apparatus (as opposed to biosynthetic cargo). Here we will discuss new insights gained and also highlight new avenues undertaken to further explore the cell biology of the ER and the Golgi apparatus through tandem mass spectrometry.","972":"To cause infection, a virus enters a host cell, replicates, and assembles, with the resulting new viral progeny typically released into the extracellular environment to initiate a new infection round. Virus entry, replication, and assembly are dynamic and coordinated processes that require precise interactions with host components, often within and surrounding a defined subcellular compartment. Accumulating evidence pinpoints the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a crucial organelle supporting viral entry, replication, and assembly. This review focuses on the molecular mechanism by which different viruses co-opt the ER to accomplish these crucial infection steps. Certain bacterial toxins also hijack the ER for entry. An interdisciplinary approach, using rigorous biochemical and cell biological assays coupled with advanced microscopy strategies, will push to the next level our understanding of the virus-ER interaction during infection.","973":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a paradigm for human tumor viruses: it is the first virus recognized to cause cancer in people; it causes both lymphomas and carcinomas; yet these tumors arise infrequently given that most people in the world are infected with the virus. EBV is maintained extrachromosomally in infected normal and tumor cells. Eighty-four percent of these viral plasmids replicate each S phase, are licensed, require a single viral protein for their synthesis, and can use two functionally distinct origins of DNA replication, oriP, and Raji ori. Eighty-eight percent of newly synthesized plasmids are segregated faithfully to the daughter cells. Infectious viral particles are not synthesized under these conditions of latent infection. This plasmid replication is consistent with survival of EBV's host cells. Rare cells in an infected population either spontaneously or following exogenous induction support EBV's lytic cycle, which is lethal for the cell. In this case, the viral DNA replicates 100-fold or more, uses a third kind of viral origin of DNA replication, oriLyt, and many viral proteins. Here we shall describe the three modes of EBV's replication as a function of the viral origins used and the viral and cellular proteins that mediate the DNA synthesis from these origins focusing, where practical, on recent advances in our understanding.","974":"Developmentally programmed polyploidy occurs by at least four different mechanisms, two of which (endoreduplication and endomitosis) involve switching from mitotic cell cycles to endocycles by the selective loss of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and bypassing many of the processes of mitosis. Here we review the mechanisms of endoreplication, focusing on recent results from Drosophila and mice.","975":"Endogenous and exogenous factors constantly challenge cellular DNA, generating cytotoxic and\/or mutagenic DNA adducts. As a result, organisms have evolved different mechanisms to defend against the deleterious effects of DNA damage. Among these diverse repair pathways, direct DNA-repair systems provide cells with simple yet efficient solutions to reverse covalent DNA adducts. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the field of direct DNA repair, namely, photolyase-, alkyltransferase-, and dioxygenase-mediated repair processes. We present specific examples to describe new findings of known enzymes and appealing discoveries of new proteins. At the end of this article, we also briefly discuss the influence of direct DNA repair on other fields of biology and its implication on the discovery of new biology.","976":"Hydrogen sulfide (sulfide, H(2)S) is a colorless, water-soluble gas with a typical smell of rotten eggs. In the past, it has been investigated for its role as a potent toxic gas emanating from sewers and swamps or as a by-product of industrial processes. At high concentrations, H(2)S is a powerful inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase; in trace amounts, it is an important signaling molecule, like nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), together termed \"gasotransmitters.\" This review will cover the physiological role and the pathogenic effects of H(2)S, focusing on ethylmalonic encephalopathy, a human mitochondrial disorder caused by genetic abnormalities of sulfide metabolism. We will also discuss the options that are now conceivable for preventing genetically driven chronic H(2)S toxicity, taking into account that a complete understanding of the physiopathology of H(2)S has still to be achieved.","977":"","978":"Although mitochondria are usually considered as supporters of life, they are also involved in cellular death. Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is a crucial event during apoptosis because it causes the release of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. MOMP is mainly controlled by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members. We discuss the current understanding of how activating and inhibitory interactions within this family lead to the activation and oligomerization of MOMP effectors Bax and Bak, which result in membrane permeabilization. The order of events leading to MOMP is then highlighted step by step, emphasizing recent discoveries regarding the formation of Bax\/Bak pores on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Besides the Bcl-2 proteins, the mitochondrial organelle contributes to and possibly regulates MOMP, because mitochondrial resident proteins and membrane lipids are prominently involved in the process.","979":"The endocytic pathway is a system specialized for the uptake of compounds from the cell microenvironment for their degradation. It contains an arsenal of hydrolases, including proteases, which are normally enclosed in membrane-bound organelles, but if released to the cytosol can initiate apoptosis signaling pathways. Endogenous and exogenous compounds have been identified that can mediate destabilization of lysosomal membranes, and it was shown that lysosomal proteases are not only able to initiate apoptotic signaling but can also amplify the apoptotic pathways initiated in other cellular compartments. The endocytic pathway also receives cargo destined for degradation via the autophagic pathway. By recycling energy and biosynthetic substrates, and by degrading damaged organelles and molecules, the endocytic system assists the autophagic system in resisting apoptotic stimuli. Steps leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and subsequent triggering of cell death as well as the therapeutic potential of intervention in lysosomal membrane permeabilization will be discussed.","980":"Clearance of apoptotic cells is the final stage of programmed cell death. Uncleared corpses can become secondarily necrotic, promoting inflammation and autoimmunity. Remarkably, even in tissues with high cellular turnover, apoptotic cells are rarely seen because of efficient clearance mechanisms in healthy individuals. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the steps involved in prompt cell clearance in vivo. These include the sensing of corpses via \"find me\" signals, the recognition of corpses via \"eat me\" signals and their cognate receptors, the signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for engulfment, and the responses of the phagocyte that keep cell clearance events \"immunologically silent.\" This study focuses on our understanding of these steps.","981":"Much of the mammalian skeleton is composed of bones that originate from cartilage templates through endochondral ossification. Elucidating the mechanisms that control endochondral bone development is critical for understanding human skeletal diseases, injury response, and aging. Mouse genetic studies in the past 15 years have provided unprecedented insights about molecules regulating chondrocyte formation, chondrocyte maturation, and osteoblast differentiation, all key processes of endochondral bone development. These include the roles of the secreted proteins IHH, PTHrP, BMPs, WNTs, and FGFs, their receptors, and transcription factors such as SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX, in regulating chondrocyte and osteoblast biology. This review aims to integrate the known functions of extracellular signals and transcription factors that regulate development of the endochondral skeleton.","982":"The rough endoplasmic reticulum is a major site of protein biosynthesis in all eukaryotic cells, serving as the entry point for the secretory pathway and as the initial integration site for the majority of cellular integral membrane proteins. The core components of the protein translocation machinery have been identified, and high-resolution structures of the targeting components and the transport channel have been obtained. Research in this area is now focused on obtaining a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of protein translocation and membrane protein integration.","983":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of synthesis for nearly one-third of the eukaryotic proteome and is accordingly endowed with specialized machinery to ensure that proteins deployed to the distal secretory pathway are correctly folded and assembled into native oligomeric complexes. Proteins failing to meet this conformational standard are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a complex process through which folding-defective proteins are selected and ultimately degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. ERAD proceeds through four tightly coupled steps involving substrate selection, dislocation across the ER membrane, covalent conjugation with polyubiquitin, and proteasomal degradation. The ERAD machinery shows a modular organization with central ER membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligases linking components responsible for recognition in the ER lumen to the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm. The core ERAD machinery is highly conserved among eukaryotes and much of our basic understanding of ERAD organization has been derived from genetic and biochemical studies of yeast. In this article we discuss how the core ERAD machinery is organized in mammalian cells.","984":"Protein misfolding is a common cellular event that can produce intrinsically harmful products. To reduce the risk, quality control mechanisms are deployed to detect and eliminate misfolded, aggregated, and unassembled proteins. In the secretory pathway, it is mainly the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways that perform this role. Here, specialized factors are organized to monitor and process the folded states of nascent polypeptides. Despite the complex structures, topologies, and posttranslational modifications of client molecules, the ER mechanisms are the best understood among all protein quality-control systems. This is the result of convergent and sometimes serendipitous discoveries by researchers from diverse fields. Although major advances in ER quality control and ERAD came from all model organisms, this review will focus on the discoveries culminating from the simple budding yeast.","985":null,"986":"The sirtuins are a family of proteins that act predominantly as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases. In mammals seven sirtuin family members exist, including three members, Sirt3, Sirt4, and Sirt5, that localize exclusively within the mitochondria. Although originally linked to life-span regulation in simple organisms, this family of proteins appears to have various and diverse functions in higher organisms. One particular property that is reviewed here is the regulation of mitochondrial number, turnover, and activity by various mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial sirtuins. An emerging consensus from these recent studies is that sirtuins may act as metabolic sensors, using intracellular metabolites such as NAD and short-chain carbon fragments such as acetyl coenzyme A to modulate mitochondrial function to match nutrient supply.","987":"Within the last decade, multiple novel congenital human disorders have been described with genetic defects in known and\/or novel components of several well-known DNA repair and damage response pathways. Examples include disorders of impaired nucleotide excision repair, DNA double-strand and single-strand break repair, as well as compromised DNA damage-induced signal transduction including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. These conditions further reinforce the importance of multiple genome stability pathways for health and development in humans. Furthermore, these conditions inform our knowledge of the biology of the mechanics of genome stability and in some cases provide potential routes to help exploit these pathways therapeutically. Here, I will review a selection of these exciting findings from the perspective of the disorders themselves, describing how they were identified, how genotype informs phenotype, and how these defects contribute to our growing understanding of genome stability pathways.","988":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of endogenous noncoding RNAs that, together with the Argonaute family of proteins (AGOs), silence the expression of complementary mRNA targets posttranscriptionally. Perfectly complementary targets are cleaved within the base-paired region by catalytically active AGOs. In the case of partially complementary targets, however, AGOs are insufficient for silencing and need to recruit a protein of the GW182 family. GW182 proteins induce translational repression, mRNA deadenylation and exonucleolytic target degradation. Recent work has revealed a direct molecular link between GW182 proteins and cellular deadenylase complexes. These findings shed light on how miRNAs bring about target mRNA degradation and promise to further our understanding of the mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression.","989":"Translational control plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. It is especially important in defining the proteome, maintaining homeostasis, and controlling cell proliferation, growth, and development. Numerous disease states result from aberrant regulation of protein synthesis, so understanding the molecular basis and mechanisms of translational control is critical. Here we outline the pathway of protein synthesis, with special emphasis on the initiation phase, and identify areas needing further clarification. Features of translational control are described together with numerous specific examples, and we discuss prospects for future conceptual advances.","990":"","991":"Chromosomal DNA replication in plants has requirements and constraints similar to those in other eukaryotes. However, some aspects are plant-specific. Studies of DNA replication control in plants, which have unique developmental strategies, can offer unparalleled opportunities of comparing regulatory processes with yeast and, particularly, metazoa to identify common trends and basic rules. In addition to the comparative molecular and biochemical studies, genomic studies in plants that started with Arabidopsis thaliana in the year 2000 have now expanded to several dozens of species. This, together with the applicability of genomic approaches and the availability of a large collection of mutants, underscores the enormous potential to study DNA replication control in a whole developing organism. Recent advances in this field with particular focus on the DNA replication proteins, the nature of replication origins and their epigenetic landscape, and the control of endoreplication will be reviewed.","992":"The transforming effects of proto-oncogenes such as MYC that mediate unrestrained cell proliferation are countered by \"intrinsic tumor suppressor mechanisms\" that most often trigger apoptosis. Therefore, cooperating genetic or epigenetic effects to suppress apoptosis (e.g., overexpression of BCL2) are required to enable the dual transforming processes of unbridled cell proliferation and robust suppression of apoptosis. Certain oncogenes such as BCR-ABL are capable of concomitantly mediating the inhibition of apoptosis and driving cell proliferation and therefore are less reliant on cooperating lesions for transformation. Accordingly, direct targeting of BCR-ABL through agents such as imatinib have profound antitumor effects. Other oncoproteins such as MYC rely on the anti-apoptotic effects of cooperating oncoproteins such as BCL2 to facilitate tumorigenesis. In these circumstances, where the primary oncogenic driver (e.g., MYC) cannot yet be therapeutically targeted, inhibition of the activity of the cooperating antiapoptotic protein (e.g., BCL2) can be exploited for therapeutic benefit.","993":"Enormous numbers of adult blood cells are constantly regenerated throughout life from hematopoietic stem cells through a series of progenitor stages. Accessibility, robust functional assays, well-established prospective isolation, and successful clinical application made hematopoiesis the classical mammalian stem cell system. Most of the basic concepts of stem cell biology have been defined in this system. At the same time, many long-standing disputes in hematopoiesis research illustrate our still limited understanding. Here we discuss the embryonic development and lifelong maintenance of the hematopoietic system, its cellular components, and some of the hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms involved in controlling hematopoietic cell fates.","994":"The skeleton as an organ is widely distributed throughout the entire vertebrate body. Wnt signaling has emerged to play major roles in almost all aspects of skeletal development and homeostasis. Because abnormal Wnt signaling causes various human skeletal diseases, Wnt signaling has become a focal point of intensive studies in skeletal development and disease. As a result, promising effective therapeutic agents for bone diseases are being developed by targeting the Wnt signaling pathway. Understanding the functional mechanisms of Wnt signaling in skeletal biology and diseases highlights how basic and clinical studies can stimulate each other to push a quick and productive advancement of the entire field. Here we review the current understanding of Wnt signaling in critical aspects of skeletal biology such as bone development, remodeling, mechanotransduction, and fracture healing. We took special efforts to place fundamentally important discoveries in the context of human skeletal diseases.","995":null,"996":"Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, and their replication requires host cell functions. Although the size, composition, complexity, and functions encoded by their genomes are remarkably diverse, all viruses rely absolutely on the protein synthesis machinery of their host cells. Lacking their own translational apparatus, they must recruit cellular ribosomes in order to translate viral mRNAs and produce the protein products required for their replication. In addition, there are other constraints on viral protein production. Crucially, host innate defenses and stress responses capable of inactivating the translation machinery must be effectively neutralized. Furthermore, the limited coding capacity of the viral genome needs to be used optimally. These demands have resulted in complex interactions between virus and host that exploit ostensibly virus-specific mechanisms and, at the same time, illuminate the functioning of the cellular protein synthesis apparatus.","997":"Genome-wide analysis of translational control has taken strides in recent years owing to the advent of high-throughput technologies, including DNA microarrays and deep sequencing. Global studies have unraveled a principal role, among posttranscriptional mechanisms, for mRNA translation in determining protein levels in the cell. The impact of translational control in dynamic regulation of the proteome under different conditions is increasingly appreciated. Here we review genome-wide studies that use high-throughput techniques and bioinformatics to assess the role of mRNA translation in the regulation of protein levels; we also discuss how genome-wide data on mRNA translation can be obtained, analyzed, and used to identify mechanisms of translational control.","998":"The skin and its appendages constitute the largest organ of the body. Its stratified epithelia offer protection from environmental stresses such as dehydration, irradiation, mechanical trauma, and pathogenic infection, whereas its appendages, like hair and sebaceous glands, help regulate body temperature as well as influence animal interaction and social behavior through camouflage and sexual signaling. To respond to and function effectively in a dynamic external environment, the skin and its appendages possess a remarkable ability to regenerate in a carefully controlled fashion. When this finely tuned homeostatic process is disrupted, skin diseases such as cancers may result. At present, the molecular signals that orchestrate cell proliferation, differentiation, and patterning in the skin remain incompletely understood. It is increasingly apparent that many morphogenetic pathways with key roles in development are also important in regulating skin biology. Of these, Wnt signaling has emerged as the dominant pathway controlling the patterning of skin and influencing the decisions of embryonic and adult stem cells to adopt the various cell lineages of the skin and its appendages, as well as subsequently controlling the function of differentiated skin cells. Here we will review established concepts and present recent advances in our understanding of the diverse roles that Wnt signaling plays in skin development, homeostasis, and disease.","999":null,"1000":null,"1001":"The formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues occurs during the folding of many proteins that enter the secretory pathway. As the polypeptide chain collapses, cysteines brought into proximity can form covalent linkages during a process catalyzed by members of the protein disulfide isomerase family. There are multiple pathways in mammalian cells to ensure disulfides are introduced into proteins. Common requirements for this process include a disulfide exchange protein and a protein oxidase capable of forming disulfides de novo. In addition, any incorrect disulfides formed during the normal folding pathway are removed in a process involving disulfide exchange. The pathway for the reduction of disulfides remains poorly characterized. This work will cover the current knowledge in the field and discuss areas for future investigation.","1002":"Mutations in Parkin or PINK1 are the most common cause of recessive familial parkinsonism. Recent studies suggest that PINK1 and Parkin form a mitochondria quality control pathway that identifies dysfunctional mitochondria, isolates them from the mitochondrial network, and promotes their degradation by autophagy. In this pathway the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 senses mitochondrial fidelity and recruits Parkin selectively to mitochondria that lose membrane potential. Parkin, an E3 ligase, subsequently ubiquitinates outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, notably the mitofusins and Miro, and induces autophagic elimination of the impaired organelles. Here we review the recent rapid progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of PINK1- and Parkin-mediated mitophagy and the identification of Parkin substrates suggesting how mitochondrial fission and trafficking are involved. We also discuss how defects in mitophagy may be linked to Parkinson's disease.","1003":"","1004":"Programmed necrosis or necroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death driven by TNF-like death cytokines, toll-like receptors, and antigen receptors. Unlike necrosis induced by physical trauma, a dedicated pathway is involved in programmed necrosis. In particular, a kinase complex composed of the receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 is a central step in necrotic cell death. Assembly and activation of this RIPK1-RIPK3 \"necrosome\" is critically controlled by protein ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and caspase-mediated cleavage events. The molecular signals cumulate in formation of intracellular vacuoles, organelle swelling, internal membrane leakage, and eventually plasma membrane rupture. These morphological changes can result in spillage of intracellular adjuvants to promote inflammation and further exacerbate tissue injury. Because of the inflammatory nature of necrosis, it is an attractive pathway for therapeutic intervention in acute inflammatory diseases.","1005":"Multicellular organisms have evolved processes to prevent abnormal proliferation or inappropriate tissue infiltration of cells, and these tumor suppressive mechanisms serve to prevent tissue hyperplasia, tumor development, and metastatic spread of tumors. These include potentially reversible processes such as cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence, as well as apoptotic cell death, which in contrast eliminates dangerous cells that may initiate tumor development. Tumor suppressive processes are organized as complex, extensive signaling networks, controlled by central \"nodes.\" These \"nodes\" are prominent tumor suppressors, such as P53 or PTEN, whose loss is responsible for the development of the majority of human cancers. In this review we discuss the processes by which some of these prominent tumor suppressors trigger apoptotic cell death and how this process protects us from cancer development.","1006":"Germ cell development creates totipotency through genetic as well as epigenetic regulation of the genome function. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the first germ cell population established during development and are immediate precursors for both the oocytes and spermatogonia. We here summarize recent findings regarding the mechanism of PGC development in mice. We focus on the transcriptional and signaling mechanism for PGC specification, potential pluripotency, and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs and strategies for the reconstitution of germ cell development using pluripotent stem cells in culture. Continued studies on germ cell development may lead to the generation of totipotency in vitro, which should have a profound influence on biological science as well as on medicine.","1007":"The formation of the three lineages of the mouse blastocyst provides a powerful model system to study interactions among cell behavior, cell signaling, and lineage development. Hippo signaling differences between the inner and outer cells of the early cleavage stages, combined with establishment of a stably polarized outer epithelium, lead to the establishment of the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm, whereas FGF signaling differences among the individual cells of the ICM lead to gradual separation and segregation of the epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages. Events in the late blastocyst lead to the formation of a special subset of cells from the primitive endoderm that are key sources for the signals that establish the subsequent body axis. The slow pace of mouse early development, the ability to culture embryos over this time period, the increasing availability of live cell imaging tools, and the ability to modify gene expression at will are providing increasing insights into the cell biology of early cell fate decisions.","1008":"Autoimmune diseases reflect a breakdown in self-tolerance that results from defects in thymic deletion of potentially autoreactive T cells (central tolerance) and in T-cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that normally control potentially autoreactive T cells in the periphery (peripheral tolerance). The mechanisms leading to autoimmune diseases are multifactorial and depend on a complex combination of genetic, epigenetic, molecular, and cellular elements that result in pathogenic inflammatory responses in peripheral tissues driven by self-antigen-specific T cells. In this article, we describe the different checkpoints of tolerance that are defective in autoimmune diseases as well as specific events in the autoimmune response which represent therapeutic opportunities to restore long-term tolerance in autoimmune diseases. We present evidence for the role of different pathways in animal models and the therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in clinical trials in autoimmune diseases.","1009":"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a conserved regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. In cells, mTOR is the catalytic subunit of two complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2, which have distinct upstream regulatory signals and downstream substrates. mTORC1 directly senses cellular nutrient availability while indirectly sensing circulating nutrients through growth factor signaling pathways. Cellular stresses that restrict growth also impinge on mTORC1 activity. mTORC2 is less well understood and appears only to sense growth factors. As an integrator of diverse growth regulatory signals, mTOR evolved to be a central signaling hub for controlling cellular metabolism and energy homoeostasis, and defects in mTOR signaling are important in the pathologies of cancer, diabetes, and aging. Here we discuss mechanisms by which each mTOR complex might regulate cell survival in response to metabolic and other stresses.","1010":null,"1011":"Three embryonic tissue sources-the neural ectoderm, the surface ectoderm, and the periocular mesenchyme-contribute to the formation of the mammalian eye. For this reason, the developing eye has presented an invaluable system for studying the interactions among cells and, more recently, genes, in specifying cell fate. This article describes how the eye primordium is specified in the anterior neural plate by four eye field transcription factors and how the optic vesicle becomes regionalized into three distinct tissue types. Specific attention is given to how cross talk between the optic vesicle and surface ectoderm contributes to lens and optic cup formation. This article also describes how signaling networks and cell movements set up axes in the optic cup and establish the multiple cell fates important for vision. How multipotent retinal progenitor cells give rise to the six neuronal and one glial cell type in the mature retina is also explained. Finally, the history and progress of cellular therapeutics for the treatment of degenerative eye disease is outlined. Throughout this article, special attention is given to how disruption of gene function causes ocular malformation in humans. Indeed, the accessibility of the eye has contributed much to our understanding of the basic processes involved in mammalian development.","1012":"During S phase, not only does DNA have to be replicated, but also newly synthesized DNA molecules have to be connected with each other. This sister chromatid cohesion is essential for the biorientation of chromosomes on the mitotic or meiotic spindle, and is thus an essential prerequisite for chromosome segregation. Cohesion is mediated by cohesin complexes that are thought to embrace sister chromatids as large rings. Cohesin binds to DNA dynamically before DNA replication and is converted into a stably DNA-bound form during replication. This conversion requires acetylation of cohesin, which in vertebrates leads to recruitment of sororin. Sororin antagonizes Wapl, a protein that is able to release cohesin from DNA, presumably by opening the cohesin ring. Inhibition of Wapl by sororin therefore \"locks\" cohesin rings on DNA and allows them to maintain cohesion for long periods of time in mammalian oocytes, possibly for months or even years.","1013":"The transport of lipids from their synthesis site at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to different target membranes could be mediated by both vesicular and nonvesicular transport mechanisms. Nonvesicular lipid transport appears to be the major transport route of certain lipid species, and could be mediated by either spontaneous lipid transport or by lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs). Although nonvesicular lipid transport has been extensively studied for more than four decades, its underlying mechanism, advantage and regulation, have not been fully explored. In particular, the function of LTPs and their involvement in intracellular lipid movement remain largely controversial. In this article, we describe the pathways by which lipids are synthesized at the ER and delivered to different cellular membranes, and discuss the role of LTPs in lipid transport both in vitro and in intact cells.","1014":"A protein's function is intimately linked to its correct subcellular location, yet the machinery required for protein synthesis is predominately cytosolic. How proteins are trafficked through the confines of the cell and integrated into the appropriate cellular compartments has puzzled and intrigued researchers for decades. Indeed, studies exploring this premise revealed elaborate cellular protein translocation and sorting systems, which ensure that all proteins are shuttled to the appropriate cellular destination, where they fulfill their specific functions. This holds true for mitochondria, where sophisticated molecular machines serve to recognize incoming precursor proteins and integrate them into the functional framework of the organelle. We summarize the recent progress in our understanding of mitochondrial protein sorting and the machineries and mechanisms that mediate and regulate this highly dynamic cellular process essential for survival of virtually all eukaryotic cells.","1015":"","1016":"A developing animal is exposed to both intrinsic and extrinsic stresses. One stress response is caspase activation. Caspase activation not only controls apoptosis but also proliferation, differentiation, cell shape, and cell migration. Caspase activation drives development by executing cell death or nonapoptotic functions in a cell-autonomous manner, and by secreting signaling molecules or generating mechanical forces, in a noncell autonomous manner.","1017":"The mammalian nervous system is the most complex organ of any living organism. How this complexity is generated during neural development is just beginning to be elucidated. This article discusses the signaling, transcriptional, and epigenetic mechanisms that are involved in neural development. The first part focuses on molecules that control neuronal numbers through regulation of the timing of onset of neurogenesis, the timing of the neuronal-to-glial switch, and the rate of progenitor proliferation. The second part focuses on molecules that control neuronal diversity by generating spatially or temporally distinct populations of neuronal progenitors. Most of the studies discussed in this article are focused on the developing mammalian cerebral cortex, because this is one of the main model systems for neural developmental studies and many of the mechanisms identified in this tissue also operate elsewhere in the developing brain and spinal cord.","1018":"Cell division requires careful orchestration of three major events: entry into mitosis, chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis. Signaling within and between the molecules that control these events allows for their coordination via checkpoints, a specific class of signaling pathways that ensure the dependency of cell-cycle events on the successful completion of preceding events. Multiple positive- and negative-feedback loops ensure that a cell is fully committed to division and that the events occur in the proper order. Unlike other signaling pathways, which integrate external inputs to decide whether to execute a given process, signaling at cell division is largely dedicated to completing a decision made in G1 phase-to initiate and complete a round of mitotic cell division. Instead of deciding if the events of cell division will take place, these signaling pathways entrain these events to the activation of the cell-cycle kinase cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and provide the opportunity for checkpoint proteins to arrest cell division if things go wrong.","1019":null,"1020":"Wnt-mediated signal transduction pathways have long been recognized for their roles in regulating embryonic development, and have more recently been linked to cancer, neurologic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and disorders of endocrine function and bone metabolism in adults. Although therapies targeting Wnt signaling are attractive in theory, in practice it has been difficult to obtain specific therapeutics because many components of Wnt signaling pathways are also involved in other cellular processes, thereby reducing the specificity of candidate therapeutics. New technologies, and advances in understanding the mechanisms of Wnt signaling, have improved our understanding of the nuances of Wnt signaling and are leading to promising new strategies to target Wnt signaling pathways.","1021":"Autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative disorders although concepts about how it influences these diseases are still evolving. Once proposed to be mainly an alternative cell death pathway, autophagy is now widely viewed as both a vital homeostatic mechanism in healthy cells and as an important cytoprotective response mobilized in the face of aging- and disease-related metabolic challenges. In Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other diseases, impairment at different stages of autophagy leads to the buildup of pathogenic proteins and damaged organelles, while defeating autophagy's crucial prosurvival and antiapoptotic effects on neurons. The differences in the location of defects within the autophagy pathway and their molecular basis influence the pattern and pace of neuronal cell death in the various neurological disorders. Future therapeutic strategies for these disorders will be guided in part by understanding the manifold impact of autophagy disruption on neurodegenerative diseases.","1022":"The regulation of translation provides a mechanism to control not only the abundance of proteins, but also the precise time and subcellular location that they are synthesized. Much of what is known concerning the molecular basis for translational control has been gleaned from experiments (e.g., luciferase assays and polysome analysis) that measure average changes in the protein synthesis of a population of cells, however, mechanistic insights can be obscured in ensemble measurements. The development of fluorescent microscopy techniques and reagents has allowed translation to be studied within its cellular context. Here we highlight recent methodologies that can be used to study global changes in protein synthesis or regulation of specific mRNAs in single cells. Imaging of translation has provided direct evidence for local translation of mRNAs at synapses in neurons and will become an important tool for studying translational control.","1023":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encodes seven proteins necessary for viral DNA synthesis-UL9 (origin-binding protein), ICP8 (single-strand DNA [ssDNA]-binding protein), UL30\/UL42 (polymerase), and UL5\/UL8\/UL52 (helicase\/primase). It is our intention to provide an up-to-date analysis of our understanding of the structures of these replication proteins and how they function during HSV replication. The potential roles of host repair and recombination proteins will also be discussed.","1024":null,"1025":"","1026":"Growth factors and oncogenic kinases play important roles in stimulating cell growth during development and transformation. These processes have significant energetic and synthetic requirements and it is apparent that a central function of growth signals is to promote glucose metabolism to support these demands. Because metabolic pathways represent a fundamental aspect of cell proliferation and survival, there is considerable interest in targeting metabolism as a means to eliminate cancer. A challenge, however, is that molecular links between metabolic stress and cell death are poorly understood. Here we review current literature on how cells cope with metabolic stress and how autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis are tightly linked to cell metabolism. Ultimately, understanding of the interplay between nutrients, autophagy, and cell death will be a key component in development of new treatment strategies to exploit the altered metabolism of cancer cells.","1027":"Adipose tissue is an important site for lipid storage, energy homeostasis, and whole-body insulin sensitivity. It is important to understand the mechanisms involved in adipose tissue development and function, which can be regulated by the endocrine actions of various peptide and steroid hormones. Recent studies have revealed that white and brown adipocytes can be derived from distinct precursor cells. This review will focus on transcriptional control of adipogenesis and its regulation by several endocrine hormones. The general functions and cellular origins of adipose tissue and how the modulation of adipocyte development pertains to metabolic disease states will also be considered.","1028":"The development of the gastrointestinal tract is a complex process that integrates signaling processes with downstream transcriptional responses. Here, we discuss the regionalization of the primitive gut and formation of the intestine and liver. Anterior-posterior position in the primitive gut is important for establishing regions that will become functional organs. Coordination of signaling between the epithelium and mesenchyme and downstream transcriptional responses is required for intestinal development and homeostasis. Liver development uses a complex transcriptional network that controls the establishment of organ domains, cell differentiation, and adult function. Discussion of these transcriptional mechanisms gives us insight into how the primitive gut, composed of simple endodermal cells, develops into multiple diverse cell types that are organized into complex mature organs.","1029":null,"1030":null,"1031":"Regulatory T cells expressing the FoxP3 transcription factor have a profound and nonredundant role in several aspects of immunological tolerance. We will review here the specification of this lineage, its population dynamics, and the diversity of subphenotypes that correlate with their diverse roles in controlling inflammation in a variety of settings.","1032":"Pathogens exploit several eukaryotic signaling pathways during an infection. They have evolved specific effectors and toxins to hijack host cell machinery for their own benefit. Signaling molecules are preferentially targeted by pathogens because they globally regulate many cellular processes. Both viruses and bacteria manipulate and control pathways that regulate host cell survival and shape, including MAPK signaling, G-protein signaling, signals controlling cytoskeletal dynamics, and innate immune responses.","1033":null,"1034":"The Wnt pathway is a major embryonic signaling pathway that controls cell proliferation, cell fate, and body-axis determination in vertebrate embryos. Soon after egg fertilization, Wnt pathway components play a role in microtubule-dependent dorsoventral axis specification. Later in embryogenesis, another conserved function of the pathway is to specify the anteroposterior axis. The dual role of Wnt signaling in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos is regulated at different developmental stages by distinct sets of Wnt target genes. This review highlights recent progress in the discrimination of different signaling branches and the identification of specific pathway targets during vertebrate axial development.","1035":null,"1036":"mRNA translation is the most energy consuming process in the cell. In addition, it plays a pivotal role in the control of gene expression and is therefore tightly regulated. In response to various extracellular stimuli and intracellular cues, signaling pathways induce quantitative and qualitative changes in mRNA translation by modulating the phosphorylation status and thus the activity of components of the translational machinery. In this work we focus on the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, as they are strongly implicated in the regulation of translation in homeostasis, whereas their malfunction has been linked to aberrant translation in human diseases, including cancer.","1037":"Localization of an mRNA species to a particular subcellular region can complement translational control mechanisms to produce a restricted spatial distribution of the protein it encodes. mRNA localization has been studied most in asymmetric cells such as budding yeast, early embryos, and neurons, but the process is likely to be more widespread. This article reviews the current state of knowledge about the mechanisms of mRNA localization and its functions in early embryonic development, focusing on Drosophila where the relevant knowledge is most advanced. Links between mRNA localization and translational control mechanisms also are examined.","1038":"","1039":"","1040":"","1041":"Here we discuss the spatio-temporal organization of replication in eubacteria and eukaryotes. Although there are significant differences in how replication is organized in cells that contain nuclei from those that do not, you will see that organization of replication in all organisms is principally dictated by the structured arrangement of the chromosome. We will begin with how replication is organized in eubacteria with particular emphasis on three well studied model organisms. We will then discuss spatial and temporal organization of replication in eukaryotes highlighting the similarities and differences between these two domains of life.","1042":"Genes dedicated to killing cells must have evolved because of their positive effects on organismal survival. Positive functions of apoptotic genes have been well established in a large number of biological contexts, including their role in eliminating damaged and potentially cancerous cells. More recently, evidence has suggested that proapoptotic proteins-mostly caspases-can induce proliferation of neighboring surviving cells to replace dying cells. This process, that we will refer to as \"apoptosis-induced proliferation,\" may be critical for stem cell activity and tissue regeneration. Depending on the caspases involved, at least two distinct types of apoptosis-induced proliferation can be distinguished. One of these types have been studied using a model in which cells have initiated cell death, but are prevented from executing it because of effector caspase inhibition, thereby generating \"undead\" cells that emit persistent mitogen signaling and overgrowth. Such conditions are likely to contribute to certain forms of cancer. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of apoptosis-induced proliferation and discuss its relevance for tissue regeneration and cancer.","1043":"The inner ear is a structurally complex vertebrate organ built to encode sound, motion, and orientation in space. Given its complexity, it is not surprising that inner ear dysfunction is a relatively common consequence of human genetic mutation. Studies in model organisms suggest that many genes currently known to be associated with human hearing impairment are active during embryogenesis. Hence, the study of inner ear development provides a rich context for understanding the functions of genes implicated in hearing loss. This chapter focuses on molecular mechanisms of inner ear development derived from studies of model organisms.","1044":null,"1045":"Dendritic cells (DCs) link innate immune sensing of the environment to the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Given their supreme capacity to interact with and present antigen to T cells, DCs have been proposed as key mediators of immunological tolerance in the steady state. However, recent evidence suggests that the role of DCs in central and peripheral T-cell tolerance is neither obligate nor dominant. Instead, DCs appear to regulate multiple aspects of T-cell physiology including tonic antigen receptor signaling, priming of effector T-cell response, and the maintenance of regulatory T cells. These diverse contributions of DCs may reflect the significant heterogeneity and \"division of labor\" observed between and within distinct DC subsets. The emerging complex role of different DC subsets should form the conceptual basis of DC-based therapeutic approaches toward induction of tolerance or immunization.","1046":"During development, signaling pathways specify cell fates by activating transcriptional programs in response to extracellular signals. Extensive studies in the past 30 years have revealed that surprisingly few pathways exist to regulate developmental programs and that dysregulation of these can lead to human diseases, including cancer. Although these pathways use distinct signaling components and signaling strategies, a number of common themes have emerged regarding their organization and regulation in time and space. Examples from Drosophila, such as Notch, Hedgehog, Wingless\/WNT, BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), EGF (epidermal growth factor), and FGF (fibroblast growth factor) signaling, illustrate their abilities to act either at a short range or over a long distance, and in some instances to generate morphogen gradients that pattern fields of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. They also show how feedback loops and transcriptional cascades are part of the logic of developmental regulation.","1047":"Many forms of synaptic plasticity are triggered by biochemical signaling that occurs in small postsynaptic compartments called dendritic spines, each of which typically houses the postsynaptic terminal associated with a single glutamatergic synapse. Recent advances in optical techniques allow investigators to monitor biochemical signaling in single dendritic spines and thus reveal the signaling mechanisms that link synaptic activity and the induction of synaptic plasticity. This is mostly in the study of Ca2+-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity for which many of the steps between Ca2+ influx and changes to the synapse are now known. This article introduces the new techniques used to investigate signaling in single dendritic spines and the neurobiological insights that they have produced.","1048":"Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a highly regulated and complex stage of gene expression. It requires the action of at least 12 initiation factors, many of which are known to be the targets of regulatory pathways. Here we review our current understanding of the molecular mechanics of eukaryotic translation initiation, focusing on recent breakthroughs from in vitro and in vivo studies. We also identify important unanswered questions that will require new ideas and techniques to solve.","1049":"Many animal organs, such as the lung, the kidney, the mammary gland, and the vasculature, consist of branched tubular structures that arise through a process known as \"branching morphogenesis\" that results from the remodeling of epithelial or endothelial sheaths into multicellular tubular networks. In recent years, the combination of molecular biology, forward and reverse genetic approaches, and their complementation by live imaging has started to unravel rules and mechanisms controlling branching processes in animals. Common patterns of branch formation spanning diverse model systems are beginning to emerge that might reflect unifying principles of tubular organ formation.","1050":"Decades of extensive biochemical and biophysical research have outlined the mechanism of translation. Rich structural studies have provided detailed snapshots of the translational machinery at all phases of the translation cycle. However, the relationship between structural dynamics, composition, and function remains unknown. The multistep nature of each stage of the translation cycle results in rapid desynchronization of individual ribosomes, thus hindering elucidation of the underlying mechanisms by conventional bulk biophysical and biochemical methods. Single-molecule approaches unsusceptible to these complications have led to the first glances at both compositional and conformational dynamics on the ribosome and their impact on translational control. These experiments provide the necessary link between static structure and mechanism, often providing new perspectives. Here we review recent advances in the field and their relationship to structural and biochemical data.","1051":"The link between perturbations in translational control and cancer etiology is becoming a primary focus in cancer research. It has now been established that genetic alterations in several components of the translational apparatus underlie spontaneous cancers as well as an entire class of inherited syndromes known as \"ribosomopathies\" associated with increased cancer susceptibility. These discoveries have illuminated the importance of deregulations in translational control to very specific cellular processes that contribute to cancer etiology. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the view that deregulation of translational control is a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development. Indeed, activation of these key oncogenic pathways induces rapid and dramatic translational reprogramming both by increasing overall protein synthesis and by modulating specific mRNA networks. These translational changes promote cellular transformation, impacting almost every phase of tumor development. This paradigm represents a new frontier in the multihit model of cancer formation and offers significant promise for innovative cancer therapies. Current research, in conjunction with cutting edge technologies, will further enable us to explore novel mechanisms of translational control, functionally identify translationally controlled mRNA groups, and unravel their impact on cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.","1052":"The control of translation and mRNA degradation is important in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. In general, translation and steps in the major pathway of mRNA decay are in competition with each other. mRNAs that are not engaged in translation can aggregate into cytoplasmic mRNP granules referred to as processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules, which are related to mRNP particles that control translation in early development and neurons. Analyses of P-bodies and stress granules suggest a dynamic process, referred to as the mRNA Cycle, wherein mRNPs can move between polysomes, P-bodies and stress granules although the functional roles of mRNP assembly into higher order structures remain poorly understood. In this article, we review what is known about the coupling of translation and mRNA degradation, the properties of P-bodies and stress granules, and how assembly of mRNPs into larger structures might influence cellular function.","1053":"Neurons can sustain high rates of synaptic transmission without exhausting their supply of synaptic vesicles. This property relies on a highly efficient local endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes, which can be reused for hundreds, possibly thousands, of exo-endocytic cycles. Morphological, physiological, molecular, and genetic studies over the last four decades have provided insight into the membrane traffic reactions that govern this recycling and its regulation. These studies have shown that synaptic vesicle endocytosis capitalizes on fundamental and general endocytic mechanisms but also involves neuron-specific adaptations of such mechanisms. Thus, investigations of these processes have advanced not only the field of synaptic transmission but also, more generally, the field of endocytosis. This article summarizes current information on synaptic vesicle endocytosis with an emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms and with a special focus on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the predominant pathway of synaptic vesicle protein internalization.","1054":"This work summarizes our current understanding of the elongation and termination\/recycling phases of eukaryotic protein synthesis. We focus here on recent advances in the field. In addition to an overview of translation elongation, we discuss unique aspects of eukaryotic translation elongation including eEF1 recycling, eEF2 modification, and eEF3 and eIF5A function. Likewise, we highlight the function of the eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3 in translation termination, and the functions of ABCE1\/Rli1, the Dom34:Hbs1 complex, and Ligatin (eIF2D) in ribosome recycling. Finally, we present some of the key questions in translation elongation, termination, and recycling that remain to be answered.","1055":"","1056":"Messenger RNAs (mRNAs), the templates for translation, have evolved to harbor abundant cis-acting sequences that affect their posttranscriptional fates. These elements are frequently located in the untranslated regions and serve as binding sites for trans-acting factors, RNA-binding proteins, and\/or small non-coding RNAs. This article provides a systematic synopsis of cis-acting elements, trans-acting factors, and the mechanisms by which they affect translation. It also highlights recent technical advances that have ushered in the era of transcriptome-wide studies of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed by mRNAs and their trans-acting factors.","1057":"","1058":"The skin epidermis is a stratified epithelium that forms a barrier that protects animals from dehydration, mechanical stress, and infections. The epidermis encompasses different appendages, such as the hair follicle (HF), the sebaceous gland (SG), the sweat gland, and the touch dome, that are essential for thermoregulation, sensing the environment, and influencing social behavior. The epidermis undergoes a constant turnover and distinct stem cells (SCs) are responsible for the homeostasis of the different epidermal compartments. Deregulation of the signaling pathways controlling the balance between renewal and differentiation often leads to cancer formation.","1059":"Wnt genes are important regulators of embryogenesis and cell differentiation in vertebrates and insects. New data revealed by comparative genomics have now shown that members of the Wnt signaling pathway can be found in all clades of metazoans, but not in fungi, plants, or unicellular eukaryotes. This article focuses on new data from recent genomic analyses of several basal metazoan organisms, providing evidence that the Wnt pathway was a primordial signaling pathway during evolution. The formation of a Wnt signaling center at the site of gastrulation was instrumental for the formation of a primary, anterior-posterior body axis, which can be traced throughout animal evolution.","1060":"Different types of synapses are specialized to interpret spike trains in their own way by virtue of the complement of short-term synaptic plasticity mechanisms they possess. Numerous types of short-term, use-dependent synaptic plasticity regulate neurotransmitter release. Short-term depression is prominent after a single conditioning stimulus and recovers in seconds. Sustained presynaptic activation can result in more profound depression that recovers more slowly. An enhancement of release known as facilitation is prominent after single conditioning stimuli and lasts for hundreds of milliseconds. Finally, tetanic activation can enhance synaptic strength for tens of seconds to minutes through processes known as augmentation and posttetantic potentiation. Progress in clarifying the properties, mechanisms, and functional roles of these forms of short-term plasticity is reviewed here.","1061":"","1062":null,"1063":"Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitter at chemical synapses, thus initiating the flow of information in neural networks. To achieve this, vesicles undergo a dynamic cycle of fusion and retrieval to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the presynaptic terminals in which they reside. Moreover, compelling evidence indicates these vesicles differ in their availability for release and mobilization in response to stimuli, prompting classification into at least three different functional pools. Ongoing studies of the molecular and cellular bases for this heterogeneity attempt to link structure to physiology and clarify how regulation of vesicle pools influences synaptic strength and presynaptic plasticity. We discuss prevailing perspectives on vesicle pools, the role they play in shaping synaptic transmission, and the open questions that challenge current understanding.","1064":"The formation and maintenance of neural circuits in the mammal central nervous system (CNS) require the coordinated expression of genes not just at the transcriptional level, but at the translational level as well. Recent evidence shows that regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is necessary for certain forms of synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory. In addition, regulated translation helps guide axonal growth cones to their targets on other neurons or at the neuromuscular junction. Several neurologic syndromes have been correlated with and indeed may be caused by aberrant translation; one important example is the fragile X mental retardation syndrome. Although translation in the CNS is regulated by multiple mechanisms and factors, we focus this review on regulatory mRNA-binding proteins with particular emphasis on fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) because they have been shown to be at the nexus of translational control and brain function in health and disease.","1065":"Wnt signaling is activated by wounding and participates in every subsequent stage of the healing process from the control of inflammation and programmed cell death, to the mobilization of stem cell reservoirs within the wound site. In this review we summarize recent data elucidating the roles that the Wnt pathway plays in the injury repair process. These data provide a foundation for potential Wnt-based therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating tissue regeneration.","1066":"In a complex multicellular organism, different cell types engage in specialist functions, and as a result, the secretory output of cells and tissues varies widely. Whereas some quiescent cell types secrete minor amounts of proteins, tissues like the pancreas, producing insulin and other hormones, and mature B cells, producing antibodies, place a great demand on their endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our understanding of how protein secretion in general is controlled in the ER is now quite sophisticated. However, there remain gaps in our knowledge, particularly when applying insight gained from model systems to the more complex situations found in vivo. This article describes recent advances in our understanding of the ER and its role in preparing proteins for secretion, with an emphasis on glycoprotein quality control and pathways of disulfide bond formation.","1067":"Epigenetic mechanisms are extensively utilized during mammalian development. Specific patterns of gene expression are established during cell fate decisions, maintained as differentiation progresses, and often augmented as more specialized cell types are required. Much of what is known about these mechanisms comes from the study of two distinct epigenetic phenomena: genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. In the case of genomic imprinting, alleles are expressed in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner, whereas X-chromosome inactivation in females requires that only one X chromosome is active in each somatic nucleus. As model systems for epigenetic regulation, genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation have identified and elucidated the numerous regulatory mechanisms that function throughout the genome during development.","1068":"Mammalian cells require growth-factor-receptor-initiated signaling to proliferate. Signal transduction not only initiates entry into the cell cycle, but also reprograms cellular metabolism. This instructional metabolic reprogramming is critical if the cell is to fulfill the anabolic and energetic requirements that accompany cell growth and division. Growth factor signaling mediated by the PI3K\/Akt pathway plays a major role in regulating the cellular uptake of glucose, as well as the incorporation of this glucose carbon into lipids for membrane synthesis. Tyrosine-kinase-based regulation of key glycolytic enzymes such as pyruvate kinase also plays a critical role directing glucose carbon into anabolic pathways. In addition, the Myc transcription factor and mTOR kinase regulate the uptake and utilization of amino acids for protein and nucleic acid synthesis, as well as for the supply of intermediates to the mitochondrial Krebs cycle. However, the relationship between cellular signaling and metabolism is not unidirectional. Cells, by sensing levels of intracellular metabolites and the status of key metabolic pathways, can exert feedback control on signal transduction networks through multiple types of metabolite-derived protein modifications. These mechanisms allow cells to coordinate growth and division with their metabolic activity.","1069":"","1070":"","1071":"","1072":"Autophagy is an important catabolic process that delivers cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for degradation. Autophagy promotes cell survival by elimination of damaged organelles and proteins aggregates, as well as by facilitating bioenergetic homeostasis. Although autophagy has been considered a cell survival mechanism, recent studies have shown that autophagy can promote cell death. The core mechanisms that control autophagy are conserved between yeast and humans, but animals also possess genes that regulate autophagy that are not present in yeast. These regulatory differences may be explained by the need to control autophagy in a cell context-specific manner in multicellular animals, such as during cell survival and cell death. Autophagy was thought to be a bulk cytoplasmic degradation mechanism, but recent studies have shown that specific cargo is recruited for degradation. This suggests the possibility that either cell survival or death may be regulated by selective autophagic clearance of cytoplasmic material. Here we summarize the mechanisms that regulate autophagy and how they may contribute to cell survival and death.","1073":"Somatic recombination of TCR genes in immature thymocytes results in some cells with useful TCR specificities, but also many with useless or potentially self-reactive specificities. Thus thymic selection mechanisms operate to shape the T-cell repertoire. Thymocytes that have a TCR with low affinity for self-peptide-MHC complexes are positively selected to further differentiate and function in adaptive immunity, whereas useless ones die by neglect. Clonal deletion and clonal diversion (Treg differentiation) are the major processes in the thymus that eliminate or control self-reactive T cells. Although these processes are thought to be efficient, they fail to control self-reactivity in all circumstances. Thus, peripheral tolerance processes exist wherein self-reactive T cells become functionally unresponsive (anergy) or are deleted after encountering self-antigens outside of the thymus. Recent advances in mechanistic studies of central and peripheral T-cell tolerance are promoting the development of therapeutic strategies to treat autoimmune disease and cancer and improve transplantation outcome.","1074":"","1075":"The mouse mammary gland is an outstanding developmental model that exemplifies the activities of many of the effector pathways known to organize mammalian morphogenesis; furthermore, there are well-characterized methods for the specific genetic manipulation of various mammary epithelial cell components. Among these signaling pathways, Wnt signaling has been shown to generate plasticity of fate determination, expanding the genetic programs available to cells in the mammary lineage. It is responsible first for the appearance of the mammary fate in embryonic ectoderm and then for maintaining bi-potential basal stem cells in adult mammary ductal trees. Recent technical developments have led to the separate analysis of various mammary epithelial cell subpopulations, spurring the investigation of Wnt-dependent interactions. Although Wnt signaling was shown to be oncogenic for mouse mammary epithelium even before being identified as the principle oncogenic driver for gut epithelium, conclusive data implicating this pathway as a tumor driver for breast cancer lag behind, and we examine potential reasons.","1076":"Components of the Wnt signaling pathway are expressed in a tightly regulated and spatially specific manner during development of the forebrain, and Wnts are key regulators of regional forebrain identity. Wnt signaling from the cortical hem regulates the expansion and cell-type specification of the adjacent neuroepithelium and, in conjunction with Bmp, Fgf, and Shh signaling, controls dorsal-ventral forebrain patterning. Subsequently, Wnt signaling dynamically regulates the behavior of cortical progenitor cells, initially promoting the expansion of radial glia progenitor cells and later inducing neurogenesis by promoting terminal differentiation of intermediate progenitor cells. A role for Wnt signaling in cell-type specification has also been proposed.","1077":"","1078":"The relentless nature and increasing prevalence of human pancreatic diseases, in particular, diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma, has motivated further understanding of pancreas organogenesis. The pancreas is a multifunctional organ whose epithelial cells govern a diversity of physiologically vital endocrine and exocrine functions. The mechanisms governing the birth, differentiation, morphogenesis, growth, maturation, and maintenance of the endocrine and exocrine components in the pancreas have been discovered recently with increasing tempo. This includes recent studies unveiling mechanisms permitting unexpected flexibility in the developmental potential of immature and mature pancreatic cell subsets, including the ability to interconvert fates. In this article, we describe how classical cell biology, genetic analysis, lineage tracing, and embryological investigations are being complemented by powerful modern methods including epigenetic analysis, time-lapse imaging, and flow cytometry-based cell purification to dissect fundamental processes of pancreas development.","1079":"All the information to make a complete, fully functional living organism is encoded within the genome of the fertilized oocyte. How is this genetic code translated into the vast array of cellular behaviors that unfold during the course of embryonic development, as the zygote slowly morphs into a new organism? Studies over the last 30 years or so have shown that many of these cellular processes are driven by secreted or membrane-bound signaling molecules. Elucidating how the genetic code is translated into instructions or signals during embryogenesis, how signals are generated at the correct time and place and at the appropriate level, and finally, how these instructions are interpreted and put into action, are some of the central questions of developmental biology. Our understanding of the causes of congenital malformations and disease has improved substantially with the rapid advances in our knowledge of signaling pathways and their regulation during development. In this article, I review some of the signaling pathways that play essential roles during embryonic development. These examples show some of the mechanisms used by cells to receive and interpret developmental signals. I also discuss how signaling pathways downstream from these signals are regulated and how they induce specific cellular responses that ultimately affect cell fate and morphogenesis.","1080":"A key function of signal transduction during cell polarization is the creation of spatially segregated regions of the cell cortex that possess different lipid and protein compositions and have distinct functions. Polarity can be initiated spontaneously or in response to signaling inputs from adjacent cells or soluble factors and is stabilized by positive-feedback loops. A conserved group of proteins, the Par proteins, plays a central role in polarity establishment and maintenance in many contexts. These proteins generate and maintain their distinct locations in cells by actively excluding one another from specific regions of the plasma membrane. The Par signaling pathway intersects with multiple other pathways that control cell growth, death, and organization.","1081":"","1082":"","1083":"Structures of the bacterial ribosome have provided a framework for understanding universal mechanisms of protein synthesis. However, the eukaryotic ribosome is much larger than it is in bacteria, and its activity is fundamentally different in many key ways. Recent cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions and X-ray crystal structures of eukaryotic ribosomes and ribosomal subunits now provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore mechanisms of eukaryotic translation and its regulation in atomic detail. This review describes the X-ray crystal structures of the Tetrahymena thermophila 40S and 60S subunits and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 80S ribosome, as well as cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of translating yeast and plant 80S ribosomes. Mechanistic questions about translation in eukaryotes that will require additional structural insights to be resolved are also presented.","1084":"","1085":"The lungs serve the primary function of air-blood gas exchange in all mammals and in terrestrial vertebrates. Efficient gas exchange requires a large surface area that provides intimate contact between the atmosphere and the circulatory system. To achieve this, the lung contains a branched conducting system (the bronchial tree) and specialized air-blood gas exchange units (the alveoli). The conducting system brings air from the external environment to the alveoli and functions to protect the lung from debris that could obstruct airways, from entry of pathogens, and from excessive loss of fluids. The distal lung enables efficient exchange of gas between the alveoli and the conducting system and between the alveoli and the circulatory system. In this article, we highlight developmental and physiological mechanisms that specify, pattern, and regulate morphogenesis of this complex and essential organ. Recent advances have begun to define molecular mechanisms that control many of the important processes required for lung organogenesis; however, many questions remain. A deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms will aid in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital lung disease and in the development of strategies to enhance the reparative response of the lung to injury and eventually permit regeneration of functional lung tissue.","1086":"The mammalian kidney is a vital organ with considerable cellular complexity and functional diversity. Kidney development is notable for requiring distinct but coincident tubulogenic processes involving reciprocal inductive signals between mesenchymal and epithelial progenitor compartments. Key molecular pathways mediating these interactions have been identified. Further, advances in the analysis of gene expression and gene activity, coupled with a detailed knowledge of cell origins, are enhancing our understanding of kidney morphogenesis and unraveling the normal processes of postnatal repair and identifying disease-causing mechanisms. This article focuses on recent insights into central regulatory processes governing organ assembly and renal disease, and predicts future directions for the field.","1087":null,"1088":"All living organisms maintain a high ATP:ADP ratio to drive energy-requiring processes. They therefore need mechanisms to maintain energy balance at the cellular level. In addition, multicellular eukaryotes have assigned the task of storing energy to specialized cells such as adipocytes, and therefore also need a means of intercellular communication to signal the needs of individual tissues and to maintain overall energy balance at the whole body level. Such signaling allows animals to survive periods of fasting or starvation when food is not available and is mainly achieved by hormonal and nervous communication. Insulin, adipokines, epinephrine, and other agonists thus stimulate pathways that regulate the activities of key enzymes involved in control of metabolism to integrate organismal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Overnutrition can dysregulate these pathways and have damaging consequences, causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","1089":"The Wingless (Wg) pathway represents one of the best-characterized intercellular signaling networks. Studies performed in Drosophila over the last 30 years have contributed to our understanding of the role of Wg signaling in the regulation of tissue growth, polarity, and patterning. These studies have revealed mechanisms conserved in the vertebrate Wnt pathways and illustrate the elegance of using the Drosophila model to understand evolutionarily conserved modes of gene regulation. In this article, we describe the function of Wg signaling in patterning the Drosophila embryonic epidermis and wing imaginal disc. As well, we present an overview of the establishment of the Wg morphogen gradient and discuss the differential modes of Wg-regulated gene expression.","1090":"Homeostasis of the protein-folding environment in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is maintained by signal transduction pathways that collectively constitute an unfolded protein response (UPR). These affect bulk protein synthesis and thereby the levels of ER stress, but also culminate in regulated expression of specific mRNAs, such as that encoding the transcription factor ATF4. Mechanisms linking eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) phosphorylation to control of unfolded protein load in the ER were elucidated more than 10 years ago, but recent work has highlighted the diversity of processes that impinge on eIF2 activity and revealed that there are multiple mechanisms by which changes in eIF2 activity can modulate the translation of individual mRNAs. In addition, the potential for affecting this step of translation initiation pharmacologically is becoming clearer. Furthermore, it is now clear that another strand of the UPR, controlled by the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), also affects rates of protein synthesis in stressed cells and that its effector function, mediated by the transcription factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), is subject to important mRNA-specific translational regulation. These new insights into the convergence of translational control and the UPR will be reviewed here.","1091":"Long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTP\/LTD) can be elicited by activating N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors, typically by the coincident activity of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. The early phases of expression are mediated by a redistribution of AMPA-type glutamate receptors: More receptors are added to potentiate the synapse or receptors are removed to weaken synapses. With time, structural changes become apparent, which in general require the synthesis of new proteins. The investigation of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these forms of synaptic plasticity has received much attention, because NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD may constitute cellular substrates of learning and memory.","1092":"Wnt proteins are best known for their profound roles in cell patterning, because they are required for the embryonic development of all animal species studied to date. Besides regulating cell fate, Wnt proteins are gaining increasing recognition for their roles in nervous system development and function. New studies indicate that multiple positive and negative Wnt signaling pathways take place simultaneously during the formation of vertebrate and invertebrate neuromuscular junctions. Although some Wnts are essential for the formation of NMJs, others appear to play a more modulatory role as part of multiple signaling pathways. Here we review the most recent findings regarding the function of Wnts at the NMJ from both vertebrate and invertebrate model systems.","1093":"The synapse is the functional unit of the brain. During the last several decades we have acquired a great deal of information on its structure, molecular components, and physiological function. It is clear that synapses are morphologically and molecularly diverse and that this diversity is recruited to different functions. One of the most intriguing findings is that the size of the synaptic response in not invariant, but can be altered by a variety of homo- and heterosynaptic factors such as past patterns of use or modulatory neurotransmitters. Perhaps the most difficult challenge in neuroscience is to design experiments that reveal how these basic building blocks of the brain are put together and how they are regulated to mediate the information flow through neural circuits that is necessary to produce complex behaviors and store memories. In this review we will focus on studies that attempt to uncover the role of synaptic plasticity in the regulation of whole-animal behavior by learning and memory.","1094":null,"1095":"","1096":"A defining feature of many cancers is deregulated translational control. Typically, this occurs at the level of recruitment of the 40S ribosomes to the 5'-cap of cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs), the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis, which is controlled by the heterotrimeric eukaryotic initiation complex eIF4F. Thus, eIF4F in particular, and translation initiation in general, represent an exploitable vulnerability and unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention in many transformed cells. In this article, we discuss the development, mode of action and biological activity of a number of small-molecule inhibitors that interrupt PI3K\/mTOR signaling control of eIF4F assembly, as well as compounds that more directly block eIF4F activity.","1097":"Many of the morphogenetic processes that occur during development in the mouse are based on cyclic events with defined time intervals, as exemplified by somitogenesis (every 2 h), hair cycles (every 25 d), and spermatogenesis (every 35 d). Among these events, somitogenesis is the most dynamic morphogenetic mechanism showing clear cyclicity during embryogenesis and is therefore a good system with which to review the synchronous and cyclic characteristics of developmental pathways. The metameric properties of the somites underpin the segmental properties along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the body. The periodicity of somites is controlled by the so-called segmentation clock operating in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). This tissue contains the somite precursor cells that exist only during embryonic development. Both theoretical and experimental approaches have contributed to the understanding of the mechanism of somite segmentation. This article focuses on how the segmentation clock functions to organize the collective behavior of cells and how this information is translated into the spatial patterning of segmental somites. The interplay between signaling molecules that provides positional information and the transcription factors that respond to such positional cues are critical to the role of the segmentation clock and are discussed.","1098":"The Wnt signaling pathway was originally uncovered as one of the prototype developmental signaling cascades in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates. The first indication that Wnt signaling also plays a role in the adult animal came from the study of the intestine of Tcf-4 (Tcf7L2) knockout mice. The gastrointestinal epithelium continuously self-renews over the lifetime of an organism and is, in fact, the most rapidly self-renewing tissue of the mammalian body. Recent studies indicate that Wnt signaling plays a central role in the biology of gastrointestinal stem cells. Furthermore, mutational activation of the Wnt cascade is the principle cause of colon cancer.","1099":"Despite advances in medicine, infectious diseases remain major causes of death and disability worldwide. Acute or chronic infectious agents mediate host tissue damage and cause a spectrum of disease as diverse as overwhelming sepsis and shock within hours to persistent tissue inflammation causing organ failure or even cancer over years. Although pathogen exposure can cause disease via host-derived inflammation, pathogens share recognized elements with harmless human commensals. Mouse models and organisms with simpler flora are revealing the dialogue between multicellular hosts and commensal flora. In some instances the persistent inflammation associated with pathogens can be interpreted within a framework of frustrated commensalism in which the host and pathogen cannot complete the requisite dialogue that establishes homeostasis. In contrast, coevolved commensals interact cooperatively with the host immune system, resulting in immunotolerance. Attempts to more thoroughly understand the molecular nature of the dialogue may uncover novel approaches to the control of inflammation and tissue damage.","1100":"Aberrant regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a prevalent theme in cancer biology. From the earliest observation that Wnt overexpression could lead to malignant transformation of mouse mammary tissue to the most recent genetic discoveries gleaned from tumor genome sequencing, the Wnt pathway continues to evolve as a central mechanism in cancer biology. This article summarizes the evidence supporting a role for Wnt signaling in human cancer. This includes a review of the genetic mutations affecting Wnt pathway components, as well as some of epigenetic mechanisms that alter expression of genes relevant to Wnt. I also highlight some research on the cooperativity of Wnt with other signaling pathways in cancer. Finally, some emphasis is placed on laboratory research that provides a proof of concept for the therapeutic inhibition of Wnt signaling in cancer.","1101":"Teeth develop as ectodermal appendages from epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Tooth organogenesis is regulated by an intricate network of cell-cell signaling during all steps of development. The dental hard tissues, dentin, enamel, and cementum, are formed by unique cell types whose differentiation is intimately linked with morphogenesis. During evolution the capacity for tooth replacement has been reduced in mammals, whereas teeth have acquired more complex shapes. Mammalian teeth contain stem cells but they may not provide a source for bioengineering of human teeth. Therefore it is likely that nondental cells will have to be reprogrammed for the purpose of clinical tooth regeneration. Obviously this will require understanding of the mechanisms of normal development. The signaling networks mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during morphogenesis are well characterized but the molecular signatures of the odontogenic tissues remain to be uncovered.","1102":"A fundamental property of the immune system is its ability to mediate self-defense with a minimal amount of collateral damage to the host. The system uses several different mechanisms to achieve this goal, which is collectively referred to as the \"process of immunological tolerance.\" This article provides an introductory historical overview to these various mechanisms, which are discussed in greater detail throughout this collection, and then briefly describes what happens when this process fails, a state referred to as \"autoimmunity.\"","1103":"","1104":"","1105":"","1106":"The development of most autoimmune diseases includes a strong heritable component. This genetic contribution to disease ranges from simple Mendelian inheritance of causative alleles to the complex interactions of multiple weak loci influencing risk. The genetic variants responsible for disease are being discovered through a range of strategies from linkage studies to genome-wide association studies. Despite the rapid advances in genetic analysis, substantial components of the heritable risk remain unexplained, either owing to the contribution of an as-yet unidentified, \"hidden,\" component of risk, or through the underappreciated effects of known risk loci. Surprisingly, despite the variation in genetic control, a great deal of conservation appears in the biological processes influenced by risk alleles, with several key immunological pathways being modified in autoimmune diseases covering a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. The primary translational potential of this knowledge is in the rational design of new therapeutics to exploit the role of these key pathways in influencing disease. With significant further advances in understanding the genetic risk factors and their biological mechanisms, the possibility of genetically tailored (or \"personalized\") therapy may be realized.","1107":"A major challenge for the immune system is to control pathogens and stressed cells, such as infected or tumors cells, while sparing healthy self-cells. To achieve this tolerance to self, immune cells must recognize and differentiate \"self\" versus \"nonself\" and \"self\" versus \"altered self.\" In the absence of self-tolerance, cells of the adaptive immune system attack healthy cells and cause autoimmune diseases such as lupus, psoriasis, and type I diabetes. Mechanisms at work to ensure tolerance in the innate immune system are still poorly understood. Natural killer cells are innate immune lymphocytes, which have the capacity to kill cellular targets and produce cytokines without prior specific sensitization. Because of these intrinsic effector capacities, tolerance mechanisms must exist to prevent autoreactivity. Herein, we will review the present knowledge on NK cell tolerance.","1108":null,"1109":"The morphology and molecular composition of synapses provide the structural basis for synaptic function. This article reviews the electron microscopy of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines, using data from rodent hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. Excitatory synapses have a prominent postsynaptic density, in contrast with inhibitory synapses, which have less dense presynaptic or postsynaptic specializations and are usually found on the cell body or proximal dendritic shaft. Immunogold labeling shows that the presynaptic active zone provides a scaffold for key molecules involved in the release of neurotransmitter, whereas the postsynaptic density contains ligand-gated ionic channels, other receptors, and a complex network of signaling molecules. Delineating the structure and molecular organization of these axospinous synapses represents a crucial step toward understanding the mechanisms that underlie synaptic transmission and the dynamic modulation of neurotransmission associated with short- and long-term synaptic plasticity.","1110":"Calcium (Ca(2+)) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that accumulates in the cytoplasm in response to diverse classes of stimuli and, in turn, regulates many aspects of cell function. In neurons, Ca(2+) influx in response to action potentials or synaptic stimulation triggers neurotransmitter release, modulates ion channels, induces synaptic plasticity, and activates transcription. In this article, we discuss the factors that regulate Ca(2+) signaling in mammalian neurons with a particular focus on Ca(2+) signaling within dendritic spines. This includes consideration of the routes of entry and exit of Ca(2+), the cellular mechanisms that establish the temporal and spatial profile of Ca(2+) signaling, and the biophysical criteria that determine which downstream signals are activated when Ca(2+) accumulates in a spine. Furthermore, we also briefly discuss the technical advances that made possible the quantitative study of Ca(2+) signaling in dendritic spines.","1111":"Genomics methodologies have advanced to the extent that it is now possible to interrogate the gene expression in a single cell but proteomics has traditionally lagged behind and required much greater cellular input and was not quantitative. Coupling protein with gene expression data is essential for understanding how cell behavior is regulated. Advances primarily in mass spectrometry have, however, greatly improved the sensitivity of proteomics methods over the last decade and the outcome of proteomic analyses can now also be quantified. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to obtain sufficient tissue from staged mammalian embryos to combine proteomic and genomic analyses. Recent developments in pluripotent stem cell biology have in part addressed this issue by providing surrogate scalable cell systems in which early developmental events can be modeled. Here we present an overview of current proteomics methodologies and the kind of information this can provide on the biology of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells.","1112":"","1113":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological process in which epithelial cells acquire the motile and invasive characteristics of mesenchymal cells. Although EMT in embryonic development is a coordinated, organized process involving interaction between many different cells and tissue types, aspects of the EMT program can be inappropriately activated in response to microenvironmental alterations and aberrant stimuli, and this can contribute to disease conditions including tissue fibrosis and cancer progression. Here we will outline how EMT functions in normal development, how it could be activated in pathologic conditions-especially by matrix metalloproteinases-and how it may be targeted for therapeutic benefit.","1114":"The genesis of skeletal muscle during embryonic development and postnatal life serves as a paradigm for stem and progenitor cell maintenance, lineage specification, and terminal differentiation. An elaborate interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic regulatory mechanisms controls myogenesis at all stages of development. Many aspects of adult myogenesis resemble or reiterate embryonic morphogenetic episodes, and related signaling mechanisms control the genetic networks that determine cell fate during these processes. An integrative view of all aspects of myogenesis is imperative for a comprehensive understanding of muscle formation. This article provides a holistic overview of the different stages and modes of myogenesis with an emphasis on the underlying signals, molecular switches, and genetic networks.","1115":"Regulation of cell signaling by Wnt proteins is critical for the formation of neuronal circuits. Wnts modulate axon pathfinding, dendritic development, and synaptic assembly. Through different receptors, Wnts activate diverse signaling pathways that lead to local changes on the cytoskeleton or global cellular changes involving nuclear function. Recently, a link between neuronal activity, essential for the formation and refinement of neuronal connections, and Wnt signaling has been uncovered. Indeed, neuronal activity regulates the release of Wnt and the localization of their receptors. Wnts mediate synaptic structural changes induced by neuronal activity or experience. New emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction in Wnt signaling contributes to neurological disorders. In this article, the attention is focused on the function of Wnt signaling in the formation of neuronal circuits in the vertebrate central nervous system.","1116":null,"1117":"Chemical synapses are asymmetric intercellular junctions that mediate synaptic transmission. Synaptic junctions are organized by trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules bridging the synaptic cleft. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules not only connect pre- and postsynaptic compartments, but also mediate trans-synaptic recognition and signaling processes that are essential for the establishment, specification, and plasticity of synapses. A growing number of synaptic cell adhesion molecules that include neurexins and neuroligins, Ig-domain proteins such as SynCAMs, receptor phosphotyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and several leucine-rich repeat proteins have been identified. These synaptic cell adhesion molecules use characteristic extracellular domains to perform complementary roles in organizing synaptic junctions that are only now being revealed. The importance of synaptic cell adhesion molecules for brain function is highlighted by recent findings implicating several such molecules, notably neurexins and neuroligins, in schizophrenia and autism.","1118":"The discovery of the genetic causes of syndromic autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities has greatly informed our understanding of the molecular pathways critical for normal synaptic function. The top-down approaches using human phenotypes and genetics helped identify causative genes and uncovered the broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric features that can result from various mutations in the same gene. Importantly, the human studies unveiled the exquisite sensitivity of cognitive function to precise levels of many diverse proteins. Bottom-up approaches applying molecular, biochemical, and neurophysiological studies to genetic models of these disorders revealed unsuspected pathogenic mechanisms and identified potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, studies in model organisms showed that symptoms of these devastating disorders can be reversed, which brings hope that affected individuals might benefit from interventions even after symptoms set in. Scientists predict that insights gained from studying these rare syndromic disorders will have an impact on the more common nonsyndromic autism and mild cognitive deficits.","1119":"Since the discovery of the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors in the brain, many have deliberated over their likely structures and how these may relate to function. This was initially satisfied by the determination of the first amino acid sequences of the Cys-loop receptors that recognized acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and glycine, followed later by similar determinations for the glutamate receptors, comprising non-NMDA and NMDA subtypes. The last decade has seen a rapid advance resulting in the first structures of Cys-loop receptors, related bacterial and molluscan homologs, and glutamate receptors, determined down to atomic resolution. This now provides a basis for determining not just the complete structures of these important receptor classes, but also for understanding how various domains and residues interact during agonist binding, receptor activation, and channel opening, including allosteric modulation. This article reviews our current understanding of these mechanisms for the Cys-loop and glutamate receptor families.","1120":"The establishment and maintenance of precisely organized tissues requires the formation of sharp borders between distinct cell populations. The maintenance of segregated cell populations is also required for tissue homeostasis in the adult, and deficiencies in segregation underlie the metastatic spreading of tumor cells. Three classes of mechanisms that underlie cell segregation and border formation have been uncovered. The first involves differences in cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion that establishes interfacial tension at the border between distinct cell populations. A second mechanism involves the induction of actomyosin-mediated contraction by intercellular signaling, such that cortical tension is generated at the border. Third, activation of Eph receptors and ephrins can lead to both decreased adhesion by triggering cleavage of E-cadherin, and to repulsion of cells by regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, thus preventing intermingling between cell populations. These mechanisms play crucial roles at distinct boundaries during development, and alterations in cadherin or Eph\/ephrin expression have been implicated in tumor metastasis.","1121":"The regulated exocytosis that mediates chemical signaling at synapses requires mechanisms to coordinate the immediate response to stimulation with the recycling needed to sustain release. Two general classes of transporter contribute to release, one located on synaptic vesicles that loads them with transmitter, and a second at the plasma membrane that both terminates signaling and serves to recycle transmitter for subsequent rounds of release. Originally identified as the target of psychoactive drugs, these transport systems have important roles in transmitter release, but we are only beginning to understand their contribution to synaptic transmission, plasticity, behavior, and disease. Recent work has started to provide a structural basis for their activity, to characterize their trafficking and potential for regulation. The results indicate that far from the passive target of psychoactive drugs, neurotransmitter transporters undergo regulation that contributes to synaptic plasticity.","1122":"(Macro)autophagy is a cellular membrane trafficking process that serves to deliver cytoplasmic constituents to lysosomes for degradation. At basal levels, it is critical for maintaining cytoplasmic as well as genomic integrity and is therefore key to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is also highly adaptable and can be modified to digest specific cargoes to bring about selective effects in response to numerous forms of intracellular and extracellular stress. It is not a surprise, therefore, that autophagy has a fundamental role in cancer and that perturbations in autophagy can contribute to malignant disease. We review here the roles of autophagy in various aspects of tumor suppression including the response of cells to nutrient and hypoxic stress, the control of programmed cell death, and the connection to tumor-associated immune responses.","1123":"Ubiquitous forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) are caused by enduring increases or decreases in neurotransmitter release. Such forms or presynaptic plasticity are equally observed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and the list of locations expressing presynaptic LTP and LTD continues to grow. In addition to the mechanistically distinct forms of postsynaptic plasticity, presynaptic plasticity offers a powerful means to modify neural circuits. A wide range of induction mechanisms has been identified, some of which occur entirely in the presynaptic terminal, whereas others require retrograde signaling from the postsynaptic to presynaptic terminals. In spite of this diversity of induction mechanisms, some common induction rules can be identified across synapses. Although the precise molecular mechanism underlying long-term changes in transmitter release in most cases remains unclear, increasing evidence indicates that presynaptic LTP and LTD can occur in vivo and likely mediate some forms of learning.","1124":"","1125":"","1126":"Sensory systems detect small molecules, mechanical perturbations, or radiation via the activation of receptor proteins and downstream signaling cascades in specialized sensory cells. In vertebrates, the two principal categories of sensory receptors are ion channels, which mediate mechanosensation, thermosensation, and acid and salt taste; and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which mediate vision, olfaction, and sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. GPCR-based signaling in rods and cones illustrates the fundamental principles of rapid activation and inactivation, signal amplification, and gain control. Channel-based sensory systems illustrate the integration of diverse modulatory signals at the receptor, as seen in the thermosensory\/pain system, and the rapid response kinetics that are possible with direct mechanical gating of a channel. Comparisons of sensory receptor gene sequences reveal numerous examples in which gene duplication and sequence divergence have created novel sensory specificities. This is the evolutionary basis for the observed diversity in temperature- and ligand-dependent gating among thermosensory channels, spectral tuning among visual pigments, and odorant binding among olfactory receptors. The coding of complex external stimuli by a limited number of sensory receptor types has led to the evolution of modality-specific and species-specific patterns of retention or loss of sensory information, a filtering operation that selectively emphasizes features in the stimulus that enhance survival in a particular ecological niche. The many specialized anatomic structures, such as the eye and ear, that house primary sensory neurons further enhance the detection of relevant stimuli.","1127":"Neural circuits must maintain stable function in the face of many plastic challenges, including changes in synapse number and strength, during learning and development. Recent work has shown that these destabilizing influences are counterbalanced by homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that act to stabilize neuronal and circuit activity. One such mechanism is synaptic scaling, which allows neurons to detect changes in their own firing rates through a set of calcium-dependent sensors that then regulate receptor trafficking to increase or decrease the accumulation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites. Additional homeostatic mechanisms may allow local changes in synaptic activation to generate local synaptic adaptations, and network-wide changes in activity to generate network-wide adjustments in the balance between excitation and inhibition. The signaling pathways underlying these various forms of homeostatic plasticity are currently under intense scrutiny, and although dozens of molecular pathways have now been implicated in homeostatic plasticity, a clear picture of how homeostatic feedback is structured at the molecular level has not yet emerged. On a functional level, neuronal networks likely use this complex set of regulatory mechanisms to achieve homeostasis over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.","1128":"Upon entering a presynaptic terminal, an action potential opens Ca(2+) channels, and transiently increases the local Ca(2+) concentration at the presynaptic active zone. Ca(2+) then triggers neurotransmitter release within a few hundred microseconds by activating synaptotagmins Ca(2+). Synaptotagmins bind Ca(2+) via two C2-domains, and transduce the Ca(2+) signal into a nanomechanical activation of the membrane fusion machinery; this activation is mediated by the Ca(2+)-dependent interaction of the synaptotagmin C2-domains with phospholipids and SNARE proteins. In triggering exocytosis, synaptotagmins do not act alone, but require an obligatory cofactor called complexin, a small protein that binds to SNARE complexes and simultaneously activates and clamps the SNARE complexes, thereby positioning the SNARE complexes for subsequent synaptotagmin action. The conserved function of synaptotagmins and complexins operates generally in most, if not all, Ca(2+)-regulated forms of exocytosis throughout the body in addition to synaptic vesicle exocytosis, including in the degranulation of mast cells, acrosome exocytosis in sperm cells, hormone secretion from endocrine cells, and neuropeptide release.","1129":null,"1130":null,"1131":null,"1132":null,"1133":"The extracellular matrix (ECM) and its receptors make diverse contributions to development. The ECM comes in a variety of forms, including the more \"standard\" ECM that is internal to the animal and on the basal side of epithelial sheets, as well as the apical ECM, which is especially elaborated in the invertebrates to form the exoskeleton. ECM proteins accumulate adjacent to particular target tissues in the developing animal by a variety of mechanisms: local synthesis in the target tissue; local synthesis by migrating cells; and secretion from a distant source and capture by the target tissue. The diverse developmental functions of the ECM are discussed, including the generation of a road for cell migration, creation of morphogenetic checkpoints for differentiation, modulation of morphogen gradients, insulation of organs, gluing together cell layers, and providing structure for the organism.","1134":"The extracellular matrix (ECM) serves diverse functions and is a major component of the cellular microenvironment. The ECM is a highly dynamic structure, constantly undergoing a remodeling process where ECM components are deposited, degraded, or otherwise modified. ECM dynamics are indispensible during restructuring of tissue architecture. ECM remodeling is an important mechanism whereby cell differentiation can be regulated, including processes such as the establishment and maintenance of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and wound repair. In contrast, abnormal ECM dynamics lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion, failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of ECM remodeling and its regulation, therefore, is essential for developing new therapeutic interventions for diseases and novel strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","1135":null,"1136":"Maintaining the proteome to preserve the health of an organism in the face of developmental changes, environmental insults, infectious diseases, and rigors of aging is a formidable task. The challenge is magnified by the inheritance of mutations that render individual proteins subject to misfolding and\/or aggregation. Maintenance of the proteome requires the orchestration of protein synthesis, folding, degradation, and trafficking by highly conserved\/deeply integrated cellular networks. In humans, no less than 2000 genes are involved. Stress sensors detect the misfolding and aggregation of proteins in specific organelles and respond by activating stress-responsive signaling pathways. These culminate in transcriptional and posttranscriptional programs that up-regulate the homeostatic mechanisms unique to that organelle. Proteostasis is also strongly influenced by the general properties of protein folding that are intrinsic to every proteome. These include the kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding, misfolding, and aggregation of individual proteins. We examine a growing body of evidence establishing that when cellular proteostasis goes awry, it can be reestablished by deliberate chemical and biological interventions. We start with approaches that employ chemicals or biological agents to enhance the general capacity of the proteostasis network. We then introduce chemical approaches to prevent the misfolding or aggregation of specific proteins through direct binding interactions. We finish with evidence that synergy is achieved with the combination of mechanistically distinct approaches to reestablish organismal proteostasis.","1137":"Integrin-based adhesion has served as a model for studying the central role of adhesion in migration. In this article, we outline modes of migration, both integrin-dependent and -independent in vitro and in vivo. We next discuss the roles of adhesion contacts as signaling centers and linkages between the ECM and actin that allows adhesions to serve as traction sites. This includes signaling complexes that regulate migration and the interplay among adhesion, signaling, and pliability of the substratum. Finally, we address mechanisms of adhesion assembly and disassembly and the role of adhesion in cellular polarity.","1138":"Calcium (Ca(2+)) is a critical regulator of cardiac myocyte function. Principally, Ca(2+) is the link between the electrical signals that pervade the heart and contraction of the myocytes to propel blood. In addition, Ca(2+) controls numerous other myocyte activities, including gene transcription. Cardiac Ca(2+) signaling essentially relies on a few critical molecular players--ryanodine receptors, voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, and Ca(2+) pumps\/transporters. These moieties are responsible for generating Ca(2+) signals upon cellular depolarization, recovery of Ca(2+) signals following cellular contraction, and setting basal conditions. Whereas these are the central players underlying cardiac Ca(2+) fluxes, networks of signaling mechanisms and accessory proteins impart complex regulation on cardiac Ca(2+) signals. Subtle changes in components of the cardiac Ca(2+) signaling machinery, albeit through mutation, disease, or chronic alteration of hemodynamic demand, can have profound consequences for the function and phenotype of myocytes. Here, we discuss mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) signaling in ventricular and atrial myocytes. In particular, we describe the roles and regulation of key participants involved in Ca(2+) signal generation and reversal.","1139":"A variety of secretory cargoes move through the Golgi, but the pathways and mechanisms of this traffic are still being debated. Here, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of five current models for Golgi traffic: (1) anterograde vesicular transport between stable compartments, (2) cisternal progression\/maturation, (3) cisternal progression\/maturation with heterotypic tubular transport, (4) rapid partitioning in a mixed Golgi, and (5) stable compartments as cisternal progenitors. Each model is assessed for its ability to explain a set of key observations encompassing multiple cell types. No single model can easily explain all of the observations from diverse organisms. However, we propose that cisternal progression\/maturation is the best candidate for a conserved core mechanism of Golgi traffic, and that some cells elaborate this core mechanism by means of heterotypic tubular transport between cisternae.","1140":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) uses an elaborate surveillance system called the ER quality control (ERQC) system. The ERQC facilitates folding and modification of secretory and membrane proteins and eliminates terminally misfolded polypeptides through ER-associated degradation (ERAD) or autophagic degradation. This mechanism of ER protein surveillance is closely linked to redox and calcium homeostasis in the ER, whose balance is presumed to be regulated by a specific cellular compartment. The potential to modulate proteostasis and metabolism with chemical compounds or targeted siRNAs may offer an ideal option for the treatment of disease.","1141":"Thrombospondins are evolutionarily conserved, calcium-binding glycoproteins that undergo transient or longer-term interactions with other extracellular matrix components. They share properties with other matrix molecules, cytokines, adaptor proteins, and chaperones, modulate the organization of collagen fibrils, and bind and localize an array of growth factors or proteases. At cell surfaces, interactions with an array of receptors activate cell-dependent signaling and phenotypic outcomes. Through these dynamic, pleiotropic, and context-dependent pathways, mammalian thrombospondins contribute to wound healing and angiogenesis, vessel wall biology, connective tissue organization, and synaptogenesis. We overview the domain organization and structure of thrombospondins, key features of their evolution, and their cell biology. We discuss their roles in vivo, associations with human disease, and ongoing translational applications. In many respects, we are only beginning to appreciate the important roles of these proteins in physiology and pathology.","1142":null,"1143":"The Golgi serves as a hub for intracellular membrane traffic in the eukaryotic cell. Transport within the early secretory pathway, that is within the Golgi and from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, is mediated by COPI-coated vesicles. The COPI coat shares structural features with the clathrin coat, but differs in the mechanisms of cargo sorting and vesicle formation. The small GTPase Arf1 initiates coating on activation and recruits en bloc the stable heptameric protein complex coatomer that resembles the inner and the outer shells of clathrin-coated vesicles. Different binding sites exist in coatomer for membrane machinery and for the sorting of various classes of cargo proteins. During the budding of a COPI vesicle, lipids are sorted to give a liquid-disordered phase composition. For the release of a COPI-coated vesicle, coatomer and Arf cooperate to mediate membrane separation.","1144":"The retina is a highly complex and specialized organ that performs preliminary analysis of visual information. Composed of highly metabolically active tissue, the retina requires a precise and well-balanced means of maintaining its functional activity during extended periods of time. Maintenance and regulation of a vast array of different structural and functional proteins is required for normal function of the retina. This process is referred to as protein homeostasis and involves a variety of activities, including protein synthesis, folding, transport, degradation, elimination, and recycling. Deregulation of any of these activities can lead to malfunctioning of the retina, from subtle subclinical signs to severe retinal degenerative diseases leading to blindness. Examples of retinal degenerative diseases caused by disruption of protein homeostasis include retinitis pigmentosa and Stargardt's disease. A detailed discussion of the role of disruption in protein homeostasis in these and other retinal diseases is presented, followed by examples of some existing and potential treatments.","1145":"According to the \"generic view\" of protein aggregation, the ability to self-assemble into stable and highly organized structures such as amyloid fibrils is not an unusual feature exhibited by a small group of peptides and proteins with special sequence or structural properties, but rather a property shared by most proteins. At the same time, through a wide variety of techniques, many of which were originally devised for applications in other disciplines, it has also been established that the maintenance of proteins in a soluble state is a fundamental aspect of protein homeostasis. Taken together, these advances offer a unified framework for understanding the molecular basis of protein aggregation and for the rational development of therapeutic strategies based on the biological and chemical regulation of protein solubility.","1146":"Despite more than six decades of successful Golgi research, the fundamental question as to how biosynthetic material is transported through the secretory pathway remains unanswered. New technologies such as live cell imaging and correlative microscopy have highlighted the plastic nature of the Golgi, one that is sensitive to perturbation yet highly efficient in regaining both structure and function. Single molecule-microscopy and super resolution-microscopy further adds to this picture. Various models for protein transport have been put forward, each with its own merits and pitfalls but we are far from resolving whether one is more correct than the other. As such, our laboratory considers multiple mechanisms of Golgi transport until proven otherwise. This includes the two classical modes of transport, vesicular transport and cisternal progression\/maturation as well as more recent models such as tubular inter- and intra-cisternal connections (long lasting or transient) and inter-Golgi stack transport. In this article, we focus on an emerging inductive technology, mass spectrometry-based proteomics that has already enabled insight into the relative composition of compartments and subcompartments of the secretory pathway including mechanistic aspects of protein transport. We note that proteomics, as with any other technology, is not a stand-alone technology but one that works best alongside complementary approaches.","1147":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary site for synthesis and folding of secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Proteins are translocated into ER lumen in an unfolded state and require protein chaperones and catalysts of protein folding to assist in proper folding. Properly folded proteins traffic from the ER to the Golgi apparatus; misfolded proteins are targeted to degradation. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly regulated intracellular signaling pathway that prevents accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. UPR provides an adaptive mechanism by which cells can augment protein folding and processing capacities of the ER. If protein misfolding is not resolved, the UPR triggers apoptotic cascades. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying ER stress-induced apoptosis are not completely understood, increasing evidence suggests that ER and mitochondria cooperate to signal cell death. Mitochondria and ER form structural and functional networks (mitochondria-associated ER membranes [MAMs]) essential to maintain cellular homeostasis and determine cell fate under various pathophysiological conditions. Regulated Ca(2+) transfer from the ER to the mitochondria is important in maintaining control of prosurvival\/prodeath pathways. We discuss the signaling\/communication between the ER and mitochondria and focus on the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in these complex processes.","1148":"The function of the Golgi has long been recognized to critically depend on vesicular transport from, to, and within its cisternae, involving constant membrane fission and fusion. These processes are mediated by Arf GTPases and coat proteins, and Rabs, tethers and SNARE proteins, respectively. In this article, we describe structural studies of Golgi coats and tethers and their interactions with SNAREs and GTPases as well as insights regarding membrane traffic processes that these have provided.","1149":"Extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for all stages of angiogenesis. In the adult, angiogenesis begins with endothelial cell (EC) activation, degradation of vascular basement membrane, and vascular sprouting within interstitial matrix. During this sprouting phase, ECM binding to integrins provides critical signaling support for EC proliferation, survival, and migration. ECM also signals the EC cytoskeleton to initiate blood vessel morphogenesis. Dynamic remodeling of ECM, particularly by membrane-type matrix metalloproteases (MT-MMPs), coordinates formation of vascular tubes with lumens and provides guidance tunnels for pericytes that assist ECs in the assembly of vascular basement membrane. ECM also provides a binding scaffold for a variety of cytokines that exert essential signaling functions during angiogenesis. In the embryo, ECM is equally critical for angiogenesis and vessel stabilization, although there are likely important distinctions from the adult because of differences in composition and abundance of specific ECM components.","1150":"Sperm and egg production requires a robust stem cell system that balances self-renewal with differentiation. Self-renewal at the expense of differentiation can cause tumorigenesis, whereas differentiation at the expense of self-renewal can cause germ cell depletion and infertility. In most organisms, and sometimes in both sexes, germline stem cells (GSCs) often reside in a defined anatomical niche. Factors within the niche regulate a balance between GSC self-renewal and differentiation. Asymmetric division of the germline stem cell to form daughter cells with alternative fates is common. The exception to both these tendencies is the mammalian testis where there does not appear to be an obvious anatomical niche and where GSC homeostasis is likely accomplished by a stochastic balance of self-renewal and differentiation and not by regulated asymmetric cell division. Despite these apparent differences, GSCs in all organisms share many common mechanisms, although not necessarily molecules, to guarantee survival of the germline.","1151":"Store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) are a nearly ubiquitous Ca(2+) entry pathway stimulated by numerous cell surface receptors via the reduction of Ca(2+) concentration in the ER. The discovery of STIM proteins as ER Ca(2+) sensors and Orai proteins as structural components of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, a prototypic SOC, opened the floodgates for exploring the molecular mechanism of this pathway and its functions. This review focuses on recent advances made possible by the use of STIM and Orai as molecular tools. I will describe our current understanding of the store-operated Ca(2+) entry mechanism and its emerging roles in physiology and disease, areas of uncertainty in which further progress is needed, and recent findings that are opening new directions for research in this rapidly growing field.","1152":"Changes in the intracellular concentration of calcium ions in neurons are involved in neurite growth, development, and remodeling, regulation of neuronal excitability, increases and decreases in the strength of synaptic connections, and the activation of survival and programmed cell death pathways. An important aspect of the signals that trigger these processes is that they are frequently initiated in the form of glutamatergic neurotransmission within dendritic trees, while their completion involves specific changes in the patterns of genes expressed within neuronal nuclei. Accordingly, two prominent aims of research concerned with calcium signaling in neurons are determination of the mechanisms governing information conveyance between synapse and nucleus, and discovery of the rules dictating translation of specific patterns of inputs into appropriate and specific transcriptional responses. In this article, we present an overview of the avenues by which glutamatergic excitation of dendrites may be communicated to the neuronal nucleus and the primary calcium-dependent signaling pathways by which synaptic activity can invoke changes in neuronal gene expression programs.","1153":"Antero- and retrograde cargo transport through the Golgi requires a series of membrane fusion events. Fusion occurs at the cis- and trans-side and along the rims of the Golgi stack. Four functional SNARE complexes have been identified mediating lipid bilayer merger in the Golgi. Their function is tightly controlled by a series of reactions involving vesicle tethering and SM proteins. This network of protein interactions spatially and temporally determines the specificity of transport vesicle targeting and fusion within the Golgi.","1154":"The Golgi is essential for processing proteins and sorting them, as well as plasma membrane components, to their final destinations. Not surprisingly, this organelle, a major compartment of the secretory pathway, is an important venue for regulating many aspects of development in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Through its role as a site for protein cleavage and glycosylation as well as through changes in its spatial organization and secretory trafficking, the Golgi exerts highly specific effects on cellular differentiation and morphogenesis by spatially and temporally constraining developmental pathways.","1155":"\"Germ granules\" are cytoplasmic, nonmembrane-bound organelles unique to germline. Germ granules share components with the P bodies and stress granules of somatic cells, but also contain proteins and RNAs uniquely required for germ cell development. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of germ granule assembly, dynamics, and function. One hypothesis is that germ granules operate as hubs for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression, a function at the core of the germ cell differentiation program.","1156":"Voltage-gated calcium (Ca(2+)) channels are key transducers of membrane potential changes into intracellular Ca(2+) transients that initiate many physiological events. There are ten members of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel family in mammals, and they serve distinct roles in cellular signal transduction. The Ca(V)1 subfamily initiates contraction, secretion, regulation of gene expression, integration of synaptic input in neurons, and synaptic transmission at ribbon synapses in specialized sensory cells. The Ca(V)2 subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at fast synapses. The Ca(V)3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of action potentials in rhythmically firing cells such as cardiac myocytes and thalamic neurons. This article presents the molecular relationships and physiological functions of these Ca(2+) channel proteins and provides information on their molecular, genetic, physiological, and pharmacological properties.","1157":"Eukaryotic cells must contend with a continuous stream of misfolded proteins that compromise the cellular protein homeostasis balance and jeopardize cell viability. An elaborate network of molecular chaperones and protein degradation factors continually monitor and maintain the integrity of the proteome. Cellular protein quality control relies on three distinct yet interconnected strategies whereby misfolded proteins can either be refolded, degraded, or delivered to distinct quality control compartments that sequester potentially harmful misfolded species. Molecular chaperones play a critical role in determining the fate of misfolded proteins in the cell. Here, we discuss the spatial and temporal organization of cellular quality control strategies and their implications for human diseases linked to protein misfolding and aggregation.","1158":"Animal fertilization is governed by the interaction (binding) of proteins on the surfaces of sperm and egg. In many examples presented herein, fertilization proteins evolve rapidly and show the signature of positive selection (adaptive evolution). This review describes the molecular evolution of fertilization proteins in sea urchins, abalone, and oysters, animals with external fertilization that broadcast their gametes into seawater. Theories regarding the selective forces responsible for the rapid evolution driven by positive selection seen in many fertilization proteins are discussed. This strong selection acting on divergence of interacting fertilization proteins might lead to prezygotic reproductive isolation and be a significant factor in the speciation process. Since only a fraction of all eggs are fertilized and only an infinitesimal fraction of male gametes succeed in fertilizing an egg, gametes are obviously a category of entities subjected to intense selection. It is curious that this is never mentioned in the literature dealing with selection, perhaps because we know so little about fitness differences among gametes. (Ernst Mayr, 1997).","1159":"The sex chromosomes play a highly specialized role in germ cell development in mammals, being enriched in genes expressed in the testis and ovary. Sex chromosome abnormalities (e.g., Klinefelter [XXY] and Turner [XO] syndrome) constitute the largest class of chromosome abnormalities and the commonest genetic cause of infertility in humans. Understanding how sex-gene expression is regulated is therefore critical to our understanding of human reproduction. Here, we describe how the expression of sex-linked genes varies during germ cell development; in females, the inactive X chromosome is reactivated before meiosis, whereas in males the X and Y chromosomes are inactivated at this stage. We discuss the epigenetics of sex chromosome inactivation and how this process has influenced the gene content of the mammalian X and Y chromosomes. We also present working models for how perturbations in sex chromosome inactivation or reactivation result in subfertility in the major classes of sex chromosome abnormalities.","1160":"The development of the nervous system involves the generation of a stunningly diverse array of neuronal subtypes that enable complex information processing and behavioral outputs. Deciphering how the nervous system acquires and interprets information and orchestrates behaviors will be greatly enhanced by the identification of distinct neuronal circuits and by an understanding of how these circuits are formed, changed, and\/or maintained over time. Addressing these challenging questions depends in part on the ability to accurately identify and characterize the unique neuronal subtypes that comprise individual circuits. Distinguishing characteristics of neuronal subgroups include but are not limited to neurotransmitter phenotype, dendritic morphology, the identity of synaptic partners, and the expression of constellations of subgroup-specific proteins, including ion channel subtypes.","1161":"Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) are central to the function of smooth muscle, which lines the walls of all hollow organs. These changes take a variety of forms, from sustained, cell-wide increases to temporally varying, localized changes. The nature of the Ca(2+) signal is a reflection of the source of Ca(2+) (extracellular or intracellular) and the molecular entity responsible for generating it. Depending on the specific channel involved and the detection technology employed, extracellular Ca(2+) entry may be detected optically as graded elevations in intracellular Ca(2+), junctional Ca(2+) transients, Ca(2+) flashes, or Ca(2+) sparklets, whereas release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores may manifest as Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) puffs, or Ca(2+) waves. These diverse Ca(2+) signals collectively regulate a variety of functions. Some functions, such as contractility, are unique to smooth muscle; others are common to other excitable cells (e.g., modulation of membrane potential) and nonexcitable cells (e.g., regulation of gene expression).","1162":"Production of functional eggs requires meiosis to be coordinated with developmental signals. Oocytes arrest in prophase I to permit oocyte differentiation, and in most animals, a second meiotic arrest links completion of meiosis to fertilization. Comparison of oocyte maturation and egg activation between mammals, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila reveal conserved signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms as well as unique adaptations for reproductive strategies. Recent studies in mammals and C. elegans show the role of signaling between surrounding somatic cells and the oocyte in maintaining the prophase I arrest and controlling maturation. Proteins that regulate levels of active Cdk1\/cyclin B during prophase I arrest have been identified in Drosophila. Protein kinases play crucial roles in the transition from meiosis in the oocyte to mitotic embryonic divisions in C. elegans and Drosophila. Here we will contrast the regulation of key meiotic events in oocytes.","1163":"The Golgi factory receives custom glycosylates and dispatches its cargo to the correct cellular locations. The process requires importing donor substrates, moving the cargo, and recycling machinery. Correctly glycosylated cargo reflects the Golgi's quality and efficiency. Genetic disorders in the specific equipment (enzymes), donors (nucleotide sugar transporters), or equipment recycling\/reorganization components (COG, SEC, golgins) can all affect glycosylation. Dozens of human glycosylation disorders fit these categories. Many other genes, with or without familiar names, well-annotated pedigrees, or likely homologies will join the ranks of glycosylation disorders. Their broad and unpredictable case-by-case phenotypes cross the traditional medical specialty boundaries. The gene functions in patients may be elusive, but their common feature may include altered glycosylation that provide clues to Golgi function. This article focuses on a group of human disorders that affect protein or lipid glycosylation. Readers may find it useful to generalize some of these patient-based, translational observations to their own research.","1164":"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are found at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, where they interact with a plethora of ligands. Over the last decade, new insights have emerged regarding the mechanism and biological significance of these interactions. Here, we discuss changing views on the specificity of protein-heparan sulfate binding and the activity of HSPGs as receptors and coreceptors. Although few in number, heparan sulfate proteoglycans have profound effects at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level.","1165":"The Golgi is an essential membrane-bound organelle in the secretary pathway of eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, the Golgi stacks are integrated into a continuous perinuclear ribbon, which poses a challenge for the daughter cells to inherit this membrane organelle during cell division. To facilitate proper partitioning, the mammalian Golgi ribbon is disassembled into vesicles in early mitosis. Following segregation into the daughter cells, a functional Golgi is reformed. Here we summarize our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control the mitotic Golgi disassembly and postmitotic reassembly cycle in mammalian cells.","1166":"Translational control of specific mRNAs is a widespread mechanism of gene regulation, and it is especially important in pattern formation in the oocytes of organisms in which the embryonic axes are established maternally. Drosophila and Xenopus have been especially valuable in elucidating the relevant molecular mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively review what is known about translational control in these two systems, focusing on examples that illustrate key concepts that have emerged. We focus on protein-mediated translational control, rather than regulation mediated by small RNAs, as the former appears to be predominant in controlling these developmental events. Mechanisms that modulate the ability of the specific mRNAs to be recruited to the ribosome, that regulate polyadenylation of specific mRNAs, or that control the association of particular mRNAs into translationally inert ribonucleoprotein complexes will all be discussed.","1167":"Biological research has always tremendously benefited from the development of key methodology. In fact, it was the advent of microscopy that shaped our understanding of cells as the fundamental units of life. Microscopic techniques are still central to the elucidation of biological units and processes, but equally important are methods that allow access to the dimension of time, to investigate the dynamics of molecular functions and interactions. Here, fluorescence spectroscopy with its sensitivity to access the single-molecule level, and its large temporal resolution, has been opening up fully new perspectives for cell biology. Here we summarize the key fluorescent techniques used to study cellular dynamics, with the focus on lipid and membrane systems.","1168":"Stable intercellular bridges are a conserved feature of gametogenesis in multicellular animals observed more than 100 years ago, but their function was unknown. Many of the components necessary for this structure have been identified through the study of cytokinesis in Drosophila; however, mammalian intercellular bridges have distinct properties from those of insects. Mammalian germ cell intercellular bridges are composed of general cytokinesis components with additional germ cell-specific factors including TEX14. TEX14 is an inactive kinase essential for the maintenance of stable intercellular bridges in gametes of both sexes but whose loss specifically impairs male meiosis. TEX14 acts to impede the terminal steps of abscission by competing for essential component CEP55, blocking its interaction in nongerm cells with ALIX and TSG101. Additionally, TEX14-interacting protein RBM44, whose localization in stabile intercellular bridges is limited to pachytene and secondary spermatocytes, may participate in processes such as RNA transport but is nonessential to the maintenance of intercellular bridge stability.","1169":"Small noncoding RNAs have emerged as potent regulators of gene expression, especially in the germline. We review the biogenesis and regulatory function of three major small noncoding RNA pathways in the germline: The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway that leads to the degradation of target mRNAs, the microRNA (miRNA) pathway that mostly represses the translation of target mRNAs, and the newly discovered Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway that appears to have diverse functions in epigenetic programming, transposon silencing, and the regulation of mRNA translation and stability. The siRNA and miRNA pathways are present in the germline as well as many somatic tissues, whereas the piRNA pathway is predominantly confined to the germline. Investigation of the three small RNA pathways has started to reveal a new dimension of gene regulation with defining roles in germline specification and development.","1170":"The Golgi is an ancient and fundamental eukaryotic organelle. Evolutionary cell biological studies have begun establishing the repertoire, processes, and level of complexity of membrane-trafficking machinery present in early eukaryotic cells. This article serves as a review of the literature on the topic of Golgi evolution and diversity and reports a novel comparative genomic survey addressing Golgi machinery in the widest taxonomic diversity of eukaryotes sampled to date. Finally, the article is meant to serve as a primer on the rationale and design of evolutionary cell biological studies, hopefully encouraging readers to consider this approach as an addition to their cell biological toolbox. It is clear that the major machinery involved in vesicle trafficking to and from the Golgi was already in place by the time of the divergence of the major eukaryotic lineages, nearly 2 billion years ago. Much of this complexity was likely generated by an evolutionary process involving gene duplication and coevolution of specificity encoding membrane-trafficking proteins. There have also been clear cases of loss of Golgi machinery in some lineages as well as innovation of novel machinery. The Golgi is a wonderfully complex and diverse organelle and its continued exploration promises insight into the evolutionary history of the eukaryotic cell.","1171":"Morphological plasticity of biological membrane is critical for cellular life, as cells need to quickly rearrange their membranes. Yet, these rearrangements are constrained in two ways. First, membrane transformations may not lead to undesirable mixing of, or leakage from, the participating cellular compartments. Second, membrane systems should be metastable at large length scales, ensuring the correct function of the particular organelle and its turnover during cellular division. Lipids, through their ability to exist with many shapes (polymorphism), provide an adequate construction material for cellular membranes. They can self-assemble into shells that are very flexible, albeit hardly stretchable, which allows for their far-reaching morphological and topological behaviors. In this article, we will discuss the importance of lipid polymorphisms in the shaping of membranes and its role in controlling cellular membrane morphology.","1172":"A major step in the journey from germline stem cell to differentiated gamete is the decision to leave the mitotic cell cycle and begin progression through the meiotic cell cycle. Over the past decade, molecular regulators of the mitosis\/meiosis decision have been discovered in most of the major model multicellular organisms. Historically, the mitosis\/meiosis decision has been closely linked with controls of germline self-renewal and the sperm\/egg decision, especially in nematodes and mice. Molecular explanations of those linkages clarify our understanding of this fundamental germ cell decision, and unifying themes have begun to emerge. Although the complete circuitry of the decision is not known in any organism, the recent advances promise to impact key issues in human reproduction and agriculture.","1173":"Genetically engineered mice are critical experimental models for the study of breast cancer biology. Transgenic mice, employing strong mammary epithelial promoters to drive oncogenes, develop carcinomas with phenotypes corresponding to the molecular pathway activated. Gene-targeted (knockout) mice, in which tumor suppressors are deleted, develop mammary neoplasms with phenotypes primarily including patterns seen in spontaneous mouse mammary tumors, albeit at higher rates. Improved genetic engineering, using inducible gene expression, somatic gene transduction, conditional alleles, and crossbreeding for combined\/compound genetic engineering yields precise molecular models with exquisite experimental control and phenotypes with comparative pathologic validity. Mammary gland transplantation technology adds a practical and validated method for assessing biologic behavior of selected mammary tissues. Overall, the many mouse models available are a rich resource for experimental biology with phenocopies of breast cancer subtypes, and a variety of practical advantages. The challenge is matching the model to the experimental question.","1174":"The coordinated and physiological behavior of living cells in an organism critically depends on their ability to interact with surrounding cells and with the extracellular space. For this, cells have to interpret incoming stimuli, correctly process the signals, and produce meaningful responses. A major part of such signaling mechanisms is the translation of incoming stimuli into intracellularly understandable signals, usually represented by second messengers or second-messenger systems. Two key second messengers, namely the calcium ion and signaling lipids, albeit extremely different in nature, play an important and often synergistic role in such signaling cascades. In this report, we will shed some light on an entire family of protein kinases, the protein kinases C, that are perfectly designed to exactly decode these two second messengers in all of their properties and convey the signaling content to downstream processes within the cell.","1175":"Viruses intricately interact with and modulate cellular membranes at several stages of their replication, but much less is known about the role of viral lipids compared to proteins and nucleic acids. All animal viruses have to cross membranes for cell entry and exit, which occurs by membrane fusion (in enveloped viruses), by transient local disruption of membrane integrity, or by cell lysis. Furthermore, many viruses interact with cellular membrane compartments during their replication and often induce cytoplasmic membrane structures, in which genome replication and assembly occurs. Recent studies revealed details of membrane interaction, membrane bending, fission, and fusion for a number of viruses and unraveled the lipid composition of raft-dependent and -independent viruses. Alterations of membrane lipid composition can block viral release and entry, and certain lipids act as fusion inhibitors, suggesting a potential as antiviral drugs. Here, we review viral interactions with cellular membranes important for virus entry, cytoplasmic genome replication, and virus egress.","1176":"A decline in mitochondrial activity has been associated with aging and is a hallmark of many neurological diseases. Surveillance mechanisms acting at the molecular, organellar, and cellular level monitor mitochondrial integrity and ensure the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis. Here we will review the central role of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases, the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome system, and the mitochondrial unfolded response in this interconnected quality control network, highlighting the dual function of some proteases in protein quality control within the organelle and for the regulation of mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy.","1177":"Cell membranes are composed of a lipid bilayer, containing proteins that span the bilayer and\/or interact with the lipids on either side of the two leaflets. Although recent advances in lipid analytics show that membranes in eukaryotic cells contain hundreds of different lipid species, the function of this lipid diversity remains enigmatic. The basic structure of cell membranes is the lipid bilayer, composed of two apposing leaflets, forming a two-dimensional liquid with fascinating properties designed to perform the functions cells require. To coordinate these functions, the bilayer has evolved the propensity to segregate its constituents laterally. This capability is based on dynamic liquid-liquid immiscibility and underlies the raft concept of membrane subcompartmentalization. This principle combines the potential for sphingolipid-cholesterol self-assembly with protein specificity to focus and regulate membrane bioactivity. Here we will review the emerging principles of membrane architecture with special emphasis on lipid organization and domain formation.","1178":"Ever since it was discovered that biological membranes have a core of a bimolecular sheet of lipid molecules, lipid bilayers have been a model laboratory for investigating physicochemical and functional properties of biological membranes. Experimental and theoretical models help the experimental scientist to plan experiments and interpret data. Theoretical models are the theoretical scientist's preferred toys to make contact between membrane theory and experiments. Most importantly, models serve to shape our intuition about which membrane questions are the more fundamental and relevant ones to pursue. Here we review some membrane models for lipid self-assembly, monolayers, bilayers, liposomes, and lipid-protein interactions and illustrate how such models can help answering questions in modern lipid cell biology.","1179":"Despite their compositional complexity, lipidomes comprise a large number of isobaric species that cannot be distinguished by conventional low resolution mass spectrometry and therefore in-depth MS\/MS analysis was required for their accurate quantification. Here we argue that the progress in high resolution mass spectrometry is changing the concept of lipidome characterization. Because exact masses of isobaric species belonging to different lipid classes are not necessarily identical, they can now be distinguished and directly quantified in total lipid extracts. By streamlining and simplifying the molecular characterization of lipidomes, high resolution mass spectrometry has developed into a generic tool for cell biology and molecular medicine.","1180":"Inositol phospholipids have been implicated in almost all aspects of cellular physiology including spatiotemporal regulation of cellular signaling, acquisition of cellular polarity, specification of membrane identity, cytoskeletal dynamics, and regulation of cellular adhesion, motility, and cytokinesis. In this review, we examine the critical role phosphoinositides play in these processes to execute the establishment and maintenance of cellular architecture. Epithelial tissues perform essential barrier and transport functions in almost all major organs. Key to their development and function is the establishment of epithelial cell polarity. We place a special emphasis on highlighting recent studies demonstrating phosphoinositide regulation of epithelial cell polarity and how individual cells use phosphoinositides to further organize into epithelial tissues.","1181":null,"1182":"Fibronectin (FN) is a multidomain protein with the ability to bind simultaneously to cell surface receptors, collagen, proteoglycans, and other FN molecules. Many of these domains and interactions are also involved in the assembly of FN dimers into a multimeric fibrillar matrix. When, where, and how FN binds to its various partners must be controlled and coordinated during fibrillogenesis. Steps in the process of FN fibrillogenesis including FN self-association, receptor activities, and intracellular pathways have been under intense investigation for years. In this review, the domain organization of FN including the extra domains and variable region that are controlled by alternative splicing are described. We discuss how FN-FN and cell-FN interactions play essential roles in the initiation and progression of matrix assembly using complementary results from cell culture and embryonic model systems that have enhanced our understanding of this process.","1183":"Receptor-mediated endocytosis is used by a number of viruses and toxins to gain entry into cells. Some have evolved to use specific lipids in the plasma membrane as their receptors. They include bacterial toxins such as Shiga and Cholera toxin and viruses such as mouse polyoma virus and simian virus 40. Through multivalent binding to glycosphingolipids, they induce lipid clustering and changes in membrane properties. Internalization occurs by unusual endocytic mechanisms involving lipid rafts, induction of membrane curvature, trans-bilayer coupling, and activation of signaling pathways. Once delivered to early endosomes, they follow diverse intracellular routes to the lumen of the ER, from which they penetrate into the cytosol. The role of the lipid receptors is central in these well-studied processes.","1184":null,"1185":"Spermatogenesis is a complex and ordered differentiation process in which the spermatogonial stem cell population gives rise to primary spermatocytes that undergo two successive meiotic divisions followed by a major biochemical and structural reorganization of the haploid cells to generate mature elongate spermatids. The transcriptional regulatory programs that orchestrate this process have been intensively studied in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and mouse. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified the factors involved and revealed mechanisms of action that are unique to male germ cells. In a well-studied example, cofactors and pathways distinct from those used in somatic tissues mediate the action of CREM in male germ cells. But perhaps the most striking feature concerns the paralogs of somatically expressed transcription factors and of components of the general transcription machinery that act in distinct regulatory mechanisms in both Drosophila and murine spermatogenesis.","1186":"We review experiments in which somatic cell nuclei are transplanted singly to enucleated eggs (metaphase II) in amphibia and mammals and as multiple nuclei to the germinal vesicle of amphibian oocytes (prophase I). These experiments have shown the totipotency of some somatic cell nuclei, as well as switches in cell type and changes in gene expression. Abnormalities of nuclear transplant embryo development increase greatly as nuclei are taken from progressively more differentiated donor cells. The molecular changes that accompany the reprogramming of transplanted nuclei help to indicate the mechanisms used by eggs and oocytes to reprogram gene expression. We discuss the importance of chromosomal protein exchange, of transcription factor supply, and of chromatin access in reprogramming.","1187":"The combination of carbohydrate and lipid generates unusual molecules in which the two distinctive halves of the glycoconjugate influence the function of each other. Membrane glycolipids can act as primary receptors for carbohydrate binding proteins to mediate transmembrane signaling despite restriction to the outer bilayer leaflet. The extensive heterogeneity of the lipid moiety plays a significant, but still largely unknown, role in glycosphingolipid function. Potential interplay between glycolipids and their fatty acid isoforms, together with their preferential interaction with cholesterol, generates a complex mechanism for the regulation of their function in cellular physiology.","1188":"Activity-dependent plasticity of vertebrate neurons allows the brain to respond to its environment. During brain development, both spontaneous and sensory-driven neural activity are essential for instructively guiding the process of synapse development. These effects of neuronal activity are transduced in part through the concerted regulation of a set of activity-dependent transcription factors that coordinate a program of gene expression required for the formation and maturation of synapses. Here we review the cellular signaling networks that regulate the activity of transcription factors during brain development and discuss the functional roles of specific activity-regulated transcription factors in specific stages of synapse formation, refinement, and maturation. Interestingly, a number of neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to abnormalities in activity-regulated transcriptional pathways, indicating that these signaling networks are critical for cognitive development and function.","1189":"Our concept of biological membranes has markedly changed, from the fluid mosaic model to the current model that lipids and proteins have the ability to separate into microdomains, differing in their protein and lipid compositions. Since the breakthrough in crystallizing membrane proteins, the most powerful method to define lipid-binding sites on proteins has been X-ray and electron crystallography. More recently, chemical biology approaches have been developed to analyze protein-lipid interactions. Such methods have the advantage of providing highly specific cellular probes. With the advent of novel tools to study functions of individual lipid species in membranes together with structural analysis and simulations at the atomistic resolution, a growing number of specific protein-lipid complexes are defined and their functions explored. In the present article, we discuss the various modes of intramembrane protein-lipid interactions in cellular membranes, including examples for both annular and nonannular bound lipids. Furthermore, we will discuss possible functional roles of such specific protein-lipid interactions as well as roles of lipids as chaperones in protein folding and transport.","1190":"Organisms survive changes in the environment by altering their rates of metabolism, growth, and reproduction. At the same time, the system must ensure the stability and functionality of its macromolecules. Fluctuations in the environment are sensed by highly conserved stress responses and homeostatic mechanisms, and of these, the heat shock response (HSR) represents an essential response to acute and chronic proteotoxic damage. However, unlike the strategies employed to maintain the integrity of the genome, protection of the proteome must be tailored to accommodate the normal flux of nonnative proteins and the differences in protein composition between cells, and among individuals. Moreover, adult cells are likely to have significant differences in the rates of synthesis and clearance that are influenced by intrinsic errors in protein expression, genetic polymorphisms, and fluctuations in physiological and environmental conditions. Here, we will address how protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is achieved at the level of the cell and organism, and how the threshold of the stress response is set to detect and combat protein misfolding. For metazoans, the requirement for coordinated function and growth imposes additional constraints on the detection, signaling, and response to misfolding, and requires that the HSR is integrated into various aspects of organismal physiology, such as lifespan. This is achieved by hierarchical regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) by the metabolic state of the cell and centralized neuronal control that could allow optimal resource allocation between cells and tissues. We will examine how protein folding quality control mechanisms in individual cells may be integrated into a multicellular level of control, and further, even custom-designed to support individual variability and impose additional constraints on evolutionary adaptation.","1191":"Despite more than 3 billion years since the origin of life on earth, the powerful forces of biological evolution seem to have failed to generate any living cell that is devoid of a dense and complex array of cell surface glycans. Thus, cell surface glycans seem to be as essential for life as having a DNA genetic code, diverse RNAs, structural\/functional proteins, lipid-based membranes, and metabolites that mediate energy flux and signaling. The likely reasons for this apparently universal law of biology are considered here, and include the fact that glycans have the greatest potential for generating diversity, and thus evading recognition by pathogens. This may also explain why in striking contrast to the genetic code, glycans show widely divergent patterns between taxa. On the other hand, glycans have also been coopted for myriad intrinsic functions, which can vary in their importance for organismal survival. In keeping with these considerations, a significant percentage of the genes in the typical genome are dedicated to the generation and\/or turnover of glycans. Among eukaryotes, the Golgi is the subcellular organelle that serves to generate much of the diversity of cell surface glycans, carrying out various glycan modifications of glycoconjugates that transit through the Golgi, en route to the cell surface or extracellular destinations. Here I present an overview of general considerations regarding the selective forces shaping evolution of the Golgi glycosylation machinery, and then briefly discuss the common types of variations seen in each major class of glycans, finally focusing on sialic acids as an extreme example of evolutionary glycan diversity generated by the Golgi. Future studies need to address both the phylogenetic diversity the Golgi and the molecular mechanisms for its rapid responses to intrinsic and environmental stimuli.","1192":"The protein composition of the Golgi is intimately linked to its structure and function. As the Golgi serves as the major protein-sorting hub for the secretory pathway, it faces the unique challenge of maintaining its protein composition in the face of constant influx and efflux of transient cargo proteins. Much of our understanding of how proteins are retained in the Golgi has come from studies on glycosylation enzymes, largely because of the compartment-specific distributions these proteins display. From these and other studies of Golgi membrane proteins, we now understand that a variety of retention mechanisms are employed, the majority of which involve the dynamic process of iterative rounds of retrograde and anterograde transport. Such mechanisms rely on protein conformation and amino acid-based sorting signals as well as on properties of transmembrane domains and their relationship with the unique lipid composition of the Golgi.","1193":null,"1194":"In mammals, intracellular levels of cholesterol and fatty acids are controlled through a feedback regulatory system mediated by a family of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). SREBPs are synthesized as inactive precursors bound to membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. When cells are deprived of cholesterol and fatty acids, NH(2)-terminal fragments of SREBPs become proteolytically released from membranes and migrate to the nucleus to activate transcription of genes required for lipid synthesis and uptake. Conversely, lipid repletion inhibits proteolytic processing of SREBPs and thereby suppresses lipid accumulation. We review here studies in cultured cells that reveal the mechanism for regulation of SREBP proteolytic activation, and those in animal models in which SREBP proteolysis has been either activated or inhibited to show the essential role of SREBPs in regulating hepatic lipid homeostasis.","1195":"Lysosomal lipid storage diseases, or lipidoses, are inherited metabolic disorders in which typically lipids accumulate in cells and tissues. Complex lipids, such as glycosphingolipids, are constitutively degraded within the endolysosomal system by soluble hydrolytic enzymes with the help of lipid binding proteins in a sequential manner. Because of a functionally impaired hydrolase or auxiliary protein, their lipid substrates cannot be degraded, accumulate in the lysosome, and slowly spread to other intracellular membranes. In Niemann-Pick type C disease, cholesterol transport is impaired and unesterified cholesterol accumulates in the late endosome. In most lysosomal lipid storage diseases, the accumulation of one or few lipids leads to the coprecipitation of other hydrophobic substances in the endolysosomal system, such as lipids and proteins, causing a \"traffic jam.\" This can impair lysosomal function, such as delivery of nutrients through the endolysosomal system, leading to a state of cellular starvation. Therapeutic approaches are currently restricted to mild forms of diseases with significant residual catabolic activities and without brain involvement.","1196":"Since its first visualization in 1898, the Golgi has been a topic of intense morphological research. A typical mammalian Golgi consists of a pile of stapled cisternae, the Golgi stack, which is a key station for modification of newly synthesized proteins and lipids. Distinct stacks are interconnected by tubules to form the Golgi ribbon. At the entrance site of the Golgi, the cis-Golgi, vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) form the intermediate between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi stack. At the exit site of the Golgi, the trans-Golgi, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is the major site of sorting proteins to distinct cellular locations. Golgi functioning can only be understood in light of its complex architecture, as was revealed by a range of distinct electron microscopy (EM) approaches. In this article, a general concept of mammalian Golgi architecture, including VTCs and the TGN, is described.","1197":"Vesicular transport of protein and lipid cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cis-Golgi compartments depends on coat protein complexes, Rab GTPases, tethering factors, and membrane fusion catalysts. ER-derived vesicles deliver cargo to an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) that then fuses with and\/or matures into cis-Golgi compartments. The forward transport pathway to cis-Golgi compartments is balanced by a retrograde directed pathway that recycles transport machinery back to the ER. How trafficking through the ERGIC and cis-Golgi is coordinated to maintain organelle structure and function is poorly understood and highlights central questions regarding trafficking routes and organization of the early secretory pathway.","1198":"Eukaryotic cells can synthesize thousands of different lipid molecules that are incorporated into their membranes. This involves the activity of hundreds of enzymes with the task of creating lipid diversity. In addition, there are several, typically redundant, mechanisms to transport lipids from their site of synthesis to other cellular membranes. Biosynthetic lipid transport helps to ensure that each cellular compartment will have its characteristic lipid composition that supports the functions of the associated proteins. In this article, we provide an overview of the biosynthesis of the major lipid constituents of cell membranes, that is, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols, and discuss the mechanisms by which these newly synthesized lipids are delivered to their target membranes.","1199":"Sterols and sphingolipids are considered mainly eukaryotic lipids even though both are present in some prokaryotes, with sphingolipids being more widespread than sterols. Both sterols and sphingolipids differ in their structural features in vertebrates, plants, and fungi. Interestingly, some invertebrates cannot synthesize sterols de novo and seem to have a reduced dependence on sterols. Sphingolipids and sterols are found in the plasma membrane, but we do not have a clear picture of their precise intracellular localization. Advances in lipidomics and subcellular fractionation should help to improve this situation. Genetic approaches have provided insights into the diversity of sterol and sphingolipid functions in eukaryotes providing evidence that these two lipid classes function together. Intermediates in sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation are involved in signaling pathways, whereas sterol structures are converted to hormones. Both lipids have been implicated in regulating membrane trafficking.","1200":"The protein processing and trafficking function of the Golgi is intimately linked to multiple intracellular signaling pathways. Assembly of Golgi trafficking structures and lipid sorting at the Golgi complex is controlled and coordinated by specific phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases. The intra-Golgi transport machinery is also regulated by kinases belonging to several functionally distinct families, for example, MAP kinase signaling is required for mitotic disassembly of the Golgi. However, the Golgi plays an additional, prominent role in compartmentalizing other signaling cascades that originate at the plasma membrane or at other organelles. This article summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the signaling network that converges at the Golgi.","1201":"The CRISPR\/Cas system in prokaryotes provides resistance against invading viruses and plasmids. Three distinct stages in the mechanism can be recognized. Initially, fragments of invader DNA are integrated as new spacers into the repetitive CRISPR locus. Subsequently, the CRISPR is transcribed and the transcript is cleaved by a Cas protein within the repeats, generating short RNAs (crRNAs) that contain the spacer sequence. Finally, crRNAs guide the Cas protein machinery to a complementary invader target, either DNA or RNA, resulting in inhibition of virus or plasmid proliferation. In this article, we discuss our current understanding of this fascinating adaptive and heritable defense system, and describe functional similarities and differences with RNAi in eukaryotes.","1202":"In most eukaryotes, histone and DNA modifications are responsible for the silencing of genes integrated in heterochromatic sequences, as well as the silencing of pericentromeric repeats and transposable elements themselves. But the mechanisms that guide these modifications to heterochromatin during the cell cycle have been elusive. RNA interference takes advantage of heterochromatic transcription to process small RNAs and recruit enzymes required for both histone and DNA modifications, and is one such mechanism that has been identified. The processes are best understood in fission yeast and plants, but recent work in mammalian cells, especially in the germline, suggests these mechanisms may be highly conserved.","1203":"The various splice variants of the three SERCA- and the two SPCA-pump genes in higher vertebrates encode P-type ATPases of the P(2A) group found respectively in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the secretory pathway. Of these, SERCA2b and SPCA1a represent the housekeeping isoforms. The SERCA2b form is characterized by a luminal carboxy terminus imposing a higher affinity for cytosolic Ca(2+) compared to the other SERCAs. This is mediated by intramembrane and luminal interactions of this extension with the pump. Other known affinity modulators like phospholamban and sarcolipin decrease the affinity for Ca(2+). The number of proteins reported to interact with SERCA is rapidly growing. Here, we limit the discussion to those for which the interaction site with the ATPase is specified: HAX-1, calumenin, histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein, and indirectly calreticulin, calnexin, and ERp57. The role of the phylogenetically older and structurally simpler SPCAs as transporters of Ca(2+), but also of Mn(2+), is also addressed.","1204":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an intracellular Ca(2+) store not only sets up cytosolic Ca(2+) signals, but, among other functions, also assembles and folds newly synthesized proteins. Alterations in ER homeostasis, including severe Ca(2+) depletion, are an upstream event in the pathophysiology of many diseases. On the one hand, insufficient release of activator Ca(2+) may no longer sustain essential cell functions. On the other hand, loss of luminal Ca(2+) causes ER stress and activates an unfolded protein response, which, depending on the duration and severity of the stress, can reestablish normal ER function or lead to cell death. We will review these various diseases by mainly focusing on the mechanisms that cause ER Ca(2+) depletion.","1205":"Aging cells accumulate damaged and misfolded proteins through a functional decline in their protein homeostasis (proteostasis) machinery, leading to reduced cellular viability and the development of protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's. Metabolic signaling pathways that regulate the aging process, mediated by insulin\/IGF-1 signaling, dietary restriction, and reduced mitochondrial function, can modulate the proteostasis machinery in many ways to maintain a youthful proteome for longer and prevent the onset of age-associated diseases. These mechanisms therefore represent potential therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of such pathologies.","1206":"Cell membranes show complex behavior, in part because of the large number of different components that interact with each other in different ways. One aspect of this complex behavior is lateral organization of components on a range of spatial scales. We found that lipid-only mixtures can model the range of size scales, from approximately 2 nm up to microns. Furthermore, the size of compositional heterogeneities can be controlled entirely by lipid composition for mixtures such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)\/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)\/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)\/cholesterol or sphingomyelin (SM)\/DOPC\/POPC\/cholesterol. In one region of special interest, because of its connection to cell membrane rafts, nanometer-scale domains of liquid-disordered phase and liquid-ordered phase coexist over a wide range of compositions.","1207":"In this article, we provide an overview of lipid simulations, describing how a computer can be used as a laboratory for lipid research. We briefly discuss the methodology of lipid simulations followed by a number of topical applications that show the benefit of computer modeling for complementing experiments. In particular, we show examples of cases in which simulations have made predictions of novel phenomena that have later been confirmed by experimental studies. Overall, the applications discussed in this article focus on the most recent state of the art and aim to provide a perspective of where the field of lipid simulations stands at the moment.","1208":"Tenascins are a family of extracellular matrix proteins that evolved in early chordates. There are four family members: tenascin-X, tenascin-R, tenascin-W, and tenascin-C. Tenascin-X associates with type I collagen, and its absence can cause Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. In contrast, tenascin-R is concentrated in perineuronal nets. The expression of tenascin-C and tenascin-W is developmentally regulated, and both are expressed during disease (e.g., both are associated with cancer stroma and tumor blood vessels). In addition, tenascin-C is highly induced by infections and inflammation. Accordingly, the tenascin-C knockout mouse has a reduced inflammatory response. All tenascins have the potential to modify cell adhesion either directly or through interaction with fibronectin, and cell-tenascin interactions typically lead to increased cell motility. In the case of tenascin-C, there is a correlation between elevated expression and increased metastasis in several types of tumors.","1209":"Cell adhesions mediate important bidirectional interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. They provide an interactive interface between the extracellular chemical and physical environment and the cellular scaffolding and signaling machinery. This dynamic, reciprocal regulation of intracellular processes and the matrix is mediated by membrane receptors such as the integrins, as well as many other components that comprise the adhesome. Adhesome constituents assemble themselves into different types of cell adhesion structures that vary in molecular complexity and change over time. These cell adhesions play crucial roles in cell migration, proliferation, and determination of cell fate.","1210":"Mammalian skin comprises a multi-layered epithelium, the epidermis, and an underlying connective tissue, the dermis. The epidermal extracellular matrix is a basement membrane, whereas the dermal ECM comprises fibrillar collagens and associated proteins. There is considerable heterogeneity in ECM composition within both epidermis and dermis. The functional significance of this extends beyond cell adhesion to a range of cell autonomous and nonautonomous processes, including control of epidermal stem cell fate. In skin, cell-ECM interactions influence normal homeostasis, aging, wound healing, and disease. Disturbed integrin and ECM signaling contributes to both tumor formation and fibrosis. Strategies for manipulating cell-ECM interactions to repair skin defects and intervene in a variety of skin diseases hold promise for the future.","1211":"Glycosylation is a very common modification of protein and lipid, and most glycosylation reactions occur in the Golgi. Although the transfer of initial sugar(s) to glycoproteins or glycolipids occurs in the ER or on the ER membrane, the subsequent addition of the many different sugars that make up a mature glycan is accomplished in the Golgi. Golgi membranes are studded with glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters arrayed in a generally ordered manner from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), such that each activity is able to act on specific substrate(s) generated earlier in the pathway. The spectrum of glycosyltransferases and other activities that effect glycosylation may vary with cell type, and thus the final complement of glycans on glycoconjugates is variable. In addition, glycan synthesis is affected by Golgi pH, the integrity of Golgi peripheral membrane proteins, growth factor signaling, Golgi membrane dynamics, and cellular stress. Knowledge of Golgi glycosylation has fostered the development of assays to identify mechanisms of intracellular vesicular trafficking and facilitated glycosylation engineering of recombinant glycoproteins.","1212":"Classical secretion consists of the delivery of transmembrane and soluble proteins to the plasma membrane and the extracellular medium, respectively, and is mediated by the organelles of the secretory pathway, the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), the ER exit sites, and the Golgi, as described by the Nobel Prize winner George Palade (Palade 1975). At the center of this transport route, the Golgi stack has a major role in modifying, processing, sorting, and dispatching newly synthesized proteins to their final destinations. More recently, however, it has become clear that an increasing number of transmembrane proteins reach the plasma membrane unconventionally, either by exiting the ER in non-COPII vesicles or by bypassing the Golgi. Here, we discuss the evidence for Golgi bypass and the possible physiological benefits of it. Intriguingly, at least during Drosophila development, Golgi bypass seems to be mediated by a Golgi protein, dGRASP, which is found ectopically localized to the plasma membrane.","1213":"Metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1 (mGluR1s) are required for a normal function of the mammalian brain. They are particularly important for synaptic signaling and plasticity in the cerebellum. Unlike ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate rapid synaptic transmission, mGluR1s produce in cerebellar Purkinje cells a complex postsynaptic response consisting of two distinct signal components, namely a local dendritic calcium signal and a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. The basic mechanisms underlying these synaptic responses were clarified in recent years. First, the work of several groups established that the dendritic calcium signal results from IP(3) receptor-mediated calcium release from internal stores. Second, it was recently found that mGluR1-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials are mediated by the transient receptor potential channel TRPC3. This surprising finding established TRPC3 as a novel postsynaptic channel for glutamatergic synaptic transmission.","1214":"There are two RNA worlds. The first is the primordial RNA world, a hypothetical era when RNA served as both information and function, both genotype and phenotype. The second RNA world is that of today's biological systems, where RNA plays active roles in catalyzing biochemical reactions, in translating mRNA into proteins, in regulating gene expression, and in the constant battle between infectious agents trying to subvert host defense systems and host cells protecting themselves from infection. This second RNA world is not at all hypothetical, and although we do not have all the answers about how it works, we have the tools to continue our interrogation of this world and refine our understanding. The fun comes when we try to use our secure knowledge of the modern RNA world to infer what the primordial RNA world might have looked like.","1215":"Changes in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) represent a vital signaling mechanism enabling communication among cells and between cells and the environment. The initiation of embryo development depends on a [Ca(2+)](i) increase(s) in the egg, which is generally induced during fertilization. The [Ca(2+)](i) increase signals egg activation, which is the first stage in embryo development, and that consist of biochemical and structural changes that transform eggs into zygotes. The spatiotemporal patterns of [Ca(2+)](i) at fertilization show variability, most likely reflecting adaptations to fertilizing conditions and to the duration of embryonic cell cycles. In mammals, the focus of this review, the fertilization [Ca(2+)](i) signal displays unique properties in that it is initiated after gamete fusion by release of a sperm-derived factor and by periodic and extended [Ca(2+)](i) responses. Here, we will discuss the events of egg activation regulated by increases in [Ca(2+)](i), the possible downstream targets that effect these egg activation events, and the property and identity of molecules both in sperm and eggs that underpin the initiation and persistence of the [Ca(2+)](i) responses in these species.","1216":"Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common inherited neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by uncontrolled excessive motor movements and cognitive and emotional deficits. The mutation responsible for HD leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) protein, which confers one or more toxic functions to mutant Htt leading to neurodegeneration. The polyQ expansion makes Htt prone to aggregate and accumulate, and manipulations that mitigate protein misfolding or facilitate the clearance of misfolded proteins tend to slow disease progression in HD models. This article will focus on HD and the evidence that it is a conformational disease.","1217":"Aptamers and the SELEX process were discovered over two decades ago. These discoveries have spawned a productive academic and commercial industry. The collective results provide insights into biology, past and present, through an in vitro evolutionary exploration of the nature of nucleic acids and their potential roles in ancient life. Aptamers have helped usher in an RNA renaissance. Here we explore some of the evolution of the aptamer field and the insights it has provided for conceptualizing an RNA world, from its nascence to our current endeavor employing aptamers in human proteomics to discover biomarkers of health and disease.","1218":"Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a multimegadalton ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprised of five snRNPs and numerous proteins. Intricate RNA-RNA and RNP networks, which serve to align the reactive groups of the pre-mRNA for catalysis, are formed and repeatedly rearranged during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. Both the conformation and composition of the spliceosome are highly dynamic, affording the splicing machinery its accuracy and flexibility, and these remarkable dynamics are largely conserved between yeast and metazoans. Because of its dynamic and complex nature, obtaining structural information about the spliceosome represents a major challenge. Electron microscopy has revealed the general morphology of several spliceosomal complexes and their snRNP subunits, and also the spatial arrangement of some of their components. X-ray and NMR studies have provided high resolution structure information about spliceosomal proteins alone or complexed with one or more binding partners. The extensive interplay of RNA and proteins in aligning the pre-mRNA's reactive groups, and the presence of both RNA and protein at the core of the splicing machinery, suggest that the spliceosome is an RNP enzyme. However, elucidation of the precise nature of the spliceosome's active site, awaits the generation of a high-resolution structure of its RNP core.","1219":"Bacterial cells are frequently exposed to dramatic fluctuations in their environment, which cause perturbation in protein homeostasis and lead to protein misfolding. Bacteria have therefore evolved powerful quality control networks consisting of chaperones and proteases that cooperate to monitor the folding states of proteins and to remove misfolded conformers through either refolding or degradation. The levels of the quality control components are adjusted to the folding state of the cellular proteome through the induction of compartment specific stress responses. In addition, the activities of several quality control components are directly controlled by these stresses, allowing for fast activation. Severe stress can, however, overcome the protective function of the proteostasis network leading to the formation of protein aggregates, which are sequestered at the cell poles. Protein aggregates are either solubilized by AAA+ chaperones or eliminated through cell division, allowing for the generation of damage-free daughter cells.","1220":"Cells have thousands of different lipids. In the plasma membrane, and in membranes of the late secretory and endocytotic pathways, these lipids are not evenly distributed over the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer. The basis for this transmembrane lipid asymmetry lies in the fact that glycerolipids are primarily synthesized on the cytosolic and sphingolipids on the noncytosolic surface of cellular membranes, that cholesterol has a higher affinity for sphingolipids than for glycerolipids. In addition, P4-ATPases, \"flippases,\" actively translocate the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine to the cytosolic surface. ABC transporters translocate lipids in the opposite direction but they generally act as exporters rather than \"floppases.\" The steady state asymmetry of the lipids can be disrupted within seconds by the activation of phospholipases and scramblases. The asymmetric lipid distribution has multiple implications for physiological events at the membrane surface. Moreover, the active translocation also contributes to the generation of curvature in the budding of transport vesicles.","1221":"A number of long coiled-coil proteins are present on the Golgi. Often referred to as \"golgins,\" they are well conserved in evolution and at least five are likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Individual golgins are found in different parts of the Golgi stack, and they are typically anchored to the membrane at their carboxyl termini by a transmembrane domain or by binding a small GTPase. They appear to have roles in membrane traffic and Golgi structure, but their precise function is in most cases unclear. Many have binding sites for Rab family GTPases along their length, and this has led to the suggestion that the golgins act collectively to form a tentacular matrix that surrounds the Golgi to capture Rab-coated membranes in the vicinity of the stack. Such a collective role might explain the lack of cell lethality seen following loss of some of the genes in human familial conditions or mouse models.","1222":"Ca(2+) is an important intracellular messenger affecting many diverse processes. In eukaryotic cells, Ca(2+) storage is achieved within specific intracellular organelles, especially the endoplasmic\/sarcoplasmic reticulum, in which Ca(2+) is buffered by specific proteins known as Ca(2+) buffers. Ca(2+) buffers are a diverse group of proteins, varying in their affinities and capacities for Ca(2+), but they typically also carry out other functions within the cell. The wide range of organelles containing Ca(2+) and the evidence supporting cross-talk between these organelles suggest the existence of a dynamic network of organellar Ca(2+) signaling, mediated by a variety of organellar Ca(2+) buffers.","1223":"Calcium signaling results from a complex interplay between activation and inactivation of intracellular and extracellular calcium permeable channels. This complexity is obvious from the pattern of calcium signals observed with modest, physiological concentrations of calcium-mobilizing agonists, which typically present as sequential regenerative discharges of stored calcium, a process referred to as calcium oscillations. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the underlying mechanism of calcium oscillations through the power of mathematical modeling. We also summarize recent findings on the role of calcium entry through store-operated channels in sustaining calcium oscillations and in the mechanism by which calcium oscillations couple to downstream effectors.","1224":"Lipid droplets (LDs) are independent organelles that are composed of a lipid ester core and a surface phospholipid monolayer. Recent studies have revealed many new proteins, functions, and phenomena associated with LDs. In addition, a number of diseases related to LDs are beginning to be understood at the molecular level. It is now clear that LDs are not an inert store of excess lipids but are dynamically engaged in various cellular functions, some of which are not directly related to lipid metabolism. Compared to conventional membrane organelles, there are still many uncertainties concerning the molecular architecture of LDs and how each function is placed in a structural context. Recent findings and remaining questions are discussed.","1225":"Integrins are large, membrane-spanning, heterodimeric proteins that are essential for a metazoan existence. All members of the integrin family adopt a shape that resembles a large \"head\" on two \"legs,\" with the head containing the sites for ligand binding and subunit association. Most of the receptor dimer is extracellular, but both subunits traverse the plasma membrane and terminate in short cytoplasmic domains. These domains initiate the assembly of large signaling complexes and thereby bridge the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. To allow cells to sample and respond to a dynamic pericellular environment, integrins have evolved a highly responsive receptor activation mechanism that is regulated primarily by changes in tertiary and quaternary structure. This review summarizes recent progress in the structural and molecular functional studies of this important class of adhesion receptor.","1226":"The trans-Golgi network (TGN) receives a select set of proteins from the endocytic pathway-about 5% of total plasma membrane glycoproteins (Duncan and Kornfeld 1988). Proteins that are delivered include mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), TGN46, sortilin, and various toxins that hitchhike a ride backward through the secretory pathway to intoxicate cells after they exit into the cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This article will review work on the molecular players that drive protein transport from the endocytic pathway to the TGN. Distinct requirements have revealed multiple routes for retrograde transport; in addition, the existence of multiple, potential coat proteins and\/or cargo adaptors imply that multiple vesicular transfers are likely involved. Several comprehensive reviews have appeared recently and should be sought for additional details (Bonifacino and Rojas 2006; Johannes and Popoff 2008).","1227":null,"1228":null,"1229":"Dynamic changes in cytosolic and nuclear Ca(2+) concentration are reported to play a critical regulatory role in different aspects of skeletal muscle development and differentiation. Here we review our current knowledge of the spatial dynamics of Ca(2+) signals generated during muscle development in mouse, rat, and Xenopus myocytes in culture, in the exposed myotome of dissected Xenopus embryos, and in intact normally developing zebrafish. It is becoming clear that subcellular domains, either membrane-bound or otherwise, may have their own Ca(2+) signaling signatures. Thus, to understand the roles played by myogenic Ca(2+) signaling, we must consider: (1) the triggers and targets within these signaling domains; (2) interdomain signaling, and (3) how these Ca(2+) signals integrate with other signaling networks involved in myogenesis. Imaging techniques that are currently available to provide direct visualization of these Ca(2+) signals are also described.","1230":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a consequence of defective recognition of the multimembrane spanning protein cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator (CFTR) by the protein homeostasis or proteostasis network (PN) (Hutt and Balch (2010). Like many variant proteins triggering misfolding diseases, mutant CFTR has a complex folding and membrane trafficking itinerary that is managed by the PN to maintain proteome balance and this balance is disrupted in human disease. The biological pathways dictating the folding and function of CFTR in health and disease are being studied by numerous investigators, providing a unique opportunity to begin to understand and therapeutically address the role of the PN in disease onset, and its progression during aging. We discuss the general concept that therapeutic management of the emergent properties of the PN to control the energetics of CFTR folding biology may provide significant clinical benefit.","1231":"It has often been suggested that the high curvature of transport intermediates in cells may be a sufficient means to segregate different lipid populations based on the relative energy costs of forming bent membranes. In this review, we present in vitro experiments that highlight the essential physics of lipid sorting at thermal equilibrium: It is driven by a trade-off between bending energy, mixing entropy, and interactions between species. We collect evidence that lipid sorting depends strongly on lipid-lipid and protein-lipid interactions, and hence on the underlying composition of the membrane and on the presence of bound proteins.","1232":"Basement membranes are widely distributed extracellular matrices that coat the basal aspect of epithelial and endothelial cells and surround muscle, fat, and Schwann cells. These extracellular matrices, first expressed in early embryogenesis, are self-assembled on competent cell surfaces through binding interactions among laminins, type IV collagens, nidogens, and proteoglycans. They form stabilizing extensions of the plasma membrane that provide cell adhesion and that act as solid-phase agonists. Basement membranes play a role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and help maintain function in the adult. Mutations adversely affecting expression of the different structural components are associated with developmental arrest at different stages as well as postnatal diseases of muscle, nerve, brain, eye, skin, vasculature, and kidney.","1233":"The development of multicellular organisms, as well as maintenance of organ architecture and function, requires robust regulation of cell fates. This is in part achieved by conserved signaling pathways through which cells process extracellular information and translate this information into changes in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell shape. Gene deletion studies in higher eukaryotes have assigned critical roles for components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and their cellular receptors in a vast number of developmental processes, indicating that a large proportion of this signaling is regulated by cell-ECM interactions. In addition, genetic alterations in components of this signaling axis play causative roles in several human diseases. This review will discuss what genetic analyses in mice and lower organisms have taught us about adhesion signaling in development and disease.","1234":null,"1235":"The function of T-lymphocytes during adaptive immune responses is directed by antigen receptors, costimulatory molecules, and cytokines. These extrinsic stimuli are coupled to a network of serine\/threonine kinases that control the epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic programs that determine T-cell function. It is increasingly recognized that serine\/threonine kinases, notably those that are controlled by lipid second messengers such as polyunsaturated diacylglycerols (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP(3)), are at the core of T-cell signal transduction. In the present review the object will be to discuss some important examples of how pathways of serine\/threonine phosphorylation control molecular functions of proteins and control protein localization to coordinate T-cell function in adaptive immune responses.","1236":"Collagens are the most abundant proteins in mammals. The collagen family comprises 28 members that contain at least one triple-helical domain. Collagens are deposited in the extracellular matrix where most of them form supramolecular assemblies. Four collagens are type II membrane proteins that also exist in a soluble form released from the cell surface by shedding. Collagens play structural roles and contribute to mechanical properties, organization, and shape of tissues. They interact with cells via several receptor families and regulate their proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Some collagens have a restricted tissue distribution and hence specific biological functions.","1237":null,"1238":"Proteins generally must fold into precise three-dimensional conformations to fulfill their biological functions. In the cell, this fundamental process is aided by molecular chaperones, which act in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. How this machinery assists newly synthesized polypeptide chains in navigating the complex folding energy landscape is now being understood in considerable detail. The mechanisms that ensure the maintenance of a functional proteome under normal and stress conditions are also of great medical relevance, as the aggregation of proteins that escape the cellular quality control underlies a range of debilitating diseases, including many age-of-onset neurodegenerative disorders.","1239":null,"1240":"Leukocytes, of both the innate and adaptive lineages, are normal cellular components of all tissues. These important cells not only are critical for regulating normal tissue homeostasis, but also are significant paracrine regulators of all physiologic and pathologic tissue repair processes. This article summarizes recent insights regarding the trophic roles of leukocytes at each stage of mammary gland development and during cancer development, with a focus on Murids and humans.","1241":"An astonishing number of extracellular matrix glycoproteins are expressed in dynamic patterns in the developing and adult nervous system. Neural stem cells, neurons, and glia express receptors that mediate interactions with specific extracellular matrix molecules. Functional studies in vitro and genetic studies in mice have provided evidence that the extracellular matrix affects virtually all aspects of nervous system development and function. Here we will summarize recent findings that have shed light on the specific functions of defined extracellular matrix molecules on such diverse processes as neural stem cell differentiation, neuronal migration, the formation of axonal tracts, and the maturation and function of synapses in the peripheral and central nervous system.","1242":"The complex patterns of neuronal wiring in the adult nervous system depend on a series of guidance events during neural development that establish a framework on which functional circuits can be built. In this subject collection, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal guidance are considered from several perspectives, ranging from how cytoskeletal dynamics within extending neuronal growth cones steer axons, to how guidance cues influence synaptogenesis. We introduce here some basic topics to frame the more detailed reviews in following articles, including the cellular strategies that define basic themes governing neuronal wiring throughout life, an enumeration of the molecular cues and receptors known to play key guidance roles during neural development, and an overview of the signaling mechanisms that transduce guidance information into growth-cone steering.","1243":"Riboswitches are structured noncoding RNA domains that selectively bind metabolites and control gene expression (Mandal and Breaker 2004a; Coppins et al. 2007; Roth and Breaker 2009). Nearly all examples of the known riboswitches reside in noncoding regions of messenger RNAs where they control transcription or translation. Newfound classes of riboswitches are being reported at a rate of about three per year (Ames and Breaker 2009), and these have been shown to selectively respond to fundamental metabolites including coenzymes, nucleobases or their derivatives, amino acids, and other small molecule ligands. The characteristics of some riboswitches suggest they could be modern descendents of an ancient sensory and regulatory system that likely functioned before the emergence of enzymes and genetic factors made of protein (Nahvi et al. 2002; Vitreschak et al. 2004; Breaker 2006). If true, then some of the riboswitch structures and functions that serve modern cells so well may accurately reflect the capabilities of RNA sensors and switches that existed in the RNA World. This article will address some of the characteristics of modern riboswitches that may be relevant to ancient versions of these metabolite-sensing RNAs.","1244":"When cells are observed by phase contrast microscopy, nucleoli are among the most conspicuous structures. The nucleolus was formally described between 1835 and 1839, but it was another century before it was discovered to be associated with a specific chromosomal locus, thus defining it as a cytogenetic entity. Nucleoli were first isolated in the 1950s, from starfish oocytes. Then, in the early 1960s, a boomlet of studies led to one of the epochal discoveries in the modern era of genetics and cell biology: that the nucleolus is the site of ribosomal RNA synthesis and nascent ribosome assembly. This epistemologically repositioned the nucleolus as not merely an aspect of nuclear anatomy but rather as a cytological manifestation of gene action-a major heuristic advance. Indeed, the finding that the nucleolus is the seat of ribosome production constitutes one of the most vivid confluences of form and function in the history of cell biology. This account presents the nucleolus in both historical and contemporary perspectives. The modern era has brought the unanticipated discovery that the nucleolus is plurifunctional, constituting a paradigm shift.","1245":"Axon outgrowth and guidance to the proper target requires the coordination of filamentous (F)-actin and microtubules (MTs), the dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that promote shape change and locomotion. Over the past two decades, our knowledge of the many guidance cues, receptors, and downstream signaling cascades involved in neuronal outgrowth and guidance has increased dramatically. Less is known, however, about how those cascades of information converge and direct appropriate remodeling and interaction of cytoskeletal polymers, the ultimate effectors of movement and guidance. During development, much of the communication that occurs between environmental guidance cues and the cytoskeleton takes place at the growing tip of the axon, the neuronal growth cone. Several articles on this topic focus on the \"input\" to the growth cone, the myriad of receptor types, and their corresponding cognate ligands. Others investigate the signaling cascades initiated by receptors and propagated by second messenger pathways (i.e., kinases, phosphatases, GTPases). Ultimately, this plethora of information converges on proteins that associate directly with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. The role of these cytoskeletal-associated proteins, as well as the cytoskeleton itself in axon outgrowth and guidance, is the subject of this article.","1246":"The adult mammary structure provides for the rapid growth, development, and immunological protection of the live-born young of mammals through its production of milk. The dynamic remodeling of the branched epithelial structure of the mammary gland in response to physiological stimuli that allow its programmed branching morphogenesis at puberty, cyclical turnover during the reproductive cycle, differentiation into a secretory organ at parturition, postlactational involution, and ultimately, regression with age is critical for these processes. Extracellular metalloproteinases are essential for the remodeling programs that operate in the tissue microenvironment at the interface of the epithelium and the stroma, coupling form with function. Deregulated proteolytic activity drives the transition of a physiological mammary microenvironment into a tumor microenvironment, facilitating malignant transformation.","1247":"Pre-mRNA processing, including 5'-end capping, splicing, editing, and polyadenylation, consists of a series of orchestrated and primarily cotranscriptional steps that ensure both the high fidelity and extreme diversity characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression. Alternative splicing and editing allow relatively small genomes to encode vast proteomic arrays while alternative 3'-end formation enables variations in mRNA localization, translation, and stability. Of course, this mechanistic complexity comes at a high price. Mutations in the myriad of RNA sequence elements that regulate mRNA biogenesis, as well as the trans-acting factors that act upon these sequences, underlie a number of human diseases. In this review, we focus on one of these key RNA processing steps, splicing, to highlight recent studies that describe both conventional and novel pathogenic mechanisms that underlie muscle and neurological diseases.","1248":"Microbial synthesis of the phytohormone auxin has been known for a long time. This property is best documented for bacteria that interact with plants because bacterial auxin can cause interference with the many plant developmental processes regulated by auxin. Auxin biosynthesis in bacteria can occur via multiple pathways as has been observed in plants. There is also increasing evidence that indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the major naturally occurring auxin, is a signaling molecule in microorganisms because IAA affects gene expression in some microorganisms. Therefore, IAA can act as a reciprocal signaling molecule in microbe-plant interactions. Interest in microbial synthesis of auxin is also increasing in yet another recently discovered property of auxin in Arabidopsis. Down-regulation of auxin signaling is part of the plant defense system against phytopathogenic bacteria. Exogenous application of auxin, e.g., produced by the pathogen, enhances susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen.","1249":"While polar organelles hold the key to understanding the fundamentals of cell polarity and cell biological principles in general, they have served in the past merely for taxonomical purposes. Here, we highlight recent efforts in unraveling the molecular basis of polar organelle positioning in bacterial cells. Specifically, we detail the role of members of the Ras-like GTPase superfamily and coiled-coil-rich scaffolding proteins in modulating bacterial cell polarity and in recruiting effector proteins to polar sites. Such roles are well established for eukaryotic cells, but not for bacterial cells that are generally considered diffusion-limited. Studies on spatial regulation of protein positioning in bacterial cells, though still in their infancy, will undoubtedly experience a surge of interest, as comprehensive localization screens have yielded an extensive list of (polarly) localized proteins, potentially reflecting subcellular sites of functional specialization predicted for organelles.","1250":"Integrins bind extracellular matrix fibrils and associate with intracellular actin filaments through a variety of cytoskeletal linker proteins to mechanically connect intracellular and extracellular structures. Each component of the linkage from the cytoskeleton through the integrin-mediated adhesions to the extracellular matrix therefore transmits forces that may derive from both intracellular, myosin-generated contractile forces and forces from outside the cell. These forces activate a wide range of signaling pathways and genetic programs to control cell survival, fate, and behavior. Additionally, cells sense the physical properties of their surrounding environment through forces exerted on integrin-mediated adhesions. This article first summarizes current knowledge about regulation of cell function by mechanical forces acting through integrin-mediated adhesions and then discusses models for mechanotransduction and sensing of environmental forces.","1251":"The nucleus is unique amongst cellular organelles in that it contains a myriad of discrete suborganelles. These nuclear bodies are morphologically and molecularly distinct entities, and they host specific nuclear processes. Although the mode of biogenesis appears to differ widely between individual nuclear bodies, several common design principles are emerging, particularly, the ability of nuclear bodies to form de novo, a role of RNA as a structural element and self-organization as a mode of formation. The controlled biogenesis of nuclear bodies is essential for faithful maintenance of nuclear architecture during the cell cycle and is an important part of cellular responses to intra- and extracellular events.","1252":"Cells maintain a healthy proteome through continuous evaluation of the quality of each of their proteins. Quality control requires the coordinated action of chaperones and proteolytic systems. Chaperones identify abnormal or unstable conformations in proteins and often assist them to regain stability. However, if repair is not possible, the aberrant protein is eliminated from the cellular cytosol to prevent undesired interactions with other proteins or its organization into toxic multimeric complexes. Autophagy and the ubiquitin\/proteasome system mediate the complete degradation of abnormal protein products. In this article, we describe each of these proteolytic systems and their contribution to cellular quality control. We also comment on the cellular consequences resulting from the dysfunction of these systems in common human protein conformational disorders and provide an overview on current therapeutic interventions based on the modulation of the proteolytic systems.","1253":"The response of innate immune cells to growth factors, immune complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, pathogens, cellular damage, and many other stimuli is regulated by a complex net of intracellular signal transduction pathways. The majority of these pathways are either initiated or modulated by Src-family or Syk tyrosine kinases present in innate cells. The Src-family kinases modulate the broadest range of signaling responses, including regulating immunoreceptors, C-type lectins, integrins, G-protein-coupled receptors, and many others. Src-family kinases also modulate the activity of other kinases, including the Tec-family members as well as FAK and Pyk2. Syk kinase is required for initiation of signaling involving receptors that utilize immunoreceptor tyrosine activation (ITAM) domains. This article reviews the major activating and inhibitory signaling pathways regulated by these cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, illuminating the many examples of signaling cross talk between pathways.","1254":"The crystal structures of ribosomes that have been obtained since 2000 have transformed our understanding of protein synthesis. In addition to proving that RNA is responsible for catalyzing peptide bond formation, these structures have provided important insights into the mechanistic details of how the ribosome functions. This review emphasizes what has been learned about the mechanism of peptide bond formation, the antibiotics that inhibit ribosome function, and the fidelity of decoding.","1255":"B cells contribute to protective adaptive immune responses through generation of antibodies and long-lived memory cells, following engagement of the B-cell receptor (BCR) with specific antigen. Recent imaging investigations have offered novel insights into the ensuing molecular and cellular events underlying B-cell activation. Following engagement with antigen, BCR microclusters form and act as sites of active signaling through the recruitment of intracellular signaling molecules and adaptors. Signaling through these \"microsignalosomes\" is propagated and enhanced through B-cell spreading in a CD19-dependent manner. Subsequently, the mature immunological synapse is formed, and functions as a platform for antigen internalization, enabling the antigen presentation to helper T cells required for maximal B-cell activation. In this review, we discuss the emerging and critical role for the cytoskeleton in the coordination and regulation of these molecular events during B-cell activation.","1256":null,"1257":"Of the established Ca(2+) mobilizing messengers, NAADP is arguably the most tantalizing. It is the most potent, often efficacious at low nanomolar concentrations. Recent studies have identified a new class of calcium release channel, the two-pore channels (TPCs), as the likely targets for NAADP. These channels are endolysosomal in localization where they mediate local Ca(2+) release, and have highlighted a new role of acidic organelles as targets for messenger-evoked Ca(2+) mobilization. Three distinct roles of TPCs have been identified. The first is to effect local Ca(2+) release that may play a role in endolysosomal function including vesicular fusion and trafficking. The second is to trigger global calcium release by recruiting Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) channels at lysosomal-ER junctions. The third is to regulate plasma membrane excitability by the targeting of Ca(2+) release from appropriately positioned subplasma membrane stores to regulate plasma membrane Ca(2+)-activated channels. In this review, I discuss the role of NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release from endolysosomal stores as a widespread trigger for intracellular calcium signaling mechanisms, and how studies of TPCs are beginning to enhance our understanding of the central role of lysosomes in Ca(2+) signaling.","1258":"Auxin is a simple molecule with a remarkable ability to control plant growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. The mechanistic basis for this versatility appears to stem from the highly complex nature of the networks regulating auxin metabolism, transport and response. These heavily feedback-regulated and inter-dependent mechanisms are complicated in structure and complex in operation giving rise to a system with self-organizing properties capable of generating highly context-specific responses to auxin as a single, generic signal.","1259":"Cells of the mammary gland are in intimate contact with other cells and with the extracellular matrix (ECM), both of which provide not only a biochemical context, but a mechanical context as well. Cell-mediated contraction allows cells to sense the stiffness of their microenvironment, and respond with appropriate mechanosignaling events that regulate gene expression and differentiation. ECM composition and organization are tightly regulated throughout development of the mammary gland, resulting in corresponding regulation of the mechanical environment and proper tissue architecture. Mechanical regulation is also at play during breast carcinoma progression, as changes in ECM deposition, composition, and organization accompany breast carcinoma. These changes result in stiffer matrices that activate mechanosignaling pathways and thereby induce cell proliferation, facilitate local tumor cell invasion, and promote progression. Thus, understanding the role of forces in the mammary gland is crucial to understanding both normal developmental and pathological processes.","1260":"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)R) and their relatives, ryanodine receptors, are the channels that most often mediate Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Their regulation by Ca(2+) allows them also to propagate cytosolic Ca(2+) signals regeneratively. This brief review addresses the structural basis of IP(3)R activation by IP(3) and Ca(2+). IP(3) initiates IP(3)R activation by promoting Ca(2+) binding to a stimulatory Ca(2+)-binding site, the identity of which is unresolved. We suggest that interactions of critical phosphate groups in IP(3) with opposite sides of the clam-like IP(3)-binding core cause it to close and propagate a conformational change toward the pore via the adjacent N-terminal suppressor domain. The pore, assembled from the last pair of transmembrane domains and the intervening pore loop from each of the four IP(3)R subunits, forms a structure in which a luminal selectivity filter and a gate at the cytosolic end of the pore control cation fluxes through the IP(3)R.","1261":"Small RNA regulators (sRNAs) have been identified in a wide range of bacteria and found to play critical regulatory roles in many processes. The major families of sRNAs include true antisense RNAs, synthesized from the strand complementary to the mRNA they regulate, sRNAs that also act by pairing but have limited complementarity with their targets, and sRNAs that regulate proteins by binding to and affecting protein activity. The sRNAs with limited complementarity are akin to eukaryotic microRNAs in their ability to modulate the activity and stability of multiple mRNAs. In many bacterial species, the RNA chaperone Hfq is required to promote pairing between these sRNAs and their target mRNAs. Understanding the evolution of regulatory sRNAs remains a challenge; sRNA genes show evidence of duplication and horizontal transfer but also could be evolved from tRNAs, mRNAs or random transcription.","1262":"Structural changes to DNA severely affect its functions, such as replication and transcription, and play a major role in age-related diseases and cancer. A complicated and entangled network of DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms, including multiple DNA repair pathways, damage tolerance processes, and cell-cycle checkpoints safeguard genomic integrity. Like transcription and replication, DDR is a chromatin-associated process that is generally tightly controlled in time and space. As DNA damage can occur at any time on any genomic location, a specialized spatio-temporal orchestration of this defense apparatus is required.","1263":"Messenger RNAs undergo 5' capping, splicing, 3'-end processing, and export before translation in the cytoplasm. It has become clear that these mRNA processing events are tightly coupled and have a profound effect on the fate of the resulting transcript. This processing is represented by modifications of the pre-mRNA and loading of various protein factors. The sum of protein factors that stay with the mRNA as a result of processing is modified over the life of the transcript, conferring significant regulation to its expression.","1264":"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are located in the sarcoplasmic\/endoplasmic reticulum membrane and are responsible for the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores during excitation-contraction coupling in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. RyRs are the largest known ion channels (&gt; 2MDa) and exist as three mammalian isoforms (RyR 1-3), all of which are homotetrameric proteins that interact with and are regulated by phosphorylation, redox modifications, and a variety of small proteins and ions. Most RyR channel modulators interact with the large cytoplasmic domain whereas the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein forms the ion-conducting pore. Mutations in RyR2 are associated with human disorders such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia whereas mutations in RyR1 underlie diseases such as central core disease and malignant hyperthermia. This chapter examines the current concepts of the structure, function and regulation of RyRs and assesses the current state of understanding of their roles in associated disorders.","1265":"For over a century, mouse mammary tumor biology and the associated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) have served as the foundation for experimental cancer research, in general, and, in particular, experimental breast cancer research. Spontaneous mouse mammary tumors were the basis for studies of the natural history of neoplasia, oncogenic viruses, host responses, endocrinology and neoplastic progression. However, lacking formal proof of a human mammary tumor virus, the preeminence of the mouse model faded in the 1980s. Since the late 1980s, genetically engineered mice (GEM) have proven extremely useful for studying breast cancer and have become the animal model for human breast cancer. Hundreds of mouse models of human breast cancer have been developed since the first demonstration in 1984. The GEM have attracted a new generation of molecular and cellular biologists eager to apply their skill sets to these surrogates of the human disease. Newcomers often enter the field without an appreciation of the origins of mouse mammary tumor biology and the basis for many of the prevailing concepts. Our purpose in writing this compendium is to extend an \"olive branch\" while simultaneously deepen the knowledge of the novice mouse mammary tumor biologist as they journey into a field rich in pathology and genetics spanning several centuries.","1266":"Second messenger molecules relay, amplify, and diversify cell surface receptor signals. Two important examples are phosphorylated D-myo-inositol derivatives, such as phosphoinositide lipids within cellular membranes, and soluble inositol phosphates. Here, we review how phosphoinositide metabolism generates multiple second messengers with important roles in T-cell development and function. They include soluble inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate, long known for its Ca(2+)-mobilizing function, and phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate, whose generation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and turnover by the phosphatases PTEN and SHIP control a key \"hub\" of TCR signaling. More recent studies unveiled important second messenger functions for diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and soluble inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate (IP(4)) in immune cells. Inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrakisphosphate acts as a soluble phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate analog to control protein membrane recruitment. We propose that phosphoinositide lipids and soluble inositol phosphates (IPs) can act as complementary partners whose interplay could have broadly important roles in cellular signaling.","1267":"A critical feature of the hypothesized RNA world would have been the ability to control chemical processes in response to environmental cues. Riboswitches present themselves as viable candidates for a sophisticated mechanism of regulatory control in RNA-based life. These regulatory elements in the modern world are most commonly found in the 5'-untranslated regions of bacterial mRNAs, directly interacting with metabolites as a means of regulating expression of the coding region via a secondary structural switch. In this review, we focus on recent insights into how these RNAs fold into complex architectures capable of both recognizing a specific small molecule compound and exerting regulatory control over downstream sequences, with an emphasis on transcriptional regulation.","1268":null,"1269":"Dosage compensation is a strategy to deal with the imbalance of sex chromosomal gene products relative to autosomes and also between the sexes. The mechanisms that ensure dosage compensation for X-chromosome activity have been extensively studied in mammals, worms, and flies. Although each entails very different mechanisms to equalize the dose of X-linked genes between the sexes, they all involve the co-ordinate regulation of hundreds of genes specifically on the sex chromosomes and not the autosomes. In addition to chromatin modifications and changes in higher order chromatin structure, nuclear organization is emerging as an important component of these chromosome-wide processes and in the specific targeting of dosage compensation complexes to the sex chromosomes. Preferential localization within the nucleus and 3D organization are thought to contribute to the differential treatment of two identical homologs within the same nucleus, as well as to the chromosome-wide spread and stable maintenance of heterochromatin.","1270":"Nuclear speckles, also known as interchromatin granule clusters, are nuclear domains enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors, located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. When observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, they usually appear as 20-50 irregularly shaped structures that vary in size. Speckles are dynamic structures, and their constituents can exchange continuously with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure, and dynamics of speckles have provided an important paradigm for understanding the functional organization of the nucleus and the dynamics of the gene expression machinery.","1271":"The bacterial flagellum and the virulence-associated injectisome are complex, structurally related nanomachines that bacteria use for locomotion or the translocation of virulence factors into eukaryotic host cells. The assembly of both structures and the transfer of extracellular proteins is mediated by a unique, multicomponent transport apparatus, the type III secretion system. Here, we discuss the significant progress that has been made in recent years in the visualization and functional characterization of many components of the type III secretion system, the structure of the bacterial flagellum, and the injectisome complex.","1272":"An entire mammary epithelial outgrowth, capable of full secretory differentiation, may comprise the progeny of a single cellular antecedent, i.e., may be generated from a single mammary epithelial stem cell. Early studies showed that any portion of an intact murine mammary gland containing epithelium could recapitulate an entire mammary epithelial tree on transplantation into an epithelium-free mammary fat pad. More recent studies have shown that a hierarchy of mammary stem\/progenitor cells exists among the mammary epithelium and that their behavior and maintenance is dependent on signals generated both locally and systemically. In this review, we have attempted to develop the scientific saga surrounding the discovery and characterization of the murine mammary stem\/progenitor cell hierarchy and to suggest further approaches that will enhance our knowledge and understanding of these cells and their role in both normal development and neoplasia.","1273":"Topographic maps are a two-dimensional representation of one neural structure within another and serve as the main strategy to organize sensory information. The retina's projection via axons of retinal ganglion cells to midbrain visual centers, the optic tectum\/superior colliculus, is the leading model to elucidate mechanisms of topographic map formation. Each axis of the retina is mapped independently using different mechanisms and sets of axon guidance molecules expressed in gradients to achieve the goal of representing a point in the retina onto a point within the target. An axon's termination along the temporal-nasal mapping axis is determined by opposing gradients of EphAs and ephrin-As that act through their forward and reverse signaling, respectively, within the projecting axons, each of which inhibits interstitial branching, cooperating with a branch-promoting activity, to generate topographic specific branching along the shaft of the parent axons that overshoot their correct termination zone along the anterior-posterior axis of the target. The dorsal-ventral termination position is then determined using a gradient of ephrin-B that can act as a repellent or attractant depending on the ephrin-B concentration relative to EphB levels on the interstitial branches to guide them along the medial-lateral axis of the target to their correct termination zone, where they arborize. In both cases, axon-axon competition results in axon mapping based on relative rather than absolute levels of repellent or attractant activity. The map is subsequently refined through large-scale pruning driven in large part by patterned retinal activity.","1274":"No community-accepted scientific methods are available today to guide studies on what role RNA played in the origin and early evolution of life on Earth. Further, a definition-theory for life is needed to develop hypotheses relating to the \"RNA First\" model for the origin of life. Four approaches are currently at various stages of development of such a definition-theory to guide these studies. These are (a) paleogenetics, in which inferences about the structure of past life are drawn from the structure of present life; (b) prebiotic chemistry, in which hypotheses with experimental support are sought that get RNA from organic and inorganic species possibly present on early Earth; (c) exploration, hoping to encounter life independent of terran life, which might contain RNA; and (d) synthetic biology, in which laboratories attempt to reproduce biological behavior with unnatural chemical systems.","1275":"The 28 mammalian members of the super-family of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are cation channels, mostly permeable to both monovalent and divalent cations, and can be subdivided into six main subfamilies: the TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), and the TRPA (ankyrin) groups. TRP channels are widely expressed in a large number of different tissues and cell types, and their biological roles appear to be equally diverse. In general, considered as polymodal cell sensors, they play a much more diverse role than anticipated. Functionally, TRP channels, when activated, cause cell depolarization, which may trigger a plethora of voltage-dependent ion channels. Upon stimulation, Ca2+ permeable TRP channels generate changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, by Ca2+ entry via the plasma membrane. However, more and more evidence is arising that TRP channels are also located in intracellular organelles and serve as intracellular Ca2+ release channels. This review focuses on three major tasks of TRP channels: (1) the function of TRP channels as Ca2+ entry channels; (2) the electrogenic actions of TRPs; and (3) TRPs as Ca2+ release channels in intracellular organelles.","1276":"Imaging has become an indispensable tool in the study of cancer biology and in clinical prognosis and treatment. The rapid advances in high resolution fluorescent imaging at single cell level and MR\/PET\/CT image registration, combined with new molecular probes of cell types and metabolic states, will allow the physical scales imaged by each to be bridged. This holds the promise of translation of basic science insights at the single cell level to clinical application. In this article, we describe the recent advances in imaging at the macro- and micro-scale and how these advances are synergistic with new imaging agents, reporters, and labeling schemes. Examples of new insights derived from the different scales of imaging and relevant probes are discussed in the context of cancer progression and metastasis.","1277":"The immunological synapse has been an area of very active scientific interest over the last decade. Surprisingly, much about the synapse remains unknown or is controversial. Here we review some of these current issues in the field: how the synapse is defined, its potential role in T-cell function, and our current understanding about how the synapse is formed.","1278":"The hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), Varkud Satellite (VS), and glmS ribozymes catalyze sequence-specific intramolecular cleavage of RNA. They range between 50 and 150 nucleotides in length, and are known as the \"small self-cleaving ribozymes.\" Except for the glmS ribozyme that functions as a riboswitch in Gram-positive bacteria, they were originally discovered as domains of satellite RNAs. However, recent studies show that several of them are broadly distributed in genomes of organisms from many phyla. Each of these ribozymes has a unique overall architecture and active site organization. Crystal structures have revealed how RNA active sites can bind preferentially to the transition state of a reaction, whereas mechanistic studies have shown that nucleobases can efficiently perform general acid-base and electrostatic catalysis. This versatility explains the abundance of ribozymes in contemporary organisms and also supports a role for catalytic RNAs early in evolution.","1279":"Calcium is a versatile and dynamic 2nd messenger that is essential for the survival of all higher organisms. In cells that undergo activation or excitation, calcium is released from the endoplasmic\/sarcoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium-dependent kinases and phosphatases, thereby regulating numerous cellular processes; for example, apoptosis and autophagy. In the case of apoptosis, endogenous ligands or pharmacological agents induce prolonged cytosolic calcium elevation, which in turn leads to cell death. In contrast, there is now evidence that calcium regulates autophagy by several mechanisms, and these may be important for maintaining cell survival. Here we summarize what is known about how calcium regulates these life and death decisions. We pay particular attention to pathways that have been described in lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes, as these systems provide optimal models for understanding calcium signaling in the context of normal cell physiology.","1280":"The nuclear lamins are type V intermediate filament proteins that are critically important for the structural properties of the nucleus. In addition, they are involved in the regulation of numerous nuclear processes, including DNA replication, transcription and chromatin organization. The developmentally regulated expression of lamins suggests that they are involved in cellular differentiation. Their assembly dynamic properties throughout the cell cycle, particularly in mitosis, are influenced by posttranslational modifications. Lamins may regulate nuclear functions by direct interactions with chromatin and determining the spatial organization of chromosomes within the nuclear space. They may also regulate chromatin functions by interacting with factors that epigenetically modify the chromatin or directly regulate replication or transcription.","1281":null,"1282":"RNAi has existed at least since the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This collection of pathways responds to a diversity of \"abberant\" RNAs and generally silences or eliminates genes sharing sequence content with the silencing trigger. In the canonical pathway, double-stranded RNAs are processed into small RNAs, which guide effector complexes to their targets by complementary base pairing. Many alternative routes from silencing trigger to small RNA are continuously being uncovered. Though the triggers of the pathway and the mechanisms of small RNA production are many, all RNAi-related mechanisms share Argonaute proteins as the heart of their effector complexes. These can act as self-contained silencing machines, binding directly to small RNAs, carrying out homology-based target recognition, and in some cases cleaving targets using an endogenous nuclease domain. Here, we discuss the diversity of Argonaute proteins from a structural and functional perspective.","1283":"Much of the dynamics information is lost in bulk measurements because of the population averaging. Single-molecule methods measure one molecule at a time; they provide knowledge not obtainable by other means. In this article, we review the application of the two most widely used single-molecule methods--fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and force versus extension measurements--to several RNA reactions. First, we discuss folding\/unfolding studies on a hairpin ribozyme that revealed multiple conformations of the RNA with distinct kinetics, and on a series of RNA pseudoknots, whose mechanical stabilities were found to show a strong correlation with their frameshifting efficiency during translation. We also discuss several RNA-related molecular motors. Single-molecule experiments revealed detailed mechanisms for the interaction of HIV reverse transcriptase and nucleic acid helicases (NS3 and RIG-1) with their substrates. Optical tweezers studies showed that translation of a single messenger RNA by a ribosome occurs by successive translocation-and-pause cycles. Single-molecule FRET experiments yielded important information on ribosome conformational changes and tRNA dynamics during translation. Overall, single-molecule experiments have been very valuable for understanding RNA reactions.","1284":"The general notion of an \"RNA World\" is that, in the early development of life on the Earth, genetic continuity was assured by the replication of RNA and genetically encoded proteins were not involved as catalysts. There is now strong evidence indicating that an RNA World did indeed exist before DNA- and protein-based life. However, arguments regarding whether life on Earth began with RNA are more tenuous. It might be imagined that all of the components of RNA were available in some prebiotic pool, and that these components assembled into replicating, evolving polynucleotides without the prior existence of any evolved macromolecules. A thorough consideration of this \"RNA-first\" view of the origin of life must reconcile concerns regarding the intractable mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. Perhaps these concerns will eventually be resolved, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.","1285":"The X-linked region now known as the \"X-inactivation center\" (Xic) was once dominated by protein-coding genes but, with the rise of Eutherian mammals some 150-200 million years ago, became infiltrated by genes that produce long noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Some of the noncoding genes have been shown to play crucial roles during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), including the targeting of chromatin modifiers to the X. The rapid establishment of ncRNA hints at a possible preference for long transcripts in some aspects of epigenetic regulation. This article discusses the role of RNA in XCI and considers the advantages RNA offers in delivering allelic, cis-limited, and locus-specific control. Unlike proteins and small RNAs, long ncRNAs are tethered to the site of transcription and effectively tag the allele of origin. Furthermore, long ncRNAs are drawn from larger sequence space than proteins and can mark a unique region in a complex genome. Thus, like their small RNA cousins, long ncRNAs may emerge as versatile and powerful regulators of the epigenome.","1286":"The history of plant biology is inexorably intertwined with the conception and discovery of auxin, followed by the many decades of research to comprehend its action during growth and development. Growth responses to auxin are complex and require the coordination of auxin production, transport, and perception. In this overview of past auxin research, we limit our discourse to the mechanism of auxin action. We attempt to trace the almost epic voyage from the birth of the hormonal concept in plants to the recent crystallographic studies that resolved the TIR1-auxin receptor complex, the first structural model of a plant hormone receptor. The century-long endeavor is a beautiful illustration of the power of scientific reasoning and human intuition, but it also brings to light the fact that decisive progress is made when new technologies emerge and disciplines unite.","1287":"A woman's breast cancer risk is affected by her reproductive history. The hormonal milieu also influences the course of the disease. The female reproductive hormones, estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, have a major impact on breast cancer and control postnatal mammary gland development. Analysis of hormone receptor mutant mouse strains combined with tissue recombination techniques and proteomics revealed that sequential activation of hormone signaling in the mammary epithelium is required for progression of morphogenesis. Hormones impinge on a subset of luminal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) that express hormone receptors and act as sensor cells translating and amplifying systemic signals into local stimuli. Proliferation is induced by paracrine mechanisms mediated by distinct factors at different stages. Tissue and stage specificity of hormonal signaling is achieved at the molecular level by different chromatin contexts and differential recruitment of coactivators and corepressors.","1288":"Mounting evidence in recent years has challenged the dogma that prokaryotes are simple and undefined cells devoid of an organized subcellular architecture. In fact, proteins once thought to be the purely eukaryotic inventions, including relatives of actin and tubulin control prokaryotic cell shape, DNA segregation, and cytokinesis. Similarly, compartmentalization, commonly noted as a distinguishing feature of eukaryotic cells, is also prevalent in the prokaryotic world in the form of protein-bounded and lipid-bounded organelles. In this article we highlight some of these prokaryotic organelles and discuss the current knowledge on their ultrastructure and the molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and maintenance.","1289":"Like their host cells, many viruses produce noncoding (nc)RNAs. These show diversity with respect to time of expression during viral infection, length and structure, protein-binding partners and relative abundance compared with their host-cell counterparts. Viruses, with their limited genomic capacity, presumably evolve or acquire ncRNAs only if they selectively enhance the viral life cycle or assist the virus in combating the host's response to infection. Despite much effort, identifying the functions of viral ncRNAs has been extremely challenging. Recent technical advances and enhanced understanding of host-cell ncRNAs promise accelerated insights into the RNA warfare mounted by this fascinating class of RNPs.","1290":"Breast cancer progression involves multiple genetic events, which can activate dominant-acting oncogenes and disrupt the function of specific tumor suppressor genes. This article describes several key oncogene and tumor suppressor signaling networks that have been implicated in breast cancer progression. Among the tumor suppressors, the article emphasizes BRCA1\/2 and p53 tumor suppressors. In addition to these well characterized tumor suppressors, the article highlights the importance of PTEN tumor suppressor in counteracting PI3K signaling from activated oncogenes such as ErbB2. This article discusses the use of mouse models of human breast that recapitulate the key genetic events involved in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. Finally, the therapeutic potential of targeting these key tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling networks is discussed.","1291":"A little-noted result of the confirmation of multiple premises of the RNA-world hypothesis is that we now know something about the dawn organisms that followed the origin of life, perhaps over 4 billion years ago. We are therefore in an improved position to reason about the biota just before RNA times, during the era of the first replicators, the first Darwinian creatures on Earth. An RNA congener still prominent in modern biology is a plausible descendent of these first replicators.","1292":"Although the actin cytoskeleton and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling complexes are seemingly distinct molecular structures, they are tightly integrated in T cells. The signaling pathways initiated by TCRs binding to peptide MHC complexes are extensively influenced by the actin cytoskeletal activities of the motile phase before TCR signaling, the signalosome scaffolding function of the cytoskeleton, and the translocation of signaling clusters that precedes the termination of signaling at these complexes. As these three successive phases constitute essentially all the steps consequent to immune synapse formation, it has become clear that the substantial physical forces and signaling interactions generated by the actin cytoskeleton dominate the signaling life cycle of TCR signalosomes. We discuss the contributions of the actin cytoskeleton to TCR signaling phases and model some remaining questions about how specific cytoskeletal factors regulate TCR signaling outcomes.","1293":"The mammary gland is an organ that at once gives life to the young, but at the same time poses one of the greatest threats to the mother. Understanding how the tissue develops and functions is of pressing importance in determining how its control mechanisms break down in breast cancer. Here we argue that the interactions between mammary epithelial cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) are crucial in the development and function of the tissue. Current strategies for treating breast cancer take advantage of our knowledge of the endocrine regulation of breast development, and the emerging role of stromal-epithelial interactions (Fig. 1). Focusing, in addition, on the microenvironmental influences that arise from cell-matrix interactions will open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We suggest that ultimately a three-pronged approach targeting endocrine, growth factor, and cell-matrix interactions will provide the best chance of curing the disease.","1294":"Optimal exploitation of the expanding database of sequences requires rapid finding and folding of RNAs. Methods are reviewed that automate folding and discovery of RNAs with algorithms that couple thermodynamics with chemical mapping, NMR, and\/or sequence comparison. New functional noncoding RNAs in genome sequences can be found by combining sequence comparison with the assumption that functional noncoding RNAs will have more favorable folding free energies than other RNAs. When a new RNA is discovered, experiments and sequence comparison can restrict folding space so that secondary structure can be rapidly determined with the help of predicted free energies. In turn, secondary structure restricts folding in three dimensions, which allows modeling of three-dimensional structure. An example from a domain of a retrotransposon is described. Discovery of new RNAs and their structures will provide insights into evolution, biology, and design of therapeutics. Applications to studies of evolution are also reviewed.","1295":"The signaling pathway controlling antigen receptor-induced regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a key role in lymphocyte activation and development and the generation of lymphomas. Work of the past decade has led to dramatic progress in the identification and characterization of new players in the pathway. Moreover, novel enzymatic activities relevant for this pathway have been discovered, which represent interesting drug targets for immuno-suppression or lymphoma treatment. Here, we summarize these findings and give an outlook on interesting open issues that need to be addressed in the future.","1296":"Although model protocellular membranes consisting of monoacyl lipids are similar to membranes composed of contemporary diacyl lipids, they differ in at least one important aspect. Model protocellular membranes allow for the passage of polar solutes and thus can potentially support cell-to functions without the aid of transport machinery. The ability to transport polar molecules likely stems from increased lipid dynamics. Selectively permeable vesicle membranes composed of monoacyl lipids allow for many lifelike processes to emerge from a remarkably small set of molecules.","1297":"Zebrafish models have significantly contributed to our understanding of vertebrate development and, more recently, human disease. The growing number of genetic tools available in zebrafish research has resulted in the identification of many genes involved in developmental and disease processes. In particular, studies in the zebrafish have clarified roles of the p53 tumor suppressor in the formation of specific tumor types, as well as roles of p53 family members during embryonic development. The zebrafish has also been instrumental in identifying novel mechanisms of p53 regulation and highlighting the importance of these mechanisms in vivo. This article will summarize how zebrafish models have been used to reveal numerous, important aspects of p53 function.","1298":"Inactivation of p53 is critical for the formation of most tumors. Illumination of the key function(s) of p53 protein in protecting cells from becoming cancerous is therefore a worthy goal. Arguably p53's most important function is to act as a transcription factor that directly regulates perhaps several hundred of the cell's RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)-transcribed genes, and indirectly regulates thousands of others. Indeed p53 is the most well studied mammalian transcription factor. The p53 tetramer binds to its response element where it can recruit diverse transcriptional coregulators such as histone modifying enzymes, chromatin remodeling factors, subunits of the mediator complex, and components of general transcription machinery and preinitiation complex (PIC) to modulate RNAPII activity at target loci (Laptenko and Prives 2006). The p53 transcriptional program is regulated in a stimulus-specific fashion (Murray-Zmijewski et al. 2008; Vousden and Prives 2009), whereby distinct subsets of p53 target genes are induced in response to different p53-activating agents, likely allowing cells to tailor their response to different types of stress. How p53 is able to discriminate between these different loci is the subject of intense research. Here, we describe key aspects of the fundamentals of p53-mediated transcriptional regulation and target gene promoter selectivity.","1299":"Calcium signaling in neurons as in other cell types mediates changes in gene expression, cell growth, development, survival, and cell death. However, neuronal Ca(2+) signaling processes have become adapted to modulate the function of other important pathways including axon outgrowth and changes in synaptic strength. Ca(2+) plays a key role as the trigger for fast neurotransmitter release. The ubiquitous Ca(2+) sensor calmodulin is involved in various aspects of neuronal regulation. The mechanisms by which changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in neurons can bring about such diverse responses has, however, become a topic of widespread interest that has recently focused on the roles of specialized neuronal Ca(2+) sensors. In this article, we summarize synaptotagmins in neurotransmitter release, the neuronal roles of calmodulin, and the functional significance of the NCS and the CaBP\/calneuron protein families of neuronal Ca(2+) sensors.","1300":"Investigations into the organization of transcription have their origins in cell biology. Early studies characterized nascent transcription in relation to discernable nuclear structures and components. Advances in light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization helped to begin the difficult task of naming the countless individual players and components of transcription and placing them in context. With the completion of mammalian genome sequences, the seemingly boundless task of understanding transcription of the genome became finite and began a new period of rapid advance. Here we focus on the organization of transcription in mammals drawing upon information from lower organisms where necessary. The emerging picture is one of a highly organized nucleus with specific conformations of the genome adapted for tissue-specific programs of transcription and gene expression.","1301":"Telomerase is a eukaryotic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) whose specialized reverse transcriptase action performs de novo synthesis of one strand of telomeric DNA. The resulting telomerase-mediated elongation of telomeres, which are the protective end-caps for eukaryotic chromosomes, counterbalances the inevitable attrition from incomplete DNA replication and nuclease action. The telomerase strategy to maintain telomeres is deeply conserved among eukaryotes, yet the RNA component of telomerase, which carries the built-in template for telomeric DNA repeat synthesis, has evolutionarily diverse size and sequence. Telomerase shows a distribution of labor between RNA and protein in aspects of the polymerization reaction. This article first describes the underlying conservation of a core set of structural features of telomerase RNAs important for the fundamental polymerase activity of telomerase. These include a pseudoknot-plus-template domain and at least one other RNA structural motif separate from the template-containing domain. The principles driving the diversity of telomerase RNAs are then explored. Much of the diversification of telomerase RNAs has come from apparent gain-of-function elaborations, through inferred evolutionary acquisitions of various RNA motifs used for telomerase RNP biogenesis, cellular trafficking of enzyme components, and regulation of telomerase action at telomeres. Telomerase offers broadly applicable insights into the interplay of protein and RNA functions in the context of an RNP enzyme.","1302":"Now is an opportune moment to address the confluence of cell biological form and function that is the nucleus. Its arrival is especially timely because the recognition that the nucleus is extremely dynamic has now been solidly established as a paradigm shift over the past two decades, and also because we now see on the horizon numerous ways in which organization itself, including gene location and possibly self-organizing bodies, underlies nuclear functions.","1303":"During the past decade, the appreciation and understanding of how bacterial cells can be organized in both space and time have been revolutionized by the identification and characterization of multiple bacterial homologs of the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton. Some of these bacterial actins, such as the plasmid-borne ParM protein, have highly specialized functions, whereas other bacterial actins, such as the chromosomally encoded MreB protein, have been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities. In this review we cover our current understanding of the structure, assembly, function, and regulation of bacterial actins. We focus on ParM as a well-understood reductionist model and on MreB as a central organizer of multiple aspects of bacterial cell biology. We also discuss the outstanding puzzles in the field and possible directions where this fast-developing area may progress in the future.","1304":"The ability to transplant mammary epithelial cells of any age or developmental stage to the normal anatomical site of an inbred recipient mouse strain has revolutionized the studies of mammary development and tumor biology over the past 50 years. This simple method has made the mammary gland of the rodent one of the most accessible and studied organs and facilitated our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular properties of normal and neoplastic development. This short review outlines the early concepts that led to the development of the transplantation technology and the impact of this method on our understanding for a variety of processes important both for the normal development and differentiation of the gland as well as the phenomena of neoplastic progression.","1305":"Internal membrane bound structures sequester all genetic material in eukaryotic cells. The most prominent of these structures is the nucleus, which is bounded by a double membrane termed the nuclear envelope (NE). Though this NE separates the nucleoplasm and genetic material within the nucleus from the surrounding cytoplasm, it is studded throughout with portals called nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPC is a highly selective, bidirectional transporter for a tremendous range of protein and ribonucleoprotein cargoes. All the while the NPC must prevent the passage of nonspecific macromolecules, yet allow the free diffusion of water, sugars, and ions. These many types of nuclear transport are regulated at multiple stages, and the NPC carries binding sites for many of the proteins that modulate and modify the cargoes as they pass across the NE. Assembly, maintenance, and repair of the NPC must somehow occur while maintaining the integrity of the NE. Finally, the NPC appears to be an anchor for localization of many nuclear processes, including gene activation and cell cycle regulation. All these requirements demonstrate the complex design of the NPC and the integral role it plays in key cellular processes.","1306":"DNA methylation and histone modifications have essential roles in remodeling chromatin structure of genes necessary for multi-lineage differentiation of mammary stem\/progenitor cells. The role of this well-defined epigenetic programming is to heritably maintain transcriptional plasticity of these loci over multiple cell divisions in the differentiated progeny. Epigenetic events can be deregulated in progenitor cells chronically exposed to xenoestrogen or inflammatory microenvironment. In addition, epigenetically mediated silencing of genes associated with tumor suppression can take place, resulting in clonal proliferation of undifferentiated or semidifferentiated cells. Alternatively, microRNAs that negatively regulate the expression of their protein-coding targets may become epigenetically repressed, leading to oncogenic expression of these genes. Here we further discuss interactions between DNA methylation and histone modifications that have significant contributions to the differentiation of mammary stem\/progenitor cells and to tumor initiation and progression.","1307":"Myxobacteria are renowned for the ability to sporulate within fruiting bodies whose shapes are species-specific. The capacity to build those multicellular structures arises from the ability of M. xanthus to organize high cell-density swarms, in which the cells tend to be aligned with each other while constantly in motion. The intrinsic polarity of rod-shaped cells lays the foundation, and each cell uses two polar engines for gliding on surfaces. It sprouts retractile type IV pili from the leading cell pole and secretes capsular polysaccharide through nozzles from the trailing pole. Regularly periodic reversal of the gliding direction was found to be required for swarming. Those reversals are generated by a G-protein switch which is driven by a sharply tuned oscillator. Starvation induces fruiting body development, and systematic reductions in the reversal frequency are necessary for the cells to aggregate rather than continue to swarm. Developmental gene expression is regulated by a network that is connected to the suppression of reversals.","1308":"Orphan nuclear bodies are defined as nonchromatin nuclear compartments that have been less well studied compared with other well-characterized structures in the nucleus. Nuclear bodies have traditionally been thought of as uniform distinct entities depending on the protein \"markers\" they contain. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that nuclear bodies enriched in different sets of transcriptional regulators share a link to the ubiquitin-proteasome and SUMO-conjugation pathways. An emerging concept is that some orphan nuclear bodies might act as sites of protein modification by SUMO and\/or proteasomal degradation of ubiquitin-tagged proteins. By defining a specialized environment for protein modification and degradation, orphan nuclear bodies may increase the capacity of cells to survive under varying environmental conditions.","1309":"The adapter molecule LAT is a nucleating site for multiprotein signaling complexes that are vital for the function and differentiation of T cells. Extensive investigation of LAT in multiple experimental systems has led to an integrated understanding of the formation, composition, regulation, dynamic movement, and function of LAT-nucleated signaling complexes. This review discusses interactions of signaling molecules that bind directly or indirectly to LAT and the role of cooperativity in stabilizing LAT-nucleated signaling complexes. In addition, it focuses on how imaging studies visualize signaling assemblies as signaling clusters and demonstrate their dynamic nature and cellular fate. Finally, this review explores the function of LAT based on the interpretation of mouse models using various LAT mutants.","1310":"Because of the molecular complexity of the ribosome and protein synthesis, it is a challenge to imagine how translation could have evolved from a primitive RNA World. Two specific suggestions are made here to help to address this, involving separate evolution of the peptidyl transferase and decoding functions. First, it is proposed that translation originally arose not to synthesize functional proteins, but to provide simple (perhaps random) peptides that bound to RNA, increasing its available structure space, and therefore its functional capabilities. Second, it is proposed that the decoding site of the ribosome evolved from a mechanism for duplication of RNA. This process involved homodimeric \"duplicator RNAs,\" resembling the anticodon arms of tRNAs, which directed ligation of trinucleotides in response to an RNA template.","1311":"Although p53 is a major cancer preventive factor, under certain extreme stress conditions it may induce severe pathologies. Analyses of animal models indicate that p53 is largely responsible for the toxicity of ionizing radiation or DNA damaging drugs contributing to hematopoietic component of acute radiation syndrome and largely determining severe adverse effects of cancer treatment. p53-mediated damage is strictly tissue specific and occurs in tissues prone to p53-dependent apoptosis (e.g., hematopoietic system and hair follicles); on the contrary, p53 can serve as a survival factor in tissues that respond to p53 activation by cell cycle arrest (e.g., endothelium of small intestine). There are multiple experimental indications that p53 contributes to pathogenicity of acute ischemic diseases. Temporary reversible suppression of p53 by small molecules can be an effective and safe approach to reduce severity of p53-associated pathologies.","1312":"The origin of the p53 superfamily predates animal evolution and first appears in unicellular Flagellates. Invertebrate p53 superfamily members appear to have a p63-like domain structure, which seems to be evolutionarily ancient. The radiation into p53, p63, and p73 proteins is a vertebrate invention. In invertebrate models amenable to genetic analysis p53 superfamily members mainly act in apoptosis regulation in response to genotoxic agents and do not have overt developmental functions. We summarize the literature on cnidarian and mollusc p53 superfamily members and focus on the function and regulation of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans p53 superfamily members in triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence showing that invertebrate p53 superfamily proteins also have functions unrelated to apoptosis, such as DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint responses, compensatory proliferation, aging, autophagy, and innate immunity.","1313":"Axons follow highly stereotyped and reproducible trajectories to their targets. In this review we address the properties of the first pioneer neurons to grow in the developing nervous system and what has been learned over the past several decades about the extracellular and cell surface substrata on which axons grow. We then discuss the types of guidance cues and their receptors that influence axon extension, what determines where cues are expressed, and how axons respond to the cues they encounter in their environment.","1314":"Genomes are organized into complex higher-order structures by folding of the DNA into chromatin fibers, chromosome domains, and ultimately chromosomes. The higher-order organization of genomes is functionally important for gene regulation and control of gene expression programs. Defects in how chromatin is globally organized are relevant for physiological and pathological processes. Mutations and transcriptional misregulation of several global genome organizers are linked to human diseases and global alterations in chromatin structure are emerging as key players in maintenance of genome stability, aging, and the formation of cancer translocations.","1315":"Advances in microscopy automation and image analysis have given biologists the tools to attempt large scale systems-level experiments on biological systems using microscope image readout. Fluorescence microscopy has become a standard tool for assaying gene function in RNAi knockdown screens and protein localization studies in eukaryotic systems. Similar high throughput studies can be attempted in prokaryotes, though the difficulties surrounding work at the diffraction limit pose challenges, and targeting essential genes in a high throughput way can be difficult. Here we will discuss efforts to make live-cell fluorescent microscopy based experiments using genetically encoded fluorescent reporters an automated, high throughput, and quantitative endeavor amenable to systems-level experiments in bacteria. We emphasize a quantitative data reduction approach, using simulation to help develop biologically relevant cell measurements that completely characterize the cell image. We give an example of how this type of data can be directly exploited by statistical learning algorithms to discover functional pathways.","1316":"B-cell responses are initiated by the binding of foreign antigens to the clonally distributed B-cell receptors (BCRs) resulting in the triggering of signaling cascades that activate a variety of genes associated with B-cell activation. Although we now understand the molecular nature of the signaling pathways in considerable detail what remains only poorly understood are the mechanisms by which the information that antigen has bound to the BCR ectodomain is transduced across the B-cell membrane to the BCR cytoplasmic domains to trigger signaling. To a large part this gap in knowledge is because of the paucity of techniques to temporally and spatially resolve changes in the behavior of the BCR that occur within several seconds of antigen binding. With the advent of new live-cell imaging technologies we are gaining our first clear views of the events that lead up to the triggering of BCR signaling cascades. These events may provide potential new targets for therapeutic intervention in disease involving hyper or chronic activation of B cells.","1317":"The mammary gland is composed of a diverse array of cell types that form intricate interaction networks essential for its normal development and physiologic function. Abnormalities in these interactions play an important role throughout different stages of tumorigenesis. Branching ducts and alveoli are lined by an inner layer of secretory luminal epithelial cells that produce milk during lactation and are surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells and basement membrane. The surrounding stroma comprised of extracellular matrix and various cell types including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and infiltrating leukocytes not only provides a scaffold for the organ, but also regulates mammary epithelial cell function via paracrine, physical, and hormonal interactions. With rare exceptions breast tumors initiate in the epithelial compartment and in their initial phases are confined to the ducts but this barrier brakes down with invasive progression because of a combination of signals emitted by tumor epithelial and various stromal cells. In this article, we overview the importance of cellular interactions and microenvironmental signals in mammary gland development and cancer.","1318":"Paraspeckles are a relatively new class of subnuclear bodies found in the interchromatin space of mammalian cells. They are RNA-protein structures formed by the interaction between a long nonprotein-coding RNA species, NEAT1\/Men epsilon\/beta, and members of the DBHS (Drosophila Behavior Human Splicing) family of proteins: P54NRB\/NONO, PSPC1, and PSF\/SFPQ. Paraspeckles are critical to the control of gene expression through the nuclear retention of RNA containing double-stranded RNA regions that have been subject to adenosine-to-inosine editing. Through this mechanism paraspeckles and their components may ultimately have a role in controlling gene expression during many cellular processes including differentiation, viral infection, and stress responses.","1319":"The spatial pattern of branches within axonal or dendritic arbors and the relative arrangement of neighboring arbors with respect to one another impact a neuron's potential connectivity. Although arbors can adopt diverse branching patterns to suit their functions, evenly spread branches that avoid clumping or overlap are a common feature of many axonal and dendritic arbors. The degree of overlap between neighboring arbors innervating a surface is also characteristic within particular neuron types. The arbors of some populations of neurons innervate a target with a comprehensive and nonoverlapping \"tiled\" arrangement, whereas those of others show substantial territory overlap. This review focuses on cellular and molecular studies that have provided insight into the regulation of spatial arrangements of neurite branches within and between arbors. These studies have revealed principles that govern arbor arrangements in dendrites and axons in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Diverse molecular mechanisms controlling the spatial patterning of sister branches and neighboring arbors have begun to be elucidated.","1320":"DNA pumps play important roles in bacteria during cell division and during the transfer of genetic material by conjugation and transformation. The FtsK\/SpoIIIE proteins carry out the translocation of double-stranded DNA to ensure complete chromosome segregation during cell division. In contrast, the complex molecular machines that mediate conjugation and genetic transformation drive the transport of single stranded DNA. The transformation machine also processes this internalized DNA and mediates its recombination with the resident chromosome during and after uptake, whereas the conjugation apparatus processes DNA before transfer. This article reviews these three types of DNA pumps, with attention to what is understood of their molecular mechanisms, their energetics and their cellular localizations.","1321":"A major surprise arising from genome-wide analyses has been the observation that the majority of the genome is transcribed, generating noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). It is still an open question whether some or all of these ncRNAs constitute functional networks regulating gene transcriptional programs. However, in light of recent discoveries and given the diversity and flexibility of long ncRNAs and their abilities to nucleate molecular complexes and to form spatially compact arrays of complexes, it becomes likely that many or most ncRNAs act as sensors and integrators of a wide variety of regulated transcriptional responses and probably epigenetic events. Because many RNA-binding proteins, on binding RNAs, show distinct allosteric conformational alterations, we suggest that a ncRNA\/RNA-binding protein-based strategy, perhaps in concert with several other mechanistic strategies, serves to integrate transcriptional, as well as RNA processing, regulatory programs.","1322":"Earth is the one known example of an inhabited planet and to current knowledge the likeliest site of the one known origin of life. Here we discuss the origin of Earth's atmosphere and ocean and some of the environmental conditions of the early Earth as they may relate to the origin of life. A key punctuating event in the narrative is the Moon-forming impact, partly because it made Earth for a short time absolutely uninhabitable, and partly because it sets the boundary conditions for Earth's subsequent evolution. If life began on Earth, as opposed to having migrated here, it would have done so after the Moon-forming impact. What took place before the Moon formed determined the bulk properties of the Earth and probably determined the overall compositions and sizes of its atmospheres and oceans. What took place afterward animated these materials. One interesting consequence of the Moon-forming impact is that the mantle is devolatized, so that the volatiles subsequently fell out in a kind of condensation sequence. This ensures that the volatiles were concentrated toward the surface so that, for example, the oceans were likely salty from the start. We also point out that an atmosphere generated by impact degassing would tend to have a composition reflective of the impacting bodies (rather than the mantle), and these are almost without exception strongly reducing and volatile-rich. A consequence is that, although CO- or methane-rich atmospheres are not necessarily stable as steady states, they are quite likely to have existed as long-lived transients, many times. With CO comes abundant chemical energy in a metastable package, and with methane comes hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as important albeit less abundant gases.","1323":"How life emerged on this planet is one of the most important and fundamental questions of science. Although nearly all details concerning our origins have been lost in the depths of time, there is compelling evidence to suggest that the earliest life might have exploited the catalytic and self-recognition properties of RNA to survive. If an RNA based replicating system could be constructed in the laboratory, it would be much easier to understand the challenges associated with the very earliest steps in evolution and provide important insight into the establishment of the complex metabolic systems that now dominate this planet. Recent progress into the selection and characterization of ribozymes that promote nucleotide synthesis and RNA polymerization are discussed and outstanding problems in the field of RNA-mediated RNA replication are summarized.","1324":"Normal development of the mammary gland proceeds via interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme that start during embryogenesis and continue during pubertal outgrowth and differentiation. The function of specific peptide growth factors that bind members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and the cytokine receptor family are required at each stage. In many cases the peptides are produced in one compartment and act on receptors in the other compartment. One of the striking differences between normal development and cancer is the loss of this cross-talk. Mammary tumor cells often produce a peptide and express the receptor on the same cell leading to autocrine activation of signaling pathways, a mechanism that is characteristic for cancer cells. We will discuss different peptides in the context of normal development and cancer in this review.","1325":"The budding yeast nucleus, like those of other eukaryotic species, is highly organized with respect to both chromosomal sequences and enzymatic activities. At the nuclear periphery interactions of nuclear pores with chromatin, mRNA, and transport factors promote efficient gene expression, whereas centromeres, telomeres, and silent chromatin are clustered and anchored away from pores. Internal nuclear organization appears to be function-dependent, reflecting localized sites for tRNA transcription, rDNA transcription, ribosome assembly, and DNA repair. Recent advances have identified new proteins involved in the positioning of chromatin and have allowed testing of the functional role of higher-order chromatin organization. The unequal distribution of silent information regulatory factors and histone modifying enzymes, which arises in part from the juxtaposition of telomeric repeats, has been shown to influence chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. Other localization events suppress unwanted recombination. These findings highlight the contribution budding yeast genetics and cytology have made to dissecting the functional role of nuclear structure.","1326":"Sensory systems must map accurate representations of the external world in the brain. Although the physical senses of touch and vision build topographic representations of the spatial coordinates of the body and the field of view, the chemical sense of olfaction maps discontinuous features of chemical space, comprising an extremely large number of possible odor stimuli. In both mammals and insects, olfactory circuits are wired according to the convergence of axons from sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor. Synapses are organized into distinctive spherical neuropils--the olfactory glomeruli--that connect sensory input with output neurons and local modulatory interneurons. Although there is a strong conservation of form in the olfactory maps of mammals and insects, they arise using divergent mechanisms. Olfactory glomeruli provide a unique solution to the problem of mapping discontinuous chemical space onto the brain.","1327":"Astronomical observations have shown that carbonaceous compounds in the gas and solid state, refractory and icy are ubiquitous in our and distant galaxies. Interstellar molecular clouds and circumstellar envelopes are factories of complex molecular synthesis. A surprisingly large number of molecules that are used in contemporary biochemistry on Earth are found in the interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres and surfaces, comets, asteroids and meteorites, and interplanetary dust particles. In this article we review the current knowledge of abundant organic material in different space environments and investigate the connection between presolar and solar system material, based on observations of interstellar dust and gas, cometary volatiles, simulation experiments, and the analysis of extraterrestrial matter. Current challenges in astrochemistry are discussed and future research directions are proposed.","1328":"RNA interference (RNAi) provides a powerful reverse genetics approach to analyze gene functions both in tissue culture and in vivo. Because of its widespread applicability and effectiveness it has become an essential part of the tool box kits of model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and the mouse. In addition, the use of RNAi in animals in which genetic tools are either poorly developed or nonexistent enables a myriad of fundamental questions to be asked. Here, we review the methods and applications of in vivo RNAi to characterize gene functions in model organisms and discuss their impact to the study of developmental as well as evolutionary questions. Further, we discuss the applications of RNAi technologies to crop improvement, pest control and RNAi therapeutics, thus providing an appreciation of the potential for phenomenal applications of RNAi to agriculture and medicine.","1329":"The modern ribosome was largely formed at the time of the last common ancestor, LUCA. Hence its earliest origins likely lie in the RNA world. Central to its development were RNAs that spawned the modern tRNAs and a symmetrical region deep within the large ribosomal RNA, (rRNA), where the peptidyl transferase reaction occurs. To understand pre-LUCA developments, it is argued that events that are coupled in time are especially useful if one can infer a likely order in which they occurred. Using such timing events, the relative age of various proteins and individual regions within the large rRNA are inferred. An examination of the properties of modern ribosomes strongly suggests that the initial peptides made by the primitive ribosomes were likely enriched for l-amino acids, but did not completely exclude d-amino acids. This has implications for the nature of peptides made by the first ribosomes. From the perspective of ribosome origins, the immediate question regarding coding is when did it arise rather than how did the assignments evolve. The modern ribosome is very dynamic with tRNAs moving in and out and the mRNA moving relative to the ribosome. These movements may have become possible as a result of the addition of a template to hold the tRNAs. That template would subsequently become the mRNA, thereby allowing the evolution of the code and making an RNA genome useful. Finally, a highly speculative timeline of major events in ribosome history is presented and possible future directions discussed.","1330":"Following the publication of the Origin of Species in 1859, many naturalists adopted the idea that living organisms were the historical outcome of gradual transformation of lifeless matter. These views soon merged with the developments of biochemistry and cell biology and led to proposals in which the origin of protoplasm was equated with the origin of life. The heterotrophic origin of life proposed by Oparin and Haldane in the 1920s was part of this tradition, which Oparin enriched by transforming the discussion of the emergence of the first cells into a workable multidisciplinary research program. On the other hand, the scientific trend toward understanding biological phenomena at the molecular level led authors like Troland, Muller, and others to propose that single molecules or viruses represented primordial living systems. The contrast between these opposing views on the origin of life represents not only contrasting views of the nature of life itself, but also major ideological discussions that reached a surprising intensity in the years following Stanley Miller's seminal result which showed the ease with which organic compounds of biochemical significance could be synthesized under putative primitive conditions. In fact, during the years following the Miller experiment, attempts to understand the origin of life were strongly influenced by research on DNA replication and protein biosynthesis, and, in socio-political terms, by the atmosphere created by Cold War tensions. The catalytic versatility of RNA molecules clearly merits a critical reappraisal of Muller's viewpoint. However, the discovery of ribozymes does not imply that autocatalytic nucleic acid molecules ready to be used as primordial genes were floating in the primitive oceans, or that the RNA world emerged completely assembled from simple precursors present in the prebiotic soup. The evidence supporting the presence of a wide range of organic molecules on the primitive Earth, including membrane-forming compounds, suggests that the evolution of membrane-bounded molecular systems preceded cellular life on our planet, and that life is the evolutionary outcome of a process, not of a single, fortuitous event.","1331":"CD28 costimulation regulates a wide range of cellular processes, from proliferation and survival to promoting the differentiation of specialized T-cell subsets. Since first being identified over 20 years ago, CD28 has remained a subject of intense study because of its profound consequences on T cell function and its potential for therapeutic manipulation. In this review we highlight the signaling cascades initiated by the major signaling motifs in CD28, focusing on PI-3 kinase-dependent and -independent pathways and how these are linked to specific cellular outcomes. Recent studies using gene targeted knockin mice have clarified the relative importance of these motifs on in vivo immune responses; however, much remains to be elucidated. Understanding the mechanism behind costimulation holds great potential for development of new clinically relevant reagents, a fact beginning to be realized with the advent of drugs that prevent CD28 ligation and signaling.","1332":"In a bilaterally symmetric animal, the midline plays a key role in directing axon growth during wiring of the nervous system. Midline cells provide a variety of guidance cues for growing axons, to which different types of axons respond in different ways and at different times. For some axons, the midline is an intermediate target. They first seek it out, but then move on towards their final targets on the opposite side. For others, the midline is a repulsive barrier that keeps them on their own side of the midline. And for many of these axons the midline provides signals that guide them along specific lateral pathways or up and down the longitudinal axis.","1333":"The ability to form biofilms is a universal attribute of bacteria. Biofilms are multicellular communities held together by a self-produced extracellular matrix. The mechanisms that different bacteria employ to form biofilms vary, frequently depending on environmental conditions and specific strain attributes. In this review, we emphasize four well-studied model systems to give an overview of how several organisms form biofilms: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Using these bacteria as examples, we discuss the key features of biofilms as well as mechanisms by which extracellular signals trigger biofilm formation.","1334":"Self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells. We review the importance of vesicles during the origins of life, fundamental thermodynamics and kinetics of self-assembly, and experimental models of simple vesicles, focusing on prebiotically plausible fatty acids and their derivatives. We review recent work on interactions of simple vesicles with RNA and other studies of the transition from vesicles to protocells. Finally we discuss current challenges in understanding the biophysics of protocells, as well as conceptual questions in information transmission and self-replication.","1335":"Genetic screens were for long the prerogative of those that studied model organisms. The discovery in 2001 that gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) can also be brought about in mammalian cells paved the way for large scale loss-of-function genetic screens in higher organisms. In this article, we describe how functional genetic studies can help us understand the biology of breast cancer, how it can be used to identify novel targets for breast cancer therapy, and how it can help in the identification of those patients that are most likely to respond to a given therapy.","1336":"The Tec family tyrosine kinases regulate lymphocyte development, activation, and differentiation. In T cells, the predominant Tec kinase is Itk, which functions downstream of the T-cell receptor to regulate phospholipase C-gamma. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of Itk kinase structure and enzymatic regulation, focusing on Itk protein domain interactions and mechanisms of substrate recognition. We also discuss the role of Itk in the development of conventional versus innate T-cell lineages, including both alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell subsets. Finally, we describe the complex role of Itk signaling in effector T-cell differentiation and the regulation of cytokine gene expression. Together, these data implicate Itk as an important modulator of T-cell signaling and function.","1337":"The regenerative capacity of injured adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) tissue is very limited. Disease or injury that causes destruction or damage to neuronal networks typically results in permanent neurological deficits. Injury to the spinal cord, for example, interrupts vital ascending and descending fiber tracts of spinally projecting neurons. Because neuronal structures located proximal or distal to the injury site remain largely intact, a major goal of spinal cord injury research is to develop strategies to reestablish innervation lost as a consequence of injury. The growth inhibitory nature of injured adult CNS tissue is a major barrier to regenerative axonal growth and sprouting. An increasing complexity of molecular players is being recognized. CNS inhibitors fall into three general classes: members of canonical axon guidance molecules (e.g., semaphorins, ephrins, netrins), prototypic myelin inhibitors (Nogo, MAG, and OMgp) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (lecticans, NG2). On the other end of the spectrum are molecules that promote neuronal growth and sprouting. These include growth promoting extracellular matrix molecules, cell adhesion molecules, and neurotrophic factors. In addition to environmental (extrinsic) growth regulatory cues, cell intrinsic regulatory mechanisms exist that greatly influence injury-induced neuronal growth. Various degrees of growth and sprouting of injured CNS neurons have been achieved by lowering extrinsic inhibitory cues, increasing extrinsic growth promoting cues, or by activation of cell intrinsic growth programs. More recently, combination therapies that activate growth promoting programs and at the same time attenuate growth inhibitory pathways have met with some success. In experimental animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI), mono and combination therapies have been shown to promote neuronal growth and sprouting. Anatomical growth often correlates with improved behavioral outcomes. Challenges ahead include testing whether some of the most promising treatment strategies in animal models are also beneficial for human patients suffering from SCI.","1338":"The T cell receptor (TCR) is responsible for discriminating between self- and foreign-derived peptides, translating minute differences in amino-acid sequence into large differences in response. Because of the great variability in the TCR and its ligands, activation of T cells by foreign peptides is a quantitative process, dependent on a mix of upstream signals and downstream integration. Accordingly, quantitative data and computational models have shed light on many important aspects of this process: molecular noise in ligand recognition, spatial dynamics in T cell-APC (antigen presenting cell) interactions, graded versus all-or-none decision making by the TCR apparatus, mechanisms of peptide antagonism and synergism, and the tunability and robustness of activation thresholds. Though diverse in their formalism, these studies together paint a picture of how modeling has shaped and will continue to shape understanding of T cell immunobiology.","1339":"Understanding the origin of life requires knowledge not only of the origin of biological molecules such as amino acids, nucleotides and their polymers, but also the manner in which those molecules are integrated into the organized systems that characterize cellular life. In this article, we introduce a constructive approach to understand how biological molecules can be arranged to achieve a higher-order biological function: replication of genetic information.","1340":null,"1341":"A sparse geological record combined with physics and molecular phylogeny constrains the environmental conditions on the early Earth. The Earth began hot after the moon-forming impact and cooled to the point where liquid water was present in approximately 10 million years. Subsequently, a few asteroid impacts may have briefly heated surface environments, leaving only thermophile survivors in kilometer-deep rocks. A warm 500 K, 100 bar CO(2) greenhouse persisted until subducted oceanic crust sequestered CO(2) into the mantle. It is not known whether the Earth's surface lingered in a approximately 70 degrees C thermophile environment well into the Archaean or cooled to clement or freezing conditions in the Hadean. Recently discovered approximately 4.3 Ga rocks near Hudson Bay may have formed during the warm greenhouse. Alkalic rocks in India indicate carbonate subduction by 4.26 Ga. The presence of 3.8 Ga black shales in Greenland indicates that S-based photosynthesis had evolved in the oceans and likely Fe-based photosynthesis and efficient chemical weathering on land. Overall, mantle derived rocks, especially kimberlites and similar CO(2)-rich magmas, preserve evidence of subducted upper oceanic crust, ancient surface environments, and biosignatures of photosynthesis.","1342":"Signal transduction by the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) is initiated by phosphorylation of conserved motifs (ITAMs) contained within the cytoplasmic domains of the invariant subunits. TCR complexes contain a total of 10 ITAMs and this unusual configuration has prompted studies of the role of specific ITAMs, or of ITAM multiplicity, in regulating TCR-directed developmental and effector responses. Here, we summarize data generated during the past two decades and discuss how these findings have in some cases resolved, and in others complicated, outstanding questions relating to the function of TCR ITAMs.","1343":"Forward and reverse genetic experiments have both played important roles in revealing critical aspects of mammalian signal transduction pathways in cell culture experiments. Only recently have we begun to comprehend the depth, breadth, and complexity of these pathways and of their interrelationships. Here, we summarize successful examples in which different forward genetic approaches have led to novel discoveries in NF-kappaB signaling. We believe that forward genetics will continue to play an irreplaceable role in advancing our understanding of the complexities of the pathways that regulate the functions of this key transcription factor.","1344":"Axon pruning and neuronal cell death constitute two major regressive events that enable the establishment of fully mature brain architecture and connectivity. Although the cellular mechanisms for these two events are thought to be distinct, recent evidence has indicated the direct involvement of axon guidance molecules, including semaphorins, netrins, and ephrins, in controlling both processes. Here, we review how axon guidance cues regulate regressive events in paradigmatic models of neural development, from early control of apoptosis of neural progenitors, to later maintenance of neuronal survival and stereotyped pruning of axonal branches. These new findings are also discussed in the context of neural diseases and the potential links between axon pruning and degeneration.","1345":"A plant's roots system determines both the capacity of a sessile organism to acquire nutrients and water, as well as providing a means to monitor the soil for a range of environmental conditions. Since auxins were first described, there has been a tight connection between this class of hormones and root development. Here we review some of the latest genetic, molecular, and cellular experiments that demonstrate the importance of generating and maintaining auxin gradients during root development. Refinements in the ability to monitor and measure auxin levels in root cells coupled with advances in our understanding of the sources of auxin that contribute to these pools represent important contributions to our understanding of how this class of hormones participates in the control of root development. In addition, we review the role of identified molecular components that convert auxin gradients into local differentiation events, which ultimately defines the root architecture.","1346":"A common ancestor to the three p53 family members of human genes p53, p63, and p73 is first detected in the evolution of modern-day sea anemones, in which both structurally and functionally it acts to protect the germ line from genomic instabilities in response to stresses. This p63\/p73 common ancestor gene is found in almost all invertebrates and first duplicates to produce a p53 gene and a p63\/p73 ancestor in cartilaginous fish. Bony fish contain all three genes, p53, p63, and p73, and the functions of these three transcription factors diversify in the higher vertebrates. Thus, this gene family has preserved its structural features and functional activities for over one billion years of evolution.","1347":"Even 30 years after its discovery, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is still somewhat of an enigma. p53's intimate and multifaceted role in the cell cycle is mirrored in its equally complex structural biology that is being unraveled only slowly. Here, we discuss key structural aspects of p53 function and its inactivation by oncogenic mutations. Concerted action of folded and intrinsically disordered domains of the highly dynamic p53 protein provides binding promiscuity and specificity, allowing p53 to process a myriad of cellular signals to maintain the integrity of the human genome. Importantly, progress in elucidating the structural biology of p53 and its partner proteins has opened various avenues for structure-guided rescue of p53 function in tumors. These emerging anticancer strategies include targeting mutant-specific lesions on the surface of destabilized cancer mutants with small molecules and selective inhibition of p53's degradative pathways.","1348":"Nuclear stress bodies (nSBs) are unique subnuclear organelles which form in response to heat shock. They are initiated through a direct interaction between heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and pericentric tandem repeats of satellite III sequences and correspond to active transcription sites for noncoding satellite III transcripts. Given their unusual features, nSBs are distinct from other known transcription sites. In stressed cells, they are thought to participate in rapid, transient, and global reprogramming of gene expression through different types of mechanisms including chromatin remodeling and trapping of transcription and splicing factors. The analysis of these atypical and intriguing structures uncovers new facets of the relationship between nuclear organization and nuclear function.","1349":"Recent genetic evidence has established a pathogenetic role for NF-kappaB signaling in cancer. NF-kappaB signaling is engaged transiently when normal B lymphocytes respond to antigens, but lymphomas derived from these cells accumulate genetic lesions that constitutively activate NF-kappaB signaling. Many genetic aberrations in lymphomas alter CARD11, MALT1, or BCL10, which constitute a signaling complex that is intermediate between the B-cell receptor and IkappaB kinase. The activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma activates NF-kappaB by a variety of mechanisms including oncogenic mutations in CARD11 and a chronic active form of B-cell receptor signaling. Normal plasma cells activate NF-kappaB in response to ligands in the bone marrow microenvironment, but their malignant counterpart, multiple myeloma, sustains a variety of genetic hits that stabilize the kinase NIK, leading to constitutive activation of the classical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways. Various oncogenic abnormalities in epithelial cancers, including mutant K-ras, engage unconventional IkappaB kinases to activate NF-kappaB. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB signaling in each of these cancer types induces apoptosis, providing a rationale for the development of NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.","1350":"The identity of the auxin receptor(s) and the mechanism of auxin perception has been a subject of intense interest since the discovery of auxin almost a century ago. The development of genetic approaches to the study of plant hormone signaling led to the discovery that auxin acts by promoting degradation of transcriptional repressors called Aux\/IAA proteins. This process requires a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) called SCF(TIR1) and related SCF complexes. Surprisingly, auxin works by directly binding to TIR1, the F-box protein subunit of this SCF. Structural studies demonstrate that auxin acts like a \"molecular glue,\" to stabilize the interaction between TIR1 and the Aux\/IAA substrate. These exciting results solve an old problem in plant biology and reveal new mechanisms for E3 regulation and hormone perception.","1351":"Wiring of the brain relies initially on the correct outgrowth of axons to reach the appropriate target area for innervation. A large number of guidance receptors present in the plasma membrane of axonal growth cones and elsewhere on the neuron read and execute directional cues present in the extracellular environment of the navigating growth cone. The exact timing, levels, and localization of expression of the guidance receptors in the plasma membrane therefore determine the outcome of guidance decisions. Many guidance receptors are localized in exquisitely precise spatial and temporal patterns. The cellular mechanisms ensuring these localization patterns include spatially accurate sorting after synthesis in the secretory pathway, retrieval of inappropriately expressed receptors by endocytosis followed by degradation or recycling, and restriction of diffusion. This article will discuss the machinery and regulation underlying the restricted distribution of membrane receptors, focusing on the currently best-studied example, the L1 cell adhesion molecule. In addition to the long-range mechanisms ensuring appropriate localization, the same mechanisms can act locally to adjust levels and localization of receptors. These local mechanisms are regulated by ligand binding and subsequent activation of local signaling cascades. It is likely that the localization of all guidance receptors is regulated by a combination of sorting, retrieval, recycling and retention, similar to the ones we discuss here for L1.","1352":"The Cajal body (CB) is a nuclear organelle present in all eukaryotes that have been carefully studied. It is identified by the signature protein coilin and by CB-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). CBs contain high concentrations of splicing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other RNA processing factors, suggesting that they are sites for assembly and\/or posttranscriptional modification of the splicing machinery of the nucleus. The histone locus body (HLB) contains factors required for processing histone pre-mRNAs. As its name implies, the HLB is associated with the genes that code for histones, suggesting that it may function to concentrate processing factors at their site of action. CBs and HLBs are present throughout the interphase of the cell cycle, but disappear during mitosis. The biogenesis of CBs shows the features of a self-organizing structure.","1353":"Organic chemistry on a planetary scale is likely to have transformed carbon dioxide and reduced carbon species delivered to an accreting Earth. According to various models for the origin of life on Earth, biological molecules that jump-started Darwinian evolution arose via this planetary chemistry. The grandest of these models assumes that ribonucleic acid (RNA) arose prebiotically, together with components for compartments that held it and a primitive metabolism that nourished it. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to identify possible prebiotic chemistry that might have created RNA. Organic molecules, given energy, have a well-known propensity to form multiple products, sometimes referred to collectively as \"tar\" or \"tholin.\" These mixtures appear to be unsuited to support Darwinian processes, and certainly have never been observed to spontaneously yield a homochiral genetic polymer. To date, proposed solutions to this challenge either involve too much direct human intervention to satisfy many in the community, or generate molecules that are unreactive \"dead ends\" under standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Carbohydrates, organic species having carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in a ratio of 1:2:1 and an aldehyde or ketone group, conspicuously embody this challenge. They are components of RNA and their reactivity can support both interesting spontaneous chemistry as part of a \"carbohydrate world,\" but they also easily form mixtures, polymers and tars. We describe here the latest thoughts on how on this challenge, focusing on how it might be resolved using minerals containing borate, silicate, and molybdate, inter alia.","1354":"A general approach for modeling the architecture of large and structured RNA molecules is described. The method exploits the modularity and the hierarchical folding of RNA architecture that is viewed as the assembly of preformed double-stranded helices defined by Watson-Crick base pairs and RNA modules maintained by non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Despite the extensive molecular neutrality observed in RNA structures, specificity in RNA folding is achieved through global constraints like lengths of helices, coaxiality of helical stacks, and structures adopted at the junctions of helices. The Assemble integrated suite of computer tools allows for sequence and structure analysis as well as interactive modeling by homology or ab initio assembly with possibilities for fitting within electronic density maps. The local key role of non-Watson-Crick pairs guides RNA architecture formation and offers metrics for assessing the accuracy of three-dimensional models in a more useful way than usual root mean square deviation (RMSD) values.","1355":"Eukaryotic gene expression is an intricate multistep process, regulated within the cell nucleus through the activation or repression of RNA synthesis, processing, cytoplasmic export, and translation into protein. The major regulators of gene expression are chromatin remodeling and transcription machineries that are locally recruited to genes. However, enzymatic activities that act on genes are not ubiquitously distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, but limited to specific and spatially defined foci that promote preferred higher-order chromatin arrangements. The positioning of genes within the nuclear landscape relative to specific functional landmarks plays an important role in gene regulation and disease.","1356":"p73 and p63 are two homologs of the tumor suppressive transcription factor p53. Given the high degree of structural similarity shared by the p53 family members, p73 and p63 can bind and activate transcription from the majority of the p53-responsive promoters. Besides overlapping functions shared with p53 (i.e., induction of apoptosis in response to cellular stress), the existence of extensive structural variability within the family determines unique roles for p63 and p73. Their crucial and specific functions in controlling development and differentiation are well exemplified by the p63 and p73 knockout mouse phenotypes. Here, we describe the contribution of p63 and p73 to human pathology with emphasis on their roles in tumorigenesis and development.","1357":"Understanding the origin of cellular life on Earth requires the discovery of plausible pathways for the transition from complex prebiotic chemistry to simple biology, defined as the emergence of chemical assemblies capable of Darwinian evolution. We have proposed that a simple primitive cell, or protocell, would consist of two key components: a protocell membrane that defines a spatially localized compartment, and an informational polymer that allows for the replication and inheritance of functional information. Recent studies of vesicles composed of fatty-acid membranes have shed considerable light on pathways for protocell growth and division, as well as means by which protocells could take up nutrients from their environment. Additional work with genetic polymers has provided insight into the potential for chemical genome replication and compatibility with membrane encapsulation. The integration of a dynamic fatty-acid compartment with robust, generalized genetic polymer replication would yield a laboratory model of a protocell with the potential for classical Darwinian biological evolution, and may help to evaluate potential pathways for the emergence of life on the early Earth. Here we discuss efforts to devise such an integrated protocell model.","1358":"The mammary gland is an epidermal appendage that begins to form during embryogenesis, but whose development is only completed during pregnancy. Each mammary gland begins as a budlike invagination of the surface ectoderm, which then gives rise to a simple duct system by birth. Subsequent development occurs during sexual maturation and during pregnancy and lactation. In this review, we outline the distinct stages of embryonic mammary development and discuss the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of morphogenesis at each stage. We also discuss the potential relevance of embryonic breast development to the pathophysiology of breast cancer and highlight questions for future research.","1359":"Inactivation of p53 functions is an almost universal feature of human cancer cells. This has spurred a tremendous effort to develop p53 based cancer therapies. Gene therapy using wild-type p53, delivered by adenovirus vectors, is now in widespread use in China. Other biologic approaches include the development of oncolytic viruses designed to replicate and kill only p53 defective cells and also the development of siRNA and antisense RNA's that activate p53 by inhibiting the function of the negative regulators Mdm2, MdmX, and HPV E6. The altered processing of p53 that occurs in tumor cells can elicit T-cell and B-cell responses to p53 that could be effective in eliminating cancer cells and p53 based vaccines are now in clinical trial. A number of small molecules that directly or indirectly activate the p53 response have also reached the clinic, of which the most advanced are the p53 mdm2 interaction inhibitors. Increased understanding of the p53 response is also allowing the development of powerful drug combinations that may increase the selectivity and safety of chemotherapy, by selective protection of normal cells and tissues.","1360":"The mammalian brain is the most complex organ in the body. It controls all aspects of our bodily functions and interprets the world around us through our senses. It defines us as human beings through our memories and our ability to plan for the future. Crucial to all these functions is how the brain is wired in order to perform these tasks. The basic map of brain wiring occurs during embryonic and postnatal development through a series of precisely orchestrated developmental events regulated by specific molecular mechanisms. Below we review the most important features of mammalian brain wiring derived from work in both mammals and in nonmammalian species. These mechanisms are highly conserved throughout evolution, simply becoming more complex in the mammalian brain. This fascinating area of biology is uncovering the essence of what makes the mammalian brain able to perform the everyday tasks we take for granted, as well as those which give us the ability for extraordinary achievement.","1361":"Thirty years of research on the p53 family of genes has generated almost fifty thousand publications. The first of these papers detected the p53 protein associated with a viral oncogene product in transformed cells and tumors and focused the field on cancer biology. Subsequent manuscripts have shown a wide variety of functions for the p53 family of genes and their proteins. These proteins are involved in reproduction, genomic repair, fidelity and recombination, the regulation of metabolic processes, longevity, surveillance of the stability of development, the production of stem cells and changes in epigenetic marks, the development of the nervous system (p73), the immune system (p73) and skin (p63), as well as the better known roles for the family in tumor suppression. The p53 family of genes has been found in the modern day ancestors of organisms with over one billion years of evolutionary history where they play a role in germ-line fidelity over that time span. As the body plan of the vertebrates emerged with the regeneration of tissues by stem cells over a lifetime, the p53 gene and its protein were adapted to be a tumor suppressor of somatic stem and progenitor cells complementing its' past functions in the germ line. Because the p53 family of genes has played a role in germ-line fidelity and preservation of the species, even in times of stress, these genes have been under constant selection pressure to change and adapt to new situations. This has given rise to this diversity of functions all working to preserve homeostatic processes that permit growth and reproduction in a world that is constantly challenging the fidelity of information transfer at each generation. The p53 family of gene products has influenced the rates of evolutionary change, just as evolutionary changes have altered the p53 family and its functions.","1362":"Group II introns are mobile ribozymes that self-splice from precursor RNAs to yield excised intron lariat RNAs, which then invade new genomic DNA sites by reverse splicing. The introns encode a reverse transcriptase that stabilizes the catalytically active RNA structure for forward and reverse splicing, and afterwards converts the integrated intron RNA back into DNA. The characteristics of group II introns suggest that they or their close relatives were evolutionary ancestors of spliceosomal introns, the spliceosome, and retrotransposons in eukaryotes. Further, their ribozyme-based DNA integration mechanism enabled the development of group II introns into gene targeting vectors (\"targetrons\"), which have the unique feature of readily programmable DNA target specificity.","1363":"Since the structure of DNA was elucidated more than 50 years ago, Watson-Crick base pairing has been widely speculated to be the likely mode of both information storage and transfer in the earliest genetic polymers. The discovery of catalytic RNA molecules subsequently provided support for the hypothesis that RNA was perhaps even the first polymer of life. However, the de novo synthesis of RNA using only plausible prebiotic chemistry has proven difficult, to say the least. Experimental investigations, made possible by the application of synthetic and physical organic chemistry, have now provided evidence that the nucleobases (A, G, C, and T\/U), the trifunctional moiety ([deoxy]ribose), and the linkage chemistry (phosphate esters) of contemporary nucleic acids may be optimally suited for their present roles-a situation that suggests refinement by evolution. Here, we consider studies of variations in these three distinct components of nucleic acids with regard to the question: Is RNA, as is generally acknowledged of DNA, the product of evolution? If so, what chemical and structural features might have been more likely and advantageous for a proto-RNA?","1364":"Simple visual inspection of bacteria indicated that, at least in some otherwise symmetric cells, structures such as flagella were often seen at a single pole. Because these structures are composed of proteins, it was not clear how to reconcile these observations of morphological asymmetry with the widely held view of bacteria as unstructured \"bags of enzymes.\" However, over the last decade, numerous GFP tagged proteins have been found at specific intracellular locations such as the poles of the cells, indicating that bacteria have a high degree of intracellular organization. Here we will explore the role of chromosomal asymmetry and the presence of \"new\" and \"old\" poles that result from the cytokinesis of rod-shaped cells in establishing bipolar and monopolar protein localization patterns. This article is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive, so we have focused on examples drawn largely from Caulobacter crescentus and Bacillus subtilis, two bacteria that undergo dramatic morphological transformation. We will highlight how breaking monopolar symmetry is essential for the correct development of these organisms.","1365":"We review the role of cadherins and cadherin-related proteins in human cancer. Cellular and animal models for human cancer are also dealt with whenever appropriate. E-cadherin is the prototype of the large cadherin superfamily and is renowned for its potent malignancy suppressing activity. Different mechanisms for inactivating E-cadherin\/CDH1 have been identified in human cancers: inherited and somatic mutations, aberrant protein processing, increased promoter methylation, and induction of transcriptional repressors such as Snail and ZEB family members. The latter induce epithelial mesenchymal transition, which is also associated with induction of \"mesenchymal\" cadherins, a hallmark of tumor progression. VE-cadherin\/CDH5 plays a role in tumor-associated angiogenesis. The atypical T-cadherin\/CDH13 is often silenced in cancer cells but up-regulated in tumor vasculature. The review also covers the status of protocadherins and several other cadherin-related molecules in human cancer. Perspectives for emerging cadherin-related anticancer therapies are given.","1366":"Nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segments of myelinated nerves, sites of cell-cell contact in early embryos and epithelial cells, and neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle all perform physiological functions that depend on clustering of functionally related but structurally diverse ion transporters and cell adhesion molecules within microdomains of the plasma membrane. These specialized cell surface domains appeared at different times in metazoan evolution, involve a variety of cell types, and are populated by distinct membrane-spanning proteins. Nevertheless, recent work has shown that these domains all share on their cytoplasmic surfaces a membrane skeleton comprised of members of the ankyrin and spectrin families. This review will summarize basic features of ankyrins and spectrins, and will discuss emerging evidence that these proteins are key players in a conserved mechanism responsible for assembly and maintenance of physiologically important domains on the surfaces of diverse cells.","1367":"The adherens junction (AJ) is an element of the cell-cell junction in which cadherin receptors bridge the neighboring plasma membranes via their homophilic interactions. Cadherins associate with cytoplasmic proteins, called catenins, which in turn bind to cytoskeletal components, such as actin filaments and microtubules. These molecular complexes further interact with other proteins, including signaling molecules, rendering the AJs into highly dynamic and regulatable structures. The AJs of such nature contribute to the physical linking of cells, as well as to the regulation of cell-cell contacts, which is essential for morphogenesis and remodeling of tissues and organs. Thus, elucidating the molecular architecture of the AJs and their regulatory mechanisms are crucial for understanding how the multicellular system is organized.","1368":"The nuclear factor NF-kappaB pathway has long been considered a prototypical proinflammatory signaling pathway, largely based on the role of NF-kappaB in the expression of proinflammatory genes including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. In this article, we describe how genetic evidence in mice has revealed complex roles for the NF-kappaB in inflammation that suggest both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles for this pathway. NF-kappaB has long been considered the \"holy grail\" as a target for new anti-inflammatory drugs; however, these recent studies suggest this pathway may prove a difficult target in the treatment of chronic disease. In this article, we discuss the role of NF-kappaB in inflammation in light of these recent studies.","1369":"Flowering plants have evolved sophisticated and complicated reproductive structures to ensure optimal conditions for the next generation. Successful reproduction relies on careful timing and coordination of tissue development, which requires constant communication between these tissues. Work on flower and fruit development over the last decade places the phytohormone auxin in a key role as a master of patterning and tissue specification of reproductive organs. Although many questions still remain, it is now clear that auxin mediates its function in flowers and fruits through an integrated process of biosynthesis, transport, and signaling, as well as interaction with other hormonal pathways. In addition, the knowledge obtained so far about auxin function already allows researchers to develop tools for crop improvement and precision agriculture.","1370":"Light is vital for plant growth and development: It provides energy for photosynthesis, but also reliable information on seasonal timing and local habitat conditions. Light sensing is therefore of paramount importance for plants. Thus, plants have evolved sophisticated light receptors and signaling networks that detect and respond to changes in light intensity, duration, and spectral quality. Environmental light signals can drive developmental transitions such as germination and flowering, but they also continuously shape development to allow adaptation to the local habitat and microclimate. The ability to respond to a changing and sometimes unfavorable environment underlies the huge success of plants. Much of this growth and developmental plasticity is achieved by light modulation of auxin signaling systems. In this article, we examine the connections between light and auxin that elicit local responses, long distance signaling, and coordinated growth between the shoot and root.","1371":"Few mechanisms provide alternatives to morphogen gradients for producing spatial patterns of cells in development. One possibility is based on the sorting out of cells that initially differentiate in a salt and pepper mixture and then physically move to create coherent tissues. Here, we describe the evidence suggesting this is the major mode of patterning in Dictyostelium. In addition, we discuss whether convergent evolution could have produced a conceptually similar mechanism in other organisms.","1372":"The p53 tumor suppressor is a multifaceted transcription factor that responds to a diverse array of stresses that include DNA damage and aberrant oncogene signaling. On activation, p53 prevents the emergence of cancer cells by initiating cell cycle arrest, senescence (terminal cell cycle arrest), or apoptosis. Although its role in assuring longevity by suppressing cancer is well established, recent studies obtained largely from genetically engineered mouse models suggest that p53 may regulate longevity and aging. In some contexts, it appears that altered p53 activity may enhance longevity, and in others, it appears to suppress longevity and accelerate aging phenotypes. Here, we discuss how genetically engineered mouse models have been used to explore antiproliferative functions of p53 in cancer suppression and how mouse models with altered aging phenotypes have shed light on how p53 might influence the aging process.","1373":"The p53 family of genes (p53, p63, and p73) is conserved over evolutionary time scales. Although the functions of p53 gene and its protein as a tumor suppressor have been firmly established, the earliest functions for the p53 ancestral genes in worms and flies are to ensure germ-line genomic integrity and the fidelity of the developmental process. In vertebrates, the p53 family of genes retains those functions in germ-line genomic integrity but have added important functions in regulation of reproduction. Loss of the p53, p63, or p73 genes in female mice leads to a significant decrease of fertility. The p53 gene product regulates maternal reproduction at the implantation stage of the embryo. p63 and p73 play important roles in monitoring the genomic quality of oocytes. The p53 pathway appears to play a similar role in human fertility. In humans, certain alleles containing a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the p53 pathway are under positive evolutionary selection. Selected alleles of these SNPs in the p53 pathway are associated with decreased fertility. This important function of the p53 pathway in reproduction provides a plausible explanation for the evolution of p53 as a tumor suppressor gene and the positive selection of some alleles in the p53 gene and its pathway. These observations provide a good possible example of antagonistic pleiotrophy for fertility, tumor suppression, and longevity.","1374":"The p53 protein is modified by as many as 50 individual posttranslational modifications. Many of these occur in response to genotoxic or nongenotoxic stresses and show interdependence, such that one or more modifications can nucleate subsequent events. This interdependent nature suggests a pathway that operates through multiple cooperative events as opposed to distinct functions for individual, isolated modifications. This concept, supported by recent investigations, which provide exquisite detail as to how various modifications mediate precise protein-protein interactions in a cooperative manner, may explain why knockin mice expressing p53 proteins substituted at one or just a few sites of modification typically show only subtle effects on p53 function. The present article focuses on recent, exciting progress and develops the idea that the impact of modification on p53 function is achieved through collective and integrated events.","1375":"The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways play a major role in Drosophila host defense. Two recognition and signaling cascades control this immune response. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria and by fungi, whereas the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway responds to Gram-negative bacterial infection. The basic mechanisms of recognition of these various types of microbial infections by the adult fly are now globally understood. Even though some elements are missing in the intracellular pathways, numerous proteins and interactions have been identified. In this article, we present a general picture of the immune functions of NF-kappaB in Drosophila with all the partners involved in recognition and in the signaling cascades.","1376":"The origins of the epithelial cells participating in the development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer of the human breast are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests a role for adult tissue-specific stem cells in these processes. In a hierarchical manner, these generate the two main mammary cell lineages, producing an increasing number of cells with distinct properties. Understanding the biological characteristics of human breast stem cells and their progeny is crucial in attempts to compare the features of normal stem cells and cancer precursor cells and distinguish these from nonprecursor cells and cells from the bulk of a tumor. A historical overview of research on human breast stem cells in primary tissue and in culture reveals the progress that has been made in this area, whereas a focus on the cell-of-origin and reprogramming that occurs during neoplastic conversion provides insight into the enigmatic way in which human breast cancers are skewed toward the luminal epithelial lineage.","1377":"ZAP-70 is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in the events involved in initiating T-cell responses by the antigen receptor. Here we review the structure of ZAP-70, its regulation, its role in development and in disease. We also describe a model experimental system in which ZAP-70 function can be interrupted by a small chemical inhibitor.","1378":"Crystalline surfaces of common rock-forming minerals are likely to have played several important roles in life's geochemical origins. Transition metal sulfides and oxides promote a variety of organic reactions, including nitrogen reduction, hydroformylation, amination, and Fischer-Tropsch-type synthesis. Fine-grained clay minerals and hydroxides facilitate lipid self-organization and condensation polymerization reactions, notably of RNA monomers. Surfaces of common rock-forming oxides, silicates, and carbonates select and concentrate specific amino acids, sugars, and other molecular species, while potentially enhancing their thermal stabilities. Chiral surfaces of these minerals also have been shown to separate left- and right-handed molecules. Thus, mineral surfaces may have contributed centrally to the linked prebiotic problems of containment and organization by promoting the transition from a dilute prebiotic \"soup\" to highly ordered local domains of key biomolecules.","1379":"The single-handedness of biological molecules has fascinated scientists and laymen alike since Pasteur's first painstaking separation of the enantiomorphic crystals of a tartrate salt more than 150 yr ago. More recently, a number of theoretical and experimental investigations have helped to delineate models for how one enantiomer might have come to dominate over the other from what presumably was a racemic prebiotic world. This article highlights mechanisms for enantioenrichment that include either chemical or physical processes, or a combination of both. The scientific driving force for this work arises from an interest in understanding the origin of life, because the homochirality of biological molecules is a signature of life.","1380":"Determining how axon guidance receptors transmit signals to allow precise pathfinding decisions is fundamental to our understanding of nervous system development and may suggest new strategies to promote axon regeneration after injury or disease. Signaling mechanisms that act downstream of four prominent families of axon guidance cues--netrins, semaphorins, ephrins, and slits--have been extensively studied in both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. Although details of these signaling mechanisms are still fragmentary and there appears to be considerable diversity in how different guidance receptors regulate the motility of the axonal growth cone, a number of common themes have emerged. Here, we review recent insights into how specific receptors for each of these guidance cues engage downstream regulators of the growth cone cytoskeleton to control axon guidance.","1381":"Endothelial cells (ECs) form extensive, highly branched and hierarchically organized tubular networks in vertebrates to ensure the proper distribution of molecular and cellular cargo in the vertebrate body. The growth of this vascular system during development, tissue repair or in disease conditions involves the sprouting, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in a process termed angiogenesis. Surprisingly, specialized ECs, so-called tip cells, which lead and guide endothelial sprouts, share many feature with another guidance structure, the axonal growth cone. Tip cells are motile, invasive and extend numerous filopodial protrusions sensing growth factors, extracellular matrix and other attractive or repulsive cues in their tissue environment. Axonal growth cones and endothelial tip cells also respond to signals belonging to the same molecular families, such as Slits and Roundabouts, Netrins and UNC5 receptors, Semaphorins, Plexins and Neuropilins, and Eph receptors and ephrin ligands. Here we summarize fundamental principles of angiogenic growth, the selection and function of tip cells and the underlying regulation by guidance cues, the Notch pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling.","1382":"The phytohormone auxin is a major regulator of plant growth and development. Many aspects of these processes depend on the multiple controls exerted by auxin on cell division and cell expansion. The detailed mechanisms by which auxin controls these essential cellular responses are still poorly understood, despite recent progress in the identification of auxin receptors and components of auxin signaling pathways. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the present knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the auxin control of cell division and cell expansion. In both cases, the involvement of at least two signaling pathways and of multiple targets of auxin action reflects the complexity of the subtle regulation of auxin-mediated cellular responses. In addition, it offers the necessary flexibility for generating differential responses within a given cell depending on its developmental context.","1383":"The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is central both in reducing cancer frequency in vertebrates and in mediating the response of commonly used cancer therapies. This article aims to summarize and discuss a large body of evidence suggesting that the p53 pathway harbors functional inherited single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect p53 signaling in cells, resulting in differences in cancer risk and clinical outcome in humans. The insights gained through these studies into how the functional p53 pathway SNPs could help in the tailoring of cancer therapies to the individual are discussed. Moreover, recent work is discussed that suggests that many more functional p53 pathway SNPs are yet to be fully characterized and that a thorough analysis of the functional human genetics of this important tumor suppressor pathway is required.","1384":"The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress that controls many biological functions, including implantation, cell-fate decisions, metabolism, and aging. In response to a defined stress signal such as gamma radiation, the response of p53 is heterogeneous in vivo. Like a complex barcode, the ability of p53 to function as a central hub that integrates defined stress signals into decisive cellular responses, in a time- and cell-type dependent manner, is facilitated by the extraordinary complexity of its regulation. Key components of this barcode are the autoregulation loops, which positively or negatively regulate p53's activities. Thus, this article focuses on reviewing our current understanding of how autoregulation loops formed between p53 and how its transcriptional targets regulate the activities of p53 at a variety of levels, through mdm2-dependent and -independent pathways. Knowing that a large number of autoregulation loops exist that influence p53's activity, our future challenge is to elucidate which of these play a central role in regulating p53, under which conditions, in response to what stress, and at which particular stage of our lives. Such knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of more effective anticancer therapeutics.","1385":"Historically basic neuroscience research has made several important contributions to the cell biology of the nucleus, in particular the elucidation of nuclear structures and compartments. As research progressed towards elucidating the mechanism of neurological disease at the cellular and molecular levels, it is now providing insight into the importance and basis of coordination of nuclear pathways within the nucleus and with other cellular compartments. Ataxias, lethal neurodegenerative diseases that are distinguished by a progressive loss of motor coordination, stem from disruption of nuclear function.","1386":"PML nuclear bodies are matrix-associated domains that recruit an astonishing variety of seemingly unrelated proteins. Since their discovery in the early 1960s, PML bodies have fascinated cell biologists because of their beauty and their tight association with cellular disorders. The identification of PML, a gene involved in an oncogenic chromosomal translocation, as the key organizer of these domains drew instant interest onto them. The multiple levels of PML body regulation by a specific posttranslational modification, sumoylation, have raised several unsolved issues. Functionally, PML bodies may sequester, modify or degrade partner proteins, but in many ways, PML bodies still constitute an enigma.","1387":"The primary role of the nucleus as an information storage, retrieval, and replication site requires the physical organization and compaction of meters of DNA. Although it has been clear for many years that nucleosomes constitute the first level of chromatin compaction, this contributes a relatively small fraction of the condensation needed to fit the typical genome into an interphase nucleus or set of metaphase chromosomes, indicating that there are additional \"higher order\" levels of chromatin condensation. Identifying these levels, their interrelationships, and the principles that govern their occurrence has been a challenging and much discussed problem. In this article, we focus on recent experimental advances and the emerging evidence indicating that structural plasticity and chromatin dynamics play dominant roles in genome organization. We also discuss novel approaches likely to yield important insights in the near future, and suggest research areas that merit further study.","1388":"The bacteria cell envelope is a complex multilayered structure that serves to protect these organisms from their unpredictable and often hostile environment. The cell envelopes of most bacteria fall into one of two major groups. Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by a thin peptidoglycan cell wall, which itself is surrounded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but are surrounded by layers of peptidoglycan many times thicker than is found in the gram-negatives. Threading through these layers of peptidoglycan are long anionic polymers, called teichoic acids. The composition and organization of these envelope layers and recent insights into the mechanisms of cell envelope assembly are discussed.","1389":"This article focuses on the functions of NF-kappaB that vitally impact lymphocytes and thus adaptive immunity. NF-kappaB has long been known to be essential for many of the responses of mature lymphocytes to invading pathogens. In addition, NF-kappaB has important functions in shaping the immune system so it is able to generate adaptive responses to pathogens. In both contexts, NF-kappaB executes critical cell-autonomous functions within lymphocytes as well as within supportive cells, such as antigen-presenting cells or epithelial cells. It is these aspects of NF-kappaB's physiologic impact that we address in this article.","1390":"It has normally been assumed that ribonucleotides arose on the early Earth through a process in which ribose, the nucleobases, and phosphate became conjoined. However, under plausible prebiotic conditions, condensation of nucleobases with ribose to give beta-ribonucleosides is fraught with difficulties. The reaction with purine nucleobases is low-yielding and the reaction with the canonical pyrimidine nucleobases does not work at all. The reasons for these difficulties are considered and an alternative high-yielding synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is discussed. Fitting the new synthesis to a plausible geochemical scenario is a remaining challenge but the prospects appear good. Discovery of an improved method of purine synthesis, and an efficient means of stringing activated nucleotides together, will provide underpinning support to those theories that posit a central role for RNA in the origins of life.","1391":"The T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex serves as a central paradigm for general principles of receptor assembly, ligand recognition, and signaling in the immune system. There is no other receptor system that matches the diversity of both receptor and ligand components. The recent expansion of the immunological structural database is beginning to identify key principles of MHC and peptide recognition. The multicomponent assembly of the TCR complex illustrates general principles used by many receptors in the immune system, which rely on basic and acidic transmembrane residues to guide assembly. The intrinsic binding of the cytoplasmic domains of the CD3epsilon and zeta chains to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane represents a novel mechanism for control of receptor activation: Insertion of critical CD3epsilon tyrosines into the hydrophobic membrane core prevents their phosphorylation before receptor engagement.","1392":"Evidence of past liquid water on the surface of Mars suggests that this world once had habitable conditions and leads to the question of life. If there was life on Mars, it would be interesting to determine if it represented a separate origin from life on Earth. To determine the biochemistry and genetics of life on Mars requires that we have access to an organism or the biological remains of one-possibly preserved in ancient permafrost. A way to determine if organic material found on Mars represents the remains of an alien biological system could be based on the observation that biological systems select certain organic molecules over others that are chemically similar (e.g., chirality in amino acids).","1393":"The adaptor protein SLP-76 is expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages including T cells, platelets, and neutrophils. SLP-76 mediated signaling is dependent on its multiple protein interaction domains, as it creates a scaffold on which key signaling complexes are built. SLP-76 is critical for supporting signaling downstream of both immunoreceptors and integrins. The signaling molecules used both upstream and downstream of SLP-76 are similar among these receptors and across cell types; however, important differences exist. Appreciating how SLP-76 coordinates signal transduction across different cell and receptor types provides insights into the complex interplay of pathways critical for activation of cells of the immune system that are essential for host defense.","1394":"The ability of neurons to form a single axon and multiple dendrites underlies the directional flow of information transfer in the central nervous system. Dendrites and axons are molecularly and functionally distinct domains. Dendrites integrate synaptic inputs, triggering the generation of action potentials at the level of the soma. Action potentials then propagate along the axon, which makes presynaptic contacts onto target cells. This article reviews what is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of neurons to initiate and extend a single axon during development. Remarkably, neurons can polarize to form a single axon, multiple dendrites, and later establish functional synaptic contacts in reductionist in vitro conditions. This approach became, and remains, the dominant model to study axon initiation and growth and has yielded the identification of many molecules that regulate axon formation in vitro (Dotti et al. 1988). At present, only a few of the genes identified using in vitro approaches have been shown to be required for axon initiation and outgrowth in vivo. In vitro, axon initiation and elongation are largely intrinsic properties of neurons that are established in the absence of relevant extracellular cues. However, the importance of extracellular cues to axon initiation and outgrowth in vivo is emerging as a major theme in neural development (Barnes and Polleux 2009). In this article, we focus our attention on the extracellular cues and signaling pathways required in vivo for axon initiation and axon extension.","1395":"A major goal of modern neuroscience research is to understand the cellular and molecular processes that control the formation, function, and remodeling of chemical synapses. In this article, we discuss the numerous studies that implicate molecules initially discovered for their functions in axon guidance as critical regulators of synapse formation and plasticity. Insights from these studies have helped elucidate basic principles of synaptogenesis, dendritic spine formation, and structural and functional synapse plasticity. In addition, they have revealed interesting dual roles for proteins and cellular mechanisms involved in both axon guidance and synaptogenesis. Much like the dual involvement of morphogens in early cell fate induction and axon guidance, many guidance-related molecules continue to play active roles in controlling the location, number, shape, and strength of neuronal synapses during development and throughout the lifetime of the organism. This article summarizes key findings that link axon guidance molecules to specific aspects of synapse formation and plasticity and discusses the emerging relationship between the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control both axon guidance and synaptogenesis.","1396":"Plants continuously generate new tissues and organs through the activity of populations of undifferentiated stem cells, called meristems. Here, we discuss the so-called shoot apical meristem (SAM), which generates all the aerial parts of the plant. It has been known for many years that auxin plays a central role in the functioning of this meristem. Auxin is not homogeneously distributed at the SAM and it is thought that this distribution is interpreted in terms of differential gene expression and patterned growth. In this context, auxin transporters of the PIN and AUX families, creating auxin maxima and minima, are crucial regulators. However, auxin transport is not the only factor involved. Auxin biosynthesis genes also show specific, patterned activities, and local auxin synthesis appears to be essential for meristem function as well. In addition, auxin perception and signal transduction defining the competence of cells to react to auxin, add further complexity to the issue. To unravel this intricate signaling network at the SAM, systems biology approaches, involving not only molecular genetics but also live imaging and computational modeling, have become increasingly important.","1397":"Studies in mice have yielded invaluable insight into our understanding of the p53 pathway. Mouse models with activated p53, no p53, and mutant p53 have queried the role of p53 in development and tumorigenesis. In these models, p53 is activated and stabilized via redundant posttranslational modifications. On activation, p53 initiates two major responses: inhibition of proliferation (via cell-cycle arrest, quiescence, senescence, and differentiation) and induction of apoptosis. Importantly, these responses are cell-type and tumor-type-specific. The analysis of mutant p53 alleles has established a gain-of-function role for p53 mutants in metastasis. The development of additional models that can precisely time the oncogenic events in single cells will provide further insight into the evolution of tumors, the importance of the stroma, and the cooperating events that lead to disruption of the p53 pathway. Ultimately, these models should serve to study the effects of novel drugs on tumor response as well as normal homeostasis.","1398":"During the course of tumorigenesis, cells acquire a number of alterations that contribute to the acquisition of the malignant phenotype, allowing them to survive and flourish in increasingly hostile environments. Cancer cells can be characterized by perturbations in the control of cell proliferation and growth, resistance to death, and alterations in their interactions with the microenvironment. Underpinning many of these changes are shifts in metabolism that allow cancer cells to use alternative pathways for energy production and building the macromolecules necessary for growth, as well as regulating the generation of signaling molecules such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the past few years, it became clear that p53, the most studied, if not most important, tumor suppressor protein, can also directly control metabolic traits of cells.","1399":"The discovery of the DNA double helix structure half a century ago immediately suggested a mechanism for its duplication by semi-conservative copying of the nucleotide sequence into two DNA daughter strands. Shortly after, a second fundamental step toward the elucidation of the mechanism of DNA replication was taken with the isolation of the first enzyme able to polymerize DNA from a template. In the subsequent years, the basic mechanism of DNA replication and its enzymatic machinery components were elucidated, mostly through genetic approaches and in vitro biochemistry. Most recently, the spatial and temporal organization of the DNA replication process in vivo within the context of chromatin and inside the intact cell are finally beginning to be elucidated. On the one hand, recent advances in genome-wide high throughput techniques are providing a new wave of information on the progression of genome replication at high spatial resolution. On the other hand, novel super-resolution microscopy techniques are just starting to give us the first glimpses of how DNA replication is organized within the context of single intact cells with high spatial resolution. The integration of these data with time lapse microscopy analysis will give us the ability to film and dissect the replication of the genome in situ and in real time.","1400":"Actin participates in several essential processes in the cell nucleus. Even though the presence of actin in the nucleus was proposed more than 30 years ago, nuclear processes that require actin have been only recently identified. Actin is part of chromatin remodeling complexes; it is associated with the transcription machineries; it becomes incorporated into newly synthesized ribonucleoproteins; and it influences long-range chromatin organization. As in the cytoplasm, nuclear actin works in conjunction with different types of actin-binding proteins that regulate actin function and bridge interactions between actin and other nuclear components.","1401":"A- and B-type lamins are the major intermediate filaments of the nucleus. Lamins engage in a plethora of stable and transient interactions, near the inner nuclear membrane and throughout the nucleus. Lamin-binding proteins serve an amazingly diverse range of functions. Numerous inner-membrane proteins help anchor lamin filaments to the nuclear envelope, serving as part of the nuclear \"lamina\" network that is essential for nuclear architecture and integrity. Certain lamin-binding proteins of the inner membrane bind partners in the outer membrane and mechanically link lamins to the cytoskeleton. Inside the nucleus, lamin-binding proteins appear to serve as the \"adaptors\" by which the lamina organizes chromatin, influences gene expression and epigenetic regulation, and modulates signaling pathways. Transient interactions of lamins with key components of the transcription and replication machinery may provide an additional level of regulation or support to these essential events.","1402":"Many multicellular cyanobacteria produce specialized nitrogen-fixing heterocysts. During diazotrophic growth of the model organism Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. strain PCC 7120, a regulated developmental pattern of single heterocysts separated by about 10 to 20 photosynthetic vegetative cells is maintained along filaments. Heterocyst structure and metabolic activity function together to accommodate the oxygen-sensitive process of nitrogen fixation. This article focuses on recent research on heterocyst development, including morphogenesis, transport of molecules between cells in a filament, differential gene expression, and pattern formation.","1403":"Like their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial cells have a highly organized internal architecture. Here, we address the question of how proteins localize to particular sites in the cell and how they do so in a dynamic manner. We consider the underlying mechanisms that govern the positioning of proteins and protein complexes in the examples of the divisome, polar assemblies, cytoplasmic clusters, cytoskeletal elements, and organelles. We argue that geometric cues, self-assembly, and restricted sites of assembly are all exploited by the cell to specifically localize particular proteins that we refer to as anchor proteins. These anchor proteins in turn govern the localization of a whole host of additional proteins. Looking ahead, we speculate on the existence of additional mechanisms that contribute to the organization of bacterial cells, such as the nucleoid, membrane microdomains enriched in specific lipids, and RNAs with positional information.","1404":"NF-kappaB is activated by many stimuli and NF-kappaB binding sites have been identified in a wide variety of genes. Yet, NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression must be stimulus- and cell-type-specific. In others words, the cellular response to different NF-kappaB activating stimuli, such as TNFalpha, IL-1, and LPS, must be different; and the response of different cell types, such as lymphocytes, fibroblasts, or epithelial cells, to the same NF-kappaB-inducing stimulus must also be different. Finally, kinetics of gene expression must be accounted for, so that all NF-kappaB-dependent genes are not activated simultaneously even if cell type and stimulus are constant. Here, we explore the mechanistic framework in which such regulatory aspects of NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression have been analyzed because they are likely to form the basis for physiological responses.","1405":"Chromosome territories (CTs) constitute a major feature of nuclear architecture. In a brief statement, the possible contribution of nuclear architecture studies to the field of epigenomics is considered, followed by a historical account of the CT concept and the final compelling experimental evidence of a territorial organization of chromosomes in all eukaryotes studied to date. Present knowledge of nonrandom CT arrangements, of the internal CT architecture, and of structural interactions with other CTs is provided as well as the dynamics of CT arrangements during cell cycle and postmitotic terminal differentiation. The article concludes with a discussion of open questions and new experimental strategies to answer them.","1406":"Symmetry breaking is essential for cell movement, polarity, and developmental patterning. Amplification of initial asymmetry is key to the conserved mechanisms involved.","1407":"The NF-kappaB pathway is a ubiquitous stress response that activates the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. Antigen receptors, receptors of the innate immune system, and certain intracellular stressors are potent activators of this pathway. The transcriptional program that is activated is both antiapoptotic and highly proinflammatory. Indeed, any compromise in engagement of the pathway results in immunodeficiency, whereas constitutive activation generates a sustained inflammatory response that may promote malignancy. As such, NF-kappaB activation is under tight regulation by a number of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. This article attempts to synthesize our current knowledge regarding the regulation of NF-kappaB signaling by ubiquitination, specifically highlighting the biochemical basis for both positive and negative feedback loops that function in unison to generate coordinated signals that are essential for the viability of metazoan animals.","1408":"The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of receptors and the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of intracellular adaptors are expressed in immune cells. By way of their cytoplasmic domain, SLAM-related receptors physically associate with SAP-related adaptors. Evidence is accumulating that the SLAM and SAP families play crucial roles in multiple immune cell types. Moreover, the prototype of the SAP family, that is SAP, is mutated in a human immunodeficiency, X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease. In the presence of SAP-family adaptors, the SLAM family usually mediates stimulatory signals that promote immune cell activation or differentiation. In the absence of SAP-family adaptors, though, the SLAM family undergoes a \"switch-of-function,\" thereby mediating inhibitory signals that suppress immune cell functions. The molecular basis and significance of this mechanism are discussed herein.","1409":"Carbon-containing meteorites provide a natural sample of the extraterrestrial organic chemistry that occurred in the solar system ahead of life's origin on the Earth. Analyses of 40 years have shown the organic content of these meteorites to be materials as diverse as kerogen-like macromolecules and simpler soluble compounds such as amino acids and polyols. Many meteoritic molecules have identical counterpart in the biosphere and, in a primitive group of meteorites, represent the majority of their carbon. Most of the compounds in meteorites have isotopic compositions that date their formation to presolar environments and reveal a long and active cosmochemical evolution of the biogenic elements. Whether this evolution resumed on the Earth to foster biogenesis after exogenous delivery of meteoritic and cometary materials is not known, yet, the selective abundance of biomolecule precursors evident in some cosmic environments and the unique L-asymmetry of some meteoritic amino acids are suggestive of their possible contribution to terrestrial molecular evolution.","1410":"This article reviews symptoms and signs of aberrant axon connectivity in humans, and summarizes major human genetic disorders that result, or have been proposed to result, from defective axon guidance. These include corpus callosum agenesis, L1 syndrome, Joubert syndrome and related disorders, horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis, Kallmann syndrome, albinism, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1, Duane retraction syndrome, and pontine tegmental cap dysplasia. Genes mutated in these disorders can encode axon growth cone ligands and receptors, downstream signaling molecules, and axon transport motors, as well as proteins without currently recognized roles in axon guidance. Advances in neuroimaging and genetic techniques have the potential to rapidly expand this field, and it is feasible that axon guidance disorders will soon be recognized as a new and significant category of human neurodevelopmental disorders.","1411":"The specificity of synaptic connections is directly related to the functional integrity of neural circuits. Long-range axon guidance and topographic mapping mechanisms bring axons into spatial proximity of target cells and thus limit the number of potential synaptic partners. Synaptic specificity is then achieved by extracellular short-range guidance cues and cell-surface recognition cues. Neural activity may enhance the precision and strength of specific circuit connections. Here, we focus on one of the final steps of synaptic matchmaking: the targeting of synaptic layers and the mutual recognition of axons and dendrites within these layers.","1412":"Motor neurons are functionally related, but represent a diverse collection of cells that show strict preferences for specific axon pathways during embryonic development. In this article, we describe the ligands and receptors that guide motor axons as they extend toward their peripheral muscle targets. Motor neurons share similar guidance molecules with many other neuronal types, thus one challenge in the field of axon guidance has been to understand how the vast complexity of brain connections can be established with a relatively small number of factors. In the context of motor guidance, we highlight some of the temporal and spatial mechanisms used to optimize the fidelity of pathfinding and increase the functional diversity of the signaling proteins.","1413":"Interacting and coordinated auxin transporter actions in plants underlie a flexible network that mobilizes auxin in response to many developmental and environmental changes encountered by these sessile organisms. The independent but synergistic activity of individual transporters can be differentially regulated at various levels. This invests auxin transport mechanisms with robust functional redundancy and added auxin flow capacity when needed. An evolutionary perspective clarifies the roles of the different transporter groups in plant development. Mathematical and functional analysis of elements of auxin transport makes it possible to rationalize the relative contributions of members of the respective transporter classes to the localized auxin transport streams that then underlie both preprogrammed developmental changes and reactions to environmental stimuli.","1414":"Monocots are known to respond differently to auxinic herbicides; hence, certain herbicides kill broadleaf (i.e., dicot) weeds while leaving lawns (i.e., monocot grasses) intact. In addition, the characters that distinguish monocots from dicots involve structures whose development is controlled by auxin. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling auxin biosynthesis, homeostasis, transport, and signal transduction appear, so far, to be conserved between monocots and dicots, although there are differences in gene copy number and expression leading to diversification in function. This article provides an update on the conservation and diversification of the roles of genes controlling auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signal transduction in root, shoot, and reproductive development in rice and maize.","1415":"The initial observation that p53 accumulation might serve as a surrogate biomarker for TP53 mutation has been the cornerstone for vast translational efforts aimed at validating its clinical use for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Early on, it was realized that accurate evaluation of p53 status and function could not be achieved through protein-expression analysis only. As our understanding of the p53 pathway has evolved and more sophisticated methods for assessment of p53 functional integrity have become available, the clinical and molecular epidemiological implications of p53 abnormalities in cancers are being revealed. They include diagnostic testing for germline p53 mutations, and the assessment of selected p53 mutations as biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and cancer risk and prognosis. Here, we describe the strengths and limitations of the most frequently used techniques for determination of p53 status in tumors, as well as the most remarkable latest findings relating to its clinical and epidemiological value.","1416":"p53 is a transcription factor with a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability and therefore preventing cancer formation. It belongs to a family of genes composed of p53, p63, and p73. The p63 and p73 genes have a dual gene structure with an internal promoter in intron-3 and together with alternative splicing, can express 6 and 29 mRNA variants, respectively. Such a complex expression pattern had not been previously described for the p53 gene, which was not consistent with our understanding of the evolution of the p53 gene family. Consequently, we revisited the human p53 gene structure and established that it encodes nine different p53 protein isoforms because of alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative initiation sites of translation. Therefore, the human p53 gene family (p53, p63, and p73) has a dual gene structure. We determined that the dual gene structure is conserved in Drosophila and in zebrafish p53 genes. The conservation through evolution of the dual gene structure suggests that the p53 isoforms play an important role in p53 tumor-suppressor activity. We and others have established that the p53 isoforms can regulate cell-fate outcome in response to stress, by modulating p53 transcriptional activity in a promoter and stress-dependent manner. We have also shown that the p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in several types of human cancers, suggesting that they play an important role in cancer formation. The determination of p53 isoforms' expression may help to link clinical outcome to p53 status and to improve cancer patient treatment.","1417":"The nuclear envelope (NE) is a highly regulated membrane barrier that separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. It contains a large number of different proteins that have been implicated in chromatin organization and gene regulation. Although the nuclear membrane enables complex levels of gene expression, it also poses a challenge when it comes to cell division. To allow access of the mitotic spindle to chromatin, the nucleus of metazoans must completely disassemble during mitosis, generating the need to re-establish the nuclear compartment at the end of each cell division. Here, I summarize our current understanding of the dynamic remodeling of the NE during the cell cycle.","1418":"Single-molecule imaging enables biophysical measurements devoid of ensemble averaging, gives enhanced spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit, and permits superresolution reconstructions. Here, single-molecule and superresolution imaging are applied to the study of proteins in live Caulobacter crescentus cells to illustrate the power of these methods in bacterial imaging. Based on these techniques, the diffusion coefficient and dynamics of the histidine protein kinase PleC, the localization behavior of the polar protein PopZ, and the treadmilling behavior and protein superstructure of the structural protein MreB are investigated with sub-40-nm spatial resolution, all in live cells.","1419":"The IKK kinase complex is the core element of the NF-kappaB cascade. It is essentially made of two kinases (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit, NEMO\/IKKgamma. Additional components may exist, transiently or permanently, but their characterization is still unsure. In addition, it has been shown that two separate NF-kappaB pathways exist, depending on the activating signal and the cell type, the canonical (depending on IKKbeta and NEMO) and the noncanonical pathway (depending solely on IKKalpha). The main question, which is still only partially answered, is to understand how an NF-kappaB activating signal leads to the activation of the kinase subunits, allowing them to phosphorylate their targets and eventually induce nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB dimers. I will review here the genetic, biochemical, and structural data accumulated during the last 10 yr regarding the function of the three IKK subunits.","1420":"Bioenergetics is central to our understanding of living systems, yet has attracted relatively little attention in origins of life research. This article focuses on energy resources available to drive primitive metabolism and the synthesis of polymers that could be incorporated into molecular systems having properties associated with the living state. The compartmented systems are referred to as protocells, each different from all the rest and representing a kind of natural experiment. The origin of life was marked when a rare few protocells happened to have the ability to capture energy from the environment to initiate catalyzed heterotrophic growth directed by heritable genetic information in the polymers. This article examines potential sources of energy available to protocells, and mechanisms by which the energy could be used to drive polymer synthesis.","1421":"The fur on a cat's back, the scales on a fish, or the bristles on a fly are all beautifully organized, with a high degree of polarization in their surface organization. Great progress has been made in understanding how individual cell polarity is established, but our understanding of how cells coordinate their polarity in forming coherent tissues is still fragmentary. The organization of cells in the plane of the epithelium is known as planar cell polarity (PCP), and studies in the past decade have delineated a genetic pathway for the control of PCP. This review will first briefly review data from the Drosophila field, where PCP was first identified and genetically characterized, and then explore how vertebrate tissues become polarized during development.","1422":"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is essential in both embryonic development and the progression of carcinomas. Wnt signaling and cadherin-mediated adhesion have been implicated in both processes; clarifying their role will depend on linking them to rearrangements of cellular structure and behavior. beta-Catenin is an essential molecule both in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and in canonical Wnt signaling. Numerous experiments have shown that the loss of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion can promote beta-catenin release and signaling; this is accomplished by proteases, protein kinases and other molecules. Cadherin loss can also signal to several other regulatory pathways. Additionally, many target genes of Wnt signaling influence cadherin adhesion. The most conspicuous of these Wnt target genes encode the transcription factors Twist and Slug, which directly inhibit the E-cadherin gene promoter. Other Wnt\/beta-catenin target genes encode metalloproteases or the cell adhesion molecule L1, which favor the degradation of E-cadherin. These factors provide a mechanism whereby cadherin loss and increased Wnt signaling induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition in both carcinomas and development.","1423":"Neuronal migration is, along with axon guidance, one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the wiring of the brain. As other organs, the nervous system has acquired the ability to grow both in size and complexity by using migration as a strategy to position cell types from different origins into specific coordinates, allowing for the generation of brain circuitries. Guidance of migrating neurons shares many features with axon guidance, from the use of substrates to the specific cues regulating chemotaxis. There are, however, important differences in the cell biology of these two processes. The most evident case is nucleokinesis, which is an essential component of migration that needs to be integrated within the guidance of the cell. Perhaps more surprisingly, the cellular mechanisms underlying the response of the leading process of migrating cells to guidance cues might be different to those involved in growth cone steering, at least for some neuronal populations.","1424":"The establishment of precise neuronal cell morphology provides the foundation for all aspects of neurobiology. During development, axons emerge from cell bodies after an initial polarization stage, elongate, and navigate towards target regions guided by a range of environmental cues. The Rho and Ras families of small GTPases have emerged as critical players at all stages of axonogenesis. Their ability to coordinately direct multiple signal transduction pathways with precise spatial control drives many of the activities that underlie this morphogenetic program: the dynamic assembly, disassembly, and reorganization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, the interaction of the growing axon with other cells and extracellular matrix, the delivery of lipids and proteins to the axon through the exocytic machinery, and the internalization of membrane and proteins at the leading edge of the growth cone through endocytosis. This article highlights the contribution of Rho and Ras GTPases to axonogenesis.","1425":"The phytohormone auxin plays an essential role in many aspects of plant growth and development. Its patterning, intercellular transport, and means of signaling have been extensively studied both in experiments and computational models. Here, we present a review of models of auxin-regulated development in different plant tissues. This includes models of organ initiation in the shoot apical meristem, development of vascular strands in leafs and stems, and auxin-related functioning in roots. The examples show how mathematical modeling can help to examine expected and unexpected behavior of the system, challenge our knowledge and hypotheses, obtain quantitative results, or suggest new experiments and ways to approach a problem.","1426":"Auxin plays a role in nearly every aspect of a plant's life. Signals from the developmental program, physiological status, and encounters with other organisms all converge on the auxin pathway. The molecular mechanisms facilitating these interactions are diverse; yet, common themes emerge. Auxin can be regulated by modulating rates of biosynthesis, conjugation, and transport, as well as sensitivity of a cell to the auxin signal. In this article, we describe some well-studied examples of auxin's interactions with other pathways.","1427":"In its wild-type form, p53 is a major tumor suppressor whose function is critical for protection against cancer. Many human tumors carry missense mutations in the TP53 gene, encoding p53. Typically, the affected tumor cells accumulate excessive amounts of the mutant p53 protein. Various lines of evidence indicate that, in addition to abrogating the tumor suppressor functions of wild-type p53, the common types of cancer-associated p53 mutations also endow the mutant protein with new activities that can contribute actively to various stages of tumor progression and to increased resistance to anticancer treatments. Collectively, these activities are referred to as mutant p53 gain-of-function. This article addresses the biological manifestations of mutant p53 gain-of-function, the underlying molecular mechanisms, and their possible clinical implications.","1428":"In response to various stress signals, which introduce infidelity into the processes of cell growth and division, p53 initiates cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence to maintain fidelity throughout the cell cycle. Although these functions are traditionally thought of as the major functions of the p53 protein for tumor suppression, recent studies have revealed some additional novel functions of the p53 pathway. These include the down-regulation of two central cell-growth pathways, the IGF\/AKT-1 and mTOR pathways, and the up-regulation of the activities of the endosomal compartment. The IGF-1\/AKT and mTOR pathways are two evolutionarily conserved pathways that play critical roles in regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and energy metabolism. In response to stress, p53 transcribes a group of critical negative regulators in these two pathways, including IGF-BP3, PTEN, TSC2, AMPK beta1, and Sestrin1\/2, which leads to the reduction in the activities of these two pathways. Furthermore, p53 transcribes several critical genes regulating the endosomal compartment, including TSAP6, Chmp4C, Caveolin-1, and DRAM, and increases exosome secretion, the rate of endosomal removal of growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR) from cell surface, and enhances autophagy. These activities all function to slow down cell growth and division, conserve and recycle cellular resources, communicate with adjacent cells and dendritic cells of the immune system, and inform other tissues of the stress signals. This coordinated regulation of IGF-1\/AKT\/mTOR pathways and the endosomal compartment by the p53 pathway integrates the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels of activities and prevents the accumulations of errors in response to stress and restores cellular homeostasis after stress.","1429":"The sequential formation of somites along the anterior-posterior axis is under control of multiple signaling gradients involving the Wnt, FGF, and retinoic acid (RA) pathways. These pathways show graded distribution of signaling activity within the paraxial mesoderm of vertebrate embryos. Although Wnt and FGF signaling show highest activity in the posterior, unsegmented paraxial mesoderm (presomitic mesoderm [PSM]), RA signaling establishes a countergradient with the highest activity in the somites. The generation of these graded activities relies both on classical source-sink mechanisms (for RA signaling) and on an RNA decay mechanism (for FGF signaling). Numerous studies reveal the tight interconnection among Wnt, FGF, and RA signaling in controlling paraxial mesoderm differentiation and in defining the somite-forming unit. In particular, the relationship to a molecular oscillator acting in somite precursors in the PSM-called the segmentation clock-has been recently addressed. These studies indicate that high levels of Wnt and FGF signaling are required for the segmentation clock activity. Furthermore, we discuss how these signaling gradients act in a dose-dependent manner in the progenitors of the paraxial mesoderm, partly by regulating cell movements during gastrulation. Finally, links between the process of axial specification of vertebral segments and Hox gene expression are discussed.","1430":"In the past decade, a wide range of fascinating monogenic diseases have been linked to mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes the A-type nuclear lamins, intermediate filament proteins of the nuclear envelope. These diseases include dilated cardiomyopathy with variable muscular dystrophy, Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, a Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 disease, mandibuloacral dysplasia, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Several diseases are also caused by mutations in genes encoding B-type lamins and proteins that associate with the nuclear lamina. Studies of these so-called laminopathies or nuclear envelopathies, some of which phenocopy common human disorders, are providing clues about functions of the nuclear envelope and insights into disease pathogenesis and human aging.","1431":"The perinucleolar compartment (PNC) is a subnuclear body characterized by its location to the periphery of the nucleolus. The PNC is a dynamic structure and is highly enriched in RNA-binding proteins and pol III RNA. The structural stability of the PNC is dependent on continuous pol III transcription and the presence of key proteins. The PNC is associated with malignancy both in vitro and in vivo and its presence positively correlates with metastatic capacity, making it a potential cancer marker. Recent studies also suggest an association between the PNC and a specific DNA locus, and ongoing PNC research continues to focus on determining the structure and function of the PNC to understand its role in cancer. This article summarizes the current understanding of PNC structure and function with an emphasis on the association of PNC and malignancy.","1432":"Bacterial chromosomes are generally approximately 1000 times longer than the cells in which they reside, and concurrent replication, segregation, and transcription\/translation of this crowded mass of DNA poses a challenging organizational problem. Recent advances in cell-imaging technology with subdiffraction resolution have revealed that the bacterial nucleoid is reliably oriented and highly organized within the cell. Such organization is transmitted from one generation to the next by progressive segregation of daughter chromosomes and anchoring of DNA to the cell envelope. Active segregation by a mitotic machinery appears to be common; however, the mode of chromosome segregation varies significantly from species to species.","1433":"The key step in NF-kappaB activation is the release of the NF-kappaB dimers from their inhibitory proteins, achieved via proteolysis of the IkappaBs. This irreversible signaling step constitutes a commitment to transcriptional activation. The signal is eventually terminated through nuclear expulsion of NF-kappaB, the outcome of a negative feedback loop based on IkappaBalpha transcription, synthesis, and IkappaBalpha-dependent nuclear export of NF-kappaB (Karin and Ben-Neriah 2000). Here, we review the process of signal-induced IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation by comparing the degradation of several IkappaBs and discussing the characteristics of IkappaBs' ubiquitin machinery.","1434":"Intercellular anchoring junctions are highly specialized regions of the plasma membrane where members of the cadherin family of transmembrane adhesion molecules on opposing cells interact through their extracellular domains, and through their cytoplasmic domains serve as a platform for organizing cytoskeletal anchors and remodelers. Here we focus on assembly of so-called \"anchoring\" or \"adhering\" junctions-adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes (DSMs), which associate with actin and intermediate filaments, respectively. We will examine how the assembly and function of AJs and DSMs are intimately connected during embryogenesis and in adult cells and tissues, and in some cases even form specialized \"mixed\" junctions. We will explore signaling and trafficking machineries that drive assembly and remodeling and how these mechanisms are co-opted in human disease.","1435":"Cytoskeletal systems are networks of polymers found in all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic cells. Their purpose is to transmit and integrate information across cellular dimensions and help turn a disorderly mob of macromolecules into a spatially organized, living cell. Information, in this context, includes physical and chemical properties relevant to cellular physiology, including: the number and activity of macromolecules, cell shape, and mechanical force. Most animal cells are 10-50 microns in diameter, whereas the macromolecules that comprise them are 10,000-fold smaller (2-20 nm). To establish long-range order over cellular length scales, individual molecules must, therefore, self-assemble into larger polymers, with lengths (0.1-20 m) comparable to the size of a cell. These polymers must then be cross-linked into organized networks that fill the cytoplasm. Such cell-spanning polymer networks enable different parts of the cytoplasm to communicate directly with each other, either by transmitting forces or by carrying cargo from one spot to another.","1436":"The 6-billion human population provides a vast reservoir of mutations, which, in addition to the opportunity of detecting very subtle defects, including specific cognitive dysfunctions as well as late appearing disorders, offers a unique background in which to investigate the roles of cell-cell adhesion proteins. Here we focus on inherited human disorders involving members of the cadherin superfamily. Most of the advances concern monogenic disorders. Yet, with the development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies, cadherin genes are emerging as susceptibility genes in multifactorial disorders. Various skin and heart disorders revealed the critical role played by desmosomal cadherins in epidermis, hairs, and myocardium, which experience high mechanical stress. Of particular interest in that respect is the study of Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1), a hereditary syndromic form of deafness. Studies of USH1 brought to light the crucial role of transient fibrous links formed by cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 in the cohesion of the developing hair bundle, the mechanoreceptive structure of the auditory sensory cells, as well as the involvement of these cadherins in the formation of the tip-link, a key component of the mechano-electrical transduction machinery. Finally, in line with the well-established role of cadherins in synaptic formation, maintenance, strength, and plasticity, a growing number of cadherin family members, especially protocadherins, have been found to be involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.","1437":"The morphological feature of tight junctions (TJs) fits well with their functions. The core of TJs is a fibril-like proteinaceous structure within the lipid bilayer, the so-called TJ strands. TJ strands in apposing plasma membranes associate with each other to eliminate the intercellular space. A network of paired TJ strands generates a continuous belt that circumscribes each cell to establish the diffusion barrier to the solutes in the paracellular pathway throughout the cellular sheet. Identification and characterization of TJ-associated proteins during the last two decades has unveiled the nature of TJ strands and how they are spatially organized. The interplay between integral membrane proteins, claudins, and cytoplasmic plaque proteins, ZO-1\/ZO-2, is critical for TJ formation and function.","1438":"The Darwinian concept of biological evolution assumes that life on Earth shares a common ancestor. The diversification of this common ancestor through speciation events and vertical transmission of genetic material implies that the classification of life can be illustrated in a tree-like manner, commonly referred to as the Tree of Life. This article describes features of the Tree of Life, such as how the tree has been both pruned and become bushier throughout the past century as our knowledge of biology has expanded. We present current views that the classification of life may be best illustrated as a ring or even a coral with tree-like characteristics. This article also discusses how the organization of the Tree of Life offers clues about ancient life on Earth. In particular, we focus on the environmental conditions and temperature history of Precambrian life and show how chemical, biological, and geological data can converge to better understand this history.\"You know, a tree is a tree. How many more do you need to look at?\"--Ronald Reagan (Governor of California), quoted in the Sacramento Bee, opposing expansion of Redwood National Park, March 3, 1966.","1439":"Morphogen gradients play a fundamental role in organ patterning and organ growth. Unlike their role in patterning, their function in regulating the growth and the size of organs is poorly understood. How and why do morphogen gradients exert their mitogenic effects to generate uniform proliferation in developing organs, and by what means can morphogens impinge on the final size of organs? The decapentaplegic (Dpp) gradient in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc has emerged as a suitable and established system to study organ growth. Here, we review models and recent findings that attempt to address how the Dpp morphogen contributes to uniform proliferation of cells, and how it may regulate the final size of wing discs.","1440":"There is abundant evidence of multiple biosynthesis pathways for the major naturally occurring auxin in plants, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and examples of differential use of two general routes of IAA synthesis, namely Trp-dependent and Trp-independent. Although none of these pathways has been completely defined, we now have examples of specific IAA biosynthetic pathways playing a role in developmental processes by way of localized IAA synthesis, causing us to rethink the interactions between IAA synthesis, transport, and signaling. Recent work also points to some IAA biosynthesis pathways being specific to families within the plant kingdom, whereas others appear to be more ubiquitous. An important advance within the past 5 years is our ability to monitor IAA biosynthesis and metabolism at increasingly higher resolution.","1441":"Leaves are the main photosynthetic organs of vascular plants and show considerable diversity in their geometries, ranging from simple spoon-like forms to complex shapes with individual leaflets, as in compound leaves. Leaf vascular tissues, which act as conduits of both nutrients and signaling information, are organized in networks of different architectures that usually mirror the surrounding leaf shape. Understanding the processes that endow leaves and vein networks with ordered and closely aligned shapes has captured the attention of biologists and mathematicians since antiquity. Recent work has suggested that the growth regulator auxin has a key role in both initiation and elaboration of final morphology of both leaves and vascular networks. A key feature of auxin action is the existence of feedback loops through which auxin regulates its own transport. These feedbacks may facilitate the iterative generation of basic modules that underlies morphogenesis of both leaves and vasculature.","1442":"Many adult stem cells divide asymmetrically to balance self-renewal and differentiation, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. Asymmetric stem cell divisions depend on asymmetric cell architecture (i.e., cell polarity) within the cell and\/or the cellular environment. In particular, as residents of the tissues they sustain, stem cells are inevitably placed in the context of the tissue architecture. Indeed, many stem cells are polarized within their microenvironment, or the stem cell niche, and their asymmetric division relies on their relationship with the microenvironment. Here, we review asymmetric stem cell divisions in the context of the stem cell niche with a focus on Drosophila germ line stem cells, where the nature of niche-dependent asymmetric stem cell division is well characterized.","1443":"Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are one of the most frequent alterations in human cancers, and germline mutations are the underlying cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which predisposes to a wide spectrum of early-onset cancers. Most mutations are single-base substitutions distributed throughout the coding sequence. Their diverse types and positions may inform on the nature of mutagenic mechanisms involved in cancer etiology. TP53 mutations are also potential prognostic and predictive markers, as well as targets for pharmacological intervention. All mutations found in human cancers are compiled in the IARC TP53 Database (http:\/\/www-p53.iarc.fr\/). A human TP53 knockin mouse model (Hupki mouse) provides an experimental model to study mutagenesis in the context of a human TP53 sequence. Here, we summarize current knowledge on TP53 gene variations observed in human cancers and populations, and current clinical applications derived from this knowledge.","1444":"Exquisite control of the activity of p53 is necessary for mammalian survival. Too much p53 is lethal, whereas too little permits tumorigenesis. MDM2 and MDM4 are structurally related proteins critical for the control of p53 activity during development, homeostasis, and the response to stress. These two essential proteins regulate both the activation of p53 in response to stress and the recovery of cells following resolution of the damage, yet both are oncogenic when overexpressed. Thus, multiple regulatory circuits ensure that their activities are fine-tuned to promote tumor-free survival. Numerous diverse stressors activate p53, and much research has gone into trying to find commonalities between them that would explain the mechanism by which p53 becomes active. It is now clear that although these diverse stressors activate p53 by different biochemical pathways, one common feature is the effort they direct, through a variety of means, toward disrupting the functions of both MDM2 and MDM4. This article provides an overview of the relationship between MDM2 and MDM4, features the various biochemical mechanisms by which p53 is activated through inhibition of their functions, and proposes some emerging areas for investigation of the p53-mediated stress response.","1445":"Planarian regeneration was one of the first models in which the gradient concept was developed. Morphological studies based on the analysis of the regeneration rates of planarian fragments from different body regions, the generation of heteromorphoses, and experiments of tissue transplantation led T.H. Morgan (1901) and C.M Child (1911) to postulate different kinds of gradients responsible for the regenerative process in these highly plastic animals. However, after a century of research, the role of morphogens in planarian regeneration has yet to be demonstrated. This may change soon, as the sequencing of the planarian genome and the possibility of performing gene functional analysis by RNA interference (RNAi) have led to the isolation of elements of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways that control patterning and axial polarity during planarian regeneration and homeostasis. Here, we discuss whether the actions of these molecules could be based on morphogenetic gradients.","1446":"Bacterial cells have evolved a variety of regulatory circuits that tightly synchronize their chromosome replication and cell division cycles, thereby ensuring faithful transmission of genetic information to their offspring. Complex multicomponent signaling cascades are used to monitor the progress of cytokinesis and couple replication initiation to the separation of the two daughter cells. Moreover, the cell-division apparatus actively participates in chromosome partitioning and, particularly, in the resolution of topological problems that impede the segregation process, thus coordinating chromosome dynamics with cell constriction. Finally, bacteria have developed mechanisms that harness the cell-cycle-dependent positioning of individual chromosomal loci or the nucleoid to define the cell-division site and control the timing of divisome assembly. Each of these systems manages to integrate a complex set of spatial and temporal cues to regulate and execute critical steps in the bacterial cell cycle.","1447":"NF-kappaB refers to multiple dimers of Rel homology domain (RHD) containing polypeptides, which are controlled by a stimulus-responsive signaling system that mediates the physiological responses to inflammatory intercellular cytokines, pathogen exposure, and developmental signals. The NF-kappaB signaling system operates on transient or short timescales, relevant to inflammation and immune responses, and on longer-term timescales relevant to cell differentiation and organ formation. Here, we summarize our current understanding of the kinetic mechanisms that allow for NF-kappaB regulation at these different timescales. We distinguish between the regulation of NF-kappaB dimer formation and the regulation of NF-kappaB activity. Given the number of regulators and reactions involved, the NF-kappaB signaling system is capable of integrating a multitude of signals to tune NF-kappaB activity, signal dose responsiveness, and dynamic control. We discuss the prevailing mechanisms that mediate signaling cross talk.","1448":"Nodal signals belong to the TGF-beta superfamily and are essential for the induction of mesoderm and endoderm and the determination of the left-right axis. Nodal signals can act as morphogens-they have concentration-dependent effects and can act at a distance from their source of production. Nodal and its feedback inhibitor Lefty form an activator\/inhibitor pair that behaves similarly to postulated reaction-diffusion models of tissue patterning. Nodal morphogen activity is also regulated by microRNAs, convertases, TGF-beta signals, coreceptors, and trafficking factors. This article describes how Nodal morphogens pattern embryonic fields and discusses how Nodal morphogen signaling is modulated.","1449":"Epithelial cell-cell junctions are formed by apical adherens junctions (AJs), which are composed of cadherin adhesion molecules interacting in a dynamic way with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Regulation of cell-cell junction stability and dynamics is crucial to maintain tissue integrity and allow tissue remodeling throughout development. Actin filament turnover and organization are tightly controlled together with myosin-II activity to produce mechanical forces that drive the assembly, maintenance, and remodeling of AJs. In this review, we will discuss these three distinct stages in the lifespan of cell-cell junctions, using several developmental contexts, which illustrate how mechanical forces are generated and transmitted at junctions, and how they impact on the integrity and the remodeling of cell-cell junctions.","1450":"Properly regulated intercellular adhesion is critical for normal development of all metazoan organisms. Adherens junctions play an especially prominent role in development because they link the adhesive function of cadherin-catenin protein complexes to the dynamic forces of the actin cytoskeleton, which helps to orchestrate a spatially confined and very dynamic assembly of intercellular connections. Intriguingly, in addition to maintaining intercellular adhesion, cadherin-catenin proteins are linked to several major developmental signaling pathways crucial for normal morphogenesis. In this article we will highlight the key genetic studies that uncovered the role of cadherin-catenin proteins in vertebrate development and discuss the potential role of these proteins as molecular biosensors of external cellular microenvironment that may spatially confine signaling molecules and polarity cues to orchestrate cellular behavior throughout the complex process of normal morphogenesis.","1451":"Morphogen gradients play a key role in multiple differentiation processes. Both the formation of the gradient and its interpretation by the receiving cells need to occur at high precision to ensure reproducible patterning. This need for quantitative precision is challenged by fluctuations in the environmental conditions and by variations in the genetic makeup of the developing embryos. We discuss mechanisms that buffer morphogen profiles against variations in gene dosage. Self-enhanced morphogen degradation and pre-steady-state decoding provide general means for buffering the morphogen profile against fluctuations in morphogen production rate. A more specific \"shuttling\" mechanism, which establishes a sharp and robust activation profile of a widely expressed morphogen, and enables the adjustment of morphogen profile with embryo size, is also described. Finally, we consider the transformation of the smooth gradient profile into sharp borders of gene expression in the signal-receiving cells. The integration theory and experiments are increasingly used, providing key insights into the system-level functioning of the developmental system.","1452":"The majority of human cancers acquire mutations that abrogate the p53 tumor suppressor network and, as a consequence, p53 is one of the most extensively studied proteins in cancer research. Because of its potent tumor suppressive activity, it is widely assumed that a molecular understanding of p53 action will produce fundamental insights into natural processes that limit tumorigenesis and may identify key molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. p53 functions largely as a transcription factor, and can trigger a variety of antiproliferative programs by activating or repressing key effector genes. Despite a significant body of literature detailing the biochemical and biological functions of p53, much remains to be elucidated. Indeed, the p53 network is as complex and enigmatic as it is relevant. It is the goal of this article, written 30 years after the discovery of p53, to present a concise review of the tumor suppressor role of the p53 network and to highlight the context-dependent nature of p53 target-gene functions.","1453":"Plants start their life as a single cell, which, during the process of embryogenesis, is transformed into a mature embryo with all organs necessary to support further growth and development. Therefore, each basic cell type is first specified in the early embryo, making this stage of development excellently suited to study mechanisms of coordinated cell specification-pattern formation. In recent years, it has emerged that the plant hormone auxin plays a prominent role in embryo development. Most pattern formation steps in the early Arabidopsis embryo depend on auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response. In this article, we describe those embryo patterning steps that involve auxin activity, and we review recent data that shed light on the molecular mechanisms of auxin action during this phase of plant development.","1454":"The establishment and maintenance of cell polarity is important to a wide range of biological processes ranging from chemotaxis to embryogenesis. An essential feature of cell polarity is the asymmetric organization of proteins and lipids in the plasma membrane. In this article, we discuss how polarity regulators such as small GTP-binding proteins and phospholipids spatially and kinetically control vesicular trafficking and membrane organization. Conversely, we discuss how membrane trafficking contributes to cell polarization through delivery of polarity determinants and regulators to the plasma membrane.","1455":"Asymmetric cell division generates cell types with different specialized functions or fates. This type of division is critical to the overall cellular organization and development of many multicellular organisms. In plants, regulated asymmetric cell divisions are of particular importance because cell migration does not occur. The influence of extrinsic cues on asymmetric cell division in plants is well documented. Recently, candidate intrinsic factors have been identified and links between intrinsic and extrinsic components are beginning to be elucidated. A novel mechanism in breaking symmetry was revealed that involves the movement of typically intrinsic factors between plant cells. As we learn more about the regulation of asymmetric cell divisions in plants, we can begin to reflect on the similarities and differences between the strategies used by plants and animals. Focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms, this article describes three selected cases of symmetry-breaking events in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These examples occur in early embryogenesis, stomatal development, and ground tissue formation in the root.","1456":"In addition to specifying cell fate, there is a wealth of evidence that molecular gradients are also primarily responsible for specifying cell polarity, particularly in the plane of epithelial sheets (\"planar polarity\"). The first compelling evidence of a role for gradients in specifying planar polarity came from transplantation experiments in the insect cuticle. More recent molecular genetic analyses in the fruit fly Drosophila have begun to give insights into the molecular nature of the gradients involved, and how they are interpreted at the cellular level.","1457":"NF-kappaB transcription factors have been suspected to be involved in cancer development since their discovery because of their kinship with the v-Rel oncogene product. Subsequent work led to identification of oncogenic mutations that result in NF-kappaB activation in lymphoid malignancies, but most of these mutations affect upstream components of NF-kappaB signaling pathways, rather than NF-kappaB family members themselves. NF-kappaB activation has also been observed in many solid tumors, but so far no oncogenic mutations responsible for NF-kappaB activation in carcinomas have been identified. In such cancers, NF-kappaB activation is a result of underlying inflammation or the consequence of formation of an inflammatory microenvironment during malignant progression. Most importantly, through its ability to up-regulate the expression of tumor promoting cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-alpha, and survival genes, such as Bcl-X(L), NF-kappaB provides a critical link between inflammation and cancer.","1458":"The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model system for the study of the establishment of cellular asymmetry and growth polarity in response to specific physiological cues. A large body of experimental observations has shown that yeast cells are able to break symmetry and establish polarity through two coupled and partially redundant intrinsic mechanisms, even in the absence of any pre-existing external asymmetry. One of these mechanisms is dependent upon interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, whereas the other relies on a Cdc42 GTPase signaling network. Integral to these mechanisms appear to be positive feedback loops capable of amplifying small and stochastic asymmetries. Spatial cues, such as bud scars and pheromone gradients, orient cell polarity by modulating the regulation of the Cdc42 GTPase cycle, thereby biasing the site of asymmetry amplification.","1459":"The organization of metazoa is based on the formation of tissues and on tissue-typical functions and these in turn are based on cell-cell connecting structures. In vertebrates, four major forms of cell junctions have been classified and the molecular composition of which has been elucidated in the past three decades: Desmosomes, which connect epithelial and some other cell types, and the almost ubiquitous adherens junctions are based on closely cis-packed glycoproteins, cadherins, which are associated head-to-head with those of the hemi-junction domain of an adjacent cell, whereas their cytoplasmic regions assemble sizable plaques of special proteins anchoring cytoskeletal filaments. In contrast, the tight junctions (TJs) and gap junctions (GJs) are formed by tetraspan proteins (claudins and occludins, or connexins) arranged head-to-head as TJ seal bands or as paracrystalline connexin channels, allowing intercellular exchange of small molecules. The by and large parallel discoveries of the junction protein families are reported.","1460":"Classical cadherins mediate specific adhesion at intercellular adherens junctions. Interactions between cadherin ectodomains from apposed cells mediate cell-cell contact, whereas the intracellular region functionally links cadherins to the underlying cytoskeleton. Structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies have provided important insights into the mechanism and specificity of cell-cell adhesion by classical cadherins and their interplay with the cytoskeleton. Adhesive binding arises through exchange of beta strands between the first extracellular cadherin domains (EC1) of partner cadherins from adjacent cells. This \"strand-swap\" binding mode is common to classical and desmosomal cadherins, but sequence alignments suggest that other cadherins will bind differently. The intracellular region of classical cadherins binds to p120 and beta-catenin, and beta-catenin binds to the F-actin binding protein alpha-catenin. Rather than stably bridging beta-catenin to actin, it appears that alpha-catenin actively regulates the actin cytoskeleton at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts.","1461":"Epithelia form physical barriers that separate the internal milieu of the body from its external environment. The biogenesis of functional epithelia requires the precise coordination of many cellular processes. One of the key events in epithelial biogenesis is the establishment of cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts, which initiate morphological changes and the formation of other adhesive structures. Cadherin-mediated adhesions generate intracellular signals that control cytoskeletal reorganization, polarity, and vesicle trafficking. Among such signaling pathways, those involving small GTPases play critical roles in epithelial biogenesis. Assembly of E-cadherin activates several small GTPases and, in turn, the activated small GTPases control the effects of E-cadherin-mediated adhesions on epithelial biogenesis. Here, we focus on small GTPase signaling at E-cadherin-mediated epithelial junctions.","1462":"Cells of many tissues acquire cellular asymmetry to execute their physiologic functions. The planar cell polarity system, first characterized in Drosophila, is important for many of these events. Studies in Drosophila suggest that an upstream system breaks cellular symmetry by converting tissue gradients to subcellular asymmetry, whereas a downstream system amplifies subcellular asymmetry and communicates polarity between cells. In this review, we discuss apparent similarities and differences in the mechanism that controls PCP as it has been adapted to a broad variety of morphological cellular asymmetries in various organisms.","1463":"During development, secreted morphogens such as Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh), and BMP emit from their producing cells in a morphogenetic field, and specify different cell fates in a direct concentration-dependent manner. Understanding how morphogens form their concentration gradients to pattern tissues has been a central issue in developmental biology. Various experimental studies from Drosophila have led to several models to explain the formation of morphogen gradients. Over the past decade, one of the main findings in this field is the characterization of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as an essential regulator for morphogen gradient formation. Genetic and cell biological studies have showed that HSPGs can regulate morphogen activities at various steps including control of morphogen movement, signaling, and intracellular trafficking. Here, we review these data, highlighting recent findings that reveal mechanistic roles of HSPGs in controlling morphogen gradient formation.","1464":"The assembly of functional neuronal networks in the developing animal relies on the polarization of neurons, i.e., the formation of a single axon and multiple dendrites. Breaking the symmetry of neurons depends on cytoskeletal rearrangements. In particular, axon specification requires local dynamic instability of actin and stabilization of microtubules. The polarized cytoskeleton also provides the basis for selective trafficking and retention of cellular components in the future somatodendritic or axonal compartments. Hence, these mechanisms are not only essential to achieve neuronal polarization, but also to maintain it. Different extracellular and intracellular signals converge on the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Most notably, Rho GTPases, PI3K, Ena\/VASP, cofilin and SAD kinases are major intracellular regulators of neuronal polarity. Analyzing polarity signals under physiological conditions will provide a better understanding of how neurons can be induced to repolarize under pathological conditions, i.e., to regenerate their axons after central nervous system (CNS) injury.","1465":"The transcription factor NF-kappaB has diverse functions in the nervous system, depending on the cellular context. NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in glutamatergic neurons. Knockout of p65 or inhibition of neuronal NF-kappaB by super-repressor IkappaB resulted in the loss of neuroprotection and defects in learning and memory. Similarly, p50-\/- mice have a lower learning ability and are sensitive to neurotoxins. Activated NF-kappaB can be transported retrogradely from activated synapses to the nucleus to translate short-term processes to long-term changes such as axon growth, which is important for long-term memory. In glia, NF-kappaB is inducible and regulates inflammatory processes that exacerbate diseases such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, ischemia, and Alzheimer's disease. In summary, inhibition of NF-kappaB in glia might ameliorate disease, whereas activation in neurons might enhance memory. This review focuses on results produced by the analysis of genetic models.","1466":"How morphogen gradients are formed in target tissues is a key question for understanding the mechanisms of morphological patterning. Here, we review different mechanisms of morphogen gradient formation from theoretical and experimental points of view. First, a simple, comprehensive overview of the underlying biophysical principles of several mechanisms of gradient formation is provided. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of different experimental approaches to gradient formation analysis.","1467":"The prosurvival transcription factor NF-kappaB specifically binds promoter DNA to activate target gene expression. NF-kappaB is regulated through interactions with IkappaB inhibitor proteins. Active proteolysis of these IkappaB proteins is, in turn, under the control of the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). Together, these three molecules form the NF-kappaB signaling module. Studies aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of NF-kappaB, IkappaB, and IKK in terms of their three-dimensional structures have lead to a greater understanding of this vital transcription factor system.","1468":"The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has produced a wellspring of insights into mechanisms that govern cellular symmetry breaking during animal development. Here we focus on two highly conserved systems that underlie many of the key symmetry-breaking events that occur during embryonic and larval development in the worm. One involves the interplay between Par proteins, Rho GTPases, and the actomyosin cytoskeleton and mediates asymmetric cell divisions that establish the germline. The other uses elements of the Wnt signaling pathway and a highly reiterative mechanism that distinguishes anterior from posterior daughter cell fates. Much of what we know about these systems comes from intensive study of a few key events-Par\/Rho\/actomyosin-mediated polarization of the zygote in response to a sperm-derived cue and the Wnt-mediated induction of endoderm at the four-cell stage. However, a growing body of work is revealing how C. elegans exploits elements\/variants of these systems to accomplish a diversity of symmetry-breaking tasks throughout embryonic and larval development.","1469":"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for a severe infection associated with different clinical features (gastroenteritis, meningoencephalitis, and abortion in pregnant women). These pathologies are caused by the unusual capacity of the bacterium to cross three host barriers during infection and to invade nonphagocytic cells. To invade host cells, Listeria uses two proteins, InlA and InlB, which have specific receptors on the host-cell surface, E-cadherin and Met, respectively. Here, we discuss the specificity of the InlA-E-cadherin interaction, the signaling cascade activated on E-cadherin engagement by InlA, and the role of InlA and E-cadherin in the breaching of host barriers and the dissemination of the infection.","1470":"Synapses are asymmetric intercellular junctions that mediate neuronal communication. The number, type, and connectivity patterns of synapses determine the formation, maintenance, and function of neural circuitries. The complexity and specificity of synaptogenesis relies upon modulation of adhesive properties, which regulate contact initiation, synapse formation, maturation, and functional plasticity. Disruption of adhesion may result in structural and functional imbalance that may lead to neurodevelopmental diseases, such as autism, or neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, understanding the roles of different adhesion protein families in synapse formation is crucial for unraveling the biology of neuronal circuit formation, as well as the pathogenesis of some brain disorders. The present review summarizes some of the knowledge that has been acquired in vertebrate and invertebrate genetic model organisms.","1471":"Chemotaxis--the directed movement of cells in a gradient of chemoattractant--is essential for neutrophils to crawl to sites of inflammation and infection and for Dictyostelium discoideum (D. discoideum) to aggregate during morphogenesis. Chemoattractant-induced activation of spatially localized cellular signals causes cells to polarize and move toward the highest concentration of the chemoattractant. Extensive studies have been devoted to achieving a better understanding of the mechanism(s) used by a neutrophil to choose its direction of polarity and to crawl effectively in response to chemoattractant gradients. Recent technological advances are beginning to reveal many fascinating details of the intracellular signaling components that spatially direct the cytoskeleton of neutrophils and D. discoideum and the complementary mechanisms that make the cell's front distinct from its back.","1472":"Cell-cell junctions continue to capture the interest of cell and developmental biologists, with an emerging area being the molecular means by which junctional signals relate to gene activity in the nucleus. Although complexities often arise in determining the direct versus indirect nature of such signal transduction, it is clear that such pathways are essential for the function of tissues and that alterations may contribute to many pathological outcomes. This review assesses a variety of cell-cell junction-to-nuclear signaling pathways, and outlines interesting areas for further study.","1473":"Source regions for morphogen gradients-organizing regions-can be generated if a local self-enhancing reaction is coupled with a long-ranging reaction that acts antagonistically. Resulting gradients can be translated into patterns of stable gene activities using genes whose products have a positive feedback on the activation on themselves. If several autoregulatory genes compete with each other for activity, cells make an unequivocal choice. Although the signal consists of a smoothly graded distribution, the all-or-nothing response of the cells leads to regions of differently determined cells that are delimited by sharp borders. In some systems, it is not the absolute but the relative level of a gradient that matters. The sequence of head, tentacles, and foot formation in hydra is controlled by a head activation gradient and is an example of this widely used but conceptually rather neglected mode. For subpatterns such as legs and wings, different \"compartments\" cooperate to produce new signaling substances. Here, morphogen production is restricted to the common borders or where they intersect. The model accounts for the formation of substructures in pairs at the correct positions within the embryo and for the correct orientation and handedness with respect to the main body axes.","1474":"A wealth of classical embryological manipulation experiments taking mainly advantage of the chicken limb buds identified the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) as the respective ectodermal and mesenchymal key signaling centers coordinating proximodistal (PD) and anteroposterior (AP) limb axis development. These experiments inspired Wolpert's French flag model, which is a classic among morphogen gradient models. Subsequent molecular and genetic analysis in the mouse identified retinoic acid as proximal signal, and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as the essential instructive signals produced by AER and ZPA, respectively. Recent studies provide good evidence that progenitors are specified early with respect to their PD and AP fates and that morpho-regulatory signaling is also required for subsequent proliferative expansion of the specified progenitor pools. The determination of particular fates seems to occur rather late and depends on additional signals such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which indicates that cells integrate signaling inputs over time and space. The coordinate regulation of PD and AP axis patterning is controlled by an epithelial-mesenchymal feedback signaling system, in which transcriptional regulation of the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 integrates inputs from the BMP, SHH, and FGF pathways. Vertebrate limb-bud development is controlled by a 4-dimensional (4D) patterning system integrating positive and negative regulatory feedback loops, rather than thresholds set by morphogen gradients.","1475":"A gradient of Dorsal activity patterns the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo by controlling the expression of genes that delineate presumptive mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and dorsal ectoderm. The availability of the Drosophila melanogaster genome sequence has accelerated the study of embryonic DV patterning, enabling the use of systems-level approaches. As a result, our understanding of Dorsal-dependent gene regulation has expanded to encompass a collection of more than 50 genes and 30 cis-regulatory sequences. This information, which has been integrated into a spatiotemporal atlas of gene regulatory interactions, comprises one of the best-understood networks controlling any developmental process to date. In this article, we focus on how Dorsal controls differential gene expression and how recent studies have expanded our understanding of Drosophila embryonic development from the cis-regulatory level to that controlling morphogenesis of the embryo.","1476":"A large number of genes have been positively selected and recruited to participate in various phases of the inflammatory response triggered by microbial stimuli. Because of the complexity of the response, the many phases in which it is deployed, and the many \"flavors\" in which it appears (depending on quality and intensity of the stimulus as well as the target organ), very elaborated mechanisms evolved to ensure that the expression of the induced genes is carefully and precisely organized so that each gene is expressed in response to specific stimuli and with kinetics and intensities that suit the peculiar function of its product(s). Data accumulated in recent years have strengthened the concept that chromatin is an essential substrate at which multiple signals are integrated to promote a correctly choreographed expression of the genes involved in inflammatory transcriptional responses. Although the current level of understanding of these mechanisms is far from complete, some concepts and ideas have resisted experimental challenges and now represent accepted paradigms that are the subject of this article.","1477":"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a pleiotropic mediator of inducible and specific gene regulation involving diverse biological activities including immune response, inflammation, cell proliferation, and death. The fine-tuning of the NF-kappaB DNA binding activity is essential for its fundamental function as a transcription factor. An increasing body of literature illustrates that this process can be elegantly and specifically controlled at multiple levels by different protein subsets. In particular, the recent identification of a non-Rel subunit of NF-kappaB itself provides a new way to understand the selective high-affinity DNA binding specificity of NF-kappaB conferred by a synergistic interaction within the whole complex. Here, we review the mechanism of the specification of DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB complexes, one of the most important aspects of NF-kappaB transcriptional control.","1478":"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) consists of a family of transcription factors that play critical roles in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Inducible NF-kappaB activation depends on phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB proteins (IkappaBs), which retain inactive NF-kappaB dimers in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. The majority of the diverse signaling pathways that lead to NF-kappaB activation converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which is responsible for IkappaB phosphorylation and is essential for signal transduction to NF-kappaB. Additional regulation of NF-kappaB activity is achieved through various post-translational modifications of the core components of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways. In addition to cytosolic modifications of IKK and IkappaB proteins, as well as other pathway-specific mediators, the transcription factors are themselves extensively modified. Tremendous progress has been made over the last two decades in unraveling the elaborate regulatory networks that control the NF-kappaB response. This has made the NF-kappaB pathway a paradigm for understanding general principles of signal transduction and gene regulation.","1479":"One of the early surprises in the study of cell adhesion was the discovery that beta-catenin plays dual roles, serving as an essential component of cadherin-based cell-cell adherens junctions and also serving as the key regulated effector of the Wnt signaling pathway. Here, we review our current model of Wnt signaling and discuss how recent work using model organisms has advanced our understanding of the roles Wnt signaling plays in both normal development and in disease. These data help flesh out the mechanisms of signaling from the membrane to the nucleus, revealing new protein players and providing novel information about known components of the pathway.","1480":"Understanding of tight junctions has evolved from their historical perception as inert solute barriers to recognition of their physiological and biochemical complexity. Many proteins are specifically localized to tight junctions, including cytoplasmic actin-binding proteins and adhesive transmembrane proteins. Among the latter are claudins, which are critical barrier proteins. Current information suggests that the paracellular barrier is most usefully modeled as having two physiologic components: a system of charge-selective small pores, 4 A in radius, and a second pathway created by larger discontinuities in the barrier, lacking charge or size discrimination. The first pathway is influenced by claudin expression patterns and the second is likely controlled by different proteins and signals. Recent information on claudin function and disease-causing mutations have led to a more complete understanding of their role in barrier formation, but progress is impeded by lack of high resolution structural information.","1481":"Desmosomes are intercellular junctions that tether intermediate filaments to the plasma membrane. Desmogleins and desmocollins, members of the cadherin superfamily, mediate adhesion at desmosomes. Cytoplasmic components of the desmosome associate with the desmosomal cadherin tails through a series of protein interactions, which serve to recruit intermediate filaments to sites of desmosome assembly. These desmosomal plaque components include plakoglobin and the plakophilins, members of the armadillo gene family. Linkage to the cytoskeleton is mediated by the intermediate filament binding protein, desmoplakin, which associates with both plakoglobin and plakophilins. Although desmosomes are critical for maintaining stable cell-cell adhesion, emerging evidence indicates that they are also dynamic structures that contribute to cellular processes beyond that of cell adhesion. This article outlines the structure and function of the major desmosomal proteins, and explores the contributions of this protein complex to tissue architecture and morphogenesis.","1482":"In the developing brain, gradients are commonly used to divide neurogenic regions into distinct functional domains. In this article, we discuss the functions of morphogen and gene expression gradients in the assembly of the nervous system in the context of the development of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is a mammal-specific region of the forebrain that functions at the top of the neural hierarchy to process and interpret sensory information, plan and organize tasks, and to control motor functions. The mature cerebral cortex is a modular structure, consisting of anatomically and functionally distinct areas. Those areas of neurons are generated from a uniform neuroepithelial sheet by two forms of gradients: graded extracellular signals and a set of transcription factor gradients operating across the field of neocortical stem cells. Fgf signaling from the rostral pole of the cerebral cortex sets up gradients of expression of transcription factors by both activating and repressing gene expression. However, in contrast to the spinal cord and the early Drosophila embryo, these gradients are not subsequently resolved into molecularly distinct domains of gene expression. Instead, graded information in stem cells is translated into discrete, region-specific gene expression in the postmitotic neuronal progeny of the stem cells.","1483":"The secreted protein Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) acts in graded fashion to pattern the dorsal-ventral axis of the vertebrate neural tube. This is a dynamic process in which increasing concentrations and durations of exposure to SHH generate neurons with successively more ventral identities. Interactions between the receiving cells and the graded signal underpin the mechanism of SHH action. In particular, negative feedback, involving proteins transcriptionally induced or repressed by SHH signaling, plays an essential role in shaping the graded readout. On one hand, negative feedback controls, in a noncell-autonomous manner, the distribution of SHH across the field of receiving cells. On the other, it acts cell-autonomously to convert different concentrations of SHH into distinct durations of intracellular signal transduction. Together, these mechanisms exemplify a strategy for morphogen interpretation, which we have termed temporal adaptation that relies on the continuous processing and refinement of the cellular response to the graded signal.","1484":"Chemical gradients of peptide mating pheromones are necessary for directional growth, which is critical for yeast mating. These gradients are generated by cell-type specific secretion or export and specific degradation in receiving cells. Spatial information is sensed by dedicated seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors and yeast cells are able to detect extremely small differences in ligand concentration across their approximately 5-microm cell surface. Here, I will discuss our current knowledge of how cells detect and respond to such shallow chemical gradients and in particular what is known about the proteins that are involved in directional growth and the establishment of the polarity axis during yeast mating.","1485":"The orthogonal axes of Drosophila are established during oogenesis through a hierarchical series of symmetry-breaking steps, most of which can be traced back to asymmetries inherent in the architecture of the ovary. Oogenesis begins with the formation of a germline cyst of 16 cells connected by ring canals. Two of these 16 cells have four ring canals, whereas the others have fewer. The first symmetry-breaking step is the selection of one of these two cells to become the oocyte. Subsequently, the germline cyst becomes surrounded by somatic follicle cells to generate individual egg chambers. The second symmetry-breaking step is the posterior positioning of the oocyte within the egg chamber, a process mediated by adhesive interactions with a special group of somatic cells. Posterior oocyte positioning is accompanied by a par gene-dependent repolarization of the microtubule network, which establishes the posterior cortex of the oocyte. The next two steps of symmetry breaking occur during midoogenesis after the volume of the oocyte has increased about 10-fold. First, a signal from the oocyte specifies posterior follicle cells, polarizing a symmetric prepattern present within the follicular epithelium. Second, the posterior follicle cells send a signal back to the oocyte, which leads to a second repolarization of the oocyte microtubule network and the asymmetric migration of the oocyte nucleus. This process again requires the par genes. The repolarization of the microtubule network results in the transport of bicoid and oskar mRNAs, the anterior and posterior determinants, respectively, of the embryonic axis, to opposite poles of the oocyte. The asymmetric positioning of the oocyte nucleus defines a cortical region of the oocyte where gurken mRNA is localized, thus breaking the dorsal-ventral symmetry of the egg and embryo.","1486":"The morphogenetic field concept was proposed by experimental embryologists to account for the self-regulative behavior of embryos. Such fields have remained an abstract concept until the recent identification of their molecular components using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and theoretical modeling. One of the best studied models of a morphogenetic field is the Dorsal-Ventral (D-V) patterning of the early frog embryo. This patterning system is regulated by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and an intricate network of secreted protein antagonists. This biochemical pathway of interacting proteins functions in the extracellular space to generate a D-V gradient of BMP signaling, which is maintained during extensive morphogenetic movements of cell layers during gastrulation. The D-V field is divided into a dorsal and a ventral center, in regions of low and high BMP signaling respectively, under opposite transcriptional control by BMPs. The robustness of the patterning is assured at two different levels. First, in the extracellular space by secreted BMP antagonists that generate a directional flow of BMP ligands to the ventral side. The flow is driven by the regulated proteolysis of the Chordin inhibitor and by the presence of a molecular sink on the ventral side that concentrates BMP signals. The tolloid metalloproteinases and the Chordin-binding protein Crossveinless-2 (CV2) are key components of this ventral sink. Second, by transcriptional feedback at the cellular level: The dorsal and ventral signaling centers adjust their size and level of BMP signaling by transcriptional feedback. This allows cells on one side of a gastrula containing about 10,000 cells to communicate with cells in the opposite pole of the embryo.","1487":"During Drosophila development, neuroblasts divide to generate progeny with two different fates. One daughter cell self-renews to maintain the neuroblast pool, whereas the other differentiates to populate the central nervous system. The difference in fate arises from the asymmetric distribution of proteins that specify either self-renewal or differentiation, which is brought about by their polarization into separate apical and basal cortical domains during mitosis. Neuroblast symmetry breaking is regulated by numerous proteins, many of which have only recently been discovered. The atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a broad regulator of polarity that localizes to the neuroblast apical cortical region and directs the polarization of the basal domain. Recent work suggests that polarity can be explained in large part by the mechanisms that restrict aPKC activity to the apical domain and those that couple asymmetric aPKC activity to the polarization of downstream factors. Polarized aPKC activity is created by a network of regulatory molecules, including Bazooka\/Par-3, Cdc42, and the tumor suppressor Lgl, which represses basal recruitment. Direct phosphorylation by aPKC leads to cortical release of basal domain factors, preventing them from occupying the apical domain. In this framework, neuroblast polarity arises from a complex system that orchestrates robust aPKC polarity, which in turn polarizes substrates by coupling phosphorylation to cortical release.","1488":"How are the asymmetric distributions of proteins, lipids, and RNAs established and maintained in various cell types? Studies from diverse organisms show that Par proteins, GTPases, kinases, and phosphoinositides participate in conserved signaling pathways to establish and maintain cell polarity.","1489":"The concept of an immunological synapse goes back to the early 1980s with the discovery of the relationship between T-cell antigen receptor mediated Ca(2+) signaling, adhesion, and directed secretion. However, this concept did not gain traction until images were published starting in 1998 that revealed a specific molecular pattern in the interface between T cells and model antigen-presenting cells or supported planar bilayers. The dominant pattern, a ring of adhesion molecules surrounding a central cluster of antigen receptors, was observed in both model systems. Analysis of the origins of this pattern over the past 10 years has presented a solution for a difficult problem in lymphocyte biology--how a highly motile cell can suddenly stop when it encounters a signal delivered by just a few antigenic ligands on the surface of another cell without disabling the sensory machinery of the motile cell. The T lymphocyte actively assembles the immunological synapse pattern following a modular design with roots in actin-myosin-based motility.","1490":"Gap junctions are aggregates of intercellular channels that permit direct cell-cell transfer of ions and small molecules. Initially described as low-resistance ion pathways joining excitable cells (nerve and muscle), gap junctions are found joining virtually all cells in solid tissues. Their long evolutionary history has permitted adaptation of gap-junctional intercellular communication to a variety of functions, with multiple regulatory mechanisms. Gap-junctional channels are composed of hexamers of medium-sized families of integral proteins: connexins in chordates and innexins in precordates. The functions of gap junctions have been explored by studying mutations in flies, worms, and humans, and targeted gene disruption in mice. These studies have revealed a wide diversity of function in tissue and organ biology.","1491":"The amphibian embryo provides a powerful model system to study morphogen gradients because of the ease with which it is possible to manipulate the early embryo. In particular, it is possible to introduce exogenous sources of morphogen, to follow the progression of the signal, to monitor the cellular response to induction, and to up- or down-regulate molecules that are involved in all aspects of long-range signaling. In this article, I discuss the evidence that gradients exist in the early amphibian embryo, the way in which morphogens might traverse a field of cells, and the way in which different concentrations of morphogens might be interpreted to activate the expression of different genes.","1492":"A large, diverse, and growing number of strategies have been proposed to explain how morphogen gradients achieve robustness and precision. We argue that, to be useful, the evaluation of such strategies must take into account the constraints imposed by competing objectives and performance tradeoffs. This point is illustrated through a mathematical and computational analysis of the strategy of self-enhanced morphogen clearance. The results suggest that the usefulness of this strategy comes less from its ability to increase robustness to morphogen source fluctuations per se, than from its ability to overcome specific kinds of noise, and to increase the fraction of a morphogen gradient within which robust threshold positions may be established. This work also provides new insights into the longstanding question of why morphogen gradients show a maximum range in vivo.","1493":"Cells can polarize in response to external signals, such as chemical gradients, cell-cell contacts, and electromagnetic fields. However, cells can also polarize in the absence of an external cue. For example, a motile cell, which initially has a more or less round shape, can lose its symmetry spontaneously even in a homogeneous environment and start moving in random directions. One of the principal determinants of cell polarity is the cortical actin network that underlies the plasma membrane. Tension in this network generated by myosin motors can be relaxed by rupture of the shell, leading to polarization. In this article, we discuss how simplified model systems can help us to understand the physics that underlie the mechanics of symmetry breaking.","1494":"For cell morphogenesis, the cell must establish distinct spatial domains at specified locations at the cell surface. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of cell polarity in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These are simple rod-shaped cells that form cortical domains at cell tips for cell growth and at the cell middle for cytokinesis. In both cases, microtubule-based systems help to shape the cell by breaking symmetry, providing endogenous spatial cues to position these sites. The plus ends of dynamic microtubules deliver polarity factors to the cell tips, leading to local activation of the GTPase cdc42p and the actin assembly machinery. Microtubule bundles contribute to positioning the division plane through the nucleus and the cytokinesis factor mid1p. Recent advances illustrate how the spatial and temporal regulation of cell polarization integrates many elements, including historical landmarks, positive and negative controls, and competition between pathways.","1495":"Mammalian left-right determination is a good example for how multiple cell biological processes coordinate in the formation of a basic body plan. The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left-right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of posteriorly tilted cilia that are built by transport via KIF3 motor on cells of the ventral node. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left-right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of sheathed lipidic particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the noncanonical hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca(2+) and changes in gene expression.","1496":"Polarized epithelial cells have a distinctive apical-basal axis of polarity for vectorial transport of ions and solutes across the epithelium. In contrast, migratory mesenchymal cells have a front-rear axis of polarity. During development, mesenchymal cells convert to epithelia by coalescing into aggregates that undergo epithelial differentiation. Signaling networks and protein complexes comprising Rho family GTPases, polarity complexes (Crumbs, PAR, and Scribble), and their downstream effectors, including the cytoskeleton and the endocytic and exocytic vesicle trafficking pathways, together regulate the distributions of plasma membrane and cytoskeletal proteins between front-rear and apical-basal polarity. The challenge is to understand how these regulators and effectors are adapted to regulate symmetry breaking processes that generate cell polarities that are specialized for different cellular activities and functions.","1497":"Morphogen gradients play an important role in pattern formation during early stages of embryonic development in many bilaterians. In an adult hydra, axial patterning processes are constantly active because of the tissue dynamics in the adult. These processes include an organizer region in the head, which continuously produces and transmits two signals that are distributed in gradients down the body column. One signal sets up and maintains the head activation gradient, which is a morphogenetic gradient. This gradient confers the capacity of head formation on tissue of the body column, which takes place during bud formation, hydra's mode of asexual reproduction, as well as during head regeneration following bisection of the animal anywhere along the body column. The other signal sets up the head inhibition gradient, which prevents head formation, thereby restricting bud formation to the lower part of the body column in an adult hydra. Little is known about the molecular basis of the two gradients. In contrast, the canonical Wnt pathway plays a central role in setting up and maintaining the head organizer.","1498":"David Baltimore recalls the experiments that led to the discovery of the NF-kappaB transcription factor more than 20 years ago."},"articletitle":{"0":"Caspases and Their Substrates.","1":"Beyond the Code: Noncoding RNAs in Skin Wound Healing.","2":"The Death Receptor Pathway of Apoptosis.","3":"Sex Differences in Circadian Rhythms.","4":"Wound Healing from an Actin Cytoskeletal Perspective.","5":"A Matter of Life and Death.","6":"Imaginal Disc Regeneration: Something Old, Something New.","7":"Fairly Criticized, or Politicized?
