These episodes often arise following development of persistent cold-air pools (PCAPs) that limit mixing and modify chemistry. While field campaigns targeting either basin meteorology or wintertime pollution chemistry have been conducted, coupling between interconnected chemical and meteorological processes remains an insufficiently studied research area. Gaps in understanding the coupled chemical-meteorological interactions that drive high pollution events make identification of the most effective air-basin specific emission control strategies challenging. To address this, a September 2019 workshop occurred with the goal of planning a future research campaign to investigate air quality in Western U.S. basins. Approximately 120 people participated, representing 50 institutions and 5 countries. Workshop participants outlined the rationale and design for a comprehensive wintertime study that would couple atmospheric chemistry and boundary-layer and complex-terrain meteorology within western U.S. basins. Participants concluded the study should focus on two regions with contrasting aerosol chemistry: three populated valleys within Utah (Salt Lake, Utah, and Cache Valleys) and the San Joaquin Valley in California. This paper describes the scientific rationale for a campaign that will acquire chemical and meteorological datasets using airborne platforms with extensive range, coupled to surface-based measurements focusing on sampling within the near-surface boundary layer, and transport and mixing processes within this layer, with high vertical resolution at a number of representative sites. No prior wintertime basin-focused campaign has provided the breadth of observations necessary to characterize the meteorological-chemical linkages outlined here, nor to validate complex processes within coupled atmosphere-chemistry models.","1":"","2":"Severe weather events including tornadoes, damaging winds, hail, and their combination produce changes in land surface vegetation and urban settings that are frequently observed through remote sensing. Capabilities continue to improve through a growing constellation of governmental and commercial assets, increasing the spatial resolution of visible, near to shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing. Here, we highlight cases where visual interpretation of imagery benefitted severe weather damage assessments made within the NOAA\/NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit. Examples demonstrate utility of imagery in assessing tracks and changes in remote areas where staffing limitations or access prevent a ground-based assessment.","3":"The Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) study was designed to describe and explain the evolution of the boundary layer aerosol, cloud, and thermodynamic structures along trajectories within the north-Pacific trade-winds. The study centered on 7 round-trips of the NSF NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) between Sacramento, CA and Kona, Hawaii between 1 July and 15 August 2015. The CSET observing strategy was to sample aerosol, cloud, and boundary layer properties upwind from the transition zone over the North Pacific and to resample these areas two days later. GFS forecast trajectories were used to plan the outbound flight to Hawaii with updated forecast trajectories setting the return flight plan two days later. Two key elements of the CSET observing system were the newly developed HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) and the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). Together they provided unprecedented characterizations of aerosol, cloud and precipitation structures that were combined with in situ measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and turbulence properties. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus infused with smoke from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale cloud-precipitation complexes, and patches of shallow cumuli in very clean environments. Ultra-clean layers observed frequently near the top of the boundary layer were often associated with shallow, optically thin, layered veil clouds. The extensive aerosol, cloud, drizzle and boundary layer sampling made over open areas of the Northeast Pacific along 2-day trajectories during CSET is unprecedented and will enable modeling studies of boundary layer cloud system evolution and the role of different processes in that evolution.","4":"Precipitation has often been used to gauge the performances of numerical weather and climate models, sometimes together with other variables such as temperature, humidity, geopotential, and clouds. Precipitation, however, is singular in that it can present a high spatial variability and probably the sharpest gradients amongst all meteorological fields. Moreover, its quantitative measurement is plagued with difficulties and there are even notable differences among different reference datasets. Several additional issues have yield to sometimes question its usefulness in model validation. This essay discusses the use of precipitation for model verification and validation, and the crucial role of highly precise and reliable satellite estimates, such as those from the core observatory of NASA's Global Precipitation Mission (GPM).","5":"","6":"Coastal regions have historically represented a significant challenge for air quality investigations due to water-land boundary transition characteristics and a paucity of measurements available over water. Prior studies have identified the formation of high levels of ozone over water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay, that can potentially recirculate back over land to significantly impact populated areas. Earth-observing satellites and forecast models face challenges in capturing the coastal transition zone where small-scale meteorological dynamics are complex and large changes in pollutants can occur on very short spatial and temporal scales. An observation strategy is presented to synchronously measure pollutants 'over-land' and 'over-water' to provide a more complete picture of chemical gradients across coastal boundaries for both the needs of state and local environmental management and new remote sensing platforms. Intensive vertical profile information from ozone lidar systems and ozonesondes, obtained at two main sites, one over land and the other over water, are complemented by remote sensing and in-situ observations of air quality from ground-based, airborne (both personned and unpersonned), and shipborne platforms. These observations, coupled with reliable chemical transport simulations, such as the NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability (NAQFC), are expected to lead to a more fully characterized and complete land-water interaction observing system that can be used to assess future geostationary air quality instruments, such as the NASA Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) as well as current low earth orbiting satellites, such as the European Space Agency's Sentinel 5-Precursor (S5-P) with its Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).","7":null,"8":"Over 150 jet engine power-loss and damage events have been attributed to a phenomenon known as Ice Crystal Icing (ICI) during the past two decades. Attributed to ingestion of large numbers of small ice particles into the engine core, typically these events have occurred at high altitudes near large convective systems in tropical air masses. In recent years there have been substantial international efforts by scientists, engineers, aviation regulators and airlines to better understand the relevant meteorological processes, solve critical engineering questions, develop new certification standards, and devise mitigation strategies for the aviation industry. One area of research is the development of nowcasting techniques based on available remote sensing technology and cloud models to identify potential areas of high ice water content (HIWC) and enable the provision of alerts to the aviation industry. An international consortium of researchers has investigated various methods for detecting the HIWC conditions associated with ICI. Multiple techniques have been developed using geostationary and polar orbiting satellite products, numerical weather prediction model fields, and ground based radar data as the basis for HIWC products. Targeted field experiments in tropical regions with high incidence of ICI events have provided data for product validation and refinement of these methods. Beginning in 2015, research teams have assembled at a series of bi-annual workshops to exchange ideas and standardize methods for evaluating performance of HIWC detection products. This paper provides an overview of the approaches used and the current skill for identifying HIWC conditions. Recommendations for future work in this area are also presented.","9":null,"10":"Diapycnal mixing plays a primary role in the thermodynamic balance of the ocean and, consequently, in oceanic heat and carbon uptake and storage. Though observed mixing rates are on average consistent with values required by inverse models, recent attention has focused on the dramatic spatial variability, spanning several orders of magnitude, of mixing rates in both the upper and deep ocean. Away from ocean boundaries, the spatio-temporal patterns of mixing are largely driven by the geography of generation, propagation and dissipation of internal waves, which supply much of the power for turbulent mixing. Over the last five years and under the auspices of US CLIVAR, a NSF- and NOAA-supported Climate Process Team has been engaged in developing, implementing and testing dynamics-based parameterizations for internal-wave driven turbulent mixing in global ocean models. The work has primarily focused on turbulence 1) near sites of internal tide generation, 2) in the upper ocean related to wind-generated near inertial motions, 3) due to internal lee waves generated by low-frequency mesoscale flows over topography, and 4) at ocean margins. Here we review recent progress, describe the tools developed, and discuss future directions.","11":"Online coupled meteorology-atmospheric chemistry models have greatly evolved in recent years. Although mainly developed by the air quality modeling community, these integrated models are also of interest for numerical weather prediction and climate modeling, as they can consider both the effects of meteorology on air quality and the potentially important effects of atmospheric composition on weather. This paper summarizes the main conclusions from the \"Symposium on Coupled Chemistry-Meteorology\/Climate Modelling: Status and Relevance for Numerical Weather Prediction, Air Quality and Climate Research,\" which was initiated by the European COST Action ES1004 \"European Framework for Online Integrated Air Quality and Meteorology Modelling (EuMetChem).\" It offers a brief review of the current status of online coupled meteorology and atmospheric chemistry modeling and a survey of processes relevant to the interactions between atmospheric physics, dynamics, and composition. In addition, it highlights scientific issues and emerging challenges that require proper consideration to improve the reliability and usability of these models for three main application areas: air quality, meteorology (including weather prediction), and climate modeling. It presents a synthesis of scientific progress in the form of answers to nine key questions, and provides recommendations for future research directions and priorities in the development, application, and evaluation of online coupled models.","12":"","13":"OLYMPEX is a comprehensive field campaign to study how precipitation in Pacific storms is modified by passage over coastal mountains.","14":"A modest operational program of systematic aircraft measurements can resolve key satellite-aerosol-data-record limitations. Satellite observations provide frequent, global aerosol-amount maps, but offer only loose aerosol property constraints needed for climate and air quality applications. We define and illustrate the feasibility of flying an aircraft payload to measure key aerosol optical, microphysical, and chemical properties in situ. The flight program could characterize major aerosol air-mass types statistically, at a level-of-detail unobtainable from space. It would: (1) enhance satellite aerosol retrieval products with better climatology assumptions, and (2) improve translation between satellite-retrieved optical properties and species-specific aerosol mass and size simulated in climate models to assess aerosol forcing, its anthropogenic components, and other environmental impacts. As such, Systematic Aircraft Measurements to Characterize Aerosol Air Masses (SAM-CAAM) could add value to data records representing several decades of aerosol observations from space, improve aerosol constraints on climate modeling, help interrelate remote-sensing, in situ, and modeling aerosol-type definitions, and contribute to future satellite aerosol missions. Fifteen Required Variables are identified, and four Payload Options of increasing ambition are defined, to constrain these quantities. \"Option C\" could meet all the SAM-CAAM objectives with about 20 instruments, most of which have flown before, but never routinely several times per week, and never as a group. Aircraft integration, and approaches to data handling, payload support, and logistical considerations for a long-term, operational mission are discussed. SAM-CAAM is feasible because, for most aerosol sources and specified seasons, particle properties tend to be repeatable, even if aerosol loading varies.","15":"","16":"(Beginning of WHAT, WHEN, WHERE Summary Box:) What: The work-shop gathered almost 50 scientists from Europe and the United States to discuss the progress towards developing electromagnetic scattering databases for ice and snow particles in the microwave region, their applications, the physical approximations used to compute these scattering properties, and how remote sensing and in situ observations can be used to validate scattering datasets. One of the main priorities of the workshop was to foster communication between users and developers of scattering databases, and to define standards and conventions for scattering data structures and variables.

The globally averaged intensity of extreme precipitation also changes more rapidly than the globally averaged precipitation rate. While some aspects of the regional variation in precipitation predicted by climate models appear robust, there is still a large degree of inter-model differences unaccounted for. Individual drivers of climate change initially alter the energy budget of the atmosphere leading to distinct rapid adjustments involving changes in precipitation. Differences in how these rapid adjustment processes manifest themselves within models are likely to explain a large fraction of the present model spread and needs better quantifications to improve precipitation predictions. Here, we introduce the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP), where a set of idealized experiments designed to understand the role of different climate forcing mechanisms were performed by a large set of climate models. PDRMIP focuses on understanding how precipitation changes relating to rapid adjustments and slower responses to climate forcings are represented across models. Initial results show that rapid adjustments account for large regional differences in hydrological sensitivity across multiple drivers. The PDRMIP results are expected to dramatically improve our understanding of the causes of the present diversity in future climate projections.","20":"Since 1997, S'COOL has engaged interested participants worldwide in observing clouds and comparing data from ground and satellite sources to inform validation efforts for several NASA Earth science missions.","21":"This article describes NASA\/JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission products and services at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Center (DISC).

This article is intended to guide users in choosing GPM datasets and services at the GES DISC.","22":"A World Meteorological Organization weather and climate extremes committee has judged that the world's longest reported distance for a single lightning flash occurred with a horizontal distance of 321 km (199.5 mi) over Oklahoma in 2007, while the world's longest reported duration for a single lightning flash is an event that lasted continuously for 7.74 seconds over southern France in 2012. In addition, the committee has unanimously recommended amendment of the AMS Glossary of Meteorology definition of lightning discharge as a \"series of electrical processes taking place within 1 second\" by removing the phrase \"within one second\" and replacing with \"continuously.\" Validation of these new world extremes (a) demonstrates the recent and on-going dramatic augmentations and improvements to regional lightning detection and measurement networks, (b) provides reinforcement regarding the dangers of lightning, and","23":"","24":"The measurement of global precipitation, both rainfall and snowfall, is critical to a wide range of users and applications. Rain gauges are indispensable in the measurement of precipitation, remaining the de facto standard for precipitation information across the Earth's surface for hydro-meteorological purposes. However, their distribution across the globe is limited: over land their distribution and density is variable, while over oceans very few gauges exist and where measurements are made, they may not adequately reflect the rainfall amounts of the broader area. Critically, the number of gauges available, or appropriate for a particular study, varies greatly across the Earth due to temporal sampling resolutions, periods of operation, data latency and data access. Numbers of gauges range from a few thousand available in near real time, to about a hundred thousand for all 'official' gauges, and to possibly hundreds of thousands if all possible gauges are included. Gauges routinely used in the generation of global precipitation products cover an equivalent area of between about 250 m2 and 3,000 m2. For comparison, the center circle of a soccer pitch or tennis court is about 260 m2. Although each gauge should represent more than just the gauge orifice, auto-correlation distances of precipitation vary greatly with regime and the integration period. Assuming each Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) -available gauge is independent and represents a surrounding area of 5 km radius, this represents only about 1% of the Earth's surface. The situation is further confounded for snowfall which has a greater measurement uncertainty.","25":null,"26":"","27":null,"28":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Coupled Air Quality and Boundary-Layer
