One of the keys to developing appropriate fabrication methods is determination of the composition and phase. Here we explore the FeGe system and establish reference Raman signatures for the distinction between FeGe hexagonal and cubic structures, as well as FeGe2 and Fe2Ge3 phases. The experimental results are substantiated by first principles lattice dynamics calculations as well as by complementary structural characterization such as transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, along with magnetic measurements.","3":"The present Highlight article shows the importance of the in situ monitoring of bulk crystalline compounds for a more thorough understanding of heterogeneous catalysts at the intersection of catalysis, materials science, crystallography and inorganic chemistry. Although catalytic action is widely regarded as a purely surface-bound phenomenon, there is increasing evidence that bulk processes can detrimentally or beneficially influence the catalytic properties of various material classes. Such bulk processes include polymorphic transformations, formation of oxygen-deficient structures, transient phases and the formation of a metal-oxide composite. The monitoring of these processes and the subsequent establishment of structure-property relationships are most effective if carried out in situ under real operation conditions. By focusing on synchrotron-based in situ X-ray diffraction as the perfect tool to follow the evolution of crystalline species, we exemplify the strength of the concept with five examples from various areas of catalytic research. As catalyst activation studies are increasingly becoming a hot topic in heterogeneous catalysis, the (self-)activation of oxide- and intermetallic compound-based materials during methanol steam and methane dry reforming is highlighted. The perovskite LaNiO3 is selected as an example to show the complex structural dynamics before and during methane dry reforming, which is only revealed upon monitoring all intermediate crystalline species in the transformation from LaNiO3 into Ni\/La2O3\/La2O2CO3. ZrO2-based materials form the second group, indicating the in situ decomposition of the intermetallic compound Cu51Zr14 into an epitaxially stabilized Cu\/tetragonal ZrO2 composite during methanol steam reforming, the stability of a ZrO0.31C0.69 oxycarbide and the gas-phase dependence of the tetragonal-to-monoclinic ZrO2 polymorphic transformation. The latter is the key parameter to the catalytic understanding of ZrO2 and is only appreciated in full detail once it is possible to follow the individual steps of the transformation between the crystalline polymorphic structures. A selected example is devoted to how the monitoring of crystalline reactive carbon during methane dry reforming operation aids in the mechanistic understanding of a Ni\/MnO catalyst. The most important aspect is the strict use of in situ monitoring of the structural changes occurring during (self-)activation to establish meaningful structure-property relationships allowing conclusions beyond isolated surface chemical aspects.","4":null,"5":null,"6":"Natural products are precious feedstock in drug discovery and sustainable materials. This work using crystal engineering strategy, visible light, and solvent-free cycloaddition successfully constructed two caffeic acid derivatives, rel-(1R,2R,3S,4S)-2,4-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)cyclobutane-1,3-dicarboxylate and rel-(1R,2R,3S,4S)-2,4-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)cyclobutane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid. Because of the multiple stereocenters, it is challenging to prepare those compounds using traditional organic synthesis methods. The crystal engineering Hirshfeld surface analysis and 2D intermolecular interaction fingerprints were applied to synthetic route design. The light resources used in this work was visible LED or free, clean, and renewable sunlight. The evidence suggested that pure stereoisomer was obtained demonstrating the stereospecificity and efficiency of the topochemical cycloaddition reaction. The derivatives exhibited free radical scavenging and antioxidant biological activities, as well as the potential inhibitory activity of fatty acid binding proteins. One of the derivatives is the precursor of the natural product Shimobashiric acid C which paves the way for the total synthesis and further study of Shimobashiric acid C. In addition, the derivatives possess photodegradability at a specific wavelength, which is very attractive for \"green\" degradable polymeric materials.","7":"A significant portion of the population suffers from idipoathic calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones, and current clinical treatments of stones have limited lasting success with a high rate of patients suffering from reoccurring stones. Understanding the role of physiologically relevant urinary species on the formation, aggregation, and growth of CaOx crystals can allow for better understanding of this complex biomineralization process and lead to more effective clinical treatments. Our prior work has focused on developing a two-stage model system, where the first stage emulates the formation of Randall's plaque, and the second stage examines the influence of the plaque on overgrowth of CaOx into a stone. Herein, we report on the development of an easy-to-use flow-cell platform that utilizes basement membrane extract (BME) as a biologically relevant crystallization substrate to study the influence of urinary 'inhibitors' on the in situ formation and growth of CaOx on BME under flow conditions. Magnesium, citrate, and osteopontin were studied because of their known ability to inhibit CaOx formation, but their influence also led to interesting modifications to the terminal crystal habit. Magnesium had little to no effect on the CaOx crystallization, but both citrate and osteopontin resulted in significant changes to the crystallization kinetics and the terminal crystal habits. Triply inhibited artificial urine solutions resulted in CaOx monohydrate formations that resembled physiological stones, and the in situ platform allowed for morphogenesis to be dynamically monitored. The BME was also used in a two-stage model system to first grow CaP that mimicked Randall's plaques, whereby the impact of the CaP crystallizing surface on CaOx formation could be studied. It was found that the CaP surface did not result in any significant changes in CaOx crystal formation or growth indicating that the urinary inhibitors and the basement membrane substrate were the dominant factors in modulating CaOx crystallization. It was also found that the basement membrane surface promoted the attachment and\/or nucleation and growth of both CaOx and CaP crystals compared to bare glass surfaces, thereby enabling easy study of the urinary inhibitors. The work presented here has elucidated the terminal growth habit of different COM structures and has provided an easy to use platform that can be widely adopted by the kidney stone and other crystallization communities.","8":"The reduction of pure and Sm-doped ceria in hydrogen has been studied by synchrotron-based in situ X-ray diffraction to eventually prove or disprove the presence of crystalline cerium hydride (CeH x ) phases and the succession of potential structural phase (trans)formations of reduced cerium oxide phases during heating-cooling cycles up to 1273 K. Despite a recent report on the existence of bulk and surface CeH x phases during reductive treatment of pure CeO2 in H2, structural analysis by Rietveld refinement as well as additional 1H-NMR spectroscopy did not reveal the presence of any crystalline CeH x phase. Rather, a sequence of phase transformations during the re-cooling process in H2 has been observed. In both samples, the reduced\/defective fluorite lattice undergoes at first a transformation into a bixbyite-type lattice with a formal stoichiometry Ce0.58 3+Ce0.42 4+O1.71 and Sm0.15 3+Ce0.39 3+Ce0.46 4+O1.73, before a transformation into rhombohedral Ce7O12 takes place in pure CeO2. This phase is clearly absent for the Sm-doped material. Finally, a triclinic Ce11O20 phase appears for both materials, which can be recovered to room temperature, and on which a phase mixture of bixbyite Ce0.66 3+Ce0.34 4+O1.67, rh-Ce0.60 3+Ce0.40 4+O1.70 and tri-Ce0.48 3+Ce0.52 4+O1.76 (for pure CeO2) or bixbyite Sm0.15 3+Ce0.47 3+Ce0.38 4+O1.69 and tri-Sm0.15 3+Ce0.31 3+Ce0.54 4+O1.77 (for Sm-doped CeO2) prevails. The absence of the rhombohedral phase indicates that Sm doping leads to the stabilization of the bixbyite phase over the rhombohedral one at this particular oxygen vacancy concentration. It is worth noting that recent work proves that hydrogen is indeed incorporated within the structures during the heat treatments, but under the chosen experimental conditions it has apparently no effect on the salient structural principles during reduction.","9":null,"10":"1-N-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [BMIM][PF6], and its methylated form, 1-N-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, [BMMIM][PF6], were incorporated into CuBTC to examine the effect of methylation of ionic liquids (ILs) on the gas separation performance of the corresponding IL\/metal-organic framework (MOF) composites. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the interactions of the methylated ILs with CuBTC were weaker compared to those of its non-methylated counterpart. Gas uptake measurements illustrated that this difference in the interactions influences the gas separation performance of the composites. Accordingly, the CO2\/N2: 15\/85 and CH4\/N2: 50\/50 selectivities increased by 37% and 60% for [BMMIM][PF6]\/CuBTC and 34% and 50% for [BMIM][PF6]\/CuBTC, respectively, compared to the corresponding selectivities of pristine CuBTC at 1000 mbar. The results revealed another structural parameter controlling the performance of the IL\/MOF composites, a novel type of material with rapidly expanding application areas.","11":null,"12":"The structure property relationships of untwinned enantiomorphic Z-(methylseleno)alkenyl-substituted phenyl-isoxazole and its isostructural triazole congener both crystallizing in the P212121 space group were investigated with respect to UV\/vis absorption, thermal behaviour, and second harmonic generation ability. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a significantly higher melting point of the novel isoxazole compound compared to the triazole derivative and therefore a broader thermal application window. The SHG efficiency of the isoxazole derivative is approximately two thirds the value of the triazole compound and approximately 27 times higher than potassium dihydrogen phosphate. Thus, the developed molecular scaffold represents an interesting novel type of nonlinear optical (NLO) chromophore.","13":null,"14":"A computational search for polymorphs of cytosine, 5-flucytosine and a 1 : 1 mixture of the two substances not only rationalised the preferred packing arrangements but also enabled the finding and characterisation of cytosine\/5-flucytosine solid solutions. The structures of the new solid forms were determined by combining laboratory powder X-ray diffraction data and computational modelling.","15":"Defined crystal growth is highly demanded for technological applications but also fundamental research. Within this work, the crystal growth of the asymmetric molecule caffeine was studied on single crystalline surfaces of muscovite mica, sodium chloride and potassium chloride. While elongated needle-like crystals grow on muscovite mica and sodium chloride, smaller individual \"bird-like\" structures were observed on potassium chloride. Depending on the surface type and temperature, the disk-shaped caffeine molecules prefer either an edge-on or flat-on orientation with respect to the surface, but in each case, a defined crystallographic relation between the surface and caffeine crystallites was determined by using the X-ray pole figure technique. On muscovite mica and sodium chloride, needle-like crystallites with edge-on oriented molecules aligned mainly with the unit cell c-axis (which coincides with the long needle axis) along the [1-10]mica, [100]mica, [110]mica and [110]NaCl, [1-10]NaCl directions, respectively. Crystals consisting of flat-on oriented molecules on KCl showed also defined alignments with respect to the substrate, but due to the altered molecule-substrate contact, the b-axis aligned along [110]KCl and [1-10]KCl. Growth at elevated temperatures enabled changes in the crystal growth whereby more defined structures formed on NaCl. On KCl, the bird-like structures remained very similar, while caffeine on the mica surface at elevated temperatures resulted in even additional texture forming with the caffeine molecules now also favoring a flat-on orientation with respect to the surface. The systematic variation of various system parameters demonstrates how sensitive the growth behavior of caffeine on this variety of substrates is.","16":null,"17":"Epindolidione, a hydrogen-bonded derivative of the organic semiconductor tetracene, is an organic pigment which has previously been used to produce stable OFETs with relatively high hole mobilities. Despite its use as an inkjet pigment and organic semiconductor, the crystal structure of epindolidione has proved elusive and is currently unknown. In this work, we report a crystal structure solution of epindolidione determined from vapor deposited thin films using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The structure is found to be similar to one of the previously reported epindolidione derivatives and is most likely a surface-mediated polymorph, with a slightly different crystal packing compared to the bulk powder. The effect of substrate temperature on film morphology and structure is also investigated, where it is found that the crystallite orientation can be tuned by deposition at different substrate temperatures. The results also illustrate the possibilities for crystal structures to be solved from thin films.","18":"Water-soluble Pt nanoflowers (NFs) were prepared by diethylene glycol-mediated reduction of Pt acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) in the presence of polyethylenimine. Advanced electron microscopy analysis showed that the NFs consist of multiple branches with a truncated cubic morphology and different crystallographic orientations. We demonstrate that the nature of the solvent strongly influences the resulting morphology. The catalytic performance of the Pt NFs in 4-nitrophenol reduction was found to be superior to that of other nanoparticle-based catalysts. Additionally, the Pt NFs display good catalytic reusability with no loss of activity after five consecutive cycles.","19":"PIXEL has been used to perform calculations of adsorbate-adsorbent interaction energies between a range of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and simple guest molecules. Interactions have been calculated for adsorption between MOF-5 and Ar, H2, and N2; Zn2(BDC)2(TED) (BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, TED = triethylenediamine) and H2; and HKUST-1 and CO2. The locations of the adsorption sites and the calculated energies, which show differences in the Coulombic or dispersion characteristic of the interaction, compare favourably to experimental data and literature energy values calculated using density functional theory.","20":null,"21":"Photocatalytic conversion of solar energy into chemical energy has attracted considerable interest for several decades. One compound already reported as a visible-light-active photocatalyst for water splitting is BiYWO6, a member of the Bi2-x Y x WO6 family of compounds. The structural and optical properties of other members of this family have not been reported to date. In this work, we synthesized various compositions of Bi2-x Y x WO6, studied their optical properties, and report their structural parameters obtained by utilizing powder diffraction coupled with Rietveld refinement.","22":"The electronic and structural properties of two tetrathiafulvalene derivatives bearing aromatic benzene rings are reported. Thin film transistors of these materials show p-type characteristics with comparable mobility values. It is found that the rigidification of the molecule is beneficial for reducing the reorganisation energy but also has an unfavorable impact on the electronic structure dimensionality.","23":null,"24":"Producing stable nanocrystals confined to porous excipient media is a desirable way to increase the dissolution rate and improve the bioavailability of poorly water soluble pharmaceuticals. The poorly soluble pharmaceutical fenofibrate was crystallized in controlled pore glass (CPG) of 10 different pore sizes between 12 nm and 300 nm. High drug loadings of greater than 20 wt% were achieved across all pore sizes greater than 20 nm. Nanocrystalline fenofibrate was formed in pore sizes greater than 20 nm and showed characteristic melting point depressions following a Gibbs-Thomson relationship as well as enhanced dissolution rates. Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was employed to characterize the crystallinity of the confined molecules. These results help to advance the fundamental understanding of nanocrystallization in confined pores.","25":null,"26":"Methods to produce nano-sized organic molecular crystals in thin films are of great interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to the potential benefit of increased solubility of poorly soluble drugs and the advantages of film-based dosage forms over traditional tablet\/capsule-based dosage form. One method to directly form organic nanocrystals is by crystallization in confined environments where the overall crystallization volume is constrained. We report the use of a novel solution impregnation method to form nanocrystals in polymer matrices with various microstructures in order to study the structure of the confined nanocrystals and the role of soft confinement and polymer chemistry on the nucleation process of nano-sized crystals. The particle diameter correlates with the microstructure of the polymer matrices and the nucleation kinetics. In addition, by carefully choosing the experimental conditions and the polymer matrix, polymorph control of nanocrystals can be achieved. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) was used to examine the local structure of nanocrystals inside the polymer matrices and crystal polymer interactions. This method may serve as a novel formulation method to obtain nanocrystals of poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for pharmaceutical industry.","27":null,"28":"Reductive intercalation of potassium within the molecular framework Ag3[Fe(CN)6] gives rise to a volume strain that is an order of magnitude smaller than is typical for common ion-storage materials.

Systematic refinements of the obtained powder patterns demonstrate that these materials expand along a specific direction while undergoing total volume reduction under an increase in hydrostatic pressure. The results confirm for the first time the Negative Linear Compressibility behaviour of this family of materials recently predicted from quantum chemical calculations.","30":"The peptide bond model N-methylacetamide self-assembles with a range of dihalotetrafluorobenzenes forming co-crystals that all show the occurrence of orthogonal hydrogen and halogen bonds.","31":null,"32":"Crystallization in rigid confinement is a promising method to obtain organic molecular nanocrystals. However, the crystallization behavior and the related characterization methods are not well studied. Here we present a systematic study of the nucleation of organic molecular nanocrystals in rigid pores. Four different compounds were studied, ibuprofen, fenofibrate, griseofulvin, and indomethacin, which range from simple to complex molecules. Solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was employed to analyse the structure of these compounds inside pores which are difficult to characterize by other analytical methods. We successfully demonstrated the production of nano-crystalline ibuprofen, fenofibrate and griseofulvin in porous silica particles with ~ 40 nm pores. These nanocrystals showed significant enhancement in dissolution rates. These results help advance the fundamental understanding of nucleation under rigid confinement and may lead to potential applications in developing new formulations in the pharmaceutical industry.","33":"One-pot solvothermal synthesis of a robust tetranuclear sodium hexakis(glycolato)tris(methanolato)aluminate complex Na3[Al4(OCH3)3(OCH2CH2O)6] via a modified yet rigorous base-catalyzed transesterification mechanism is presented here. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies indicate that this unique Al complex contains three penta-coordinate Al3+ ions, each bound to two bidentate ethylene glycolate chelators and one monodentate methanolate ligand. The remaining fourth Al3+ ion is octahedrally coordinated to one oxygen atom from each of the six surrounding glycolate chelators, effectively stitching the three penta-coordinate Al moieties together into a novel tetranuclear Al complex. This aluminate complex is periodically self-assembled into well-ordered layers normal to the [110] axis with the intra-\/inter-layer bindings involving extensive ionic bonds from the three charge-counterbalancing Na+ cations rather than the more typical hydrogen bonding interactions as a result of the fewer free hydroxyl groups present in its structure. It can also serve as a valuable precursor toward the facile synthesis of high-surface-area alumina powders using a very efficient rapid pyrolysis technique.","34":"A fluorescent macrocyclic anion receptor based on the 2,6-bis(2-anilinoethynyl)pyridine scaffold has been synthesized to investigate the mechanism of fluorescence quenching in this class of compounds. X-ray crystallography reveals that the binding pocket of the receptor is a natural host to both H2O and HCl, accommodating either molecule in nearly identical environments. Our studies show that protonation, not collisional quenching, is responsible for the observed fluorescence quenching response.","35":null,"36":null,"37":"Crystallization of l-alanine in the presence of l-valine and l-tryptophan additives on a circular poly(methyl) methacrylate (PMMA) platform designed for Metal-Assisted and Microwave-Accelerated Evaporative Crystallization (MA-MAEC) technique was investigated. Theoretical simulations predicted homogeneous temperature and electric field distributions across the circular PMMA platforms during microwave heating. Crystallization of l-alanine with and without additives on the blank and silver nanoparticle films (SNFs) modified sides of the circular PMMA platform occurred within 32-50 min using MA-MAEC technique, while the identical solutions crystallized within 161-194 min at room temperature. Optical microscopy studies revealed that l-alanine crystals without additives were found to be smaller in size and had several well-developed faces, whereas l-alanine crystals grown with additives appeared to be larger and had only one dominant highly-developed face. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that all l-alanine crystals had identical peaks, despite the morphological differences between the l-alanine crystals with and without additives observed by optical microscope images.","38":"Oriented long needle-like p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) crystals are successfully prepared by directional freezing of PABA solution in this work. The width of the oriented crystals is controlled by changing the directional cooling rate, resulting in varying crystal morphologies and thermodynamic properties while maintaining the same chemical structure.","39":"For those seeking to model biomineralization in vitro, hydrogels can serve as excellent models of the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. A major challenge posed in implementing such systems is the logistics involved, from fundamental engineering to experimental design. For the study of calcium phosphate (e.g., hydroxyapatite) formation, many researchers use hydrogel-based double-diffusion systems (DDSs). The various designs of these DDSs are seemingly as unique as their applications. In this Highlight, we present a survey of four distinct types of double-diffusion systems and evaluate them in the context of fundamental diffusion theory. Based upon this analysis, we present the design and evaluation of an optimized system. The techniques and framework for the evaluation and construction of a DDS presented here can be applied to any DDS that a researcher may want to implement for their particular studies of biomineralization.","40":null,"41":null,"42":"","43":"The ability of cyanoxime-based synthons to act as versatile synthetic tools for the construction of co-crystals is demonstrated through the preparation and structural characterization of seven co-crystals. Cyanoximes can bind effectively to both five-membered and six-membered N-heterocyclic hydrogen-bond acceptors, and they also display selectivity towards the best acceptor (as determined using semi-empirical AM1 calculations) in ditopic compounds.","44":"Three compounds, each derived from Fentanyl and differing essentially only in the length of a carboxylic acid chain, were synthesized and yielded four crystal structures three of which share several structural similarities, including the length of the chain, while the fourth, with a shorter chain, is quite different. The chain length has a significant influence on the crystal structures formed. The 'three atom' chain compounds are all solvated zwitterions which feature a hydrogen-bonded 'dimer' between adjacent zwitterions. The formation of this large dimer leaves available a second carboxylate O atom to take part in hydrogen bonding interactions with solvent molecules. The shorter 'two atom' chain compound was difficult to crystallize and required the use of synchrotron radiation to measure X-ray diffraction data. It does not form the same dimer motif observed in the 'three atom' chain compounds and has not formally formed a zwitterion; although there is evidence of proton sharing or disorder X-ray data are insufficient to create a disordered model, and the compound was modeled as formally neutral based on O-H and N-H distances.
