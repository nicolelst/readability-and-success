ability to recognize emotions from facial expression (FER) may be impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to explore FER in PD patients by using a dynamic presentation of emotions across different intensities and to examine the extent to which executive and affective alterations contributed to FER deficits. Fifteen PD patients and 15 healthy controls were assessed on the emotion recognition task (ERT). We also explored how clinical and executive factors could have contributed to ERT accuracy. PD patients showed poorer performance on the ERT, specifically on angry expressions, but they benefited from increased intensity as much as controls did. Differences were also found for apathy, depression, and executive tests, especially in the inhibition domain. Importantly, differences between groups on the ERT disappeared when controlling for inhibition and the affective symptoms. A significant effect of inhibition dysfunction was also observed on the ERT performance. Our findings demonstrate the presence of emotion recognition deficits of morphed facial expressions in patients with PD. Moreover, they suggest that inhibition dysfunctions may act as an important factor negatively influencing FER. The present study highlights the complex nature of emotion processing and its relation with emotional-affective and cognitive aspects to provide a better understanding of FER deficits in PD.

In this study, we used item-level performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to identify individuals with subtle cognitive decline. Individual MoCA item data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative was grouped using k-modes cluster analysis. These clusters were validated and examined for association with convergent neuropsychological tests. The clusters were then compared and characterized using multinomial logistic regression. A three-cluster solution had 77.3% precision, with Cluster 1 (high performing) displaying no deficits in performance, Cluster 2 (memory deficits) displaying lower memory performance, and Cluster 3 (compound deficits) displaying lower performance on memory and executive function. Age at MoCA (older in compound deficits), gender (more females in memory deficits), and marital status (fewer married in compound deficits) were significantly different among clusters. Age was not associated with increased odds of membership in the high-performing cluster compared to the others. We identified three clusters of individuals classified as cognitively unimpaired using cluster analysis. Individuals in the compound deficits cluster performed lower on the MoCA and were older and less often married than individuals in other clusters. Demographic analyses suggest that cluster identity was due to a combination of both cognitive and clinical factors. Identifying individuals at risk for future cognitive decline using the MoCA could help them receive earlier evidence-based interventions to slow further cognitive decline.

","3":null,"4":"To describe a cultural neuropsychological approach to prestatistical harmonization of cognitive data across the United States (U.S.) and Mexico with the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP). We performed a comprehensive review of the administration, scoring, and coding procedures for each cognitive test item administered across the English and Spanish versions of the HCAP in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the U.S. and the Ancillary Study on Cognitive Aging in Mexico (Mex-Cog). For items that were potentially equivalent across studies, we compared each cognitive test item for linguistic and cultural equivalence and classified items as confident or tentative linking items, based on the degree of confidence in their comparability across cohorts and language groups. We evaluated these classifications using differential item functioning techniques. We evaluated 132 test items among 21 cognitive instruments in the HCAP across the HRS and Mex-Cog. We identified 72 confident linking items, 46 tentative linking items, and 14 items that were not comparable across cohorts. Measurement invariance analysis revealed that 64% of the confident linking items and 83% of the tentative linking items showed statistical evidence of measurement differences across cohorts. Prestatistical harmonization of cognitive data, performed by a multidisciplinary and multilingual team including cultural neuropsychologists, can identify differences in cognitive construct measurement across languages and cultures that may not be identified by statistical procedures alone.

","5":"The differentiation between automatic and procedural processing in arithmetic can be crucial when examining the links between arithmetic and sustained attention, as the latter is suggested to be particularly important in more automatic and monotonous situations. The present study examined the interrelations between sustained attention and arithmetic performance while differentiating, for the first time, between automatic and procedural arithmetic problem solving, and between various groups diagnosed with difficulties in the numerical domain. The data of 506 students from the national diagnostic system for learning disabilities were used in order to examine this relationship in typically developed population and different groups with developmental dyscalculia (DD): pure DD and DD with attention deficiency. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, a differential relationship between arithmetic and sustained attention depending on the automaticity of the arithmetic task, as strong links were found under automatic arithmetic tasks when compared to under procedural ones. Furthermore, although the DD groups with attention difficulties presented similar patterns of correlations to those seen among the typically developed group, the pure DD showed no correlation between sustained attention and automatic arithmetic. These findings not only suggest that sustained attention plays a different role in automatic and procedural arithmetic but also support the notion that pure DD might not achieve automaticity in arithmetic and therefore do not rely on the sustained attention system even under simple automatic situations in arithmetic.

","6":"A growing body of research provides reliable evidence of moderate to large magnitude deficits in the visuospatial (VS) working memory (WM) of children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), relative to typically developing (TD) children. Studies of ADHD-related Visuo-spatial Working Memory (VS-WM) functioning most often present sequential presentations of VS stimuli and examine general performance characteristics. Only a few studies have examined the effects of varying VS-WM task parameters on performance in children with ADHD, despite evidence from basic-cognitive research that indicates methodological heterogeneity in VS-WM task parameters yields significant performance variability that is associated with underlying mechanistic processes. This study is the first to examine the effect of the task parameters path characteristics and path crossings on performance in children with ADHD and TD children. School-aged children with ADHD (n = 50) and TD children (n = 59) completed a VS-WM task that varied by path lengths and path crossings. Multilevel analyses indicated a negative effect of relatively long paths on VS-WM performance of both TD children and children with ADHD, and a negative effect of increasing path crossings that appears to be unique to TD children and dependent on path length. Overall, findings appear to suggest that school-aged children engage in dynamic rehearsal of VS information (i.e., mental rehearsal of path sequences), rather than static rehearsal (i.e., rehearsal of a gestalt). Moreover, ADHD-related VS-WM deficits are most likely to yield real-world impairments when information is presented with relatively long path lengths.

","7":"A variety of factors affect list learning performance and relatively few studies have examined the impact of word selection on these tests. This study examines the effect of both language and memory processing of individual words on list learning. Item-response data from 1,219 participants, Mage = 74.41 (SD = 7.13), Medu = 13.30 (SD = 2.72), in the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol were used. A Bayesian generalized (non)linear multilevel modeling framework was used to specify the measurement and explanatory item-response theory models. Explanatory effects on items due to learning over trials, serial position of words, and six word properties obtained through the English Lexicon Project were modeled. A two parameter logistic (2PL) model with trial-specific learning effects produced the best measurement fit. Evidence of the serial position effect on word learning was observed. Robust positive effects on word learning were observed for body-object integration while robust negative effects were observed for word frequency, concreteness, and semantic diversity. A weak negative effect of average age of acquisition and a weak positive effect for the number of phonemes in the word were also observed. Results demonstrate that list learning performance depends on factors beyond the repetition of words. Identification of item factors that predict learning could extend to a range of test development problems including translation, form equating, item revision, and item bias. In data harmonization efforts, these methods can also be used to help link tests via shared item features and testing of whether these features are equally explanatory across samples.

","8":null,"9":null,"10":"Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to infer others' mental (Cognitive) and emotional (Affective) states, both being impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric features underlying Affective and Cognitive ToM deficits in PD are unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analytic study to test whether PD demographical, clinical, neuropsychological, or neuropsychiatric changes related differently to both ToM processes. A systematic literature search was performed up to January 2022, including a total of 31 studies following our search terms. Data from each study were obtained from demographic (age, education), clinical (disease duration, Hoehn &amp; Yahr staging system, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III, levodopa equivalent daily dose), neuropsychological (global cognitive functioning, memory subdomains, executive functions subdomains, processing speed\/complex attention\/working memory, visuospatial and constructional abilities, and language), and neuropsychiatric (depression, apathy, anxiety) variables. Affective ToM impairment in PD was related to lower educational level and global cognition, deficits of generativity, decision making, attention\/working memory, and language. Conversely, Cognitive ToM deficits were associated with advanced age, poorer global cognition, executive dysfunctions, and language impairments. Medication moderated the relationship between attention\/working memory and Cognitive ToM, whereas age moderated the association of Affective ToM with language. No significant associations were found between ToM deficits and patients' neuropsychiatric or clinical states. These findings clarify the neuropsychological and clinical features that explain ToM deficits in PD.

","11":"There are many competing working memory models, generally formulated from young adult, typically student, samples from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and developed (WEIRD) contexts. Whether such models are adequate conceptualizations of working memory (WM) in young adults from non-WEIRD contexts is unclear. This study tested five possible models of the structure of working memory in young South African adults (n = 162; Mage = 20.41, SDage = 1.82, 38% female) who are multilingual, from predominantly low socioeconomic, largely rural, contexts. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a four-component structure composed of domain-specific (verbal, visuospatial) storage and processing provided the best fit for the data. Neuropsychological tests and rehabilitation approaches are based on leading models of working memory, and so their cross-cultural appropriateness is important.

","12":"To resolve inconsistencies in the literature regarding the dominance of the right cerebral hemisphere (RH) in emotional face perception, specifically investigating the role of the intensity of emotional expressions, different emotions, and conscious perception. The study used an online version of the well-established emotional chimeric face task (ECFT) in which participants judged which side of a chimeric face stimulus was more emotional. We tested the laterality bias in the ECFT across six basic emotions and experimentally modified the intensity of the emotional facial expression from neutral to fully emotional expressions, in incremental steps of 20%. The results showed an overall left hemiface bias across all emotions, supporting the RH hypothesis of emotional lateralization. However, the left hemiface bias decreased with decreasing intensity of the emotional facial expression. The results provide further support for the RH hypothesis and suggest that the RH dominance in emotional face perception may be affected by task difficulty and visual perception strategy.

","13":"Cognitive flexibility has been previously described as the ability to adjust cognitive and behavioral strategies in response to changing contextual demands. Cognitive flexibility is typically assessed via self-report questionnaires and performance on neuropsychological tests in research and clinical practice. A common assumption among researchers and clinicians is that self-report and neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility assess the same or similar constructs, but the extent of the relationship between these two assessment approaches in clinical cohorts remains unknown. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the relationship between self-report and neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility in clinical samples. We searched 10 databases and relevant gray literature (e.g., other databases and pearling) from inception to October 2020 and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. Eleven articles including 405 participants satisfied our eligibility criteria. A multilevel random-effects meta-analysis revealed no relationship between self-report and neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility (0.01, 95% CI [-0.16 to 0.18]). Individual random-effects meta-analyses between 12 different tests pairs also found no relationship. Based on our results, it is clear that the two assessment approaches of cognitive flexibility provide independent information-they do not assess the same construct. These findings have important ramifications for future research and clinical practice-there is a need to reconsider what constructs self-report and neuropsychological tests of \"cognitive flexibility\" actually assess, and avoid the interchangeable use of these assessments in clinical samples.

Although the neural basis of trait proactive aggression is becoming clearer, the neural basis of state proactive aggression has been largely ignored and remains unclear. We explore the basic brain correlates of state proactive aggression using a reward-interference task (RIT), in which participants play a competitive reactive time task against an opponent. They can make decision to give the opponent noise interference for winning the game and gaining reward or not. Forty healthy participants from a university in China performed the RIT in the scanner and their functional images were obtained on a 3.0-T Siemens Tim Trio scanner. Finally, 38 participants (21 males, M age = 19.24, SD = 1.32) were included in analyses. The results show that relative to the baseline, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were activated by aggression selection and nonaggression selection in the RIT. Furthermore, relative to nonaggression selection, the MPFC, ACC, TPJ, IFG, middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and middle temporal gyrus (MTG) were more strongly activated during aggression selection and correlated with the scores of some of the three basic proactive aggression motivations (instrumental motivation, moral inhibition motivation, and moral approval motivation). The results provide preliminary evidence of neural correlates for state proactive aggression and should be replicated by other methods or with other samples.

","15":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which can substantially affect nonmotor functions related to emotional processing. We aimed to examine the underlying differences in emotional processing in PD by comparing how early-stage PD patients recognize, rate, and react to facial, bodily, and vocal emotional stimuli to that of healthy controls (HC). We compared emotion recognition, emotional rating bias, and emotional response range between a PD patient group (n = 33) and a HC group (n = 29). Pearson's correlations were conducted to evaluate the relationship between emotion processing measures and clinical outcome measures in each group. PD patients showed an enhanced emotion processing as compared to HC. They were overall more accurate than HC's at identifying correct emotions and furthermore showed an increase in emotional ratings and reactions to both positive and negative stimuli that scaled with increased symptom severity, thereby yielding significant correlations between clinical outcomes and emotional range in the PD patient group. Our results suggest that alterations in emotional processing reflect disease progression in early PD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved). ","16":"Physical fitness and preserved cognitive function may provide neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis (MS), but few studies have examined their role in symptom progression over time. Dual-task paradigms can be useful to detect subtle impairment among people with MS in early stages of the disease. The present study investigated whether higher aerobic fitness or greater cognitive function could predict performance in dual-task walking 1-2 years later among people with mild or no MS-related walking impairment. Participants (n = 50) performed dual-task walking (walking while serially subtracting 7's from 100), completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), and a fitness test (VO2max). They were tested at two time points (T1 and T2), approximately 1 year apart. Walking speed, MoCA, SDMT, and VO2max at baseline (T1) were examined as predictors of dual-task walking speed at T2. MoCA (higher score), but not SDMT or fitness, was significantly correlated with percentage decrease in dual-task walking and was a significant predictor of dual-task-walking speed at T2, accounting for additional 6.1% of its variance. Cognitive impairment (MoCA &lt; 26) at baseline corresponded to a 12 cm\/s unit decrease in dual-task-walking speed at T2. Our results provide longitudinal evidence that better cognitive function, specifically global MoCA score, may protect against decline in dual-task walking ability over the years.

Intraindividual variability (IIV) is a measure of variability across multiple tasks of cognitive functioning. Due to the limited amount of research, particularly among individuals with PD, IIV has been an underutilized metric of cognitive functioning both in research and clinical practice. Previous research demonstrated that individuals with PD have greater variability in cognitive performance relative to controls, and that IIV is predictive of future cognitive impairments. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between baseline IIV and change in cortical and subcortical volumes among individuals with PD. The present study used data from 80 newly diagnosed PD patients who were part of a longitudinal cohort study (Parkinson progression marker initiative [PPMI]). Participants completed neuropsychological measures and underwent T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and the first annual follow-up. Neuropsychological tests assessed attention, processing speed, visuospatial functioning, verbal fluency learning, and memory. T1 scans were processed using standard Freesurfer protocols for extraction of regional volumes. Greater IIV at baseline was predictive of change in cortical volume in posterior temporal\/parietal regions over the 1-year period. Baseline IIV predicted cortical volume changes above and beyond the main effect of motor severity and the baseline statistical mean\/global cognition score. Our results provide initial evidence that IIV is a marker of longitudinal cortical volume loss. Evidence is building that IIV is a sensitive marker of cognitive impairment and the underlying neurodegeneration among individuals with PD.

The sample used in phenotypic and behavioral genetic analyses comprised 468 twins (154 monozygotic and 80 dizygotic twin pairs), while molecular genetic analyses were performed on 404 twins from the same sample. The zygosity of most twin pairs (96.8%) was determined via deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of buccal swabs. Trained researchers administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Heaton et al., 1993) to the entire sample. A phenotypic factor analysis of WCST variables suggested a single-factor solution. Overall heritability ranged from 0.19 to 0.23 across different measures of the WCST. The presence of a single general genetic factor, which could be identified from different measures of the WCST, indicated the unity of various WCST indicators and the existence of a common basic ability. Performance on the WCST did not reveal significant differences between the three genotypes on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). Carriers of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Met + genotype exhibited better performance in cognitive functions in comparison to the BDNF Met- genotype. This study highlighted similarities in the phenotypic and genetic structures of the WCST, suggesting one general factor underlying different cognitive functions. The BDNF Met + genotype showed significant main effects on different WCST measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved). ","21":"We investigated the imagination inflation effect in healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to determine whether an intervention can reduce susceptibility to these distortions, with implications for daily functioning. Fifty-seven older adults aged 69-90 participated. In Session 1, participants either: listened to an action statement being read, performed the action, or imagined performing the action. Actions were either functional (encountered actions of daily life; e.g., \"fill the pillbox\") or nonfunctional (not routinely encountered; e.g., \"put the toy duck on a plate\"). During Session 2, participants imagined action statements from the first session. In Session 3, participants were asked to determine whether action statements were performed during the first session. Intervention participants were instructed before the first and third sessions to attend various sensory aspects of their experience using a cue-utilization technique. Memory was worse for functional compared to nonfunctional actions. For older adults with MCI, the intervention increased correct identifications of functional actions that were performed. For healthy older adults, the intervention increased source memory of functional actions that were imagined. The intervention did not impact the accuracy of nonfunctional actions or the rates of misremembering an action as having been performed. These initial findings supported the efficacy of a cue-utilization intervention to improve memory for functional actions in an imagination inflation effect paradigm in community-dwelling older adults. The use of such strategies represents an important first step in designing interventions that are applicable to daily life. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved). ","22":"We explored the relationship between a visual scanning strategy and a facial emotion recognition deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty nondemented PD patients (balanced for symptom side at onset) and 20 age, education and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. The PD group underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery also exploring the executive functions. In both groups, eye movements were recorded while subjects categorized facial emotion from Ekman's 60-faces test. We were particularly interested in the location of fixations on facial pictures (top vs. bottom) and in emotional valence (positive vs. negative). We also compared performance of the two groups on a verbal emotion attribution task. Compared to HC, PD patients performed worse on visual recognition of negative emotions such as anger, fear, and sadness (where the upper part of the face is more informative than the lower part); the two groups did not differ on the verbal emotion attribution task. HC modified their visual scanning strategy (both number and overall time duration of fixations) according to the valence of the emotion; by contrast, PD showed the same pattern regardless of the valence. In the PD group, accuracy in the visual recognition of negative emotions and fixation pattern correlated with performance on tasks exploring executive functions; however, no associations were observed with severity of motor state. Our results suggest that visual scanning strategy contributes significantly to the facial emotion recognition deficit of PD patients, especially at a \"high level\" related to cognitive control of eye movements.

Although evidence has shown that rehabilitation programs may improve cognitive performance in persons with ABI, there is an opportunity to look more closely at the benefits provided by specific interventions. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether compensation-based memory programs improve memory or everyday outcomes (e.g., mood, quality of life, community integration, everyday functioning). The review was limited to published, English-language controlled trials that evaluated compensatory memory interventions for adults (18 +) with ABI using at least one memory or everyday outcome. The final search was conducted in April 2021 using PsychINFO, Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Review database, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant articles. Of 2,817 identified articles, 22 controlled trials met inclusion criteria, of which 12 provided sufficient data to include in the meta-analyses. Risk of bias assessment identified problems with recruitment and masking procedures. Results indicate that compared to controls, these interventions produce positive effects on outcomes of immediate verbal recall (g = 0.43), participant-reported memory (g = 0.28), and strategy use (g = 0.39) and that these improvements are maintained at follow-up. Compensatory memory programs produce meaningful memory improvements and are a promising avenue for reducing ABI-related memory impairment.

","24":"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety and depression), where individuals suffer high levels of stress from the social, physical, and cognitive burden of the disease. The present study examined two factors associated with increased risk for symptoms of anxiety and depression: executive function skills (inhibitory control\/attention and working memory) and skills to cope with stress. Adults with HD completed the NIH Toolbox measures of inhibitory control\/attention and working memory, as well as self-report measures of coping with HD-related stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Path analyses were used to test direct and indirect associations among the subtypes of executive functioning, coping, and symptoms. No significant associations were found in the full sample (n = 47), due to a significant portion of the sample with very low executive function abilities. Additional analyses were conducted on a subset of the sample (participants in the top three quartiles on both measures of executive functioning, n = 32). Significant indirect associations emerged among inhibitory control\/attention skills, secondary control coping (e.g., acceptance and reappraisal), and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the subsample. Higher inhibitory control\/attention skills were associated with greater use of secondary control coping, and greater use of these coping skills was related to lower symptoms of anxiety and depression. No direct or indirect associations were found among working memory skills, coping, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Implications for interventions to enhance executive function and coping skills in adults with HD are highlighted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

The DeNoPa study is a single-center, observational, longitudinal study with biennial follow-ups over 8 years. The present analyses are based on 123 PD (79 male) and 107 HC (64 male) with a mean age of 64.1 years (SD = 8.3). PD and HC completed a battery of neuropsychological tests and scales assessing depressive symptoms. We used a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) to study their trajectories and the dynamic interplay. Cognitive abilities of PD were on average d = -0.67 worse at baseline and d = -1.22 at 8-years follow-up in comparison to HC. Depressive symptoms in PD showed large variability and followed a U-shaped trajectory. From an intraindividual perspective, greater impairments in cognitive abilities were subsequently associated with increased depressive symptoms (b = -0.60, p = .03), whereas the effect in the opposite direction was not significant. We found indication that a decline on a global composite scale of cognition can be seen as a precursor of depressive symptoms in patients with PD. To counter cognitive losses and the subsequent mood deterioration, patient education and early cognitive (and behavioral) enrichment seem promising candidates for treatment.

However, much less is known about ageing effects on spatial language (the ability to verbally describe where objects are located in relation to other objects). The primary goal of this study was to examine age-related changes in naming static and dynamic spatial relations across the adult lifespan. Moreover, we examined whether spatial naming is more closely associated with (non-spatial) verbal or (non-linguistic) visuospatial abilities. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 85 years completed a newly developed Spatial Naming Test (SNT), as well as standard object and action naming tests and various visuospatial tasks. The psychometric properties of the novel SNT (inter-rater and test-retest reliability and convergent, divergent, and construct validity) were also examined. The psychometric evaluation confirmed the reliability and validity of the SNT. Striking effects of ageing on naming of both static and dynamic spatial relations were found, as well as on visuospatial abilities, while object and action naming remained age invariant. Moreover, both (non-spatial) verbal and (non-linguistic) visuospatial abilities predicted static spatial naming, but only visuospatial abilities accounted for significant variance in dynamic spatial naming beyond age. These findings provide the first evidence that naming spatial relations declines in ageing as a function of changes in non-linguistic visuospatial abilities, indicating strong connections between linguistic and non-linguistic representations of space. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

Method: Thirty-eight Ugandan HIV-exposed\/uninfected children (17 boys, 21 girls) were evaluated with the Early Childhood Vigilance Test (ECVT) of attention between 3 and 5 years of age, which is a 6-min 44 s animation with colorful animals that greet the child and move across the screen. Attention was proportion of total animation time viewing a computer screen, as well as the proportion of time tracking the moving animal using eye tracking. These children were then again tested at least 2 years later (between 5 and 9 years of age) with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition (KABC-II) and the visual computerized Tests of Variables of Attention (TOVA). Results: Irrespective of whether scored by webcam video scoring or using automated eye tracking to compute proportion of time viewing the animation, ECVT attention was significantly correlated with all TOVA outcomes for vigilance attention. This was still the case when the correlation was adjusted for type of caregiver training for the mother, child gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and quality of Home Observational Measurement Evaluation (HOME) environment-especially for the TOVA response time variability to signal (p = .03). None of the ECVT attention performance measures correlated significantly with any of the KABC-II cognitive ability outcomes. Conclusion: Attention assessment in early childhood is predictive of school-age computer-based measures of attention and can be used to gauge the effects of factors of early risk and resilience in brain\/behavior development in African children affected by HIV.

Cognitive dysfunctions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) might affect the visuospatial attentional abilities as well. In this study, we aimed to examine the association between atrophy and lesion location and the extent of lateralization of visuospatial attentional bias in patients with MS. Visuospatial attentional bias was measured in 35 relapsing-remitting MS patients using the Landmark task. To evaluate the relation between spatial attentional bias and gray matter atrophy, voxel-based morphometry was performed on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. In order to examine the effect of lesion location on visuospatial attentional bias, lesion-symptom mapping was conducted on the manually segmented lesions. The variability of visuospatial attentional bias was higher in MS patients compared to healthy controls (p &lt; .04). Lesion probability mapping showed that lesions located along the left superior longitudinal fascicle are associated with the extent of visuospatial bias (p &lt; .05). No correlation was found between gray matter atrophy and the attentional bias of the patients. Our results indicate that lesions affecting the integrity of white matter pathways in the fronto-parietal attentional network might be accountable for the higher variability of spatial attentional bias in patients with MS.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with deficits generating the phenomenological characteristics of future events (the imaginative component of episodic foresight), but no study to date has tested whether MS is also associated with deficits using episodic foresight to appropriately guide future-directed behavior. Forty people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 40 demographically matched healthy participants completed a validated measure that met strict criteria for assessing the functional application of episodic foresight, Virtual-Week Foresight (VW-Foresight). Overall, people with RRMS did not differ significantly relative to comparison participants in how likely they were to spontaneously acquire items that would later allow a problem to be solved and were also just as likely to subsequently use these items to solve the problem. However, the latter group difference was large in magnitude and just failed to attain significance. Higher levels of depression were significantly related to performance on this same \"use\" component of foresight in the RRMS group, and depressed RRMS participants were significantly impaired in this aspect of foresight relative to both healthy participants and nondepressed RRMS participants. The depressed MS subgroup also differed from the nondepressed subgroup in their ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living. People with RRMS who present with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology also appear to be at greater risk of experiencing specific problems with episodic foresight.

Past research has predominately relied on self-report measures of trait empathy in examining the impact of ageing on empathy, potentially contributing to the very mixed findings in this area. We aimed to examine the effects of age on state empathic ability. Two-hundred and thirty-one adults aged 17-94 years were administered behavioral measures of cognitive and affective empathy alongside traditional trait measures. We also examined the potential impact of advancing age on inhibition of self-relevant information and the relationship between this and the cognitive, affective and motivational components of empathic ability. Age was not a predictor of either trait cognitive or affective empathy measured using self-report. Further, older adults did not perform worse than younger adults on a state behavioral measure of affective empathy. Older adults did perform less accurately on some behavioral cognitive empathy tasks and also on self-relevant inhibition. Self-relevant inhibition errors and response times were negatively associated with performance on cognitive empathy tasks, though not associated with self-report or behaviorally measured affective empathy scores. Further, mediation analyses suggested the indirect effect from age-inhibition-cognitive empathy was small but significant, implicating inhibition in cognitive empathy ability in older adulthood. The relationship between advancing age and empathic skills is complex, with age possibly conferring both advantages and disadvantages. Inhibition should be examined alongside other general cognitive skills in future studies investigating empathy using behavioural measures.

Therefore, its reliable and ecologically valid examination is a crucial part of any comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. In this regard, an established English-language test identifying deficits in ER is \"The Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Evaluation Test\" (TASIT-EET). However, no comparable German-language ER test currently exists. In this study, we aimed to develop and preliminarily validate the first German-language adaption of TASIT-EET in healthy adults. We selected 22 scenes [three scenes per emotion (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral) and one practice scene] out of the 56 TASIT-EET scenes. In collaboration with a film institute and professional actors, we filmed each scene (except neutral) at three different emotional intensities. Then, we administered these intensity version scenes to 240 cognitively and mentally healthy participants, equally distributed in sex and age, ranging from 35 to 92 years. By applying Rasch analysis, the one intensity version per scene was selected that showed neither floor nor ceiling effects in participants whose ability in ER was in the medium range. We have conducted a preliminary validation of the first German-language adaption of TASIT-EET, i.e., the \"Basel Version of the Awareness of Social Inference Test-Emotion Recognition\" (BASIT-ER).

Research in moderate to severe TBI identifies differentiated cognitive profiles. There is little research investigating potential clusters following sport concussion. Cluster analysis was used to determine patterns of Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) performance at three time points (72 hr, 4-7 days, and 8-30 days postconcussion). Participants included 1,817 high-school athletes (Mage = 15.5; 37.9% female) who completed ImPACT following concussion. Separate cluster analyses of cognitive scores were conducted at each postconcussion timepoint. Results indicated three clusters of cognitive performance within 1 week postinjury, while a two-cluster solution was identified at longer intervals (8-30 days). Clusters differed primarily by level of performance and also exhibited stratified differences in symptom severity and magnitude of change in cognitive function and symptom-reporting from pre- to postconcussion. The lowest performing cluster in each PC group was Mildly-to-Moderately Impaired and exhibited the highest rates of complicated recovery, suggesting an association between the current clusters and protracted recovery. Results provide preliminary evidence that ImPACT can identify clusters of athletes based on cognitive performance postconcussion that differ in clinically meaningful ways, including symptoms, magnitude of change from baseline, and concussion recovery outcomes. Discriminant functions can classify athletes into clusters based on postconcussion scores and a supplemental excel calculator is provided for such purposes. Absence of full demographic data regarding race\/ethnicity and socioeconomic status may limit generalizability. Future work should investigate whether these clusters may assist in return-to-play decision-making by identifying at-risk athletes who may benefit from targeted intervention.

Although longitudinal assessment is ideal for tracking executive function development and onset of alcohol use, prior testing experience must be distinguished from developmental trajectories. We used the Stroop Match-to-Sample task to examine the improvement of processing speed and specific cognitive and motor control over 4 years in 445 adolescents. The twice-minus-once-tested method was used and expanded to four test sessions to delineate prior experience (i.e., learning) from development. A General Additive Model evaluated the predictive value of age and sex on executive function development and potential influences of alcohol use on development. Results revealed strong learning between the first two assessments. Adolescents significantly improved their speed processing over 4 years. Compared with boys, girls enhanced ability to control cognitive interference and motor reactions. Finally, the influence of alcohol use initiation was tested over 4 years for development in 110 no\/low, 110 moderate\/heavy age- and sex-matched drinkers; alcohol effects were not detected in the matched groups.

Existing research, however, has not investigated factors that may explain individual differences in cognitive dispersion. We investigate the extent to which the Big Five personality traits are associated with cognitive dispersion in older adulthood. To promote transparency and reliability, we applied preregistration and conceptual replication via coordinated analysis. Drawing data from seven longitudinal studies of aging (Ntotal = 33,581; Mage range = 56.4-71.2), cognitive dispersion scores were derived from cognitive test results. Independent linear regression models were fit in each study to examine personality traits as predictors of dispersion scores, adjusting for mean cognitive performance and sociodemographics (age, sex, education). Results from individual studies were synthesized using random effects meta-analyses. Synthesized results revealed that openness was positively associated with cognitive dispersion, 0.028, 95% CI [0.003, 0.054]. There was minimal evidence for associations between cognitive dispersion and the other personality traits in independent analyses or meta-analyses. Mean cognitive scores were negatively associated with cognitive dispersion across the majority of studies, while sociodemographic variables were not consistently associated with cognitive dispersion. Higher levels of openness were associated with greater cognitive dispersion across seven independent samples, indicating that individuals higher in openness had more dispersion across cognitive tests. Further research is needed to investigate mechanisms that may help to explain the link between openness and cognitive dispersion, as well as to identify additional individual factors, beyond personality traits, that may be associated with cognitive dispersion.

We performed data-driven analyses that integrated trajectory classification with prediction modeling to test declining trajectory class prediction by SMD facets, pulse pressure (PP; i.e., a robust proxy for vascular health), and sex. The longitudinal design featured memory trajectories across a 40-year band (55-95 years) of nondemented aging (N = 580; Mage = 70.2 years; 65% female) from the Victoria Longitudinal Study. First, latent class growth analyses identified distinct classes of memory trajectories. Second, we used the three-step method (R3STEP) to predict membership in the declining memory classes using six measures: memory complaints, memory concerns, memory compensation, memory self-efficacy, PP, and sex. First, we identified four classes of memory aging trajectories: (a) stable memory aging (STABLE), (b) typical memory aging (TYPICAL), (c) slowly declining memory aging (SLOW), and (d) rapidly declining memory aging (RAPID). Second, more memory concerns predicted membership in the SLOW and RAPID classes. Higher PP predicted membership in the SLOW class. Male sex predicted membership in the declining (TYPICAL, SLOW, RAPID) classes. Among SMD facets, memory concerns represent the most severe degree of apprehension about subjectively experienced memory losses. The present integrative data-driven analysis indicated that such concerns predicted membership in declining memory trajectory classes in addition to worse vascular health (higher PP) and sex (male). In nondemented aging, concerns about increasing memory failures may be veridical indicators of memory loss, especially when coupled with vascular comorbidity and being male.

In the present study, we aimed to demonstrate: first, that people with even more severe episodic memory impairment than MCI are unimpaired on a fully implicit prototype learning task and second, that the dot pattern task, at variance with the FPLT, requires a no negligible contribution from the episodic memory system. Twenty-four persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 48 healthy controls took part in this experiment. As in the original study, in addition to the FPLT, they were also administered the classical dot pattern task and an ordinary forced-choice face recognition task. AD performed like normal controls in the FPLT but scored significantly worse on the dot pattern task and the face recognition task. Interestingly, although performance on the face recognition task did not correlate with that on the FPLT, a significant correlation was observed between the face recognition and the dot pattern task. Results support both of our claims: first, that also severe amnesic people can learn new visual prototypes with a fully implicit paradigm and, second, that the classical dot pattern task requires some degree of episodic resources. Further research is needed to rule out the role of working memory in solving the FPLT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

This study tested the hypothesis that metamemory deficit is associated with poor financial decision making among older adults without dementia. Data came from 502 community-dwelling older adults participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Metamemory deficit was determined empirically by contrasting subjective memory ratings with performance on objective memory tests. Larger discrepancy of self-rated memory scores from performance-based testing scores indicates greater deficit. Financial decision making was assessed using a performance-based measure. Multivariable regression analyses examined the association of metamemory deficit with financial decision making. Participants had a mean age of 83 years and a mean education of 15 years. Approximately 75% were female. On average, participants answered two thirds of the financial decision making questions correctly. Female sex, older age, lower education, and lower financial literacy were correlated with poorer financial decision making. In an ordinal logistic regression model controlled for demographics and financial literacy, an 1SD increase in metamemory deficit reduced the odds of having better financial decision making by approximately 15%, OR: 0.844, 95% CI [0.719-0.991]. This association persisted after further controlling for family income, early life socioeconomic status, depressive symptoms and executive function. Metamemory deficit in older adults is a potential indicator of impaired financial decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved). ","41":"Verbal memory is a predictor of later functional deficits. However, it is unclear if a specific aspect of immediate free-recall is driving this relationship. Serial position effects (i.e., relationship between a word's placement on a word-list and its likelihood of being recalled) have been shown to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to determine if serial position effects predict functioning 10-year postbaseline when controlling for demographic variables and total cognitive scores. Data from 2,802 participants in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly trial were examined to predict subjective (i.e., Minimum Data Set Home Care questionnaire subscales) and performance-based (i.e., Observed Tasks of Daily Living and Everyday Problems Test) functioning 10-year postbaseline. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the association between functioning 10-year postbaseline and scores at baseline. Primacy performance demonstrated the most consistent associations with overall subjective and performance-based functioning measures 10-year postbaseline. Specifically, higher primacy performance was associated with less decline in subjective and performance-based functioning over time, particularly when primacy was analyzed from the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Fewer associations were found between middle and recency scores with subjective and performance-based functioning measures. The present study suggests that serial position effects predict future subjective and performance-based functional changes, beyond demographic information and global cognition. The study adds to a growing literature about the relative importance of primacy, especially in the prediction of functional changes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved). ","42":"The reduction of goal-directed behavior, termed apathy, is a pervasive and debilitating syndrome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, understanding of apathy as a multifaceted construct is limited, especially in Southeast Asian nations. This study aimed to investigate the severity, insight, and psychosocial influences of apathy in executive, emotional, and initiation dimensions in Vietnam-a country with high prevalence of TBI. One hundred and eleven Vietnamese participants (61 individuals with moderate to severe TBI and 50 healthy controls) and their informants completed the self-rated and informant-rated Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) for the assessment of executive, emotional, and initiation apathy severity. Insight of apathy was calculated by subtracting DAS self-ratings from informant ratings. Additionally, carers completed measures assessing psychosocial factors of overall family health and overprotective behavior, while participants rated their own self-efficacy. Our results showed greater informant-rated apathy for all three dimensions in individuals with TBI relative to controls. However, while people with TBI had greater self-rated initiation apathy, they regarded their executive apathy as lower and their emotional apathy as similar compared with controls. Reduced insight in patients was seen for executive and initiation apathy. Across participants, executive apathy was predicted by family functioning and overprotectiveness, emotional apathy was predicted by family functioning, and initiation apathy was predicted by self-efficacy. These findings support the multidimensional characterizations and socio-cultural considerations of apathy after TBI, which will potentially develop both individual-specific and symptom-specific approaches in clinical practice.

","43":"This study investigates how spatial working memory skills, and the processing and retrieval of distal auditory spatial information are influenced by visual experience. We developed an experimental paradigm using an acoustic simulation. The performance of congenitally blind and sighted participants (n = 9 per group) was compared when recalling sequences of spatialised auditory items in the same or reverse order of presentation. Two experimental conditions based on stimuli features were tested: non-semantic and semantic. Blind participants had a shorter memory span in the backward than the forward order of presentation. In contrast, sighted participants did not, revealing that blindness affects spatial information processing with greater executive source involvement. Furthermore, we found that blind subjects performed worse overall than the sighted group and that the semantic information significantly improved the performance, regardless of the experimental group and the sequences' order of presentation. Lack of early visual experience affects the ability to encode the surrounding space. Congenital blindness influences the processing and retrieval of spatial auditory items, suggesting that visual experience plays a pivotal role in calibrating spatial memory abilities using the remaining sensory modalities.

Using a dichotic listening task, which assesses auditory divided attention, benefits of a rightward prism adaptation were demonstrated in neglect patients (i.e., a syndrome following right hemisphere brain damage) by reducing their left auditory extinction. It is currently unknown whether prism adaptation affects auditory divided attention in healthy subjects. In the present study, we investigated the aftereffects of prism adaptation on dichotic listening. A sample of 47 young adults performed a dichotic listening task, in which pairs of words were presented with two words sounded simultaneously, one in each ear. Three parameters were measured: The percentage of recalled words, the percentage of correctly recalled words, and the laterality index (LI). Prism adaptation to a leftward optical deviation (L-PA) significantly increased the overall percentage of recalled words (p = .044) and that from the right ear (p = .002), and the overall LI (p = .049). For the first time, these findings demonstrate that L-PA produced an orientation of the auditory divided attention in favor of the right ear in healthy participants. This asymmetrical aftereffect provides a new argument in favor of the cross-modal dimension of prism adaptation, although an acclimatization effect of the dichotic listening task is also discussed. Our study opens up a new avenue for using prism adaptation in the field of auditory rehabilitation requiring a modulation of auditory attention.

","45":"Previous behavioral studies show that music listening enhances attention and working memory in both healthy and clinical populations. However, how music listening engages brain functional networks remains elusive due to inconsistent results from previous findings. A meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data using seed-based d mapping (SDM) with permutation of subject images was performed. Studies that presented music listening paradigms to healthy individuals were included. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the effects of music genres on brain activation. To examine functional network correlates, voxels that were significantly activated by music listening were overlaid onto cortical, subcortical, and striatal network parcellations. Whole-group analysis showed that ventral attention, somatomotor, default, dorsal attention, frontoparietal, and limbic networks significantly coactivated during music listening (familywise error-corrected p &lt; .01). Specifically, music listening activated multiple frontal, temporal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions. Subgroup analyses revealed that classical music, but not songs or simple tunes, activated the limbic network. Meta-regression analysis revealed nonsignificant correlations between years of music training and all brain regions activated during music listening. Music listening bilaterally activated multiple cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions encompassing multiple brain networks that were not modulated by music training experience. It is recommended that music listening can be applied to people with neurological disorders to modulate the disordered functional brain networks known to underlie the pathophysiology of these diseases, while future studies may help delineate the effects of music preferences on brain activation patterns among these patients to promote the development of evidence-based medicine.

However, manual scoring of this test is time-consuming, requires training, and can then still be inconsistent between different examiners. We aimed to develop and evaluate a novel, automated method for scoring a tablet-based Figure Copy Task. A cohort of 261 healthy adults and 203 stroke survivors completed the digital Oxford Cognitive Screen-Plus (OCS-Plus) Figure Copy Task. Responses were independently scored by two trained human raters and by a novel automated scoring program. Overall, the Automated Scoring Program was able to reliably extract and identify the separate figure elements (average sensitivity and specificity of 92.10% and 90.20%, respectively) and assigned total scores which agreed well with manual scores (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .83). Receiver Operating Curve analysis demonstrated that, compared to overall impairment categorizations based on manual scores, the Automated Scoring Program had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 93.40%, respectively (Area Under the Curve; AUC = 86.70%). Automated total scores also reliably distinguished between different clinical impairment groups with subacute stroke survivors scoring significantly worse than longer-term survivors, which in turn scored worse than neurologically healthy adults. These results demonstrate that the novel Automated Scoring Program was able to reliably extract and accurately score Figure Copy Task data, even in cases where drawings were highly distorted due to comorbid fine-motor deficits. This represents a significant advancement as this novel technology can be employed to produce immediate, unbiased, and reproducible scores for Figure Copy Task responses in clinical and research environments. Key Points-Question: We aimed to develop and evaluate a novel, automated method for scoring a tablet-based Figure Copy Task.

Person-centered analytics can contribute unique information about classes of persons by simultaneously considering EF performance and structure. The risk predictors of these classes can then be determined by machine learning technology. Using data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study we examined two goals: (a) detect different underlying subgroups (or classes) of EF performance and structure and (b) test multiple risk predictors for best discrimination of these detected subgroups. Method: We used a classification sample (n = 778; Mage = 71.42) for the first goal and a prediction subsample (n = 570; Mage = 70.10) for the second goal. Eight neuropsychological measures represented three EF dimensions (inhibition, updating, shifting). Fifteen predictors represented five domains (genetic, functional, lifestyle, mobility, demographic). Results: First, we observed two distinct classes: (a) lower EF performance and unidimensional structure (Class 1) and (b) higher EF performance and multidimensional structure (Class 2). Second, Class 2 was predicted by younger age, more novel cognitive activity, more education, lower body mass index, lower pulse pressure, female sex, faster balance, and more physical activity. Conclusions: Data-driven modeling approaches tested the possibility of an EF aging class that displayed both preserved EF performance levels and sustained multidimensional structure. The two observed classes differed in both performance level (lower, higher) and structure (unidimensional, multidimensional). Machine learning prediction analyses showed that the higher performing and multidimensional class was associated with multiple brain health-related protective factors.

This has mainly been linked to prevalent phonological deficits. However, deficits in lexical retrieval of picture names could also be due to increased lexical-semantic competition. The present study tested whether adults with dyslexia (AwDs) are more affected by a competitive lexical-semantic context than control participants. Twenty-seven AwD and 34 control participants completed the blocked-cyclic picture-naming paradigm and the Hayling sentence completion task. In the blocked-cyclic naming task, AwDs showed a larger semantic interference effect than controls in terms of errors, especially producing competitor errors. In the Hayling sentence completion task, AwDs made more errors than controls when asked to complete sentences with semantically unrelated words, that is, in the competitive condition. They especially produced semantically related words or antonyms to target words. We found that AwDs experience difficulties with resolving lexical competition that go beyond their phonological deficits. Future studies will need to establish the mechanisms behind the increased lexical competition that AwDs exhibit. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

Participants were assessed with three neuropsychological tests aimed at capturing central components of EF: working memory\/Letter-Number Sequencing Test (LNS), inhibition\/Color-Word Interference Test, Condition 3 (CWIT3), and flexibility\/Trail Making Test, Condition 4 (TMT4). Test results were analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM). At baseline, the TD participants outperformed the ASD and ADHD participants on all three tests. From T1 to T2, the ASD participants had less improvement than the ADHD and TD participants on the LNS test (p = .007 and .025, respectively), while having more improvement on the CWIT3 relative to the TD participants (p = .027). From T2 to T3, the ADHD participants had less improvement on the LNS test than the ASD and TD participants (p = .004 and .021, respectively). The ASD and ADHD groups mainly displayed similar maturation on the neuropsychological measures, and displayed continuous impairment relative to the TD group. The need for support and facilitation of EF in school, workplace, and social arenas might continue into young adulthood among certain individuals with ASD and ADHD.

","51":"Pediatric attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with impairments in executive functioning and academic writing skills. However, our understanding of the extent to which these children's writing difficulties are related to their underdeveloped executive functions-and whether this relation is attributable to specific executive functions-is limited. A clinically-evaluated and carefully-phenotyped sample of 91 children ages 8-13 (M = 10.60, SD = 1.25; 37 girls) were administered multiple, counterbalanced tests of the three core executive functions (working memory, inhibitory control, set shifting), assessed for ADHD symptoms via multiple-informant reports, and completed standardized, norm-referenced testing of three core writing skills (written expression, spelling, writing fluency). Bias-corrected, bootstrapped conditional effects modeling indicated that underdeveloped working memory exerted significant direct effects on all three writing skills, as well as indirect effects on written expression and spelling via the ADHD symptoms pathway (all 95% CIs exclude 0.0). In contrast, inhibitory control uniquely predicted spelling difficulties only, set shifting was not associated directly or indirectly with any assessed writing skill, and ADHD symptoms failed to uniquely predict writing skills after controlling for working memory. This pattern of results replicated across informants (parent vs. teacher ADHD symptom ratings), and was robust to control for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), majority\/minority race\/ethnicity status, intellectual functioning (IQ), decoding skills, language skills, and learning disability status. These findings suggest multiple pathways to writing skill difficulties in children with ADHD, while suggesting that their overt behavioral symptoms may be less involved in their writing difficulties than their underlying neurocognitive vulnerabilities.

It helps to explain the different cognitive adaptation to daily functioning in aging individuals and in individuals with brain pathology: a higher CR is associated with a delay in the manifestation of cognitive symptoms. CR is estimated using different proxies, such as education, cognitively stimulating life experiences, premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), and vocabulary size. Despite the complexity of CR, little research to date has systematically focused on the heterogeneity of its effects. We investigated this issue in individuals with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) by focusing on two variables: (a) the type of CR proxy (i.e., Education and Life experience) and (b) the type of test used to assess cognitive performance (i.e., the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] screening test and the extensive Brief Neuropsychological Examination-2 [ENB-2] test battery). Our results suggest that effects on CR varied: in individuals with probable AD, we found a positive relationship of Education with performance on both the MMSE and the ENB-2 tests; in contrast, individuals with SCD showed a positive relationship of a Life experience proxy selectively with the ENB-2 global score. Different proxies may reflect different compensatory mechanisms of CR depending on task demand and on an individual's global cognitive condition. In particular, while the Education proxy can capture CR-related cognitive compensation in a pathological condition such as probable AD, the more complex Life experience proxy might be useful for capturing CR-related effects when signs of deterioration are subtle, like in SCD.

The concept of cogniphobia describes the fear and avoidance of cognitively effortful tasks to avoid the onset or worsening of symptoms. Extant studies provide preliminary evidence for associations between cogniphobia and validity testing. However, less is known about the subcomponents of cogniphobia. This study investigated the relationship of cogniphobia subcomponents to validity testing and psychological presentations. Participants included 171 adults from an archival database who had completed measures of cogniphobia and psychological symptom reports as part of a larger neuropsychological study. The sample was classified as scoring above or below published cutoffs on performance validity tests (PVTs) and symptom validity tests (SVTs), consistent with current research\/recommendations. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a two-factor model of cogniphobia, with Avoidance and Dangerousness as subcomponents. Logistic regression analyses identified Avoidance as the strongest predictor of scores falling in the invalid range on PVTs and SVTs, as well as the presence of external incentives. After excluding participants who fell in the invalid range on SVTs, only Avoidance significantly predicted report of somatic complaints. Cogniphobia, especially the avoidance of cognitive exertion component, is associated with performance in the invalid range on both PVTs and SVTs and is also related to report of somatic concerns when controlling for beliefs that cognitive exertion is dangerous.

Yet, few studies have examined the link between self-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and WM performance in active-duty military cohorts. The present study utilized hierarchical linear modeling to examine this relationship by considering PTSS and underlying symptom clusters as well as WM demands related to load and affective interference in an active-duty military cohort (N = 515). PTSS severity was assessed via the posttraumatic stress disorder checklist-military version (PCL-M), and behavioral performance was measured on a delayed-recognition WM task that manipulated mnemonic load (low vs. high load) and affective interference (negative combat-related vs. neutral civilian images presented during the delay interval). Examination of the relationship between PCL-M and WM performance demonstrated that higher total PCL-M scores (especially higher numbing and hyperarousal symptoms) were associated with poorer WM task performance, b = -0.083, p = .003, 95% CI [-0.137, -0.029], even after controlling for combat experiences and previous deployment status. This relationship was stronger on trials with negative, b = -0.114, p &lt; .001, 95% CI [-0.175, -0.054], compared to neutral distracters, b = -0.052, p = .093, 95% CI [-0.112, 0.009]. These results suggest that PTSS are associated with performance costs on a WM task with combat-related negative distracters. Broadly, these findings highlight the need to address PTSS in active-duty cohorts and further investigate vulnerabilities related to cognitive demands and psychological health.

This cross-sectional study compared performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients in relation to cultural, demographic, and immigration-related factors (acculturation, bilingualism). The study comprised Turkish immigrant (n = 21) and monolingual, nonimmigrant German (n = 20) and Turkish (n = 24) patients with AD. All participants were administered cognitive screening tools, measures of depression, and dementia severity. The mean MMSE total score was significantly higher in German patients with AD compared to both patient groups, but did not differ between native-born Turkish and Turkish immigrant groups. After adjustment for years of education, differences in MMSE performance were no longer significant between groups. Furthermore, bilingualism was associated with better performance on the MMSE in Turkish-immigrant patients. The mean RUDAS total scores were similar between groups with and without adjustment for educational level. Performance on the RUDAS was not associated with demographic and immigration-related variables. The findings highlight the need to consider the educational background, linguistic integration of older non-Western immigrants for the objective characterization of cognitive profiles. The results provide support for the use of the RUDAS, particularly, among older Turkish immigrants with lower educational levels and varying degrees of acculturation, bilingualism.

Similarities between music and speech\/language in terms of their auditory features, rhythmic structure, and hierarchical structure have led to a large body of literature suggesting connections between the two domains. However, the precise underlying mechanisms behind this connection remain to be elucidated. In this theoretical review article, we synthesize previous research and present a framework of potentially shared neural mechanisms for music and speech rhythm processing. We outline structural similarities of rhythmic signals in music and speech, synthesize prominent music and speech rhythm theories, discuss impaired timing in developmental speech and language disorders, and discuss music rhythm training as an additional, potentially effective therapeutic tool to enhance speech\/language processing in these disorders. We propose the processing rhythm in speech and music (PRISM) framework, which outlines three underlying mechanisms that appear to be shared across music and speech\/language processing: Precise auditory processing, synchronization\/entrainment of neural oscillations to external stimuli, and sensorimotor coupling. The goal of this framework is to inform directions for future research that integrate cognitive and biological evidence for relationships between rhythm processing in music and speech. The current framework can be used as a basis to investigate potential links between observed timing deficits in developmental disorders, impairments in the proposed mechanisms, and pathology-specific deficits which can be targeted in treatment and training supporting speech therapy outcomes. On these grounds, we propose future research directions and discuss implications of our framework. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

Each operationalization can also be measured with or without covariates. This meta-analytic study explores the association between IIV and subsequent cognitive outcomes regardless of operational definition and measurement approach. Longitudinal studies (N = 13) that have examined IIV in association with later cognitive decline and\/or conversation to MCI\/dementia were analyzed. The effect of IIV operationalization was explored. Additional subgroup analysis of measurement approaches could not be examined due to the limited number of appropriate studies available for inclusion.

Patients with mTBI (n = 197) and trauma controls with orthopedic injuries (n = 82) were included in this prospective longitudinal study. The participants (age 16-60) completed three computerized neurocognitive tests assessing response speed and accuracy at 2 weeks and 3 months after injury, as well as questionnaires and interviews assessing sleep quality and psychological distress at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after injury. Separate Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) for each of the outcome measures (response speed, response accuracy, psychological distress) were performed. We observed a significant interaction effect between poor sleep quality and group (mTBI vs. trauma controls) in the response speed (p = .028) and psychological distress (p = .001) models, driven by a greater negative impact of poor sleep quality on response speed and psychological distress in the mTBI group. We found no such interaction effect for response accuracy (p = .825), and poor sleep quality was associated with worse accuracy to a similar extent for both groups. Our findings show that poor sleep quality has a more negative impact on cognitive control function and psychological outcome in patients with mTBI, compared to trauma controls.

The goal of the present study was to advance our understanding on this front. We isolated and examined motor kinematics associated with the learning of a rapid aimed limb movement in a sample of 40 individuals (13-34 years of age) with ETPKU and a matched comparison group of 40 individuals without phenylketonuria (PKU). Indices of motor learning included overall movement duration as well as the relative proportion of movement time devoted to ballistic and corrective submovements. (Note that practice of motor movements in nonclinical populations is associated with, not only improvements in overall speed, but also reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to corrective submovements relative to an initial ballistic submovement.) Results: A group-by-time interaction was found. With practice, the non-PKU group showed a significant reduction in the proportion of movement time devoted to the corrected (as compared to the ballistic) submovement. A similar change was not observed for the ETPKU group. In addition, within the ETPKU group, the rate of improvement in total movement duration was correlated with recent blood phenylalanine levels (an indicator of treatment adherence). Motor learning is adversely affected in individuals with ETPKU. Further investigation into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of motor learning in ETPKU will advance our understanding of the etiologic basis for this disruption as well as how it relates to the broader neurocognitive profile of ETPKU.

Forty-one PLWH, 41 individuals with PD, and 37 CTL, aged 45-79 years, underwent neuropsychological, psychological, and neurological assessment including depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical (ADL-p) and instrumental (ADL-i) daily activities, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor ADLs (ADL-UPDRS-II), QOL, and cognitive and motor functions. Hierarchical regression analyses assessed the relative contribution of predictors including demographics, disease-related factors, comorbid conditions, and mood-related factors for ADL and QOL scales. PLWH and PD participants reported more depressive symptoms and higher anxiety and worse QOL and ADL-i than CTL. The PD group had greater ADL-p and motor-related ADL-UPDRS-II difficulties than PLWH and CTL groups. In PLWH, medical comorbidities and alcohol use disorder (AUD)\/substance use disorder (SUD) histories significantly contributed to poor physical and motor ADLs. Mood scores, particularly depressive symptoms, were independent predictors of poor QOL and most ADLs in both clinical groups, above the contribution of cognitive compromise. Mood symptoms contribute significantly to poor ADLs and QOL in people aging with chronic diseases such as long-term HIV infection and PD. Comprehensive assessment and treatment of mood symptoms are recommended for ensuring optimal functional independence and life quality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).

This study examined age effects on a performance-based internet banking task and its association with neurocognitive, functional, and numerical abilities. Method: Thirty-five older adults (age 51-75) and 50 younger adults (age 18-32) completed an experimenter-controlled online banking measure in which they independently performed a series of naturalistic financial tasks (e.g., account transfers, bill paying). Participants also completed standardized tests of cognition, numeracy, and functional capacity. Results: Older adults were markedly slower and less accurate in completing the internet-based banking task, which was not confounded by other demographic, mood, or computer use factors. Higher scores on measures of neurocognition, numeracy, and financial functional capacity were both strongly associated with higher internet-based banking among older, but not younger adults. Conclusions: Findings suggest that older adults experience difficultly quickly and accurately navigating online banking platforms, which may be partly related to age-related declines in neurocognitive functions and basic financial capacity. Future studies might examine whether neurocognitive approaches to remediation and compensation can be used to improve online banking capacity in older adults.

All data were collected in naturalistic home and community settings. Results: Amongst participants with the expanded HD repeat, greater time spent in bed, measured by Fitbit, was associated with poorer accuracy and response speed on a test of visual memory, whereas lower levels of physical activity, measured by Fitbit, were associated with poorer accuracy on a test involving a working memory component. Neither time in bed nor physical activity is associated with a test of psychomotor speed. Groups were mostly similar across a range of Fitbit and self-report measures of sleep and physical activity, although the Manifest-HD group spent more time in bed than the Premanifest-HD and Healthy Control groups and had better self-reported sleep quality and more self-reported time spent sitting than the Healthy Control group and the Premanifest-HD group, respectively. Conclusions: Sleep timing and physical activity relate to cognitive functioning in HD and may be important targets for management in behavioral intervention studies aimed at improving cognition in HD.

This exploratory study aimed to determine if decision-making under risk conditions, as measured by the Game of Dice Task (GDT), can explain additional variance in on-road driving safety beyond other well-validated predictors. Method: Two hundred and thirty-nine cognitively normal Australian drivers aged 65-96 completed demographic and health questionnaires, vision testing, a neurocognitive test battery assessing cognitive flexibility, cognitive interference, episodic memory, verbal working memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial function, the GDT-a lab-based assessment of decision-making under risk conditions, validated off-road driver screening measures and an on-road driving assessment along a standard route in urban traffic conditions administered by a trained Occupational Therapist (OT). Results: The number of risky choices made, but not the number of strategy changes, across trials of the GDT independently predicted on-road safety ratings after controlling for visual acuity, cognitive test performance, and off-road driver screening measures, B = -.146, 95% CI [-.276 to -.016]. Conclusion: Overall, this study offers the first evidence that decision-making is related to older adults' on-road driving safety, and makes recommendations for future research exploring the contribution of decision-making to on-road safety.

Method: Participants included 63 PWH and 28 seronegative individuals ages 50-78 who completed standardized neurocognitive and everyday functioning assessments. Participants described four events from the recent past and four imagined events in the near future, details from which were classified as internal or external to the main event. Result: PWH produced fewer autobiographical details with small-to-medium effect sizes but did not differ from seronegative participants in meta-cognitive ratings of their performance. Performance of the study groups did not vary across past or future probes or internal versus external details; however, within the entire sample, past events were described in greater detail than future events, and more external than internal details were produced. Within the PWH group, the production of fewer internal details for future events was moderately associated with poorer prospective memory, executive dysfunction, and errors on a laboratory-based task of medication management. Conclusion: Older PWH may experience difficulty generating autobiographical details from the past and simulated events in the future, which may be related to executive dyscontrol of memory processes. Future studies might examine the role of future thinking in health behaviors such as medication adherence and retention in healthcare among PWH.

As the precise locus of this problem is yet unknown, the present study investigated this through behavioral and pupillometry indices. Adults scoring high versus low on ADHD symptomatology carried out a target detection task at three event rate (ER) levels. Phasic pupil dilation was used as an index of cognitive effort, and tonic pupil size as an index of tonic arousal. Performance and self-reports indicated state regulation difficulties in the high-ADHD group. Phasic pupil dilation was increased during slow ER, indicating additional effort allocation. Surprisingly, tonic pupil size was smallest in the fast ER, and group effects were absent for both pupil measures. The high-ADHD group showed state regulation difficulties despite similar levels of additional effort allocation as reflected by phasic pupil responses.

","70":"Large-scale studies have revolutionized biomedical research, and neurocognitive tests can help elucidate the biological basis of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, studies have predominantly been conducted in Western settings. We describe the development and validation of a computerized battery (PennCNB) with the Xhosa population of South Africa. Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 525) and a normative comparison group (n = 744) were balanced on age, sex, education, and region. Participants provided blood samples, were assessed psychiatrically, and were administered a PennCNB translation to isiXhosa, including measures of executive functions, episodic memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and sensorimotor speed. Feasibility was examined with test completion rates and input from administrators, and psychometric structural validity and associations with clinical and demographic characteristics were examined. Tests were well tolerated by participants, as &gt;87% had one (or fewer) test missing. Results suggested a similar factor structure to prior PennCNB studies in Western contexts, and expected age and sex effects were apparent. Furthermore, a similar profile of schizophrenia was observed, with neurocognitive deficits most pronounced for executive functions, especially attention, as well as memory, social cognition, and motor speed relative to complex cognition and sensorimotor speed. Results support the feasibility of implementing a culturally adapted computerized neurocognitive battery in sub-Saharan African settings and provide evidence supporting the concurrent validity of the translated instrument. Thus, the PennCNB is implementable on a large scale in non-Western contexts, shows expected factor structure, and can detect cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Obtaining valid measures of cognition by nonspecialized proctors is especially suitable in resource-limited settings, where traditional testing is prohibitive. Future work should establish normative standards, test-retest reliability, and sensitivity to treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved). ","71":"The aims of the present study were to compare fatigue levels in children with pediatric acquired brain injury (pABI) with healthy controls (HCs), and examine the interplay of fatigue with associated factors. We used baseline data from a preregistered randomized controlled trial. Seventy-six children aged 10-17 (median 13 years) with pABI in the chronic phase (88% with confirmatory cerebral imaging findings) and executive function (EF) complaints were included, most with moderate disability according to The Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE-E) categorization. HCs consisted of 60 children aged 10-17 (median 13 years). All 127 participants completed measures of fatigue and intelligence. pABI participants were also assessed for behavioral problems, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and EF. Nonparametric statistics were employed, in addition to a network analysis to model the unique associations between parent-reported fatigue and related factors. Parents reported significantly more fatigue in the pABI-group (75% of scores in clinical range; &lt; 70) compared to HCs (11.7% of scores in clinical range). No strong associations were found between fatigue and injury characteristics, but findings indicated more fatigue in the older than younger age-group for pABI participants. Network modeling revealed a central role for HRQoL, behavioral, and EF symptoms in relation to fatigue. Fatigue is reported to be highly prevalent in the chronic phase of pABI. When addressing fatigue, our findings demonstrate the advantage of including multidimensional measures of fatigue and examining associated psychological and cognitive constructs, such as HRQoL, behavioral problems, and EF.

","72":"Long-term visual memory representations, measured by recognition performance, degrade as a function of semantic interference, and their strength is related to eye-movement responses. Even though clinical research has examined interference mechanisms in pathological cognitive aging and explored the diagnostic potential of eye-movements in this context, little is known about their interaction in long-term visual memory. An eye-tracking study compared a Mild Cognitive Impaired group with healthy adults. Participants watched a stream of 129 naturalistic images from different semantic categories, presented at different frequencies (1, 6, 12, 24) to induce semantic interference (SI), then asked in a 2-Alternative Forced Choice paradigm to verbally recognize the scene they remembered (old\/novel). Recognition accuracy of both groups was negatively impacted by SI, especially in healthy adults. A wider distribution of overt attention across the scene predicted better recognition, especially by the Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI) participants, although these fixation patterns were influenced by SI. MCI compensated the detrimental effect of SI by focusing overt attention during encoding and so accruing distinctive details of the scene. During recognition, MCI participants widened overt attention to boost retrieval. Independently of the group: (a) the re-instatement of fixations indicated a more successful recall and increased as a function of SI; and (b) attending visually salient regions negatively impacted on recognition accuracy, although the reliance on such regions grew as SI increased. Effects of SI on long-term memory were reduced in MCI participants. They used different oculomotor strategies compared to healthy adults to compensate for its detrimental effects.

","73":"Rett syndrome (RTT), an x-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by spontaneous mutations in the MECP2 gene, is characterized by profound impairments in expressive language and purposeful hand use. We have pioneered the use of gaze-based tasks to by-pass these limitations and developed measures suitable for clinical trials with RTT. Here we estimated internal consistency reliability for three aspects of attention that are key to cognitive growth and that we previously identified as impaired in RTT. Using a sample of 66 children with RTT (2-19 years), we assessed Sustained Attention (butterfly task: Butterfly traverses the screen only when fixated and distractors are ignored); Disengaging\/Shifting Attention (\"gap\/overlap\" task: Shifts of gaze from central to peripheral targets are compared in conditions where the central stimulus remains or disappears at the onset of the peripheral target); Selective Attention (search task: the target is embedded in arrays differing in size and distractor type). Reliability was acceptable to excellent on almost all key measures from tasks assessing Sustained Attention and Disengaging\/Shifting Attention, with split-half coefficients and Cronbach alphas ranging from .70 to .93. Reliability increased as more trials were aggregated, with acceptable levels often reached with as few as six to nine trials. Measures from Selective Attention showed only limited reliability. Finding that critical aspects of attention can be reliably assessed in RTT with gaze-based tasks constitutes a major advance in the development of cognitive measures appropriate for clinical and translational work.

The aim of this study was to use a data-driven method to describe different cognitive phenotypes in PD and to explore anxiety, depression, and motor disturbances across the different cognitive profiles. Latent profile analysis was applied to the neuropsychological performances of 65 patients with idiopathic PD assessed by means of a battery of tests that encompass measures of attention, memory, executive functions, social cognition, language, and visuospatial abilities. A three-cluster model produced the best solution: Cluster A (21.54%) included patients with intact cognition or with a relatively slight cognitive impairment in memory and executive functioning; Cluster B (53.85%) included patients with an intermediate level of cognitive impairment; and Cluster C (24.61%) included patients with the most severe cognitive impairment, with greater deficit compared to Cluster B in executive functioning, and, notably, in tasks with a predominantly posterior cortical basis (naming and visuospatial abilities). The three subgroups did not differ in terms of age, gender, disease duration, motor symptom severity or side of onset, levodopa equivalent daily dose, level of anxiety, or depression; however, patients from Cluster C showed greater impairment than patients from Cluster A in measures of everyday functioning. We presented a qualitative description of three distinct cognitive phenotypes emerging from a sample of 65 PD patients. The three clusters seem to be related to daily functioning but are independent from the stage of disease, motor functioning, anxiety, and depression.

","75":"In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), cognitive function was tracked across multiple years by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. In this study, we examined the latent structure of the ADNI battery and evaluated the invariance of that structure among diagnostic groups and over time. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to investigate the invariance of the ADNI battery's latent factor structure among three diagnostic groups (healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, patients with Alzheimer's disease) over a 2-year interval (baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months). The results revealed a five-factor structure for the ADNI battery (memory, visuospatial processing, attention, language, executive function). This structure displayed configural invariance but not weak, strong, or strict invariance across the three diagnostic groups. Longitudinally, configural, weak, strong, and strict invariance were all established within each diagnostic group, except that strict invariance was rejected in healthy controls. The ADNI battery assesses the same cognitive abilities in the three diagnostic groups, but test scores do not calibrate to these abilities equally in the respective groups, making certain statistics (e.g., factor scores) noncomparable between groups. Within each group, the latent structure and the numerical relations between individual tests and underlying factors remained invariant over 2 years, suggesting that this battery is a reliable tool for tracking longitudinal changes in specific cognitive abilities within individual diagnostic groups.

","76":"Neuropsychological instruments are often developed in English and translated to other languages to facilitate the clinical evaluation of diverse populations or to utilize in research environments. However, the psychometric equivalence of these assessments across language must be demonstrated before populations can validly be compared. To test this equivalence, we applied measurement invariance procedures to a subsample (N = 1,708) of the Hispanic Community Health Survey\/Study of Latinos (HCHS\/SOL) across English and Spanish versions of a neurocognitive battery. Using cardinality matching, 854 English-speaking and 854 Spanish-speaking subsamples were matched on age, education, sex, immigration status (U.S. born, including territories, or foreign-born), and Hispanic\/Latino heritage background. Neurocognitive measures included the Six-Item Screener (SIS), Brief-Spanish English Verbal Learning Test (B-SEVLT), Word Fluency (WF), and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS). Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to test item-level invariance of the SIS, B-SEVLT, and WF, as well as factor-level invariance of a higher-order neurocognitive functioning latent variable. One item of both the SIS and WF were more difficult in Spanish than English, as was the DSS test. After accounting for partial invariance, Spanish-speakers performed worse on each of the subtests and the second-order neurocognitive functioning latent variable. We found some evidence of bias at both item and factor levels, contributing to the poorer neurocognitive performance of Spanish test-takers. While these results explain the underperformance of Spanish-speakers to some extent, more work is needed to determine whether such bias is reflective of true cognitive differences or additional variables unaccounted for in this study.

However, little is known regarding the impact of sociocultural factors on PM in diverse populations, particularly Latinx PLH. The aim of this study was to examine ethnic group differences and sociocultural factors related to PM. The sample of 127 PLH (91 Latinx and 36 non-Latinx white) completed measures of quality of education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a validated PM measure, the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST). The Latinx group also completed a bicultural acculturation measure. Results revealed the Latinx and the non-Latinx white groups did not significantly differ in overall MIST performance (all p &gt; .05). In the entire sample, better quality of education was associated with better MIST performance (all p &lt; .05). Within the Latinx group, higher Latinx acculturation was associated with worse MIST performance (p = .02), whereas higher U.S. acculturation was associated with better MIST performance at a trend level (p = .07). Multivariate regressions revealed quality of education and Latinx acculturation significantly predicted MIST performance and PM errors (all p &lt; .05). SES was not related to the MIST (all p &gt; .10). In sum, clinicians must take sociocultural factors into consideration when working with Latinx PLH, as these factors influence cognitive functions (i.e., PM) vital to health-related behaviors. Integrating culturally-informed psychoeducation into care plans is an imperative first step. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved). ","78":"A deficit in interference control is commonly reported in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This has mainly been interpreted as a difficulty in inhibiting inappropriate responses. However, it could be due to at least two distinct and independent processes, which are often confounded: The activation or suppression of impulsive responses. The aim of the present study was to separate the contribution of these two processes. We compared performance of 26 children with ADHD to that of 26 nonADHD children using a novel approach based on electromyographic activity (EMG) analysis. EMG allows two distinct indices to be computed: Incorrect activation rate, which is an index of the intensity of impulse capture and correction rate, which provides a direct measure of the ability to suppress automatic responses. Children with ADHD were slower, committed more errors, and had a larger interference effect than nonADHD children. Moreover, we observed a greater incorrect activation rate and a lower correction rate in the ADHD group. Our data suggest that the difficulties in interference control found in children with ADHD are explained by both impaired inhibitory processes and a greater propensity to activate automatic responses.

Research has not clarified whether these associations differ with the presence of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, particularly within levels of antisocial behavior observed in the community. We examined whether antisocial behavior and CU traits were differentially associated with intelligence and executive function metrics in 474 adolescent twins (Mean age = 14.18; SD = 2.20) sampled from birth records to represent youth in the community living in neighborhoods with above average levels of poverty. Intelligence was assessed using standardized scores from the Shipley-2. Executive function was assessed using Go\/No-Go and Stop Signal tasks. Neither antisocial behavior, nor CU traits alone, were associated with cognitive functioning when accounting for demographic factors. However, antisocial behavior and CU traits interacted to predict reaction time variability. At low levels of CU traits, antisocial behavior was associated with higher reaction time variability (traditionally thought to reflect worse sustained attention). At high levels of CU traits, antisocial behavior was associated with lower reaction time variability (thought to reflect better sustained attention). Elevated antisocial behavior and CU traits may be characterized by a distinct neurocognitive profile compared to elevated antisocial behavior in isolation.

","84":"Objective: Hypertension, diabetes, depressive symptoms, and smoking are predictors of cognitive decline in late life. It is unknown if these risk factors are associated with cognition during midlife or if the associations between these risk factors and cognition vary by race. This longitudinal study examined (a) risk factors for decline in episodic memory, processing speed, and working memory in midlife women and (b) if the associations between risk factors and cognitive decline were moderated by race. Method: Participants (aged 42-52) were European American (n = 1,000), African American (n = 516), and Asian American (n = 437) women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Two-level hierarchical linear models tested risk factors, race, and their interactions as predictors of cognitive change over time. Results: African Americans had poorer baseline episodic memory, processing speed, and working memory and greater episodic memory decline compared to European Americans. Asian Americans had poorer episodic memory and working memory, but better processing speed than European Americans. Depressive symptoms were associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed at baseline; further, diabetes was associated with poorer processing speed at baseline. Greater depressive symptoms were associated with poorer episodic memory at baseline for African Americans but not European Americans. Conclusions: Our study results highlight racial disparities in cognition during midlife. Depressive symptoms may be particularly detrimental to the cognitive health of African Americans. Clinical and public health interventions for healthy cognitive aging should be tailored to the unique risks of racial groups.

This study examined the incremental utility of pupillometry on the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) in classifying individuals with verified traumatic brain injury (TBI), individuals simulating TBI, and healthy comparisons. Method: Participants were 177 adults across three groups: verified TBI (n = 53), feigned cognitive impairment due to TBI (SIM, n = 52), and heathy comparisons (HC, n = 72). Results: Logistic regression and ROC curve analyses identified several pupil indices that discriminated the groups. Pupillometry discriminated best for the comparison of greatest clinical interest, verified TBI versus simulators, adding information beyond traditional accuracy scores. Simulators showed evidence of greater cognitive load than both groups instructed to perform at their best ability (HC and TBI). Additionally, the typically robust phenomenon of dilating to familiar stimuli was relatively diminished among TBI simulators compared to TBI and HC. This finding may reflect competing, interfering effects of cognitive effort that are frequently observed in pupillary reactivity during deception. However, the familiarity effect appeared on nearly half the trials for SIM participants. Among those trials evidencing the familiarity response, selection of the unfamiliar stimulus (i.e., dilation-response inconsistency) was associated with a sizeable increase in likelihood of being a simulator. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings provide strong support for multimethod assessment: adding unique performance assessments such as biometrics to standard accuracy scores. Continued study of pupillometry will enhance the identification of simulators who are not detected by traditional performance validity test scoring metrics.

The aim was to improve the motor response speed and the response time when inhibition was required. Method: Forty-nine participants were randomly assigned to four conditions. The protocol consisted of eight sessions of exergame cognitive training (or no training) associated with the active or sham stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC). Results: The results indicated faster simple reaction times following the exergame training, and faster reaction times in Go trials (while the ratio of NoGo trials remained unaltered) following tRNS. No interactions were present between the two procedures. Conclusions: These findings reveal better performance in both tasks with independent effects of the two techniques. Using noninvasive brain stimulation and exergame training may be a viable strategy to increase motor response speed and improve executive control.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-33671-001.) Objective: Patients who suffer from memory loss after an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) may also suffer from anosognosia, or unawareness of their memory loss. How we define and measure anosognosia can have critical implications for its study and clinical assessment. Commonly used measures often lack standardization and reliability checks for responses. Moreover, these methods rely heavily on cognitive abilities (e.g., language abilities) that are often affected after brain injury. The aim of this study is to elucidate how to best conceptualize and detect anosognosia for memory loss by introducing a new method of assessment, the Visual-Analogue Test for Anosognosia for memory impairment (VATAmem). Method: A total of 51 patients (M = 61 years, M = 13 years of education) with memory difficulties after ABI were recruited from outpatient clinics. A total of 73 informants were also recruited (M = 51 years old, M = 13 years of education). Both patients and informants evaluated the severity of patients' everyday memory mistakes on the VATAmem, for prospective and retrospective memory deficits by using visual analogue scales, vignettes, and check questions to ensure reliability. Results and Conclusion: A total of 30% of the patients were deemed unaware of their memory deficits. Patients were less aware of their prospective (29%) than their retrospective memory difficulties (18%). The new method of assessment provided by the VATAmem reduced possible false positives and enhanced reliability. We conclude that careful consideration of methodology is a key step to interpreting anosognosia findings within a theoretical framework.

The online version of the article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-15658-001.) Objective: It was suggested that the bimanual coupling effect might be linked to motor intentionality and planning, which are the top-down components of motor execution. However, previous results in pathological and healthy individuals have also underlined the pivotal role of bottom-up sensorimotor information. In this single-case study, the Circles-Lines Coupling Task was administered to a left-parietal-brain-damaged individual. The cerebral lesion caused a central proprioceptive loss, relative to the impaired right hand, when out of the visual control. For the 1st time in literature, we sought to investigate whether the movement of the unaffected hand induced an efficient coupling effect on the movement of the affected one. The bimanual task was performed in the presence and absence of visual input. The patient's performance was compared with that of healthy controls. We observed the traditional bimanual coupling effect in healthy controls. Moreover, we also replicated the effect when they performed the task blindfolded. In the case of the patient, both hands showed the typical ovalization of the line trajectory when the task was performed in visual modality. It is interesting that when the patient performed the task blindfolded, the trajectories of the impaired right hand seemed to be not influenced by the concomitant circular movement of the spared left hand. The movement of the unaffected hand induced a bimanual coupling effect on the movement of the affected one only when the visual input was available. In absence of a visual feedback, the aberrant proprioceptive information might preclude the emerging of bimanual coupling, even in the case of a preserved motor intentionality and planning.

The latter is classified as perseverative behavior and has been attributed to defective response inhibition or attentional disengagement deficit. This study aimed at (a) verifying that consecutive (immediate) and return (temporally distant) motor perseverations could be due to different mechanisms; (b) investigating the relationships among different types of perseveration (e.g., consecutive, return, scribble), spatial neglect and the impairment in specific components of executive functioning. Method: Seventeen right brain-damaged patients underwent letter, star, bell, and apple cancellation tasks. A global index for each type of perseveration found and Mean Position of Hits, as a neglect index, were calculated. The following components of executive functioning were evaluated: motor programming (Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB] subtest), inhibitory control FAB, interference sensitivity (FAB and Stroop color-word interference test), set-shifting (Weigl sorting test, Phonemic\/semantic alternate fluencies), and working memory (Backward Digit span). Results: Ten patients out of 17 showed some degree of perseveration. Regularized linear regression analyses demonstrated that interference sensitivity and Stroop test performances were related to return perseverations and backward digit to scribble ones. No significant relationships were found for consecutive perseverations and between neglect and any type of perseverations. Conclusions: The present study showed that return perseverations might have a distinct etiology from consecutive ones, being related to an inability to update and shift between action programs according to the visual stimuli. A finer classification of perseverations could help in unveiling the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying each type of behavior.

Method: Seventy-one EOP patients (12-18 years) were included in the study. Raw scores of nine MCCB tests were converted into age- and sex-corrected T scores comprising six domains and global cognition (cognitive composite score). Patient performance, relative to the healthy reference group, was examined using one sample t-tests (reference T score mean of 50). Age effects were examined using one-way analyses of variance between three age groups (12-14 years, 15-16 years, 17-18 years). Sex differences were examined using independent samples t tests. Results: The patients performed significantly worse than the healthy reference group in all MCCB domains, with a global deficit of -1.6 SD below the reference. Across the domains, the impairments varied from -1.4 SD in speed of processing to -0.6 SD in visual learning and reasoning and problem-solving. Significant age effects were found in speed of processing, attention\/vigilance, reasoning and problem-solving, and global cognition. The oldest age group showed largest impairments relative to the age- and sex-corrected reference. Female patients had a significantly higher mean T score in verbal learning compared to males.

Results: Forty-five of 69 (65%) DLB patients were VH-positive (VH+). VH+ patients performed worse on the clock drawing (8.8\/16 vs. 11.9\/16, p = .016) with a higher rate of misrepresentation of time (69% vs. 29%, p = .002) and numbers (53% vs. 25%, p = .024). Likewise, VH+ patients performed worse on the HVOT (13.3\/30 vs. 15.7\/30, p = .009) having more isolated (6.2\/30 vs. 4.4\/30, p = .012) types of responses compared to VH- patients. Both groups had similar copying ability (p &gt; .05). The VH discriminative accuracy of the clock drawing was comparable to that of the more elaborate test of visual perception, the HVOT. Conclusions: In DLB impaired drawing and visual organization, but not copying ability is associated with the presence of VH. The simple clock drawing test can be helpful to alert a clinician to the possibility of VH in DLB.

Psychosocial factors, such as discrimination and perceived control, also differ across racial\/ethnic groups, and emerging literature highlights their potential role in contributing to cognitive disparities in addition to socioeconomic status. Method: 1,463 older adults (51% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic Black, and 22% non-Hispanic White) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project completed cognitive and psychosocial measures, including a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Everyday and Major Experiences of Lifetime Discrimination scales, and the Perceived Control scale. Mediation models quantified separate indirect effects of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity on global cognitive composite scores through education, income, discrimination, and external perceived control. Results: Educational attainment, income, and perceived control each mediated racial\/ethnic disparities in global cognition. Socioeconomic indicators (i.e., lower education and lower income) explained approximately 50% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in global cognition, and more external perceived control explained an additional 5%-8%. Hispanics reported the lowest levels of discrimination, while non-Hispanic Blacks reported the highest levels. However, neither everyday nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with global cognition. Significant racial\/ethnic disparities in global cognition remained after accounting for the included socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Conclusions: This study suggests that psychosocial factors may explain racial\/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging above and beyond socioeconomic indicators. More external perceived control, which could reflect chronic exposure to interpersonal and institutional marginalization, may be a particularly salient psychosocial risk factor for poorer cognitive aging among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults.

We explored cognitive associations with AWM during late-midlife. Method: Participants were community-dwelling men (n = 242; M = 61.90 years; range = 56-66). Linear-mixed effects regression models examined associations of total, periventricular, and deep AWM with cognitive performance, controlling for multiple comparisons. Models considering specific cognitive domains controlled for current general cognitive ability (GCA). We hypothesized that total AWM would be associated with worse processing speed, executive function, and current GCA; deep AWM would correlate with GCA and periventricular AWM would relate to specific cognitive abilities. We also assessed the potential influence of cognitive reserve by examining a moderation effect of early life (mean age of 20) cognition. Results: Greater total and deep AWM were associated with poorer current GCA. Periventricular AWM was associated with worse executive function, working memory, and episodic memory. When periventricular and deep AWM were modeled simultaneously, both retained their respective significant associations with cognitive performance. Cognitive reserve did not moderate associations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AWM contributes to poorer cognitive function in late-midlife. Examining only total AWM may obscure the potential differential impact of regional AWM. Separating total AWM into subtypes while controlling for current GCA revealed a dissociation in relationships with cognitive performance; deep AWM was associated with nonspecific cognitive ability whereas periventricular AWM was associated with specific frontal-related abilities and memory. Management of vascular or other risk factors that may increase the risk of AWM should begin during or before early late-midlife.

While reward is typically operationalized as a gain, altruistic decisions also engage the reward system in fMRI studies. Although altruism comes at a cost, individuals may be motivated by the social reward associated with benefitting another. At present, it is unclear how PD affects altruism because both increased egoistic tendencies and increased generosity have been documented. Method: To address this, 32 individuals with PD and 32 age-matched healthy controls completed two tasks of implicit and explicit altruism. First, in an intertemporal choice task, participants chose between a smaller immediate or larger later outcome. Outcome types included gains, losses, and donations, and an implicit altruism measure was derived. Second, participants completed two versions of the dictator game, which assesses nonreciprocal giving and yields an explicit measure of altruism. Results: Patients and controls showed similar altruism in the intertemporal choice task and in a dictator game for a charity, but patients were more generous than controls in the dictator game in which the recipient was a stranger. Among patients, altruism measures were moderated by laterality of hemispheric burden and medication type. Conclusions: This study was the first to examine altruistic decision-making in PD patients using both implicit and explicit measures. PD patients were neither overly generous nor egoistic in their decisions, although some disease and treatment characteristics may have a modest association with altruism in PD.

It is unknown whether the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) is capable of identifying such phenotypic variations of depression. We investigated the factor structure of the BDI-II and its associations with demographic characteristics and other nonmotor symptoms in PD. We reviewed the cases of 236 patients with a confirmed PD diagnosis. Evaluations included the BDI-II, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Apathy Scale (AS), and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI). We used exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) with target rotations as this method integrates aspects of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. We conducted hierarchical regressions to assess for associations between the BDI-II factors and gender, age, education, disease duration, cognition, anxiety, and apathy. ESEM supported the retention of a Somatic factor and an Affective factor that accounted for 53% of the model variance. Model goodness-of-fit measures were within normal limits. Higher AS scores were positively associated with the Somatic and Affective factors. Higher GAI scores were positively associated only with the Affective factor. There were no other significant relationships with factor scores. This study supports the retention of a two-factor model of the BDI-II in PD. These unique clusters of depressive symptoms in PD can be used to guide clinical decisions about the need for further psychiatric evaluation and the appropriateness of different therapeutic interventions.

","97":"Stroke-related social cognitive impairment is now well established, but studies vary considerably in the nature and magnitude of the deficits reported, as well as whether there are potential areas of preservation. Because these discrepancies may reflect clinical heterogeneity between the contributing research participants, this study provides the first concurrent assessment of all four core social cognitive domains (theory of mind, emotion perception, social behavior, and affective empathy) in the same stroke cohort. A secondary goal was to test whether the degree of social cognitive impairment varied as a function of the tasks' ecological validity, on the basis that tasks with greater realism may provide a better indication of the implications of any stroke-related difficulties for everyday social interactions. Participants included 35 people with first-time, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (as confirmed via MRI or CT) aged between 29 and 87 years (M = 64.69; SD = 12.92), and 35 controls matched for age, sex, and years of education. All participants completed a comprehensive social cognitive test battery as well as measures to broadly characterize neurocognitive function and well-being. Relative to controls, affective empathy was selectively preserved (d = 0.02), but stroke-related deficits were identified for theory of mind (d = -0.42), emotion perception (d = -0.48), and social behavior (d = -0.59). The degree of social cognitive impairment did not vary as a function of the tasks' ecological validity. These data enhance understanding of stroke-related social cognitive impairment and inform the development of tailored, evidence-based rehabilitation efforts.

Combat Veterans (N = 338) completed a neurocognitive assessment battery and several self-report symptom measures assessing depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, sleep quality, pain interference, and neurobehavioral complaints. All participants also completed two performance validity tests (PVTs) and one stand-alone symptom validity test (SVT) along with two embedded SVTs. Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a three-factor solution: performance validity, cognitive performance, and symptom report (SVTs loaded on the third factor). Results of t tests demonstrated that participants who failed PVTs displayed significantly more severe symptoms and significantly worse performance on most measures of neurocognitive functioning compared to those who passed. Participants who failed a stand-alone SVT also reported significantly more severe symptomatology on all symptom report measures, but the pattern of cognitive performance differed based on the selected SVT cutoff. Multiple linear regressions revealed that both SVT and PVT failure explained unique variance in symptom report, but only PVT failure significantly predicted cognitive performance. Performance and symptom validity tests measure distinct but related constructs. SVTs and PVTs are significantly related to both cognitive performance and symptom report; however, the relationship between symptom validity and symptom report is strongest. SVTs are also differentially related to cognitive performance and symptom report based on the utilized cutoff score. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved). ","99":"Studies conducted in developed countries have shown that attentional impairment is commonly seen in patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). There is a lack of studies using culture-free neuropsychological instruments. Additionally, attention consists of different subdomains. Deficits in subdomains have not been investigated in MDD. Studies on subdomains using systematic frameworks are needed. We aimed to verify the percentage of Brazilian MDD patients with attention deficits, using a culture-free instrument; compare different attention subdomains in MDD patients with paired controls; find the subdomain that best discriminated controls from MDD patients. Forty-five unmedicated patients currently with MDD and 45 age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. Attention performance was measured by a Go\/No-go task which detected omission errors, commission errors, reaction time (RT), and variability of reaction time (VRT). These variables assess four specific subdomains: focused attention (omission errors), response inhibition (commission errors), alertness (RT), and sustained attention (VRT). MANCOVAs were used to test group differences and logistic regressions to find the strongest predictor of MDD. Compared with normative data, 73.3% of the patients and 17.7% of the controls exhibited attention deficits, defined as a z-score &lt; 2.0 on two or more subdomains. Depressed patients showed poorer performance in all attention subdomains. The VRT variable was the strongest predictor of MDD. Lapses in attention as the test progresses affected the stability of RTs and increased VRT in MDD patients. A significant proportion of the depressive patients shows attention deficits, as described in developed countries; all attention subdomains are affected in MDD patients; sustained attention is the most affected subdomain.

Some investigations suggest that an inability to retrieve newly learned information from memory is prominent, whereas others imply that compromised acquisition accounts for impairment. Prior research has not simultaneously evaluated acquisition and retrieval processes in MS, and fewer have attempted to account for initial acquisition when studying retrieval. The Item Specific Deficit Approach (ISDA) offers a method of quantifying acquisition, retrieval, and retention processes, with the latter two mechanisms being adjusted for initial acquisition. To simultaneously quantify acquisition and retrieval abilities, the ISDA was applied to list learning performance in two independent samples of people with MS and corresponding healthy comparison groups. Study 1 included 85 people with MS and 47 healthy individuals. Study 2 involved a separate sample of 79 people with MS and 22 healthy people. They were administered neuropsychological batteries, and participants with MS were classified as globally impaired or unimpaired. The California Verbal Learning Test-II was administered to assess new-learning in both studies, and responses were scored using the ISDA. Both studies revealed that cognitively impaired people with MS manifest weaknesses involving acquisition and retrieval. Nearly identical effect sizes emerged across samples, with cognitive impairment achieving a medium effect upon acquisition and a large effect upon retrieval. These findings accord well with previous research showing diminished acquisition and retrieval among people with MS. The results may also reconcile contradictory findings in the extant literature by showing that memory impairment in MS is not exclusively attributable to either acquisition or retrieval. Rather, both processes may manifest across people with MS. The replication across samples with nearly identical effect sizes implies that these effects are reliable and possess external validity. These data hold implications for memory rehabilitation interventions involving people with MS, and suggest that acquisition and retrieval processes should be addressed in treatment.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to test two competing hypotheses: The cultural differences hypothesis asserts large differences between Whites and racial\/ethnic minorities in the U.S., and small differences between- (e.g., African Americans, Latinos) and within- (e.g., Latinos: Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans) minority groups. The cultural similarities hypothesis posits small differences between Whites and minorities, and these differences are equal or smaller in magnitude than differences between- and within-minorities on executive function performance. We also tested moderators of these differences. We focused on overall executive functioning performance and its three core components: inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility..

Absolute differences between Whites and minorities (d = 0.85, 95% CI [0.65, 1.05]) were larger in magnitude compared to between-minorities (d = 0.44, 95% CI [0.28, 0.60]) and within-minorities (d = 0.09, 95% CI [0.03, 0.15]). White-minority differences were moderated by type of executive function measure and year of data collection. Post hoc analyses revealed large relative differences between some groups but not others.

Participants included 116 older PLWH and 48 seronegatives who completed a baseline neuropsychological evaluation (see Woods et al., 2020), including a laboratory PM experiment that paralleled the design of the current naturalistic study. The naturalistic time-based PM task required participants to press a button on a portable PM response box 4 times per day for 1 month. PLWH were randomly assigned to an unsupported control condition or to an experimental group in which strategic processing was supported at encoding (implementation intentions and visualization), monitoring (content-free cuing), and\/or cue detection (auditory alarm). The seronegative participants were all assigned to the unsupported control group. In a model adjusting for age and affective disorders, PLWH who received all three supports in combination demonstrated moderately better naturalistic time-based PM accuracy as compared with PLWH controls. Both the cue detection and combination conditions were associated with markedly more precise response timing on the naturalistic time-based PM task. Supported PM accuracy as measured in the laboratory was positively associated with naturalistic PM accuracy among PLWH in the experimental groups. Providing strategic supports to enhance the cue salience of naturalistic time-based PM tasks may improve both the accuracy and timing with which older PLWH remember to perform time-based intentions.

While a few theoretical models propose that executive function may play a role in empathy, it is unknown how variation in executive function, and underlying variation in key large-scale brain network nodes, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex node within the executive control network-or the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) node within the mentalizing\/theory of mind network-may account for individual differences in empathy capacity. The relationship between individual differences in executive capacity-parsed into working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility subdomains-and magnitude of activity in a priori identified PFC subregions during a functional MRI-based ecologically valid empathy induction paradigm, was investigated. Empathic happiness (i.e., vicarious joy) and empathic concern (i.e., vicarious sadness) in response to the life circumstances of actual people were measured at separate time points as brain functional MRI was obtained. Participants also completed executive-heavy clinical neuropsychological tasks outside of the scanner. Frontopolar PFC was activated across both types of empathy. However, empathic happiness related to engagement of a much broader network of prefrontal cortex subregions relative to empathic concern: spawning frontopolar, dorsolateral, and medial aspects. PFC activation during both types of empathy was positively predicted by working memory capacity. Activation in core aspects of the working memory-executive control network, and core happiness-related aspects of the mentalizing brain network (i.e., medial PFC and precuneus) predicted greater empathy capacity.

Ninety-six persons with MS and 65 HCs aged 18 to 65 completed self-report and performance-based IBT measures along with assessments of cognition, motor function, and affect at a single time point. The MS group reported perceptions of less IBT use and poorer skills than HCs and demonstrated worse IBT performance as per accuracy and speed on the Actual Reality. In persons with MS, IBT perceptions and performance were significantly associated. Cognition and dexterity were significantly associated with IBT performance, and anxiety was associated with IBT perceptions. Disease duration, processing speed, and IBT perceptions were unique predictors of IBT performance in the MS group within a multivariate model. Persons with MS present with poorer IBT performance compared with HCs, which can limit participation.

A naturalistic performance measure, the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills (TOGSS), and standard neuropsychological tasks, were completed by 191 participants with serious mental illness. Hierarchical cluster analytic techniques were used to explore functional subgroups based on naturalistic performance measure variables. Multivariate analyses of variance were utilized to compare subgroups on TOGSS variables and neuropsychological measures, respectively. Two distinct functional subgroups emerged from the cluster analysis. On average, participants in cluster one were faster, more efficient, and more accurate compared to cluster two. Based on performance on neuropsychological tasks, cluster one had better verbal memory, visual attention, and processing speed, and executive functioning scores, compared to cluster two. The clusters did not differ on a measure of auditory working memory.

This study aims at establishing the role of communicative-pragmatic abilities in functioning, defined as a set of daily activities, in schizophrenia. This would contribute to enrich current models of the neurocognitive predictors of functioning, which have so far neglected pragmatics. One hundred people with schizophrenia underwent a comprehensive assessment including functioning, cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and pragmatics. We tested the effects of cognition as a predictor of functioning, first mediated by ToM, then sequentially mediated by ToM and pragmatics. Next, we explored the predictive effect of cognition, sequentially mediated by ToM and pragmatics, on different functional domains (i.e., interpersonal relations, instrumental role, and personal autonomy). The first model confirmed that ToM acts as a mediator between cognition and functioning. Importantly, the second model highlighted also the main mediating role of pragmatics. The mediation models on different functional domains showed that, when considered together, both pragmatics and ToM significantly influenced all aspects of functioning. When considered separately, pragmatics was significantly related to interpersonal functioning, while ToM to personal autonomy. Innovatively, our findings highlight that pragmatics has a main role, both direct and indirect, in affecting functioning. Of particular interest is that the impact of pragmatics encompasses different functional domains, and especially interpersonal functioning.

Adult participants with MDD (N = 111) who completed a baseline neuropsychological assessment battery for a cognitive remediation trial were used in analyses. We compared the frequency of cognitive impairment using the normative and idiographic approaches and examined how these indexes related to observed functioning, perceived functioning, and depression severity. While only 25% of the sample would be classified as cognitively impaired on a composite measure according to normative comparison standards, 62.2% of this group were classified as idiographically impaired using a conservative cut-off of at least 1 SD deviation below premorbid estimates. Idiographic cognitive impairment shared a stronger inverse relationship with perceived functional competence than normative cognitive impairment. Depressive symptoms did not significantly correlate with both normative and idiographic impairment. In MDD, reliance on assessment of contemporary cognitive functioning might underestimate rates of those who could be considered cognitively impaired.

Longitudinal data collected annually for up to 7 years from 1,084 older adults (ndementia = 163; nMCI = 333; nCN = 523) were analyzed. Functional reserve was operationalized as the residual variance in the Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale after accounting for demographics (sex\/gender, race, ethnicity, education), neuropathology (gray matter, hippocampal, and white matter hyperintensity volumes), and cognition (executive function, verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and spatial function). Structural equation models estimated (a) functional reserve's associations with 7-year changes in clinical diagnosis and disease severity and (b) predictors of functional reserve. Functional reserve was lower in dementia versus cognitively normal individuals. Higher baseline functional reserve was associated with lower concurrent dementia severity and slower clinical progression and attenuated the association of cognition with concurrent dementia severity. Physical function and apathy were the strongest predictors of functional reserve. Results provide preliminary validation of functional reserve for explaining individual differences in susceptibility to IADL dysfunction independent of neuropathology, cognition, and demographics. Physical functioning and apathy are promising modifiable intervention targets to enhance functional reserve in the context of brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

Besides RT, this ocular SRT (O-SRT) task enables generation of correct anticipations (CA) and stucks, reflecting other critical aspects of ISL. Method: ISL was tested in 26 individuals with TBI and 28 healthy controls using the O-SRT task. Mixed analyses of variance were conducted to analyze RT and CA in three phases: learning, interference, and recovery from interference. The average number of stucks was compared with an independent-samples t test. Finally, Pearson correlation analyses of ISL with demographic, clinical, and WM capacity measures were performed. Results: Based on RT, ISL was impaired in the TBI group. However, CA demonstrated improved learning, but with deficits in the interference and recovery from interference phases. Stucks were more frequent in the TBI group, which affected RT and CA measures. Neither demographic nor clinical factors were associated with ISL. Verbal, but not spatial, WM capacity was impaired in the TBI group, and spatial WM capacity positively correlated with ISL in controls only. Conclusion: We suggest that the high TBI group stuck rate can be attributed to lack of initiative and\/or conservative response bias associated with TBI, and view it as a main cause leading to deficits in ISL. Unlike controls, the TBI group could not muster their relatively preserved spatial WM capacity to support their ISL performance.

Previous research showed that neuropsychological and especially executive functioning deficits could be related to the two most important risk factors for sexual (re-)offending, namely an antisocial lifestyle and deviant sexual interests. Method: By using a quasi-experimental research design, the present study compared the performance of a sample of men convicted of child sexual abuse (CSA) offenses (n = 70) with men convicted of sexual offenses against adults (n = 49), men convicted of nonsexual offenses (n = 54), and nonoffending men (n = 70) in a set of neuropsychological tests assessing different aspects of executive functioning. Results: All three offending groups had a higher prevalence of brain injury and performed worse compared to nonoffending men on almost all neuropsychological tests. Individuals convicted of CSA offenses showed no differences compared to the other two offending groups. Latent class analyses revealed that a small subset of CSA-offending participants showed most pronounced neuropsychological deficits. These persons also exhibited more intense pedosexual interests but not more indicators of antisociality. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that only a certain subset of CSA-offending individuals demonstrates considerable neuropsychological deficits, which seem to correlate with a particularly strong sexual interest in children. This subgroup could also be described as having a particularly high risk concerning sexual reoffending with a sexual abuse offense.

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms and processes underlying this risk remain poorly understood. The current longitudinal study examined whether attention network components reflect neurocognitive pathways linking ADHD symptoms with adverse driving outcomes. Method: Drivers from six U.S. sites participating in the Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (N=3,226) were prospectively monitored for objectively identified crashes, near-crashes, and crash\/near-crash fault. At study entry, drivers were assessed for ADHD symptoms; completed the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition; and were then followed continuously for 1-2 years of routine, on-road driving using technology-enhanced in-car monitoring. Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation models examined the extent to which attention network components mediated the association between ADHD symptoms and future driving risk, controlling for known risk factors. Results: As expected, self-reported ADHD symptoms predicted all markers of future driving risk. Higher ADHD symptoms were associated with reduced inhibitory control, lower levels of top-down attentional control (endogenous orienting), and greater arousal decrements (phasic alertness). Controlling for ADHD symptoms, top-down attentional control uniquely predicted future crashes, near-crashes, and culpability for future crashes\/near-crashes; only arousal decrements portended future near-crashes. Only top-down attentional control significantly mediated the association between baseline ADHD symptoms and future driving risk. Conclusions: The driving risks associated with ADHD appear to be conveyed in part by impairments in the top-down, voluntary control of attention, rather than by difficulties sustaining attention over time or inhibiting impulses, as is often assumed.

Method: A large sample of adults who had sustained mild, moderate or severe TBIs seven months prior (N = 165) and a control group (N = 106) underwent DTI and cognitive testing. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated for 5 regions (corpus callosum: genu, body, splenium; fornix; superior longitudinal fasciculus) that recent meta-analyses identified as being affected by TBI and related to cognition following TBI. Memory, attention and executive functioning, which are often affected by TBI, were assessed. Results: Overall, mild TBI did not show significant WM or cognitive changes, relative to controls, but moderate to severe TBI was associated with large WM alterations (all regions) and poorer cognitive performance. No significant correlations were found between DTI findings and cognition in the moderate to severe group.

Early and ongoing examination of mild TBI is needed to determine whether WM and cognitive changes are initially present and, if so, when they resolve.

This study aimed to implement an actuarial approach to classifying MCI in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study. Method: ACTIVE study participants (N = 2,755) were classified as cognitively normal (CN) or as having MCI using NP criteria. Estimated proportion of MCI participants and reversion rates were examined as well as baseline characteristics by MCI subtype. Mixed effect models examined associations of MCI subtype with 10-year trajectories of self-reported independence and difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Results: The proportion of MCI participants was estimated to be 18.8%. Of those with MCI at baseline, 19.2% reverted to CN status for all subsequent visits. At baseline, the multidomain-amnestic MCI group generally had the greatest breadth and depth of cognitive impairment and reported the most IADL difficulty. Longitudinally, MCI participants showed faster IADL decline than CN participants (multidomain-amnestic MCI &gt; single domain-amnestic MCI &gt; nonamnestic MCI). Conclusion: NP criteria identified a proportion of MCI and reversion rate within ACTIVE that is consistent with prior studies involving community-dwelling samples. The pattern of everyday functioning change suggests that being classified as MCI, particularly amnestic MCI, is predictive of future loss of independence. Future work will apply these classifications in ACTIVE to better understand the relationships between MCI and health, social, and cognitive intervention-related factors.

Theories suggesting a common processing mechanism between praxis and speech are supported by evidence that shared neural architecture underlies both functions. Despite advances in understanding the neurobiology of this left-hemisphere specialization the cortical networks linking these 2 functions are rarely investigated on a behavioral level. Method: This study deploys functional transcranial doppler (fTCD) ultrasound to directly measure hemispheric activation during skilled manual praxis tasks shown to be correlated to hemispheric speech lateralization indices. In a new paradigm we test the hypothesis that praxis tasks are highly dependent on the left hemisphere's capacity for processing sequential information will be better correlated with direction and strength of hemispheric speech lateralization. Results: Across 2 experiments we first show that only certain praxis tasks (pegboard and coin-rotation) correlated with direct measurements of speech lateralization despite shared properties across all tasks tested. Second, through novel imaging of hemispheric activation during praxis, results showed that the pegboard differed in the lateralization pattern created and furthermore that it was significantly related to speech laterality indices, which was not the case for either of the other two tasks. Conclusion: These results are discussed in terms of a lateralized speech-praxis control mechanism and demonstrates that measurements of motor paradigms through the use of fTCD are reliable enough to provide a new insight to the behavioral relationship been speech and handedness.

We therefore examined the issue based on a narrative task that we have administered to different populations for over 20 years. Method: We meta-analyzed 98 studies (N = 11,528) conducted by our laboratories and that featured measures of biological sex and storytelling. We ran primary-data analyses (N = 797) on an overlapping subset of these studies that also included salivary hormone and digit ratio measures. Results: Women told longer stories than men, d = 0.31, 95% CI [0.24, 0.38], an effect that did not vary by geographic region but was moderated by cue type (verbal: d = 0.57, [0.44, 0.71]; pictures: d = 0.29, [0.22, 0.36]), response modality (oral: d = -0.04, [-0.18, 0.09]; handwriting: d = 0.39, [0.31, 0.47]; typing: d = 0.31, [0.21, 0.42]), and age (prepubertal children: d = 0.13, [-0.04, 0.30]; pubescents: d = 0.48, [0.23, 0.74]; premenopausal adults: d = 0.36, [0.29, 0.42]; postmenopausal adults: d = -0.09, [-0.35, 0.16]). Consistent with the age effect, estradiol, a sex-dimorphic hormone during the reproductive life stage, was a specific mediator of the sex difference in narrative-writing fluency. This mediation effect was moderated by prenatal hormone exposure, estimated via digit ratio. Conclusions: When verbal fluency is assessed through narrative writing, a robust female advantage becomes evident. It is associated with the reproductive life stage and variations in current estradiol concentrations, particularly in individuals prenatally exposed to relatively more estradiol than testosterone.

Deficits in visuoperceptual and attentional mechanisms could contribute to simultanagnosia. In the present study, we explored the impaired visual perception of global configuration with two main hypotheses: (a) It is due to a deficit in processing low-spatial frequency stimuli, and (b) it arises from deficits in adjusting attentional focus. Method: The visuoperceptual mechanism was explored by asking participants (5 PCA patients and 20 age- and education-matched healthy controls) to report the local and global elements of incongruent hierarchical letters. Stimuli were unbiased (black letters\/white background) and parvocellular biased (red letters\/green background). A cued T-detection task, where the stimulus onset asynchrony and the cues' features varied, was used to explore focal attention. Results: PCA patients systematically failed in reporting the global but not the local element. The parvocellular-biased condition partially improved the performance in only 1 patient. In the T-detection task, controls responded faster to targets cued by red dots and small cues as compared to no cues. Conversely, the cue's features did not affect patients' performance. Conclusions: Results only partially support the hypothesis according to which simultanagnosia is driven by an impairment in processing low-spatial frequencies. Data indicate a deficit in the flexibility of focal attention that prevents PCA patients from adapting the attentional window to the stimulus features. Simultanagnosia in PCA can be conceptualized as a complex result of a deficit involving visuoperceptual and exogenous attentional mechanisms.

It could be an endophenotype for a wide range of clinical disorders and a general marker of neurological health or maladaptation. The default mode network (DMN) and the central executive and the salience networks (CEN + SN) support response stability in adults. The aim of this study was to explore the associations of resting-state connectivity of the DMN and the CEN + SN with lapses of attention in typically developing primary schoolchildren. Method: RT variability was measured by RT standard deviation in the self-paced Stroop-like Animal Size Test in 137 children aged 6-11 years. Electrophysiological signatures of the DMN and the CEN + SN were obtained using a seed-based oscillatory power envelope correlation in conjunction with beamformer spatial filtering. Results: Statistical nonparametric mapping showed that RT variability was positively associated with connectivity between the DMN and the posterior insula and the right temporal cortex (PFWE-corr &lt; .006), suggesting that a greater focus of self-reflective internal attention may be associated with obstructed transition to an active processing mode. RT variability was negatively associated with connectivity between the DMN and the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula (PFWE-corr = .001) overlapping with the SN, which handles top-down cognitive regulation. These associations were specifically found for the anterior DMN seed in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in emotion and motivational circuits.

However, there is an inconsistent association between these constructs. Recent studies have shown that compromise ongoing self-monitoring of one's memory associates with anosognosia for memory loss. Yet to date it is unclear which memory monitoring mechanisms are impaired in these patients. In this study, we examined the extent to which temporal monitoring or orbitofrontal reality filtering (e.g., ability to monitor the temporal relevance of a memory) and source monitoring (e.g., the ability to distinguish which memories stem from internal as opposed to external sources) are associated with awareness of memory deficits. A total of 35 patients (M = 69 years; M = 14 years of education) with memory difficulties following a stroke were recruited from outpatient clinics. Patients were assessed with measures of self-awareness of memory difficulties, cognitive abilities and 2 experimental paradigms assessing source and temporal monitoring. Results showed that patients unaware of their memory difficulties were more likely to externalize the source of their memories. Specifically, those unaware of their deficits were more likely to assign an external source to memories that were internally produced (e.g., imagined). No differences were observed in relation to temporal monitoring between patients aware and unaware of their deficits. This study informs current theoretical models of self-awareness of memory loss. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings and explore different memory monitoring mechanisms in relation to anosognosia for memory loss.

This study aimed to extend knowledge on the specificity, durability, and mechanisms of associations between everyday discrimination and cognition by using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and a longitudinal mediation design. Participants included 3,304 older adults in the Health and Retirement Study Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol. Discrimination was assessed using the Everyday Discrimination Scale. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 8-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Vascular diseases were quantified as the self-reported presence of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to estimate episodic memory, executive functioning, processing speed, language, and visuoconstruction across a battery of 13 neuropsychological tests. Structural equation models controlled for sociodemographics and baseline cognition ascertained 2 to 4 years prior. Discrimination was associated with more depressive symptoms and vascular diseases. Depressive symptoms mediated negative effects of discrimination on subsequent functioning across all 5 cognitive domains. Vascular diseases additionally mediated negative effects of discrimination on processing speed. After accounting for mediators, direct negative effects of discrimination remained for executive functioning and visuoconstruction. This national longitudinal study in the United States provides evidence for broad and enduring effects of everyday discrimination on cognitive aging, which appear to be partially mediated by mental and physical health. Future research should examine additional mechanisms as well as moderators of these associations to better understand points of intervention.

A well-characterized sample of 136 children oversampled for ADHD and other forms of child psychopathology associated with executive dysfunction (ages 8-13; 68% Caucasian\/non-Hispanic) completed a counterbalanced series of executive function and academic tests. Parents\/teachers completed executive function ratings; teachers also rated children's academic performance. The executive function tests\/ratings association was modest (r = .30) and significantly lower than the academic tests\/ratings association (r = .63). Relative to ratings, executive function tests showed significantly higher cross-method predictive validity and significantly better within-method prediction; executive function ratings failed to demonstrate improved within-method prediction. Both methods uniquely predicted academic tests and ratings.

The cognitive mechanisms accounting for such disorders remain yet unclear. The heterogeneity of cognitive profiles of brain-damaged individuals and the use of independent tests to measure the links between these mechanisms and the comprehension of irony might contribute to this lack of clarity. The present study aimed to further explore the underlying mechanisms of irony-understanding disorders (i.e., context processing, executive functions [EF], and theory of mind [ToM]) in patients with brain lesions. We used a paradigm manipulating these mechanisms within an irony task to identify different patterns of pragmatic performance associated with cognitive profiles. We administered this task and standard neuropsychological tests assessing EF and ToM to 30 participants with acquired brain injury (ABI) and 30 healthy control (HC) participants. A cluster analysis revealed that two thirds of the participants with ABI (3 subgroups out of 4) presented atypical pragmatic and neuropsychological patterns. The most severe disturbances in understanding irony, characterized by insensitivity to the context, were associated with a joint impairment of ToM and EF in 1 subgroup. In the 2 other context-sensitive subgroups, an isolated deficit in EF co-occurred with difficulties dealing with literal or ironic statements when the EF demand of the irony task was increased. However, the effect of this EF demand could be negated by the presence of markers helping the comprehension of irony. These results have important clinical implications for the evaluation and therapy of pragmatic disorders in individuals with ABI. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

We hypothesized that veterans affected by mTBI and PTSD would manifest differences in neuropsychological testing and self-report measures compared to a group of healthy veteran controls and to veterans with only PTSD. Participants included 3 groups of veterans: (a) healthy controls (n = 43); (b) PTSD only (n = 48); and (c) comorbid blast-induced mTBI and PTSD (n = 47). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to extract a smaller number of latent dimensions for group comparison. The EFA supported an 8-factor model. A multivariate analysis of variance on the 8 factor scores demonstrated 3 significant factor mean differences: (a) perceived cognitive complications (PCC), (b) perceived emotional distress (PED), and (c) processing speed (PS). Post hoc analyses showed significant group mean difference in PS between the comorbid and the control groups. In addition, the comorbid group presented with the highest levels of PCC and PED. Results suggest that among OIF\/OEF veterans with blast-induced mTBI, PTSD with its accompanying emotional distress may be a significant determinant of subjective sense of well-being both cognitively and emotionally. The objective discrepancy in PS between the comorbid group and the healthy controls also appears largely due to PTSD more so than the remote blast-induced mTBI, as the group mean difference in PS became negligible after controlling for PTSD levels.

Early Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including neurofibrillary tangles in the perirhinal cortex as well as disrupted cortico-cortical connectivity, would be expected to disrupt the integration of object features. This integration deficit may underlie AD patients' semantic memory deficits and would be predicted to be more prominent for living objects, which tend to be more defined by sensory features compared with nonliving objects. Two experiments were conducted to assess feature integration in cognitively healthy older adults and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In both experiments, pictures of real-world objects were presented in congruent or incongruent colors. Participants were instructed to make a speeded color congruency judgment (Experiment 1) or name the presented surface color (Experiment 2). Across experiments, MCI patients showed a selective integration deficit for living, but not nonliving, objects across both experimental paradigms that was consistent with a deterioration in semantic structural representations rather than a deficit in controlled semantic retrieval. Planned secondary analyses with a subset of patients (Experiment 1) for whom PET imaging was available indicated that the degree of impairment was associated with the magnitude of cortical amyloid burden. These findings suggest that early AD pathology leads to impaired integration of distributed semantic object representations. The development of integration tasks as sensitive markers of early AD pathology may lead to more effective diagnostic tools for early detection and intervention.

","141":"Objective: Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with large magnitude impairments in working memory, whereas short-term memory deficits, when detected, tend to be less pronounced. However, confidence in these findings is limited due to task impurity combined with methodological and statistical limitations of the current evidence base. Method: A well-characterized, clinically evaluated sample of 172 children ages 8-13 years (M = 10.30, SD = 1.42; 72 girls; 64% White\/non-Hispanic) were administered multiple, counterbalanced working memory tests. Bifactor-(s-1) modeling was used to characterize the presence and magnitude of central executive working memory, phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory deficits in pediatric ADHD. Results: ADHD status was associated with very large magnitude impairments in central executive working memory that are present in most pediatric cases (d = 1.63-2.03; 75%-81% impaired), and these deficits covaried with ADHD inattentive and hyperactive\/impulsive symptom severity based on both parent and teacher report. There was also evidence for a unique, albeit significantly smaller, impairment in visuospatial short-term memory (d = 0.60; 38% impaired); however, visuospatial short-term memory abilities did not covary with ADHD symptom severity. There was no evidence linking ADHD with phonological short-term memory deficits across either the dimensional or categorical analyses. Conclusion: These findings provide strong evidence that ADHD is associated with marked central executive working memory deficits that covary with their behavioral symptom presentation across settings. In contrast, visuospatial short-term memory deficits, when present, are likely epiphenomenal, and the most parsimonious conclusion appears to be that phonological short-term memory is intact in pediatric ADHD.

In the current study, we evaluate the potential for clinical utility of two established neuropsychological tests of memory adapted into the fMRI setting. We used the Verbal Paired Associates (VPA) for assessment of verbal memory and the Object Learning and Location (OLL) task for assessment of visuospatial memory. To confirm that these tasks engage the hippocampus, we examined their neural underpinning and patterns of laterality in 20 healthy volunteers (mean age = 26.35). During fMRI of the VPA task of verbal memory, we found a strong left-lateralized posterior hippocampal activation. Remembering the location of objects in the OLL task of visuospatial memory elicited right-lateralized hippocampal activation.

Posttest probabilities using MBR methods to predict dementia status at 2-year follow up ranged from .06 to .33, while posttest probabilities for conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) ranged from .12-.32.

The current study evaluated if participants who participated in a physical activity intervention (aerobic or resistance training) showed a reduction in IIV, compared to a balance and tone control group. This study was a secondary analysis of the EXercise for Cognition and Everyday Living (EXCEL) Study. Women Aged 70-80 years with probable MCI (n = 86) participated in a 6-month randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effects of different physical exercises on cognitive ability.

The current study examined whether individuals with schizophrenia have reduced social attention and whether reduced social attention was related to social motivation deficits (measured with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms) and decreased social functioning (Role Functioning Scale). Thirty-seven outpatients with schizophrenia and 29 healthy participants completed a gaze cueing task with directional social cues (eye gaze) and nonsocial cues (arrows) at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. As predicted, schizophrenia participants had reduced social attention relative to nonsocial attention, compared with healthy participants. Healthy participants were quicker to respond to social cues than nonsocial cues, but schizophrenia participants did not exhibit this same pattern. Schizophrenia participants showed higher accuracy when targets appeared in the same location as a directional cue (i.e., congruency) for nonsocial, but not social, cues. Contrary to expectations, reduced social attention was not significantly correlated with clinically rated social motivation deficits or decreased social functioning in the schizophrenia group.

This study provides a scoping review of neuropsychological studies on MCI in Hispanic\/Latinx populations to evaluate how studies report and account for these factors in diagnosis of MCI. Method: Studies were identified using Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus, using search terms (Hispanic* OR Latin* OR \"Mexican American*\" OR \"Puerto Ric*\" OR Caribbean) and (\"Mild Cognitive Impairment\" OR MCI). Studies using neuropsychological tests in diagnosis of MCI for Latinx individuals in the United States were identified. Sample characterization (e.g., country of origin, literacy, language preference and proficiency), neuropsychological testing methods (e.g., test selection and translation, normative data source), and method of MCI diagnosis were reviewed. Results: Forty-four articles met inclusion criteria. There was considerable variability in reporting of demographic, cultural and linguistic factors across studies of MCI in Latinx individuals. For example, only 5% of studies reported nativity status, 52% reported information on language preference and use, and 34% reported the method and\/or source of test translation and adaptation.

In Session 2, participants imagined statements of actions from Session 1 as well as new statements of actions once or 3 times. On the recognition test, participants had to decide whether statements of actions were or were not enacted during Session 1. Analysis demonstrated that imagining performing the actions increased the tendency of both patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and controls to falsely recall the actions as having been enacted.

While benefits resulting from pre- and post-encoding rest can be alternatively explained via improved distinctiveness at retrieval, it has yet to be established whether both benefits are observable in amnesics. The aim of the current study was to assess whether amnesic patients showed improved retention of prose material after 10 min following both pre- and post-encoding unfilled intervals of wakeful rest. Method: Twelve patients with anterograde amnesia were recruited. Participants completed four conditions. A short prose passage was aurally presented in each condition. Prose presentation was preceded and followed by a 9-min delay interval. Delay intervals were either filled (spot-the-difference task) or unfilled (wakeful rest). Prose retention was assessed immediately after presentation and after 10 min. Results: Prose retention was consistently better when wakeful rest followed prose encoding in comparison to a condition where an effortful task was encountered both before and after encoding. Conclusions: Post-encoding wakeful rest alone substantially improves retention in amnesic patients. While pre-encoding wakeful rest elicits inconsistent benefits in amnesics, reduced retention following both pre- and post-encoding task engagement suggests that pre-encoding activity may still be relevant. Overall, our findings support consolidation interference explanations of forgetting in anterograde amnesia.

Twenty-three PD patients performed RNG on and off dopaminergic medication. Cognitive load was manipulated by performing RNG at faster (1Hz) and slower (0.5 Hz) rates. For RNG, two scores (CS1 and CS2) were derived, which are considered indices of more automatic and more controlled counting, respectively. There were no main effects of medication on RNG performance. There was a significant main effect of cognitive load on CS1, with higher CS1 scores at the faster rate (p = &lt;.01). A significant interaction effect between medication and rate (cognitive load; p = .03) followed by post hoc testing, revealed that CS2 scores were higher, on medication, at the slower but not the faster rate. Patients with PD displayed increased use of more controlled processing strategies on medication at the slowest rate of RNG. Therefore, while dopaminergic medication has been associated with disinhibitory psychopathology, our results suggest that dopamine therapy may enhance some forms of inhibitory cognitive control in PD, but only if there is sufficient time to engage controlled processing strategies.

In addition, EF impairment appeared more general (i.e., affecting more domains) in the adult sample as compared to the child sample. Exploratory analyses also suggested that the presence\/absence of overall impairment on the BRIEF among our ETPKU participants could be predicted based on a small subset of items. A 10-item subset showed total classification accuracy values of 90% and above for both groups.

Mild impairments in activities of daily living (ADL) caused by cognitive dysfunction are also present in the prodromal stage of PDD. The association of both factors has been sparsely investigated. Aim was to evaluate these specific NMS in a large nondemented PD cohort and their co-occurrence with cognitive dysfunction and ADL impairments. Data of 226 PD patients was analyzed. Using corresponding items, two DASH scores were constructed from the NMS-Scale and Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Correlations between DASH scores and PDD risk factors were examined. PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were additionally split into patients with low and high DASH burden, the latter group additionally stratified by presence of cognitive-driven ADL impairment. DASH-NMS scores differed significantly between PD-MCI and cognitively normal (PD-CN) patients (p = .04), while the DASH-PDQ did not (p = .73). The only significant predictor of the DASH-NMS score was cognitive-driven ADL (p = .01). PD-MCI patients with a high DASH burden and more cognitive ADL impairment presented with worse global cognition than patients with a low burden (p = .045). Our results show that the DASH-NMS is superior to the DASH-PDQ score, related to the severity of cognitive impairment, and strongly influenced by cognitive-driven ADL impairment. Presence of DASH symptoms and cognitive-ADL in PD-MCI patients may define a risk group for PDD conversion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

However, previous results in pathological and healthy individuals have also underlined the pivotal role of bottom-up sensorimotor information. In this single-case study, the Circles-Lines Coupling Task was administered to a left-parietal-brain-damaged individual. The cerebral lesion caused a central proprioceptive loss, relative to the impaired right hand, when out of the visual control. For the 1st time in literature, we sought to investigate whether the movement of the unaffected hand induced an efficient coupling effect on the movement of the affected one. The bimanual task was performed in the presence and absence of visual input. The patient's performance was compared with that of healthy controls. We observed the traditional bimanual coupling effect in healthy controls. Moreover, we also replicated the effect when they performed the task blindfolded. In the case of the patient, both hands showed the typical ovalization of the line trajectory when the task was performed in visual modality. It is interesting that when the patient performed the task blindfolded, the trajectories of the impaired right hand seemed to be not influenced by the concomitant circular movement of the spared left hand. The movement of the unaffected hand induced a bimanual coupling effect on the movement of the affected one only when the visual input was available. In absence of a visual feedback, the aberrant proprioceptive information might preclude the emerging of bimanual coupling, even in the case of a preserved motor intentionality and planning.

The narrative description (ND) task, initially developed to detect changes in ecologically relevant visual function in people with impaired vision, is an objective measure of the ability to perceive, understand, and describe a visual scene in a movie clip. Because the ND task draws heavily on semantic and working memory ability in addition to basic visual perception, we aimed to assess the discriminative performance of this task across levels of cognitive impairment. We recruited 56 participants with cognitive status ranging from normal cognition to mild dementia (median age 82, range 66 to 99 years) to watch 20 30-s video clips and describe the visual content without time constraints. These verbal responses were transcribed and processed to generate ND shared word scores using a \"wisdom of the crowd,\" natural-language processing approach. We compared ND scores across diagnostic groups, and used linear mixed models to examine decrements in task performance. There was a stepwise decline of ND scores with increasing levels of cognitive impairment. Additional analyses showed that ND performance was highly related to performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and domain-specific neuropsychological tests for semantic fluency and set shifting. Other models demonstrated differences in ND performance related video content between cognitively normal and impaired participants. The ND test was able to detect decrements in task performance between levels of cognitive impairment and was related to other global neuropsychological measures.

Typically, adults recall more words from the beginning (primacy) and end (recency) of the list compared to the middle of the list. These effects can be affected by neurological disease such that SPEs have been shown to be related to both current and future cognitive decline. This review aimed to summarize existing research on SPEs in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic review of SPEs in MCI and AD was conducted. Despite inconsistencies in the number of items included on word list tasks analyzing SPEs and inconsistencies in how researchers have defined and analyzed SPEs, SPEs have demonstrated the ability to predict future cognitive decline, at times above and beyond traditional memory score performance. In addition, individuals with MCI and AD show similar SPE patterns of reduced primacy and intact recency, with primacy being more reduced in AD, whereas individuals with vascular dementia demonstrate a reversed SPE pattern. The analysis of SPEs has demonstrated some utility as a marker of cognitive impairment associated with MCI, AD, and other dementias; however, research is limited by the multiple ways in which SPEs are defined and analyzed. Future research is discussed, including the need for increased data accessibility in order to quantitatively summarize previous research on SPEs in relation to MCI and AD.

One-hundred and ten participants with left spatial neglect after right-hemisphere stroke read aloud a list of 36 words. Reading errors were scored as \"contralesional\" (error in the left half of the word) or as \"other.\" The influence of lexical processing on neglect dyslexia was studied with a stepwise regression using word frequency, orthographic neighborhood (number of same length neighbors that differ by 1 letter), bigram and trigram counts (number of words with the same 2- and 3-letter combinations), length, concreteness, and imageability as predictors. MRI\/CT images of 92 patients were studied in a voxelwise lesion-symptom analysis (VLSM). Longer length and more trigram neighbors increased, while higher concreteness reduced, the rate of contralesional errors. VLSM revealed lesions in the inferior temporal sulcus, middle temporal and angular gyri, precuneus, temporal pole, and temporo-parietal white matter associated with the rate of contralesional errors. Orthographic competitors may decrease word salience, while semantic concreteness may help constrain the selection of available word options when it is based on degraded information from the left side of the word.

A model of social competence for youth with brain disorder and evidence from youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that diminished social attention may underlie social deficits in PBTSs. This study used eye tracking technology to compare visual social attention in PBTSs, youth with ASD, and typically developing (TD) youth. Participants included 90 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched youth (N = 30 per group). PBTSs were at least 5 years from diagnosis and 2 years from the completion of tumor-directed therapy. Participants' eye gaze patterns were recorded while watching an established social play paradigm that presented videos of children engaging in either interactive or parallel play. Group differences in proportional gaze duration toward social versus nonsocial areas of interest were compared. Medical correlates of social attention in PBTSs were evaluated. Groups significantly differed in gaze preference across conditions, with PBTSs looking less at social areas of interest than TD youth and in a manner comparable to youth with ASD. Among PBTSs, multimodal tumor-directed therapy was associated with reduced gaze preference for faces. This study provides the first evidence of disrupted social attention in PBTSs, with parallels to the social attention deficits observed in ASD. Findings offer a new way to conceptualize the social difficulties of PBTSs and could guide interventions aimed at improving PBTS social adjustment by increasing visual attention to socially relevant information during social interactions.

Information can be processed through either one (i.e., Unimodal WMB) or separate sensory modalities (i.e., Crossmodal WMB). In this study, we investigated whether Crossmodal WMB is differentially affected by normal or pathological aging compared to Unimodal WMB. Experiment 1: 26 older and 26 younger adults recalled the target feature matching the test probe to complete a previously displayed color-shape binding (visually presented in the Unimodal condition; auditorily and visually presented in the Crossmodal condition). Experiment 2: 35 older and 35 younger adults undertook the same paradigm while carrying out articulatory suppression to limit verbal recoding. Experiment 3: 24 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and two groups of 24 healthy matched controls (tested respectively with the same and an increased memory load compared to the patients) were recruited to perform a similar task. Results show no age-related additional cost in Crossmodal WMB in respect to Unimodal WMB. AD patients had poor attainment in both WMB tasks regardless of specific binding condition. These findings provide evidence identifying WMB per se to be impaired in AD, regardless of the type of to-be-bound material. This supports the view that WMB is a suitable cognitive marker for AD.

Research examining the impact of later-life body mass index (BMI) on normal cognitive aging has produced mixed results. There is a need for longitudinal designs, replication across multiple cognitive domains, and consideration of BMI effects in the context of important moderators. The present research examined (a) BMI prediction of neuropsychological performance and decline in executive function (EF), neurocognitive speed, and memory and (b) sex stratification of BMI effects. Participants (n = 869; 573 females; M age = 71.75, range = 53-85 years) were older adults from the Victoria Longitudinal Study. Latent growth modeling was used to examine BMI as a predictor of level and change in three latent variables of cognition. The data were then stratified by sex to test whether BMI effects differed for females and males. We adjusted for selected medical, psychosocial, and demographic characteristics. Higher BMI predicted less decline in EF, neurocognitive speed, and memory. Interestingly, when the data were stratified by sex, higher BMI predicted less neuropsychological decline across domains for females only. BMI was unrelated to cognitive aging trajectories for males. We found that elevated BMI was a risk-reducing factor for cognitive decline only for females. Results may be used to enhance the precision with which intervention protocols may target specific subgroups of older adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

Research has established that ocular behaviors are reliable biomarkers of (un)conscious cognitive processes, and they have distinguished deceptive from honest responding in experimental paradigms. This study examined the incremental utility of eye-tracking on a clinical performance validity test (PVT) in distinguishing adults with verified TBI from adults coached to feign cognitive impairment. Participants were 49 adults with moderate-to-severe TBI (TBI), 47 healthy adults coached to simulate TBI (SIM), and 67 healthy comparisons providing full effort (HC). A PVT linked to eye-tracking was completed in the context of a full neuropsychological battery. Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that eye-tracking indices did not differ among the groups during presentation of stimulus items but did differ during forced-choice trials. Compared to TBI and HC, SIM had significantly more transitions, fixations, and time spent looking at correct and incorrect response options. Logistic regressions and ROC curve analyses showed that accuracy was the best predictor of SIM versus HC. For SIM versus TBI, eye-tracking indices exceeded accuracy in distinguishing the groups. Eye-tracking added incremental predictive value to accuracy for both SIM-HC and SIM-TBI discriminations. Eye-tracking indicated that persons feigning TBI showed multiple signs of greater cognitive effort than persons with verified TBI and healthy comparisons. In the comparison of greatest interest (SIM vs. TBI) eye-tracking best predicted group status and yielded excellent discrimination when combined with accuracy. Eye-tracking may be an important complement to traditional accuracy scores on PVTs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved). ","168":"The present study explored two types of semantic relationships in semantic dementia (SD), that rely on functionally and neuroanatomically distinct semantic systems (taxonomic vs. thematic). We used the visual world paradigm coupled with eye-movement recordings, to gain an implicit, fine-grained and dynamic measure of semantic processing. Nine patients with SD and 15 healthy controls performed a simple word-to-picture matching task in which they had to identify each target among semantically related (taxonomic or thematic) competitors and unrelated distractors. We demonstrated different patterns of gaze fixations between patients with SD and controls: while patients with SD and controls were similarly sensitive to competition from taxonomically related pictures, patients with SD were far more sensitive than controls to thematically related competitors before identifying the targets. Moreover, most of the confusion errors made by patients with SD involved taxonomic distractors rather than thematic ones. We interpreted these findings as reflecting a semantic disequilibrium in SD, with increasing overreliance on thematic knowledge as taxonomic knowledge gradually deteriorates. We concluded that thematic relationships constitute a set of residual semantic knowledge and that their exaggerated activation in SD might certainly deserve further explorations to determine their specific role in this disease and notably, their influence on patients' abilities to deal with daily living activities.

My vision is to build on Neuropsychology's strengths and successes to date while also anticipating the changes needed to remain one of the leading journals in the field of neuropsychology. The most critical element in a journal's success is its content. Neuropsychology is characterized by amazing breadth, spanning basic and clinical science across the life span. The journal is extremely relevant to society and public health, given the high incidence of neurological disease and brain injury, as well as the resulting human, economic, and societal costs associated with them. At the same time, neuropsychological research also can provide important insights into more positive aspects of human function, such as resilience, creativity, altruism, and friendship, and thereby help to understand and promote wellness. Thus, Neuropsychology will continue to provide an outlet for the most interesting and highest quality science in human brain-behavior relationships that seeks to increase our understanding of neuropsychological functions in both healthy and disordered states.

Neurocognitive intraindividual variability, measured as dispersion of scores across a neuropsychological battery, is associated with worse cognitive outcomes and functional deficits among HIV+ adults but has not been studied in the context of HIV+ adults with current SU. We hypothesized that, among HIV+ adults, current SU would be associated with greater dispersion, that greater dispersion would be associated with worse medication adherence, and that this relationship would be worse among substance users. Forty HIV+ adults completed neuropsychological, psychiatric, SU, and medical evaluations and an electronic medication adherence measure. General linear models evaluated the main effect of SU status on neurocognitive dispersion, and models stratified by SU status evaluated the effect of dispersion on medication adherence, adjusting for relevant covariates. The SU+ group showed greater dispersion than did the SU- group, t(38) = 2.74, p = .049, d = 0.81, but this association did not survive multiple comparisons. Stratified analyses indicated a negative relationship between dispersion and medication adherence among the SU+ group but not in the SU- group; however, this effect was reduced after accounting for depressive symptoms. We found preliminary evidence that current SU is associated with greater neurocognitive dispersion among HIV+ adults. SU and neurocognitive dispersion may have a synergistic effect on medication adherence; however, this effect is largely accounted for by depressive symptoms. Future research should examine progression of dispersion in HIV and consequent neurocognitive and functional deficits in those with current SU.

A systematic review and series of meta-analyses were undertaken to assess anticipated gains in verbal learning with longer periods of cannabis abstinence. Studies assessing verbal learning performance in abstinent regular cannabis users and nonusing control participants; studies reporting length of cannabis abstinence at the time of neuropsychological assessment; and studies implementing one of three highly comparable measures of verbal learning and memory were included in the analyses. The included tasks have demonstrated some of the most robust declines associated with cannabis use and are prevalent in the clinical practice of neuropsychology. We assessed associations between cannabis abstinence and verbal learning scores via mixed effects subgroup analyses. Twenty-three studies (k = 28; N = 1,711) met all inclusion criteria. Cannabis users abstinent for 7 days or fewer performed worse than controls on verbal learning tasks, whereas cannabis users abstinent for longer periods showed no average significant difference in verbal learning performance compared with controls. Based on available evidence, some amelioration of verbal learning limitations presumed to result from cannabis appear to resolve between 7 and 28 days of sustained abstinence. However, in the reviewed studies, years of regular use were inversely related to longer periods of abstinence and verbal learning performance, undermining a confident inference that abstinence alone has direct benefits to verbal learning and memory.

The current study examined differences in hazard awareness learning between TBI survivors and noninjured control individuals matched for age and driving experience. Forty individuals equally divided among the 2 groups were assessed by exposure to repetitive video-based hazard scenarios, which have been shown to improve hazard awareness in noninjured individuals. Differences in participants' eye movements and behavioral response while watching video clips of genuine traffic scenes were recorded. Although survivors of TBI demonstrated relatively intact hazard awareness abilities under baseline conditions, they failed to learn from repetitive presentation of the same hazardous situation (i.e., they did not improve hazard detection) and thus failed to adjust their scanning and behavioral reaction (e.g., time to reaction, adapt of scanning behavior). Differences were more prominent for hidden hazards. Our results show impoverished anticipation abilities in driving simulation tasks performed in the subacute recovery phase after TBI and that differences in materialized hazards awareness are distinguishable between TBI survivors and noninjured drivers of similar age and driving experience.

We also sought to determine whether these relationships differ between individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and healthy adults. TBI participants (n = 28) and healthy adults (n = 29) matched for age, biological sex, and education, were tested on an emotion intensity rating and recognition task. Self-reported emotional and cognitive empathy questionnaires, together with a neuropsychological battery, were also completed. Participants with TBI reported reduced emotional and cognitive empathy. TBI participants also had reduced overall accuracy in recognizing emotion, specifically for happy and sad emotions, although they had no difficulty identifying the intensity or differentiating among emotional displays. Intensity labeling and sensitivity to differentiate among emotions positively correlated with emotional empathy for healthy adults but not for TBI participants. No facet of emotion recognition correlated with cognitive empathy for healthy adults or TBI participants. The ability to identify the intensity and differentiate among emotions is associated with emotional empathy. Although individuals with severe TBI may be able to differentiate emotions, they may be unable to utilize this information to share and understand the emotions of others, or vice versa.

The present study explores whether (a) RT mean or inconsistency reflects a more dispositional characteristic of an individual, particularly with increased cognitive impairment; (b) RT mean and inconsistency exhibit comparable patterns of change across a 4-year period; and (c) these rates of change differentially predict cognitive status. A sample of 304 adults (64-92 years) at baseline completed a choice RT task weekly for 4-5 weeks, repeating this protocol and a basic neuropsychological assessment annually for 4 years. Three cognitive status subgroups were identified at baseline and Year 4: healthy controls (HCs), as well as cognitively impaired-not-demented (CIND) status based upon single (CIND-S) and multiple (CIND-M) domains. RTI was disproportionately stable among cognitively compromised individuals at baseline, suggesting that increased RTI is a dispositional characteristic reflecting underlying changes in psychological process or neurological function. Notably, 4-year trajectories of change for RT mean versus RTI were dissociable; whereas the HC and CIND-S groups exhibited faster mean RTs over time, CIND-M individuals exhibited significant RTI increases. Multinomial logistic regressions demonstrated that greater RTI at baseline (OR = 2.58, p &lt; .01) and steeper 4-year increases (OR = 4.40, p &lt; .01) were linked to increased likelihood of CIND-M classification at Year 4, independent of age, education, chronic health conditions, and mean RT.

However, recent proposals suggest that a large discrepancy between these two abilities, defined as crystallized performance minus fluid performance, indicates heightened risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 266 cognitively healthy older adults, the present study tested linear and quadratic relationships between an ability discrepancy score and early AD neuropathology indexed via in vivo measures of beta-amyloid deposition and cortical thickness in AD-vulnerable regions. We also tested the extent that alternative forms of this ability discrepancy measure (e.g., subdomain discrepancies, verbal-visual discrepancies) and an episodic memory composite might also be sensitive markers of early AD pathology. An overall ability discrepancy was linearly and positively correlated with beta- amyloid. A quadratic relationship was found between the overall ability discrepancy score and cortical thickness such that a small positive correlation was found at lower discrepancy levels (fluid &gt; crystallized), but at higher discrepancy levels (crystallized &gt; fluid) a negative relationship was found (i.e., an inverted-U pattern). Similar patterns were found across each subdomain of cognition, but the effects were weaker than the overall ability discrepancy score. Importantly, inclusion of episodic memory (the gold standard) did not alter any of the effects, suggesting that an ability discrepancy confers unique predictiveness of AD biomarkers. These findings replicate previous findings and increase the confidence in their usefulness to predict AD biomarkers. Longitudinal validation is needed to clearly relate an ability discrepancy to specific stages of preclinical AD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

During the 2 RA episodes, results showed lacunar amnesia for autobiographical as well as nonautobiographical memories of the time period between the present and the past 15 years, with preserved anterograde memory. Moreover, her memories before this lost period were more accurate than those after the 2 RA episodes. During the 2 RA episodes, our patient experienced a \"transposition in the past\" phenomenon. Statistical analysis of the PET scan demonstrated a significant hypometabolism within the right hippocampus. The \"transposition in the past\" phenomenon illustrates the relationship between both episodic and autobiographical memories and the functioning of self, according to the SMS model.

One hundred forty-five HIV+ participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or an experimental group in which strategic processing was supported at encoding (i.e., implementation intentions and visualization), monitoring (i.e., content-free cuing), and\/or cue detection (i.e., auditory alarm).

Results also revealed a small within-subjects improvement in time-based PM in the encoding condition. Supporting strategic encoding and cue-detection processes in the laboratory can improve time-based PM deficits in older HIV+ adults, which may inform the development of more naturalistic PM-based interventions to enhance health behaviors.

Data indicated that AD patients rely on fluency in a similar extent than older adults as long as they demonstrate intact detection of differences in the perceptual quality of the items. Specifically, it appears that patients' ability to visually discriminate stimuli differing in terms of their perceptual quality is critical for patients to be able to implement strategies to appropriately use or correctly disqualify fluency during a recognition task. Overall, these findings suggest that the disruption of some basic cognitive processes could prevent AD patients to experience fluency in a similar extent than healthy controls.

Reversed language-dominance effects were intact in AD; both patients and controls produced many intrusions on dominant language targets, and relatively fewer intrusions on nondominant language targets. The opposite held for within-language errors, which were more common with nondominant than dominant targets. Patients produced the most intrusion errors with cognate switch words (which best distinguished patients from controls in ROC curves of all speech error types), while controls had equal difficulty switching on cognate and function word targets. Reversed language-dominance effects appear to illustrate automatic inhibitory control over the dominant language, but could instead reflect limited resources available for monitoring when completing a task in the nondominant language. The greater sensitivity of intrusion errors with cognate than with function word targets for distinguishing patients from controls implies that language control may be aided by relatively intact knowledge of grammatical constraints over code-switching in bilinguals with AD.

Two hundred eighty veterans with combat zone deployment histories completed semistructured clinical interviews to define BRC and NBRC histories, current and past mental health disorders, and dimensional ratings of PTSD symptomatology. Participants were also administered a number of neuropsychological measures to appraise cognitive functioning. A structural equation model (SEM) suggested that BRC and NBRC were not distinct in their prediction of cognitive performance, and there was no evidence that recurrent concussion (blast or nonblast) was directly associated with cognitive performance. BRC was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms (r = .24), PTSD symptoms were significantly associated with cognitive performance in the SEM (r = -.27), and PTSD symptoms significantly mediated the link between BRC and cognitive performance (p = .03). These results suggest that concussion history fails to directly contribute to cognitive performance, regardless of mechanism (blast or nonblast) and recurrence. BRC is nonetheless unique in its contribution to PTSD and PTSD-related cognitive deficits. Results support interventions specific to PTSD management in the interest of promoting neuropsychological functioning among war veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

We examined how the D-KEFS Tower, Verbal Fluency, Design Fluency, Color-Word Interference, and Trail Making Test tasks related to frontal lobe volumes, quantifying the regional specificity of EF components. Adults from the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS), an open-access community study of brain development, with complete MRI (3T scanner) and D-KEFS data were selected for analysis (N = 478; ages 20-85). In a mixed-effects model predicting volume, D-KEFS task, D-KEFS score, region of interest (ROI; 13 frontal, 1 occipital control), were entered as fixed effects with intercepts for participants as random effects. \"Unitary\" EF (aggregate of D-KEFS scores) was positively associated with superior frontal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral orbitofrontal volumes; a negative association was observed with frontal pole volume (| z-score slope | range = 0.040 to 0.051). \"Diverse\" EF skills (individual D-KEFS task scores) were differentially associated with two or three ROIs, respectively, but to a stronger extent (| z-score slope | range = 0.053 to 0.103). The neural correlates found for the D-KEFS support the prefrontal modularity of both unitary (aspects of EF ability common to all tasks) and diverse EF. Our findings contribute to emerging evidence that aggregate measurements of EF may serve broader but less robust frontal neural correlates than distinct EF skills.

The present study examined changes in the dynamic interaction between these attentional networks in healthy aging and in amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Healthy young adults, healthy older adults, and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were asked to identify as quickly as possible the color of a target stimulus that appeared within one of 2 peripheral boxes. Orienting was manipulated by a brief flashing of the same (valid cue) or opposite (invalid cue) box in which the target subsequently appeared. Alerting was manipulated by presenting an auditory white noise burst simultaneously with the visual orienting cue on half of the trials. All 3 groups displayed significant alerting and orienting effects but differed in the nature of the interaction between alerting and orienting. As expected, young adults displayed increased orienting under high alerting conditions through a selective enhancement of validly cued targets. While older adults displayed a greater effect of alerting on orienting compared to young adults, MCI patients did not display a significant interaction between attentional networks. Results provide support for the presence of increased compensatory interactions between attentional networks in healthy aging that may be no longer effective with the emergence of clinical symptoms in MCI. The demonstration of qualitatively distinct effects of healthy aging and MCI suggests that behavioral tests of attentional network interactions may serve as cognitive markers in individuals at increased risk for developing AD.

Whether it may serve to facilitate cognitive recovery and longer-term outcomes in persons with alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is unclear. Here, we review historical and current literature and offer perspectives for model development and potential implementation. We considered a large literature regarding the nature of alcohol-related compromise, early efforts to clarify the nature of recovery and current models and methods underlying cognitive training paradigms. We then constructed a narrative review demonstrating evolving frameworks and empirical data informing the critical review of cognitive training methods as a means of mitigating compromise and facilitating functional outcomes. Cognitive improvement with abstinence is generally noted, but training protocols may enhance performance and generalize benefit to untrained, but highly similar, tasks. Transfer of training to dissimilar tasks and functional outcomes is uncommonly reported. It is noteworthy that some work suggests that clinician ratings for participants are improved. Inconsistency in sample characteristics, training protocols, and outcome measures constrain general conclusions while suggesting opportunities for study and development. Cognitive training protocols have shown benefit in a variety of populations but have been examined infrequently in persons with AUDs. This overview indicates significant opportunity for cognitive improvement and recovery and thus a strong potential role for training protocols. However, supportive data are not robustly obtained. We suggest that one step in bridging this gap is the implementation of a conceptual framework incorporating contextual, behavioral, and neurobiological variables.

First is presented a review of emotional and social-cognitive impairments in recently detoxified AUD individuals that include alexithymia, difficulties in decoding others' emotions, and reduced theory of mind and empathy skills. Social cognition disorders in AUD pose different issues discussed, such as whether (1) these deficits are consequences of excessive alcohol consumption or premorbid risk factors for addiction, (2) emotional and social impairments impede positive treatment outcome, (3) recovery of social abilities is possible with sustained abstinence, and (4) AUD patients are unaware of their emotional and social dysfunctions. Finally, current knowledge on structural and functional brain correlates of these deficits in AUD are reviewed. Emotional and social-cognitive functions affected in AUD can potentially compromise efforts to initiate and maintain abstinence by hampering efficacy of clinical treatment. Such dysfunction can obstruct efforts to enable or reinstate higher-order abilities such as emotional self-regulation, motivation to change, success in interpersonal\/social interactions, and emotional insight and awareness of social dysfunctions (i.e., accurate metacognition). The present review highlights the need to account for emotional processing and social cognition in the evaluation and rehabilitation of alcohol-related neurocognitive disorders and to consider psychotherapeutic treatment involving remediation of emotional and social skills as implemented in psychiatric and neurological disorders.

This review seeks to describe neuroanatomical links and major mediating influences between AUD and chronic pain, in the service of identifying factors that predict the risk of chronic pain in precipitating or facilitating AUD. We review the neural bases of pain and the influence of AUD on processes involved in pain perception. We propose potential mechanisms involved in the development of chronic pain in AUD, and we consider implications for pain management in recovery from AUD. Pain is a multidimensional and subjective experience that, in its acute form, is essential for survival, but in chronic form, pain is a disorder that negatively impacts quality of life. Neural substrates involved in initiating and maintaining chronic pain include dysfunction in descending pain pathways and reward network circuitry. AUD involves preoccupation or craving, intoxication, withdrawal, and negative affect. Neural substrates of AUD involve widespread mesocorticolimbic and cerebrocerebellar networks. Both conditions involve dysfunction of extended reward and oversight circuitry, particularly prefrontal cortex. The interrelationship between chronic pain and AUD resides in the intersection of etiological influences, mental experiences, and neurobiological processes. Characterization of the connection between brain and behavioral abnormalities in AUD's precipitation of chronic pain-and vice versa-allows for early detection and treatment of patients at risk for developing either or both of these conditions and for preemptive interventional approaches to reduce the risk of consequent vulnerabilities and harm.

Peer-reviewed, original research articles that included a neuroimaging assessment of alcohol effects on subsequent cognitive or emotional processing in adolescent or young adult samples were searched (through November 2018) and summarized in the review. Cross-sectional studies provided early evidence of alcohol-related differences in neural processing across a number of cognitive domains. Longitudinal studies have identified neural abnormalities that predate drinking within most domains of cognitive functioning, while a few neural alterations have been observed within the domains of visual working memory, inhibitory control, reward processing, and cue-reactivity that appear to be related to the neurotoxic effect of alcohol use during adolescence. In contrast, neural correlates of emotion functioning appear to be relatively stable to the effects of alcohol. Larger prospective studies are greatly needed to disentangle premorbid factors from neural consequences associated with drinking, and to detect subsets of youth who may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol's effects on cognitive and emotional functioning.

","198":"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex, dynamic condition that waxes and wanes with unhealthy drinking episodes and varies in drinking patterns and effects on brain structure and function with age. Its excessive use renders chronically heavy drinkers vulnerable to direct alcohol toxicity and a variety of comorbidities attributable to nonalcohol drug misuse, viral infections, and accelerated or premature aging. AUD affects widespread brain systems, commonly, frontolimbic, frontostriatal, and frontocerebellar networks. Multimodal assessment using selective neuropsychological testing and whole-brain neuroimaging provides evidence for AUD-related specific brain structure-function relations established with double dissociations. Longitudinal study using noninvasive imaging provides evidence for brain structural and functional improvement with sustained sobriety and further decline with relapse. Functional imaging suggests the possibility that some alcoholics in recovery can compensate for impairment by invoking brain systems typically not used for a target task but that can enable normal-level performance. Evidence for AUD-aging interactions, indicative of accelerated aging, together with increasing alcohol consumption in middle-age and older adults, put aging drinkers at special risk for developing cognitive decline and possibly dementia.

","200":"Greater depressive symptoms are associated with cognitive decline in older adulthood, but it is not clear what underlying factors drive this association. One behavioral pathway through which depressive symptoms may negatively influence cognitive functioning is through activity engagement. Prior research has independently linked greater depressive symptoms to both lower leisure and physical activity and independently linked both lower leisure and physical activity to lower cognition. Therefore, depressive symptoms may negatively influence cognition by reducing engagement in beneficial leisure and\/or physical activities that help to maintain cognition. The current study examined associations between depressive symptoms, leisure activity, physical activity, and global cognitive functioning using longitudinal data from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (n = 5,458 older adults). A multilevel structural equation model estimated the between-person and within-person effects of depressive symptoms on global cognition through leisure and physical activity. Leisure activity, but not physical activity, mediated the association between depressive symptoms and global cognition between- and within-persons. When individuals reported high depressive symptoms, they also reported fewer leisure activities, which was associated with lower global cognition. These findings highlight behavioral pathways through which depressive symptoms may negatively influence cognitive functioning. Findings support the view that perhaps depressive symptoms act as a risk factor for cognitive impairment by reducing leisure activity engagement.

However, functional ability is most often evaluated in clinical settings where everyday compensation cannot be readily observed. The present study used a novel, real-world evaluation of everyday activities (prospective memory, household chores, complex IADLs, and planning tasks) to examine the impact of compensation. Fifty community dwelling older adults were recruited with cognitive status ranging from healthy to mildly impaired. Participants completed a battery of validated performance-based and cognitive tasks, an IADL questionnaire (also completed by an informant), and real-world activities carried out in their own homes. The real-world evaluation demonstrated adequate interrater reliability (intraclass coefficient = 0.92) and construct validity (r = 0.55). Compensation improved real-world task outcome on prospective memory and household chores tasks. Further, cognition emerged as a moderator between compensation and prospective memory task outcome. Participants' ratings on an IADL questionnaire were related to real-world and performance-based functioning whereas informants' ratings were related to performance-based tasks and cognition. Our results suggest that proxy measures of functional ability (i.e., performance-based, cognitive, and IADL questionnaire measures) do not fully capture the complexity of real-world performance for nondemented community dwelling older adults. Compensation appeared to improve prospective memory performance, particularly for individuals with average to low average cognitive abilities. A difference in IADL questionnaire ratings suggest that participants may be better able to judge their real-world performance than informants.

This study probes the characteristics of the dominant hemisphere by overloading cognitive processing via a novel dual-task paradigm. In 2 experiments, participants performed sets of motor and speech tasks under single-task and dual-task conditions. The sets of tasks differed as to the extent to which they relied on sequential processing, and we hypothesized that tasks more reliant on this type of processing would suffer a greater performance decrement under dual-task conditions. A reliable measure of hemispheric language dominance was obtained via functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) ultrasound. Speech production scores in the experimental set (i.e., sequential processing) were consistently impaired under dual-task conditions, a distinction that was not seen in the control set. Results of Experiment 2 confirm those of Experiment 1, whereby speech scores were most strongly impaired under dual-task conditions, especially in the experimental set. Motor performance suffered less than speech performance in dual-task conditions in both the experimental and control sets across both experiments. Data suggest that the common processing capacity for speech and fine motor praxis can be disrupted through a dual-task paradigm. This novel behavioral data supports theories of a motor-based gestural origin for language and indicates that speech production is more sensitive to the effects of increased processing requirements than are motor skills.

This study aimed to compare 3 common measures and assess their accuracy: the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF), Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate (OPIE-3), and what is commonly referred to as the Barona equation. We also sought to provide appropriate adjustment considering the Flynn effect. The sample consisted of a cross-section of 189 outpatient veterans receiving neuropsychological assessment including the TOPF and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th ed. (WAIS-IV). Paired sample t tests assessed differences between IQ models. Correlations for all models and actual WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) to establish which model best predicted variance in current IQ. Mean differences were evaluated to establish how closely the models approximated WAIS-IV FSIQ. The Barona equation estimated higher premorbid IQ than TOPF Simple Demographics Model; however, differences between the models were nonsignificant after a Flynn effect correction for the Barona equation (.23 IQ points per year). The OPIE-3 correlated with FSIQ but overestimated the FSIQ, demonstrating the Flynn effect. TOPF performance models (include word reading) characterized the variance of IQ scores best, but the Flynn-adjusted Barona equation had the smallest mean difference from the actual WAIS-IV FSIQ of any prediction model. Demographic models for premorbid IQ accurately estimate IQ in adult populations when normed on the test used to measure IQ, or when adjusted for the Flynn effect. A Flynn-corrected Barona score provided a more accurate estimation of WAIS-IV FSIQ than the TOPF or the OPIE-3. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

Their independence was studied using an auditory paradigm. Continuous EEG was recorded in 16 adults and event-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed in a new dichotic listening - Go\/Nogo task. Attention was directed either to the right dominant ear (forced-right blocks [FR]) or to the left ear (forced-left blocks [FL]). The Go\/Nogo task required a motor response only to the standard word played to the selected ear; the nonselected ear was simultaneously presented with the same word (Go condition) or with a deviant (Incongruent Go condition). In the Nogo condition, a deviant was presented to the selected ear while the standard was played to the nonselected ear. Effortful interference suppression was expected only in the FL blocks to override the automatic processing of distractors in the dominant ear. When no effortful interference suppression was necessary (FR blocks) in the Nogo condition, the N2 and P3 increase probably reflected two subcomponents of response inhibition (response restraint and response cancellation) and the P2 decrease probably reflected an early inhibitory mechanism (sensory gating). When effortful interference suppression was necessary (FL blocks), there was no Nogo-N2 (i.e., no response restraint). Interference suppression (Incongruent Go condition minus Go condition) also increased the N2 and P3, but did not modulate the P2. This new paradigm confirms the partial overlap between response inhibition and effortful interference suppression and points out specific features of their subcomponents.

Using a prospective observational design, 6-10 weeks after injury, we assessed 60 premorbidly healthy individuals, who were admitted to hospital after an mTBI. Participants were assessed with multidimensional and unitary pain questionnaires, as well as measures of cognition, complaint, anxiety and depression.

Thirty adults with TBI and 30 demographically matched healthy controls completed 2 feedback tasks while skin conductance and heart rate were recorded. In Feedback Task 1, participants assumed different emotional postures and rated how this made them feel. In Feedback Task 2, participants held a smile or frown while viewing neutral images and rated the pleasantness of each image.

However, we found reduced skin conductance responses to rapid facial manipulations and some evidence of altered physiological arousal to sad emotional postures in participants with TBI. Finally, there was no relationship between emotional empathy and facial feedback or physiological responsivity. We failed to replicate past research that demonstrated an impairment in the feedback effect in people with TBI. These normal subjective responses, though, were in the context of reduced psychophysiological responding to the posed expressions, suggesting that another mechanism can contribute to normal feedback effects after TBI.

We highlight the utility of an advanced statistical model in providing nuanced characterization of neurocognition in an adolescent population. We propose that partially ordered set (POSET) models are well suited to analyze polyfactorial tasks and identify distinct profiles of cognitive functioning. Two models were considered using POSET classification. The first modeled 5 distinct cognitive functions and allowed for multiple functions to contribute to task performance. The second simpler model involved only 2 broader-based functions without polyfactorial task specifications. Existing performance data from 745 adolescents aged 14-17 years were analyzed. Posterior probabilities of classification performance and the discriminatory properties of the estimated response distributions indicated how well the modeling approaches fit the data. The larger first model resulted in 8 profiles or states characterized by combinations of high or low functioning in 5 distinct functions. The simpler second model involved 2 broader-based functions that resulted in 4 states. Comparing model fit criteria, we believe that the finer-grained first model may better reflect the cognitive constructs associated with the tasks. Notably, POSET modeling did not always provide adequate classification of working memory because of the limited design of the Cognition Battery. We demonstrate that the use of POSET models is a feasible approach for detailed analysis of neurocognitive data that can extract information on cognitive functions, even when provided with limited task batteries.

The current study addressed these gaps in a large cohort of children and adults with SBM. White matter pathways and regional brain volumes of anterior and posterior attention networks were quantified through probabilistic tractography and automated segmentation, respectively. The Child Attention Network Test measured behavioral components of posterior and anterior attention networks. Sequential operations were associated with reduced orienting accuracy and smaller left superior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumes compared to simultaneous operations, controlling for a number of shunt revisions and age. Greater number of shunt revisions was associated with higher radial diffusivity values in the parietal tectocortical pathway. Older participants had greater accuracy and faster conflict resolution performance compared to younger participants, across operation type and number of shunt revisions.

Impulsivity was measured by errors of commission in a Go\/NoGo behavioral task, and aggression was measured through youth self-report using the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire. Head injury was assessed retrospectively using caregiver questionnaires at twin ages 14-15 years and self-reported at ages 19-20 years. Participants with a head injury in early childhood showed significant delay in the normative developmental decline of impulsivity relative to the noninjured by mid-adolescence (ages 14-15.) Moreover, earlier age at injury was related to a slower decrease in impulsivity and greater increase in reactive aggression scores. Finally, among discordant monozygotic twin pairs, the twin with a head injury experienced significantly less decline in impulsivity by ages 19-20 than the noninjured co-twin.

CRT was assessed with a 4 CRT task on a separate occasion. Data were analyzed using multiple regression (N range = 358-670). Greater volume of hyperintensities and more severe hyperintensities in frontal regions were associated with higher CRT IIV. White matter tract integrity, as assessed by both fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, showed the smallest effect sizes in associations with CRT IIV. Associations with hyperintensities were attenuated and no longer significant after controlling for M CRT. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that IIV was not incrementally predictive of white matter integrity over mean speed. This is in contrast to previous reports, and highlights the need for further study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

Patients with severe memory deficits and matched controls were presented with 3 forced-choice recognition tests. In each test, an external source of fluency was provided by manipulating the perceptual quality of the studied items during the test phase. The detectability of the perceptual manipulation varied in each test (i.e., a 10%, 20%, or 30% contrast reductions were given). The results indicated that all participants were able to rely on fluency when making recognition decisions as long as the perceptual manipulation remained unnoticed. It is interesting that our data also revealed that the level of contrast reduction at which the alternative source is detected differs between healthy controls and amnesic patients. Specifically, patients with amnesia appeared to disqualify fluency as a cue for memory even when the contrast reduction was moderate, whereas healthy participants disqualified fluency only when the contrast reduction was clearly visible. Overall, our results seem to suggest that the ability to use fluency is probably not impaired in amnesia but undergoes metacognitive changes resulting in the implementation of explicit or implicit strategies aiming at tracking alternative sources in order to reduce memory errors.

","220":"Patients who suffer from memory loss after an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) may also suffer from anosognosia, or unawareness of their memory loss. How we define and measure anosognosia can have critical implications for its study and clinical assessment. Commonly used measures often lack standardization and reliability checks for responses. Moreover, these methods rely heavily on cognitive abilities (e.g., language abilities) that are often affected after brain injury. The aim of this study is to elucidate how to best conceptualize and detect anosognosia for memory loss by introducing a new method of assessment, the Visual-Analogue Test for Anosognosia for memory impairment (VATAmem). A total of 51 patients (M = 61 years, M = 13 years of education) with memory difficulties after ABI were recruited from outpatient clinics. A total of 73 informants were also recruited (M = 51 years old, M = 13 years of education). Both patients and informants evaluated the severity of patients' everyday memory mistakes on the VATAmem, for prospective and retrospective memory deficits by using visual analogue scales, vignettes, and check questions to ensure reliability. A total of 30% of the patients were deemed unaware of their memory deficits. Patients were less aware of their prospective (29%) than their retrospective memory difficulties (18%). The new method of assessment provided by the VATAmem reduced possible false positives and enhanced reliability. We conclude that careful consideration of methodology is a key step to interpreting anosognosia findings within a theoretical framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

The secondary aim was to explore the relationship between ToM, social competence, epilepsy variables, and executive functioning (EF). Twenty-two children and adolescents (8-16 years old) with TLE and 22 typically developing controls completed two advanced behavioural tests of ToM (faux-pas, strange stories), measures of EF and verbal IQ. Parents completed questionnaires assessing ToM and social competence of their child. Epilepsy variables were obtained from treating neurologists and interviews with parents. Children and adolescents with TLE had significant impairments in cognitive and affective ToM, reduced social competence, and lower verbal IQ than controls. Although verbal IQ was reduced in the TLE group, it was not related to ToM or social functioning. ToM impairment (a single score encompassing cognitive and affective ToM) was significantly correlated with social competence problems in our TLE group. Longer duration of epilepsy was related to reduced ToM and social competence, while earlier onset of seizures was related to social competence problems only. Finally, EF was neither impaired nor related to ToM or social problems in children and adolescents with TLE. This study revealed marked ToM impairments and associated social difficulties in children and adolescents with TLE. The results support studies demonstrating similar impairments in children with other epilepsy subtypes and highlight the importance of detecting and treating ToM and social difficulties in this group.

While social engagement is often operationalized as social network size, social networks can vary not only in size, but also in composition. Previous work has found that having a greater proportion of family in a network is associated with worse socioemotional and cognitive outcomes compared to having a greater proportion of friends. In addition, social resources may differentially affect cognition in minority groups at higher risk of cognitive impairment. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine racial\/ethnic differences in the relationship between network characteristics and cognition. Ethnically and racially diverse older adults from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (n = 548, 60-93 years) were used. Multiple regressions were conducted to examine the effects of ethnicity\/race, size, composition, and their interaction on global cognition. Analyses revealed that networks with a greater proportion of friends were associated with better global cognition than networks with a greater proportion of family. Additionally, larger social network size was only associated with better global cognition among individuals who had a greater proportion of friends in their networks. Race further moderated this effect, as it was limited to African Americans. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of looking at both composition and size when examining the relationship between social network characteristics and global cognition. These findings suggest that friendships may be especially important and further suggest that social network characteristics and cognitive aging may be more strongly related among African Americans.

Participants completed the Wason task, a test of logical reasoning of conditional rules comprising precautionary rules, social-exchange rules, and legal social-exchange rules. Dependent variables were response accuracy and response time.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters global connectivity patterns secondary to both focal and diffuse damage, but little is known about how it impacts regional environments. We examined local PPC functioning in individuals with moderate-severe TBI and controls during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Eighteen individuals with moderate-severe TBI and 19 healthy controls underwent rs-fMRI and neurocognitive testing. Seed-based analyses characterized remote connectivity of PPC subregions. Voxelwise graph theoretical approaches were used to probe local PPC connectivity and modularity within and between groups, and to examine relationships between local functioning and cognition. Seed-based findings included increased connectivity from left and right hemispheric subregions to right-lateralized default mode and frontoparietal control networks in TBI compared to controls. Graph theoretical analyses revealed increased connection strength within right PPC relative to the contralateral region in TBI. Across groups, right PPC also showed decreased betweenness centrality compared with left PPC. Groups did not differ in the extent of modularity within left or right PPC, but there was less interindividual variability in modular structure within the TBI group. Right PPC modularity significantly predicted individual differences in cognitive performance. Our findings substantiate hyperconnectivity on both local and global levels after TBI and propose a special role for local right hemispheric functioning in supporting cognition independent of neurologic status. Hyperconnectivity does not appear to result from breakdown in local modular organization and may reflect shared responses to neurologic disruption among those with TBI.

Self-administered questionnaires were used for assessing fatigue, pain, depression, anxiety and subjective cognitive complaints (Everyday Memory Questionnaire [EMQ]). Also, neuropsychological tests, that is, Stroop I-IV, California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) learning and delay, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) Letter Number (L-N) Sequencing, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task were performed to examine whether these objective measures correlated with subjective complaints and were compared with normative data. There was a trend of association (p &lt; .05) between the unadjusted EMQ with Stroop IV (inhibition and shifting attention), the CVLT-II learning and delay (verbal learning and memory), and the WAIS-III L-N Sequencing (working memory), but none were statistically significant at the .001 level.

Although previous work has generally attempted to isolate the unique cognitive effects of common combat-related comorbidities, less work has been done to examine how these conditions co-occur, and whether unique cognitive signatures accompany certain clinical combinations. To address this gap, we examined how several deployment-related conditions were associated with performance on a well-validated measure of sustained attention (i.e., gradual onset continuous performance task [gradCPT]) and a battery of standard neuropsychological measures in 123 Veterans from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders. Initially, a Principal component analysis was conducted to investigate how comorbid conditions grouped together. Several sustained attention measures from the gradCPT were differentially associated with four unique combinations of trauma-related pathology. Specifically, a somatic component representing the combination of current pain, sleep disturbance, and mild traumatic brain injury was associated with a higher rate of failures of attentional engagement. On the other hand, a comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood disorder component (moodPTSD), as well as a substance use disorder component, were associated with higher rates of inhibitory control failures. Increased attentional instability was associated with moodPTSD as well as an anxiety disorder component. In contrast, the cognitive effects of deployment-related trauma were not observed on standard neuropsychological measures. These findings suggest that unique combinations of trauma-related pathology have dissociable effects on sustained attentional control. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

EMs were recorded in a father and his son (both diagnosed with CP) and controls (N = 2). In the identification tasks they watched personally familiar faces and distracters and responded by saying the names of the familiar faces or saying \"I don't know.\" Two discrimination tasks were added to distinguish the specificity of the EM pattern for the recognition tasks. In all tasks, faces were presented 1 by 1 until the response onset; thus, the EM pattern was not saturated by overexposure to the stimulus. The 1st fixation position was examined to localize the 1st area of the face attended to. The spatial-temporal fixation pattern was examined to evaluate the attention devoted to specific regions. Both family members were inaccurate and slower than controls in the identification but not the discrimination tasks. In all tasks, they made a number of fixations comparable to those of controls but showed longer fixation durations than controls did. In the identification tasks, they showed poor spatial-temporal distribution of fixations on the eyes and rare 1st fixations on the eyes. Consistent with the literature, both family members showed the typical reduced sampling of the eyes. Nevertheless, our protocol based on explicit verbal responses (which included EM only until response onset) showed that they did not increase the spatial sampling overall by making more fixations than controls did. Instead, they showed longer fixation durations across tasks; this was interpreted as a generalized problem with face processing in affording a more robust sampling of information.

Metacognitive accuracy was defined as participants' ability to correctly judge their item-by-item performance on an abstract reasoning task. Metacognitive values were calculated using the signal detection theory approach of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Large-scale subnetworks were created using Power's 264 Functional Atlas. The graph theory metric of network strength was calculated for six subsystem networks to measure functional connectivity. There were significant interactions between head injury status (TBI or HC) and internetwork connectivity between the anterior default mode network (DMN) and salience network on metacognitive accuracy (R2 = 0.13, p = .047) and between the posterior DMN and salience network on metacognitive accuracy (R2 = 0.15, p = .038). There was an interpretable interaction between head injury status and internetwork connectivity between the attention network and salience network on metacognitive accuracy (R2 = 0.13, p = .067). In all interactions, higher connectivity predicted better metacognitive accuracy in the TBI group, but this relationship was reversed for the HC group. Enhanced connectivity to both anterior and posterior regions within the DMN facilitates metacognitive accuracy postinjury.

Eighteen untreated adults with CMI, and 18 gender, age, and education matched healthy controls completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and standardized measures of pain, mood, and disability. Morphometric measurements of key neural and osseous elements were also obtained from structural brain magnetic resonance images, for correlation with symptom outcomes. CMI patients exhibited deficits in RBANS attention, immediate memory, delayed memory, and total score. After controlling for pain and associated affective disturbance, the significant group effect for RBANS attention remained. CMI patients also presented seven morphometric differences comprising the cerebellum and posterior cranial fossa compartment that differed from healthy controls, some of which were associated with self-reported pain and disability. Notably, group differences in tonsillar position were associated with self-reported pain, disability, and delayed memory. Adult CMI is associated with domain-specific cognitive change, detectable using a standard clinical instrument. The extent of cognitive impairment is independent of pain or affective symptomatology and may be related to the key pathognomonic feature of the condition.

The neuroimaging data were analyzed using whole brain, region of interest, and functional connectivity approaches. Results showed that approximate computation relative to exact computation elicited greater activation typically in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (orbital), middle temporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The brain regions overlapped with the general semantic network that also supports mathematical problem solving. In contrast, exact computation elicited greater activations in the left rolandic operculum and bilateral hippocampus. Functional connectivity analysis based on the psychophysiological interaction approach showed that approximate computation had stronger connectivity from the left intraparietal sulcus to the semantic areas. In contrast, exact computation had stronger connectivity from the left intraparietal sulcus to the phonological areas.

However, previous studies testing the presence of timing deficits have produced idiosyncratic results. This is in large part due to the underutilization of insights from basic timing research, and from the inherent difficulty that arises when a single index of performance (i.e., reaction time [RT] or accuracy) is used to index the health of what is essentially a multiple-component process. The current article utilizes a diffusion model approach to isolate the component processes involved in timing (i.e., internal clock speed, decision-making speed, speed\/accuracy trade-off strategies, and nondecision time) using a well-validated timing task. Fifty children with ADHD and 32 non-ADHD controls aged 8-12 completed a temporal bisection procedure. Diffusion model parameters indicated that both the internal clock and decision-making speeds were slower among children with ADHD. However, the strength of evidence for slowed decision making far outweighed evidence for a slower internal clock. Slower evidence accumulation during decision making is domain-general deficit in ADHD. Such slowing is consistent with adaptive-gain theories, which posit that a suboptimal ratio of neural signal-to-noise is characteristic of children with ADHD.

We examined whether a well-validated measure of sustained attention would be sensitive to vascular risk, as compared with more standard neuropsychological measures of attention and executive functioning. We assessed vascular risk factors (VRFs; blood pressure, waist circumference, cholesterol, glucose, and triglycerides) in 93 middle-to-older aged adults (45-75 years). MetS was defined based on current guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Training Program (NCEP ATP III). Participants were grouped according to number of VRFs: high risk (MetS; 3+ VRFs; N = 32), medium risk (1 or 2 VRFs; N = 35), and low risk (0 VRFs; N = 26). All participants underwent a neuropsychological battery of tests measuring executive functioning. Participants also performed the gradual-onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), a measure of sustained attention. There was a significant main effect of VRF group on sustained attention performance; participants with lower vascular risk were better able to sustain attention. No significant effects were detected on standard neuropsychological tests of executive function.

The sample included Hispanics and non-Hispanic European Americans. Across diagnostic groups, the most common type of intrusion error was actual targets presented from a competing word list under conditions eliciting proactive semantic interference (PSI), and retroactive semantic interference (RSI), followed by intrusions that represented one of three overlapping semantic categories but none of the targets from List A or B. Nonsemantic intrusions rarely occurred. These competing list intrusions (CLI) and semantically related intrusions (SRI) differentiated between aMCI and CN participants. Further, these intrusion error were related to brain amyloid load, indicating their importance as potential primary markers of AD-related neurodegeneration. Ethnicity effects were not seen across the types of intrusion errors. Two types of intrusion errors (CLI and SRI) showed differences between the CN and aMCI group, with the aMCI group evidencing a higher rate of these intrusion errors compared with the CN group.

Using the Emostroop task, we investigated whether adults with moderate to severe TBI (N = 26) have problems with rapid conceptual processing of emotional stimuli compared with controls (N = 30). Further, we investigated whether rapid conceptual processing of emotions relates to emotion recognition and emotional empathy. In the Emostroop task, participants categorize emotional words (e.g., joyous, furious, and woeful) into three emotion categories: happy, sad, and angry. Each word is superimposed onto an image of a face, which expresses an emotion that is congruent to the word (congruent condition), incongruent to the word (incongruent condition), or is neutral (neutral condition). Slowed responding in the incongruent condition (interference) and speeded responding in the congruent condition (facilitation) indicates rapid conceptual processing of the faces. Participants also completed an emotion perception task, an empathy questionnaire (the BEES) and neuropsychological tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and executive function. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that rapid conceptual processing of emotional faces was preserved in people with TBI, despite diminished neuropsychological performance, emotion recognition, emotional empathy, and slowed responding. Further, the Emostroop effect was not correlated with self-reported emotional empathy or with emotion recognition. We conclude that in people with TBI, reduced empathy may be explained by processes downstream of the initial rapid conceptual processing of emotional information, such as flexibly attending and responding to this information in a goal-directed manner in complex environments.

Blood perfusion data was correlated with the CDT (quantitative and qualitative scores) in order to evaluate their relationship and usefulness in predicting conversion to dementia. MCI patients displayed reduced rCBF in brain areas including the caudate nucleus; the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes; as well as the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The decrease in rCBF was higher for patients who later developed dementia.

Those with cognitive dysfunction also had worse functional outcomes, with mild but significant disability. In contrast, we found associations between outcome and age, traumatic brain injury, physiological and neural measures to be weak or not significant. Together, this suggests that premorbid abilities and trauma-related psychological symptoms contribute significantly to cognitive dysfunction in OEF\/OIF\/OND Veterans, and that neurological insult and aging may play less of a role.

A sample of 124 nondemented PD patients and 154 elderly controls was assessed with the Sniffin' Sticks Odor Identification Test (OIT) and the Subjective Olfactory Capability (SOC) domain of the Assessment of Self-Reported Olfactory Functioning and Olfaction-Related Quality of Life, additional to measures of depressive symptoms, verbal memory and executive functioning. Olfactory awareness groups were formed by means of the cut-offs of the OIT and the SOC. Significant correlations between the OIT and the SOC were moderate in participants with PD and small in controls. Of all PD patients, 52% overrated their sense of smell while 27% correctly identified themselves as being hyposmic, as opposed to corresponding 6% and 1% of healthy elderly. Overrating and aware of being hyposmic participants with PD showed worse executive functions than PD patients who were objectively and subjectively normosmic. The findings imply that, although people with PD are aware of hyposmia to some extent, the majority is affected by overestimation of the ability to smell, making self-reported functioning an unreliable source of information.

To identify early indicators of outcome, responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, and CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive assessment conducted 1 month postinjury were also extracted. Social cognition scores were compared to age-matched TASIT norms (N = 121). The mTBI group was significantly less able to interpret what people say and intend than norms, although the effect sizes were small (d = 0.43). There were 24.8% of people 4 years postmTBI and 9.9% of norms who experienced at least mild impairment in social inference. There were no significant differences between the mTBI group and norms for emotion evaluation. Poorer social inference 4 years after mTBI was significantly associated with lower cognitive flexibility and executive function (F = 2.57, df = 13,26, p = .02).

This study investigated this relationship in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty six AD participants and 28 control participants were asked to retrieve 2 autobiographical events. They were also administered measures of visual imagery (i.e., the taller\/wider task), and spatial imagery (i.e., the clock angles task). Analysis showed preserved autobiographical memory and visual imagery but compromised spatial imagery in AD. Significant correlations were observed between autobiographical memory and visual and spatial imagery in AD and control participants. However, autobiographical memory was predicted by visual but not by spatial imagery. The ability to retrieve (i.e., visual imagery) and manipulate mental images (i.e., spatial imagery) seems to be related with autobiographical recall in AD. In particular, visual imagery may contribute to autobiographical retrieval in AD participants by providing them with visual cues that increase the ease and speed of search through the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory.

We aimed to investigate whether egocentric and allocentric neglect are functionally dissociable and differ in prevalence and laterality in the early poststroke period. A consecutive sample of 366 acute stroke patients completed the Broken Hearts test from the Oxford Cognitive Screen. We evaluated the association between egocentric and allocentric neglect and contrasted the prevalence and severity of left-sided versus right-sided neglect. Clinically, we found a double dissociation between ego- and allocentric neglect, with 50% of the neglect patients showing only egocentric neglect and 25% only allocentric neglect. Left-sided egocentric neglect was more prevalent and more severe than was right-sided egocentric neglect, though right-sided neglect was still highly prevalent in the acute stroke sample (35%). Left-sided allocentric neglect was more severe but not more prevalent than was right-sided allocentric neglect. At 6 months, in a representative subsample of 160 patients, we found neglect recovery rates to be 81% and 74% for egocentric and allocentric neglect, respectively. Dissociable ego- and allocentric neglect symptoms support a heterogeneous account of visuospatial neglect, which was shown to be highly prevalent for both the left and the right hemifields.

Delineating the directionality of associations between CU and neurocognition has been restricted due to the relatively few longitudinal studies examining this question. As such, we examined whether decision-making prospectively predicted CU, and whether increases in CU were associated with changes in decision-making and episodic memory among a sample consisting predominantly of adolescent cannabis users. Adolescents (n = 401), aged 14-17 at baseline, completed 3 (biannual) assessments across a 1-year period. Latent growth curve analyses in structural equation models were conducted to examine potential associations between decision-making and growth in CU, and associations between change in CU and change in decision-making or episodic memory performance. Significant cross-sectional associations were observed between greater CU and poorer decision-making and episodic memory performance (p &lt; .05), consistent with our hypotheses and prior findings. However, decision-making performance did not predict change in CU frequency across 1 year. Neither was change in decision-making associated with changes in CU. However, increasing cannabis use was associated with worsening immediate (but not delayed) episodic memory. Our findings suggest that poorer decision-making does not put teens at relatively early stages of cannabis use at risk for further escalation in use over one year. However, increasing cannabis use over the same period was associated with declines in immediate memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

The SNP -1031T&gt;C in the TNF-alpha gene was genotyped in 905 patients and 571 healthy controls. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to assess the schizophrenia symptoms and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) for cognitive function. There was no significant difference in allele or genotype distribution of the SNP -1031T&gt;C between patients and controls (p = .85, p = .98). This polymorphism had no significant genotypic effect on the symptomatology assessed by the PANSS. Interestingly, this polymorphism was significantly correlated with onset age in schizophrenia patients (p = .004).

Baseline (1999 to 2002; n = 368; age range = 53-67years) and follow-up (2012 to 2014; n = 291; age range = 65-80years) measures of word-list and story recall were administered at least 10 years apart. Four samples were identified: conventional (derived from a cross-sectional sample), robust (derived from a longitudinal sample), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), and lost to follow-up. Area under the curve (AUC) values were generated to assess the diagnostic ability of conventional and robust norms using 1 standard deviation and 1.5 standard deviation cut-offs. There were differences between conventional Australian and American normative data for the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word-list recall. Individuals who declined to MCI\/AD over the follow-up displayed poorer performance at baseline, however no differences in classification ability of robust (AUC range .54 to.64) and conventional (AUC range .51 to .65) norms were observed. Neuropsychological performance in midlife predicted clinical cognitive decline 1 decade later, but conventional and robust norms was similarly predictive of conversion to disease in this cohort. The use of country-specific, representative conventional norms remains a valuable tool for neuropsychologists to assess cognitive performance throughout midlife.

The former supports a memory deficit mediated by attention\/executive dysfunctions, whereas the latter hypothesizes a hippocampal memory impairment in PD. We studied 31 controls and 34 PD patients classified as PD with normal cognition (PD-NC; n = 18) and PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n= 16). To test the retrieval deficit hypothesis, we measured the performance in encoding, retention, and recognition in verbal and visual domains; to test the associative deficit hypothesis, we used a specific associative binding measure. Using resting-state functional-MRI, we compared the functional connectivity of different hippocampal subfields between PD patients and controls, and we related it to memory performance. Consistently with the retrieval deficit hypothesis, PD-MCI, and PD-NC, were impaired in free recall encoding and retention in comparison to controls, especially in the visual domain. However, as predicted by the associative deficit hypothesis, PD-MCI and, to a lesser extent, PD-NC, showed also significant associative and binding deficits in cued recall. Notably, PD patients compared to controls did not show structural differences, although they had lower connectivity between the anterior hippocampi and the precuneus\/superior parietal cortex. Worse performance in memory was associated with a more severe disruption of the hippocampal connectivity. The pervasive pattern of memory impairment in PD supports both hypotheses. The interplay between the hippocampus, related to associative memory deficits, and the precuneus, related to attentional control, provides a neural signature that reconciles them.

To address this, the current study examined the longitudinal relationship between cognitive functioning and HRQoL among HIV+ individuals. The sample consisted of 1,306 HIV+ men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Participants received biannual assessments of cognitive functioning (including tests of processing speed, executive functioning, attention\/working memory, motor functioning, learning, and memory) and completed questionnaires assessing HRQoL and depression. Multilevel models were used to examine the longitudinal and cross-lagged relationship between HRQoL and cognition, independent of depression and HIV disease severity. There was a significant relationship between HRQoL and cognitive functioning both between and within subjects. Specifically, individuals who reported better HRQoL reported better cognitive functioning, and longitudinal change in cognition was positively related to change in HRQoL. There was a significant unidirectional-lagged relationship; cognition predicted HRQoL at subsequent visits, but HRQoL did not predict cognitive functioning at subsequent visits. Furthermore, analyses of severity of neurocognitive impairment revealed that transition to a more severe stage of cognitive impairment was associated with a decline in HRQoL. Overall, the current study suggests that changes in HRQoL are partially driven by changes in cognitive functioning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis investigating cue-reactivity functional MRI studies for different addictions. We explored 8 different addiction-related brain regions in 27 studies (29 samples) using homogeneity tests of effect sizes. An initial qualitative review failed to identify consistent activations in any brain region. We subsequently explored possible moderators related to either the addiction, participants, or study design, and found addiction type to be a relevant moderator, suggesting that different addictions may not necessarily involve the same brain regions. Successive quantitative analyses found that internet gaming addiction and heroin dependence modulated neural activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and heroin dependence further in the right orbitofrontal cortex. Our analyses also demonstrated the expected mean effect sizes in each region when conducting cue-reactivity experiments on addictions. It appears that distinct addiction types may manifest differently in the brain and may moderate cue reactivity to a greater extent than previously suggested factors.

However, these measures can confound differences in task-related processing efficiency with caution (i.e., preference for speed or accuracy). We examined whether computational models of decision-making allow these components to be isolated. Using data from two face-processing tasks (face recognition and egocentric eye-gaze discrimination), we explored whether adolescents with ASD and wide-ranging intellectual ability differed from an age and IQ matched comparison group on model parameters that are thought to represent processing efficiency, caution, and perceptual encoding\/motor output speed. We found evidence that autistic adolescents had lower processing efficiency and caution but did not differ from nonautistic adolescents in the time devoted to perceptual encoding\/motor output. These results were more consistent across tasks when we only analyzed participants with IQ above 85. Cross-task correlations suggested that processing efficiency and caution parameters were relatively stable across individuals and tasks. Furthermore, logistic classification with model parameters improved discrimination between individuals with and without ASD relative to classification using mean RT and accuracy. Finally, previous research has found that ADHD symptoms are associated with lower processing efficiency, and we observed a similar relationship in our sample, but only for autistic adolescents. Together, these results suggest that models of decision-making could provide both better discriminability between autistic and nonautistic individuals on cognitive tasks and also a more specific understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these differences.

We investigated which aspects of language are impaired in PD and what moderates these impairments. Our predictions were based on the declarative\/procedural model of language, which links grammar, including in regular inflection, to procedural memory and left-lateralized basal ganglia dopaminergic circuits but links lexical memory, including irregulars, to declarative memory. Because females tend to show declarative memory advantages as compared to males, the model predicts that females rely more on this system for regulars, which can be stored as chunks. We probed regular\/irregular Farsi past-tense production in 40 Farsi-speaking patients with moderate-to-severe nondemented PD (half female) and 40 normal controls (half female). Consistent with our predictions, we found that male, but not female, PD patients showed greater deficits at regular than irregular past-tense production. The females' impairment was mildest for regulars, likely from compensatory storage, as revealed by regular past-tense frequency effects only in females. Right-side hypokinesia (linked to left basal ganglia degeneration) correlated negatively with accuracy of regulars but not irregulars. Similarly, the levodopa equivalent dose of patients' last medication correlated only with regulars. The results suggest that language is impaired in PD, but the impairments are moderated by multiple factors, including the type of linguistic knowledge, the degree of left basal ganglia degeneration, dopamine, and sex. The findings underscore the impact of sex on the neurocognition of language and the roles of left basal ganglia dopaminergic circuits in aspects of rule-governed grammar.

Twenty-one children had small-vessel disease (AN_cPACNS), and 59 had large-vessel disease (including 49 nonprogressive [APNP_cPACNS] and 10 progressive [APP_cPACNS]). Neuroimaging revealed MRI abnormalities in 100% and 90% of children with large- and small-vessel vasculitis, respectively. The primary outcomes were Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) and the index scores from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III, WISC-IV, and WISC-V).

Here we investigated the neural substrates of topological map of the body in 23 brain-damaged patients, both from a topological and an hodological perspectives, using Voxel Lesion Symptom Mapping and atlas-based track-wise statistical analysis. Besides neuroimaging investigation, consisting of T1-weighted and FLAIR sequences, patients underwent the frontal body-evocation subtest (FBE) to assess the topological map of the body. The present results reveal a large-scale brain network involved in the topological map of the body assessed with FBE, encompassing both regions of primary elaboration and multisensory associative areas, in the temporal, parietal, frontal, and insular cortices. Hodological analysis revealed significant association between processing of the body topological map and the disconnection of the frontomarginal tract. These findings suggest that the topological map of the body is built up basing on both external and internal information that comes from the body and are constantly updated and integrated.

We searched three electronic databases for studies assessing the relationship between CR and performance in 6 cognitive domains or processes (verbal and spatial memory, attention, processing speed, verbal fluency, inhibitory control). The initial literature search yielded 1,452 articles; 245 full-texts were evaluated, and 18 studies were entered into the meta-analysis.

ES for the relationship between CR and cognition were significant (except for verbal fluency) and moderate. After applying specific techniques to reduce heterogeneity, the verbal fluency ES became significant. Metaregression analysis revealed that older age and female sex increased the ES for attention and verbal memory outcomes. High levels of CR were associated with better cognitive task performance in verbal and spatial memory, attention, processing speed, verbal fluency, and inhibitory control.

A PD task was administered to 117 patients and 88 healthy controls (HCs), along with a cognitive battery using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and relevant symptomatology scales.

Individuals with a diagnosis of BPAD or SCAD\/SCZ prefer smaller, more guaranteed rewards rather than larger, less likely rewards as compared with healthy controls (p = .002 and p = .034, respectively). There was no effect of performance on cognitive tasks, antipsychotic treatment, or symptomatology on the rate of probability discounting.

Forty-one studies (NADHD = 2,051; NTD = 2,766) provided sufficient information to calculate between-group effect sizes and were included in the current study. Results revealed moderate-magnitude planning deficits exhibited by children with ADHD, ranging from Hedge's g of 0.36 to 0.59. Analysis of latency metrics revealed small- to moderate-magnitude between-groups differences (Hedge's g ranging from -0.42 to 0.41), such that children with ADHD responded more quickly on planning tasks when compared with typically developing peers. Age, percentage of females, solution presentation (e.g., pictorial vs. physical display), and task complexity (beads vs. disks) were identified as statistically significant moderating variables across planning metrics. Although aggregated findings suggest that children with ADHD, compared with typically developing children, exhibit moderate planning deficits, researchers and clinicians are advised to consider our findings of significant participant and task moderating variables when interpreting children's performance on tower tasks.

Fifty-three HIV-seropositive patients and 62 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological testing (executive functions, attention, memory, learning, psychomotor speed, fluency) and volumetric MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry, ANCOVAs, machine learning, and multivariate regression were conducted to determine the between group differences in terms of relationship of HIV status, age, and their interaction on neurocognitive and structural brain measures. Volume and gray matter (GM) thickness of the caudate, parahippocampus, insula, and inferior frontal gyrus were smaller in seropositive subjects in comparison with healthy controls (HC).

Here we describe the case of a patient (GV) with a severe left neglect disorder as a consequence of a right hemisphere stroke. Eighteen weeks after the onset, he underwent a 10-week intensive neuropsychological rehabilitation program. Functional MRI (fMRI) during execution of a covert attention task, and a broad neuropsychological assessment were conducted before and after the training. The results show a significant improvement of the performance in neglect tasks after the rehabilitation program, although the remission of symptoms was not complete. fMRI data showed that the behavioral improvement was accompanied by an increase of activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and middle frontal gyrus bilaterally.

We used gaze-based measures and eye-tracking technology to minimize demands on the limited verbal and motor abilities associated with RTT. Shifting and disengaging attention were examined in 31 children (2-12 years) with Rett Syndrome (RTT) and 31 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls. Using the gap-overlap paradigm, the frequency and speed of shifting attention from a central to peripheral target were compared on Baseline trials, where the central stimulus disappears as the peripheral target appears, and Overlap trials, where the central stimulus remains, thus requiring disengagement. Our findings revealed that children with RTT had more \"sticky fixations\" (p &lt; .001). That is, they had fewer saccades to the peripheral target than TD children, and this was true on both baseline (77% vs. 95%), and overlap trials (63% vs. 90%). The younger children in the RTT group also had slower saccadic RTs (SRTs) than their TD counterparts (p = .04). Within the RTT group, SRTs correlated with symptom severity. Surprisingly, disengagement cost (the relative difference between gap and overlap SRTs) did not differ across groups.

The behavioral results (response time [RT] and error rate) showed that all age groups exhibited reliable conflict adaptation effect (CAE) to emotional stimuli, and conflict adaptation performance improved with age. A similar developmental pattern was observed when the ERP magnitudes of the CAE to emotional stimuli (N2 amplitude, N2 latency, and early P3 latency) were compared. Participants performed better on conflict adaptation to emotional S-S stimuli when compared with the S-R stimuli (RT-CAE, N2 amplitude-CAE and late P3 amplitude-CAE), and only children performed better conflict adaptation to emotional S-S stimuli than on S-R stimuli in terms of error rates. Children, adolescents, and young adults all presented reliable behavioral and electrophysiological conflict adaptation to emotional stimuli, and participants exhibited improved performance on conflict adaptation with age across the 3 age groups in emotional contexts. Moreover, all the age groups showed distinct cognitive control of emotional S-S and S-R conflict, and conflict adaptation to emotional S-S stimuli may mature earlier than S-R conflict.

This research was designed to clarify the nature of social and emotional cognition in AgCC with respect to imagination of the consequences of decisions by assessing responses from the Awareness of Consequences Scale (AOCS). Verbal AOCS responses from persons with AgCC and age and IQ-matched neurotypical controls were scored in the normal manner, and also subjected to semantic analyses using both latent semantic analysis and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. It was found that, relative to neurotypical controls, individuals with AgCC scored significantly lower on the typical scoring of the AOCS, had nontypical semantic content in their responses, and used fewer emotion and cognitive content (insight) words. These results were apparent in responses to the three most complex of the AOCS scenarios. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that persons with AgCC are deficient in the capacity to imagine the emotional and cognitive consequences of potential actions on others. particularly in the face of greater situational and social complexity.

Scores also increase linearly as a function of education but not in all countries. For example, a quadratic education effect was found for the fruits category in Bolivia, Honduras, and Paraguay. Sex had a significant impact on the M letter category fluency in Guatemala, fruits category in Guatemala and Peru, and occupations' category in Mexico.

","273":"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a well-established treatment that significantly improves the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients may nevertheless experience psychosocial maladjustment after surgery, as reported by an increasing body of research. Yet, no comprehensive theoretical approach has been proposed to account for this. Initially conceptualized for postsurgical epilepsy, the burden of normality (BoN) may be viewed as a model that is potentially applicable to psychosocial maladjustment after PD-DBS. We systematically examined the literature to verify this assumption by scrutinizing the 3 theoretical levels of the BoN, specifically, precursory conditions for the applicability of the model, clinical manifestations of psychosocial maladjustment, and 2 mediating variables: expectations and discarding the roles associated with the pretreatment condition. The applicability of the BoN to PD-DBS found support for the first 2 of these 3 levels in 88 scientific articles included in the review. The number of studies that addressed the mediating variables was nevertheless insufficient to draw any definitive conclusion. The degenerative condition of PD further limits the distinction between symptoms pertaining to psychosocial maladjustment and disease progression. Considering psychosocial maladjustment through the lens of the BoN is complementary to the traditional medical perspective of PD-DBS and illuminates the potential contribution of specialists from multiple disciplines in clinical rehabilitation.

","274":"Wernicke's area is a key component of the cortical language network, and it is functionally related to the comprehension of oral and written language. In addition to its main role in the perception of language, some other functions related to verbal learning also seem to involve the activity of this cortical region. It is unknown whether different degrees of neuromodulation on this area determine its effect on word learning. We aimed to analyze the influence of the application of anodal transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) over Wernicke's area at two different intensities on word learning. We compared the effect of anodal tDCS at an intensity of 0.5 mA and 1.5 mA with sham tDCS, separately in different groups, on performance in a word learning and recall task. The results show that 1.5 mA anodal tDCS improved performance. The number of words learned in this condition was higher compared with stimulation at 0.5 mA current strength and sham stimulation. Furthermore, stimulation with 1.5 mA specifically prevented the interference effect over word learning, compared to the other two tDCS conditions. These results show an intensity-dependent effect of anodal tDCS on verbal memory formation. These findings are discussed in the context of the various functions of Wernicke's area and the ability of tDCS to modulate the activity and functionality of this cortical area at different intensities.

Their assessment demands a high standardization of testing conditions, which is difficult to achieve across institutions. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) provide a solution. These virtual reality devices cover the entire visual field in a shielded way and thus keep visual stimulation constant. For neuropsychological assessment with HMDs, sufficient reliability is required. We have previously demonstrated that an early developer version of an HMD can be used to reliably measure components of visual processing capacity. However, it is unclear whether this also holds for the assessment of components of visual selective attention. Moreover, it has yet to be established whether now commercially available HMDs are capable of reliable neuropsychological assessment. We assessed the test-retest reliabilities of several components of visual selective attention and processing capacity of healthy subjects with the commercially available HTC Vive. Using an assessment procedure (combiTVA) derived from the theory of visual attention (TVA; Bundesen, 1990), we measured attentional selectivity, lateral bias, processing speed, visual working memory capacity, and the threshold of conscious perception. We compared the reliabilities of these components measured with the HTC Vive with those of a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, the gold standard of visual presentation in the laboratory. Both devices provided comparable reliabilities. Thus, HMDs fulfill the requirement to replace standard screens. With their inherent visual standardization and portability, they offer unprecedented opportunities for neuropsychological assessment, such as computerized bedside testing and comparisons of test values across institutions.

","276":"Previous studies have employed self-report measures to investigate emotion regulation (ER) strategy biases in individuals with anxiety. We investigated the neural signatures underlying ER strategy biases. Twenty individuals with high trait anxiety (HTA) and twenty individuals with low trait anxiety (LTA) completed both the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and ER tasks. During the tasks, participants were required to passively view, reappraise, and suppress expression while viewing negative images. Event-related potential (ERP) indexes: P2 (an early positive component of the latency around 200ms) and late positive potential (LPP) were adopted to examine the reliability of ER strategy bias in early and later stages during ER procedure. Results of the questionnaire indicated that trait anxiety level was positively correlated with habitual suppression use. ERP results revealed that, in LTA individuals, P2 amplitudes were reduced during both reappraisal and suppression strategy use. HTA individuals, however, showed no significant differences in P2 amplitudes between passive-view and regulation conditions. Furthermore, during the reappraisal block, a reduction of LPP was only observed in the LTA group, while HTA individuals showed a relatively more pronounced reduction in LPP during the application of the suppression strategy. Individuals in the HTA group do not demonstrate the application of effectively strategies during the initial stages of ER process, perhaps due to the presence of an automatic negative bias. While during the later stages of ER, HTA individuals demonstrated successful use of suppression but were deficient in voluntarily applying reappraisal techniques.

","277":"Stroke is often associated with increased difficulty engaging in specific future-directed thoughts and behaviors, such as generating phenomenological characteristics of future events (a component of episodic foresight) and executing directed preparatory behaviors (a component of prospective memory). The objective of this study was to clarify whether this group also exhibits increased difficulties using episodic foresight to appropriately guide future-directed behaviors. Stroke patients (n = 26) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 26) were administered a behavioral measure that met strict criteria for assessing episodic foresight. In keeping with our focus on the functional application of foresight, this measure required participants to identify a problem, self-generate a resolution, and execute the appropriate future-directed intention. Relative to controls, individuals who had suffered a stroke were less likely to acquire items that would later allow a problem to be solved and were also less likely to subsequently use these items to solve the problems. There were no group or task differences between left- and right-hemisphere-stroke subgroups. There were also no significant associations between our measure of episodic foresight with other cognitive measures or a measure of daily function. These data indicate that the capacity to apply episodic foresight in an adaptive way can be disrupted after stroke. Future work is now needed to more fully delineate the implications of difficulties engaging episodic foresight in everyday life as well as how these difficulties might be remediated.

However, JLO items show a left-right structural asymmetry that interacts with the ipsilesional attentional biases of brain-damaged patients, that is, the main target population for which the test is intended, and undermines the test's validity. Left hemisphere-damaged patients are favored by the way the stimulus lines are distributed in the original items, whereas right hemisphere-damaged patients are favored by the opposite distribution, obtained by mirror reversing the items (Treccani, Torri, &amp; Cubelli, 2005). Here we aimed to analyze the short forms of JLO available in the literature, which are often presented as preferable alternatives to the full form. Characteristics of the items of these short forms were scrutinized. By reanalyzing data from Treccani et al. (2005), we also investigated the impact of these characteristics on brain-damaged patients' performance. Seven of the 8 analyzed short forms proved to be even more asymmetric than the full form (e.g., they have a different number of left and right lines), whereas the remaining one, which uses a flexible item-selection criterion, leads to unpredictable results. Like in the full form, these asymmetries affect brain-damaged patients' performance. The presence of spatial asymmetries in JLO items cannot be neglected anymore in the development of any JLO form, given their impact on performance and the resulting detrimental effect on the accuracy and validity of the measurement. We propose to select 5-10 items among those of the original set and present them together with their mirror images to obtain a left-right balanced JLO short version.

","279":"Among patients with brain damage, executive function deficits and impulsivity correspond with propensity to engage in risky behaviors. Less research has addressed this issue in healthy adults, and fewer still have simultaneously evaluated the importance of executive function and impulsive personality. Additionally, most research has focused exclusively on substance use while ignoring other domains of risky behavior such as sexual activity and antisocial practices. Toward this end, we examined the association of risky behaviors with executive function and self-reported impulsivity. Healthy undergraduates (n = 56) were administered the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and UPPS-P impulsivity questionnaire. A self-report questionnaire assessed risky sexual activities, drug use, and antisocial behaviors over a 2-month interval. After accounting for social desirability and performance effort, multiple regression analyses revealed a robust relationship between executive function and risk-taking. Specifically, WCST performance correlated with risky sexual and substance use behavior, whereas the IGT was uniquely linked with antisocial acts. Trait impulsivity was positively associated with sexual behavior. Extending previous research, executive function accounted for more variance in risky behaviors than self-reported impulsivity, but this was mediated by facet of executive function. Decision-making under risk seemed to better account for antisocial acts, whereas perseveration was more strongly linked to sexual activity and substance misuse. These data imply that poor executive function increases the likelihood that healthy young adults will engage in risky and potentially dangerous acts, extending the ecological validity of the WCST and IGT.

Little is known, however, about whether the cognitive benefits of aerobic fitness are related to the modulation of top-down or bottom-up mechanisms in the control of executive attention. The present study aimed to shed light on this question by evaluating the phase-locking factor (PLF) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal during cognitive control. Higher fit and lower fit young adults performed a neuropsychological test of cognitive control (i.e., Stroop color-naming task) with concurrent EEG recording. In line with previous literature, behavioral results showed that higher fit individuals performed better on the Stroop task overall. Interestingly, beta phase synchronization was larger during the incongruent condition than the congruent condition for higher fit but not for lower fit individuals, suggesting a more effective use of top-down control in the former. However, no such effect was seen for gamma activity, indicating that bottom-up mechanisms are unlikely to account for the differences in performance explained by fitness levels. Altogether, these findings suggest that the greater cognitive control observed in higher fit individuals is associated with differences in the control of top-down rather than bottom-up processing, consistent with the hypothesis of selective improvement.

Since meningiomas do not directly damage the brain, this is presumably caused by a functional integrity reduction of the surrounding brain tissue through perilesional edema and\/or mass effect of the tumor. Tumor location is a key feature in determining neurological symptoms in brain tumor patients, but the relationship between meningioma location and cognitive performance remains unclear. This study aimed to identify brain areas where the presence of a meningioma forms a potential risk factor for worse cognitive performance as compared to meningiomas at other locations. Neuropsychological data (CNS Vital Signs) and MRI were collected in 224 meningioma patients one day before surgery. Sociodemographically corrected scores were calculated for 7 cognitive domains. Tumors were semiautomatically segmented and mapped into MNI-space for use in Statistical Region of Interest analyses. For each cognitive domain, we tested whether larger proportions of tumor overlap with each of the 150 defined regions were associated with worse performance. After multiple comparison (Bonferroni) and lesion volume correction, larger proportions of tumor overlap with both the left middle and superior frontal gyrus were associated with worse complex attention scores. Larger proportions of tumor overlap with the left middle frontal gyrus were associated with worse cognitive flexibility scores. For the other domains, no association between tumor overlap with a region and cognitive performance was found. The current results suggest that, compared to patients with a meningioma at other locations, patients with a meningioma at the left middle frontal gyrus are at potential risk for worse performance on cognitive flexibility and complex attention whereas patients with a meningioma at the left superior frontal gyrus are at potential risk for worse performance on complex attention.

We examined the relationship between cognitive and olfactory dysfunction in SZ+ and the clinical utility of these measures in the assessment of SZ+ patients. First-episode SZ+ patients (n = 63) and controls (n = 63) were administered tests of odor identification and discrimination in addition to measures of manual dexterity, processing speed, attention and working memory, executive functioning, ideational fluency, and memory. We analyzed the relationships between olfactory and cognitive variables and conducted stepwise multiple regressions to identify which cognitive indices best predicted olfactory performance within the SZ+ group. Linear discriminant analysis was used to identify which measures best distinguished cases from controls. Among patients, odor discrimination correlated with perseverative errors and odor identification correlated with bilateral manual dexterity. Odor discrimination performance was best predicted by perseverative errors and letter fluency, whereas odor identification ability was best predicted by manual dexterity. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that manual dexterity, letter-guided word fluency, and odor discrimination best distinguished SZ+ from healthy adults. These findings indicate that manual dexterity, letter-guided word fluency, and odor discrimination may provide incremental information that strengthens a diagnosis of SZ+. Although odor discrimination tasks have received limited attention in schizophrenia studies, the extant data along with the present results indicate that odor discrimination tasks may have utility over odor identification measures as a neurodevelopmental risk marker. Additional studies examining odor discrimination as a predictor of SZ spectrum illness are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

Slowed processing speed in HIV is a concern for cognitive and everyday functioning and is sensitive to declines in aging. We hypothesized that information processing (IP) deficits, over and above that expected with normal aging, would occur in older HIV patients similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with both conditions affecting frontostriatal pathways. Groups comprised 26 individuals with HIV infection, 29 with mild-to-moderate PD, and 21 healthy controls (C). Speed of IP was assessed with the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and the color naming condition of the Golden Stroop Task. The HIV group was impaired on speed of IP tasks compared with both the C and PD groups. Even after controlling for normal aging effects, older age in the HIV group correlated with IP slowing. Slower IP speed was associated with poorer general cognitive ability and more extrapyramidal motor signs in older HIV-infected individuals. The notable effects of impaired IP speed, over and above neurotypical age-related declines, indicate that older HIV-infected individuals may have an enhanced vulnerability for developing nonmotor and motor symptoms despite antiretroviral therapy. Assessing for oral IP speed may provide the unique opportunity to identify early signs of progressive clinical declines in HIV. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

Cognitive and physical correlates were also examined. Participants were 42 nondemented individuals with PD (24 PD-CN, 18 PD-MCI) and 42 age-matched healthy controls. Functional abilities were assessed through direct observation and self- and informant-report questionnaires. Participants were administered an activity-based memory paradigm that assessed prospective, content, and temporal order memory as well as a test of mobility. Compared to the PD-CN and healthy control groups, participants with PD-MCI performed significantly worse on directly observed everyday activities, self- and informant-reports of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and self-report of everyday activities requiring physical capacity. No significant differences were observed between PD-CN and healthy controls. Among participants with PD, content memory correlated with all of the functional outcome measures, temporal order memory correlated with self-reported IADLs, and physical mobility correlated with self-reported physical capacity and content memory. The results indicated that PD-MCI is associated with decreased ability to perform everyday activities. Reduced ability to correctly recall and sequence activities may contribute to lower functional abilities on IADLs, whereas noncognitive factors (i.e., mobility) may become more salient when the everyday task requires physical capacity.

Nonetheless, NVLD may be a distinct disorder that is differentially associated with the functioning and connectivity of the salience (SN) and default mode (DMN) networks that support social processing. Thus, we sought to assess and compare connectivity across these networks in children with NVLD, ASD, and typically developing children. Resting-state fMRI data were examined in 17 children with NVLD, 17 children with ASD selected from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), and 40 TD children (20 from ABIDE). Average DMN and SN functional connectivity and pairwise region-to-region connectivity were compared across groups. Associations with social impairment and IQ were assessed. Children with NVLD showed reduced connectivity between SN regions (anterior insula to anterior cingulate and to rostral prefrontal cortex [rPFC]), whereas children with ASD showed greater connectivity between SN regions (supramarginal gyrus to rPFC) relative to the other groups. Both clinical groups showed higher levels of parent-reported social problems, which related to altered SN connectivity in the NVLD group. No differences were detected in overall average connectivity within or between networks. The social deficits common across children with NVLD and ASD may derive from distinct alterations in connectivity within the SN. Such findings represent the first step toward identifying a neurobiological signature of NVLD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of training on the automaticity of gait and cognitive processing in PwPD and the allocation of attention between gait and a cognitive task. One-hundred PwPD were randomized to 10 weeks of challenging gait and balance training (including single and dual-task conditions) or to a control group (care as usual). Outcome measure was the absolute dual-task interference (difference between single- and dual-tasks) for gait and cognitive parameters. Differences between baseline and follow-up were compared between the groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess potential differences. Significance level was set to p = .05. The direction and magnitude of nonparametric effect sizes were used to investigate attention allocation. No significant between-groups differences were found regarding any gait parameter. The training group significantly improved the dual-task interference of the cognitive task. The direction of between-groups effect sizes indicated that the training group primarily allocated attention to the cognitive task, whereas the control group appeared to prioritize gait. The results indicate that challenging training can improve automaticity of cognitive processing during walking. This may have a beneficiary effect on the ability to ambulate safely in the community, thereby improving independence and the quality of life in this population.

Participants aged from 8 to 18 years performed a visuoconstructive and a visuospatial working memory task in which global-local processing styles were manipulated. The analysis of their visuospatial processing clearly distinguished between the neuropsychological profiles of the group with ASD without ID and the group with NLD: the latter performed less well than the former in all domains. The participants with ASD without ID had a more heterogeneous visuospatial profile, showing a diminished sensitivity to perceptual cohesiveness only in the visuoconstructive task. Examining different visuospatial domains and manipulating the cohesiveness of the stimuli might be useful for better discriminating between NLD and ASD without ID.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the directionality of the association between symptoms of anxiety and depression with cognitive performance in newly diagnosed patients with PD. Longitudinal data from 362 nondemented participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) were examined. Participants completed as many as five assessments of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and cognitive performance over a 4-year period. Bivariate dual change score models were fit to examine the dynamic association between level and change of anxiety and depressive symptoms with level and change in cognitive performance. Across all cognitive domains, worse performance was associated with subsequently higher state anxiety, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The reverse direction was not significant as higher state anxiety, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms were not associated with subsequent declines in cognitive performance. Poorer cognitive performance, across all cognitive domains, was a risk factor for increased symptoms of anxiety and depression a year later. No support was present for the alternative hypothesis that anxiety and depression are associated with subsequent cognitive decline. Clinical implications include the importance of psychoeducation, as well as assessing and monitoring anxiety and depression in patients with PD with poor cognitive performance.

All parts of OCS were translated by native Russian-speaking neuropsychologists. Russian-speaking stroke patients (N = 205) were assessed with the Rus-OCS. Their performance was compared with performance of 60 healthy Russian-speaking adults aged between the ages of 18 and 91 years. The performance of 15 stroke patients and 42 healthy adults were assessed with a parallel version within 7 days of first testing. Convergent validity of the Rus-OCS was established via correlations with comparable tasks. Performance of three stroke groups with different lesion lateralization (right, left, and bilateral) was compared on language and visual attention subtasks. Preliminary normative data based on 5th to 95th percentile were also reported. Measures of internal consistency and test-retest reliability ranged from acceptable to very good and estimates of convergent validity ranged from moderate to high. Sensitivity and specificity was found to range from .56 to 1 and from .73 to 1, respectively. Significant differences in performance between stroke and healthy groups on all subtasks confirmed the discriminative power of the Rus-OCS was good.

Computerized time-limited tasks are more sensitive than conventional paper-pencil tests in detecting these spatial attention deficits. However, their frequency in the acute stage of stroke, the neuroanatomical basis and functional relevance for patients' everyday life are unclear. A realistic visual search task is introduced, in which eye movements are recorded while the patient searches for paperclips among different everyday objects on a computer display. The \"desk task\" performance of 34 acute right-hemisphere stroke patients was compared to established paper-pencil tests for neglect and the Posner reaction time task, and finally correlated to structural brain lesions. Most of the patients, even those without clinical neglect signs and with normal paper-pencil test performance, exhibited a clear ipsilesional attention bias in the desk task. This bias was highly correlated to the left-right asymmetry in the Posner task and to neglect-related functional impairment scores. Lesion-symptom mapping revealed task-specific differences: deficits in the desk task were associated with lesions of the superior temporal gyrus, contralesional unawareness in the Posner task with ventral frontal cortex lesions and paper-pencil cancellation bias with damage to the inferior parietal lobe. Neglect behavior was further associated with distinct frontoparietal white matter tract disconnections (inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, arcuate). Results from the novel desk task indicate a functional relevance of spatial attention deficits in right-hemisphere stroke patients, even if they are \"subclinical.\" This should be considered especially in patients without obvious clinical neglect signs.

Scores were adjusted for sex, level of parental education, and family income. Although the correlations between the 2 executive function measures were moderate and consistent across age groups, their correlations with the other 5 cognitive measures were highest in the youngest age group and decreased across the older age groups. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that all NTCB measures loaded onto a single factor for the 3- to 6-year-olds. Across the older age groups, the executive function and processing speed measures loaded onto one factor, and the vocabulary knowledge, oral reading, and working memory measures loaded onto a second factor. These results indicate that younger children's performance on the NTCB is more intercorrelated and less differentiated, while performance on the NTCB executive function measures becomes more differentiated from performance on the other measures with development. These results support the hypothesis that executive functions become increasingly differentiated from other cognitive functions with development as the functional specialization of neural systems progresses throughout childhood and young adulthood.

Thirty-eight aphasic participants were examined twice. The response pattern was the same across the 2 presentations (response stability) for 36 participants, who were classified into 3 groups according to the prevailing error-type (lexical-semantic, phonological, or a balance between the two error-types): Their item-consistency was quantified with Cohen's kappa. In each case the roles played by lexical frequency, precocity of acquisition and length of the target word, and visual complexity and image agreement of the stimulus picture were examined; the ability to predict response accuracy of a model simultaneously including these 5 variables was quantified by means of the McFadden index. Finally, the relationship between predictability (McFadden index) and consistency (Cohen's kappa) was analyzed. For 34 of 36 participants, consistency was higher than chance. Consistency was directly correlated to the prevalence of lexical-semantic errors. On regression analysis, the relationship between consistency and predictability was significant. Response consistency reflects the existence of a clear difficulty gradient within the items of a battery.

","297":"The progressive loss of stored knowledge about word meanings in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) has been attributed to an amodal \"storage\" deficit of the semantic system. Performance consistency has been proposed to be a key characteristic of storage deficits but has not been examined in close detail and larger participant cohorts. We assessed whether 10 people with svPPA showed consistency in picture naming across 3 closely consecutive sessions. We examined item-by-item consistency of naming accuracy and specific error types, while controlling for the effects of word-related variables such as word frequency, familiarity, and age of acquisition. Participants were very consistent in their accurate and inaccurate responses over and above any effects of the word-related variables. Analyses of error types that compared consistency of semantic errors, correct responses, and other error types (e.g., phonologically related errors, unrelated errors) revealed lower consistency. Our findings support the assumption that semantic features constituting semantic representations of objects are progressively lost in people with svPPA and are therefore consistently unavailable during naming. Variability in the production of error types occurs when distinctive features of an object are lost, resulting in the selection of semantically or visually similar items or in the failure to select an item and a response omission.

","298":"Unawareness of neuropsychiatric symptoms appears to be common in Huntington's disease (HD), but the clinical correlates of unawareness are unclear. Identifying predictors of unawareness is important for improving diagnosis of neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment, specifically executive impairment, may be a potential important predictor of unawareness. The authors examined whether unawareness of neuropsychiatric symptoms is more common in early HD compared to premanifest HD, and whether executive task performance was associated with awareness, independent of demographic, motor or mood variables. One hundred thirty-two gene-positive participants (60 premanifest and 72 early diagnosed) from the multicenter TRACK-HD study were included. Participants and their informants completed self and informant versions of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, which measures executive dysfunction, apathy, and disinhibition symptoms. Awareness was measured as the discrepancy between self- and informant-reports across premanifest and early HD groups. Participants' executive task performance was then assessed as a predictor of unawareness across the whole group. Premanifest participants reported higher levels of executive dysfunction, apathy and disinhibition than their informants, whereas early HD participants reported less executive dysfunction and apathy than their informants, indicating that unawareness is more common after diagnosis. Impaired executive task performance was related to unawareness of executive dysfunction and apathy, independent of demographic, motor and mood variables. Executive impairment is a useful early predictor of unawareness of neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD. Clinicians should closely monitor HD patients with executive impairment for unawareness, and consider this when assessing neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD and providing education to patients and families.

","299":"Research has found that adults with hearing loss perform worse on cognitive testing than adults without hearing loss; however, heavy emphasis on tests involving auditory stimuli may overdiagnose cognitive impairment among individuals with hearing loss. This study compared visual- and auditory-verbal memory tests among adults with and without hearing loss. Forty-one adults with hearing loss (HL) and 41 age-matched adults with normal hearing (NH) completed a neuropsychological battery that included auditory and visual versions of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Testing-Revised (HVLT-R). A natural auditory condition presented HVLT-R stimuli at normal speaking volume. A crossed auditory condition presented HVLT-R stimuli to individuals with hearing loss with amplified acoustic intensity and to individuals with normal hearing under hearing loss simulation. Mixed-model ANOVA indicated significant group (HL vs. NH) by condition (visual, natural auditory, crossed auditory) interactions for HVLT-R performance, with large effect sizes. The HL group performed significantly worse than the NH group on the natural auditory version; however, the NH group performed significantly worse than the HL group on the crossed condition. The groups were equivalent on the visual condition and all other cognitive tests, showing small effect sizes. Moreover, for the HL group, visual HVLT-R correlated with other cognitive tests whereas auditory versions did not. Cognitively intact older adults with hearing loss appeared impaired on auditory-verbal memory assessment under typical administration conditions. Visual assessment of verbal memory showed evidence of superior validity and is a viable alternative method to assess memory function especially in older populations.

Increased intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive function may be an early marker of emerging neurocognitive disorder, which suggests that IIV may be a sensitive measure of neurologic compromise in HIV. In the current study, we hypothesize that increased IIV may predict impending morbidity, including future cognitive decline and death. In 708 HIV+ participants followed longitudinally for up to 14 years, we assessed the role of dispersion in forecasting death and cognitive decline. Incident neurocognitive impairment was predicted in a mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression model using age, gender, baseline mean cognitive functioning, CD4+, time followed, years of education, and dispersion at the previous visit. Death before the next visit was predicted in a binomial mixed-effects regression model using age, gender, baseline mean cognitive functioning, CD4+, time followed, years of education, and dispersion. Point-in-time dispersion and change in dispersion between visits predict future cognitive decline and death in HIV+ individuals. Individuals with greater dispersion at a visit or who had larger changes in dispersion between visits were more likely to demonstrate greater neurocognitive impairment at the subsequent visit. Greater IIV was also associated with an increased risk of death prior to the subsequent visit, even after controlling for HAND severity and global cognitive functioning. We conclude that the IIV in cognitive functioning may be more predictive of future disease consequence than mean level of cognitive functioning.

","301":"Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is related to poorer cognitive performance, but the neural underpinnings of this relation are not fully understood. This study examined whether SES-linked decrements in executive function were mediated by smaller dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) volumes. Given the literature demonstrating that SES-brain relations differ by race, we examined whether race moderated these mediations. Participants were 190 socioeconomically diverse, self-identified African American (AA) and White adults from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) SCAN study. Regional brain volumes were derived using T1-weighted MP-RAGE images. Adjusting for age and sex, moderated mediation analyses examined if the DLPFC mediated SES-executive function relations differently across racial groups. Executive function was measured using Trail Making Test part B (Trails B), Digit Span Backwards (DSB), and verbal fluency. Moderated mediation demonstrated that DLPFC volume significantly mediated the association between SES and Trails B in Whites (lower confidence interval [CI] = 0.01; upper CI = 0.07), but not in AAs (lower CI = -0.05; upper CI = 0.01). No mediations were found for DSB or verbal fluency, although SES was related to all tests. The DLPFC may be important in the association of SES and mental flexibility for White, but not AA adults. It is possible that the well-replicated advantages of high SES among Whites do not readily translate, on average, to AAs. These findings highlight the importance of brain volume for cognitive functioning, while adding to the literature on sociodemographic health disparities.

Previous electrophysiological studies on empathy in relation to psychopathic traits have focused mainly on empathy for pain; therefore, little is known about the electrophysiological correlates of empathy in aggressive situations that are particularly relevant for psychopathic meanness. We employed electroencephalography in a community sample (n = 70), the majority of whom had attained a higher level of education. All participants were screened for not having psychiatric conditions or criminal history. The P3 and late positive potential (LPP) event-related potentials and mu rhythm suppression were examined as indices of empathic processing during the observation of situations in which victims of aggression were depicted. As predicted, it was found that persons with elevated levels of psychopathic meanness scored lower on trait empathy and assigned higher positive valence to the aggression scenes. It is interesting that those scoring higher on meanness also scored higher on empathy for the perpetrator. In addition, it was found that psychopathic meanness was negatively related to LPP amplitudes following pictures of aggressive situations. No significant associations were found between meanness and the P3 or between meanness and mu suppression. This study was the first to assess the electrophysiological signature of empathy during the processing of pictures depicting aggressive situations and the relationships with psychopathic meanness. The outcomes highlight the need for more integrative approaches to further study the complex pattern of relationships between empathy and psychopathic meanness.

","303":"To characterize the hemispheric processing of metaphors in bilinguals compared with monolinguals and to determine the role of language proficiency in hemispheric lateralization. Fifty-seven English-dominant Spanish-English bilinguals and 57 English speaking monolinguals participated in a divided visual field study. The two groups performed a semantic judgment task with metaphorical, literal, and unrelated word pairs presented either to the right visual field\/left hemisphere or to the left visual field\/right hemisphere. Bilinguals processed metaphors more slowly and less accurately than monolinguals in both visual field presentations but there was no difference between the groups in the symmetry of processing-both groups showed a left hemisphere advantage. In bilinguals, the efficiency of processing within the left, but not the right, hemisphere was predicted by language dominance scores (i.e., English minus Spanish picture naming scores). Additionally, in all participants, the left hemisphere was more sensitive than the right hemisphere to metaphor familiarity; the latter in turn was sensitive to metaphor familiarity only in balanced bilinguals (not in unbalanced bilinguals and monolinguals). These results suggest that even though bilinguals are less efficient, they rely on the same underlying cognitive mechanisms as monolinguals in linguistic processing of metaphors. Moreover, whereas the right hemisphere is coarsely affected by language proficiency, the left hemisphere, and metaphor processing therein, is more sensitive to small variations in linguistic experience.

Thirty-two children were assigned to either the higher PA group (HP) (n = 16) or lower PA group (LP) (n = 16) based on their amount of PA as measured by an accelerometer. Working memory was measured by the delayed-matching test, with concurrent recordings of event-related potentials including the P3 and the positive slow wave (PSW) components. Data analysis controlling for the effects of potential confounders found that the HP group had higher response accuracy in both task conditions relative to the LP group. For reaction times (RT), the HP group showed shorter RT than the LP group in the delayed condition. Furthermore, the HP group had similar P3 amplitudes across task conditions, whereas amplitudes in the delayed condition were smaller than that in the non-delayed condition in the LP group. In addition, the HP group also showed larger PSW amplitudes than the LP group. Supplementary partial correlations analysis indicated negative correlations between levels of PA with RT in both task conditions, and positive correlations with P3 amplitude and PSW amplitude in the delayed condition. Children with higher levels of PA, while controlling for individual differences in intelligence and fitness-related factors, have better working memory as assessed by both behavioral and neuroelectric measures.

A 2001-2003 birth cohort of 145 extremely preterm\/extremely low birth weight (EPT\/ELBW) children from a single medical center, along with 111 normal birth weight (NBW) classmate controls, were recruited during their first year in kindergarten and followed annually across the next 2 years in school. Mixed model analysis was conducted to compare the groups on growth in achievement across years and examine kindergarten neuropsychological skills as predictors of growth. The EPT\/ELBW group scored significantly below NBW controls on all achievement tests across years and had higher rates of special education placement and grade repetition. Despite limited catch-up of the EPT\/ELBW group to the NBW controls in spelling, group differences were generally stable. Differences in spelling and mathematics achievement remained significant when controlling for global intelligence or excluding children who had intellectual or neurosensory impairments or repeated a grade. Higher scores on kindergarten tests of multiple neuropsychological ability domains predicted higher achievement levels and steeper growth in achievement. The findings document persistent academic weaknesses in EPT\/ELBW children across the early school years. Results point to the need for preschool interventions to enhance academic readiness and suggest that neuropsychological skills assessed in kindergarten are useful in identifying individual differences in early learning progress.

To date, the specific effects of cognitive rehabilitation (CR), cognitive training (CT), and cognitive stimulation [CS] have not been analyzed due to inconsistencies in the use of the comparison groups. This work aims to analyze the differential effects of CFIs by removing the influence of the comparison group from the estimates of the effects. a literature search performed in Pubmed, Proquest, and Embase databases yielded 65 potential studies, of which 33 studies with a sample size of 1,225 individuals were meta-analyzed. Each intervention group was treated as the unit of analysis to remove the confounding effects of the comparison condition. Measures of general cognitive functioning, memory and functional outcomes were compared using the hierarchical robust variance estimator metaregression. Age, education, sex, risk of bias, sample size, duration of intervention, the proportion of drop-outs, pharmacological treatment, and severity of disease were included as covariates. Only CT differed from no cognition-focused interventions (NCFI) for memory outcomes in univariate analyses, but differences became nonsignificant when covariates were included in the model. CR showed a significantly higher effect in outcomes measuring functioning in targeted domains with no differences in standard cognitive tests relative to NCFI. This work supports previous findings questioning the efficacy of CT or CS for AD. Moving toward CFIs focused on relevant goals and including measures related to the skills, abilities or activities that are the focus of the intervention is encouraged.

It is not clear, however, if this defect must be considered as a form of associative prosopagnosia, or as a multimodal (face and voice) people recognition disorder, because voice recognition is rarely examined in these patients. The most appropriate manner of solving this problem could consist in evaluating, in one or more patients with right ATL lesions, recognition disorders through face and voice of the same well known people. The 'Famous People Recognition Battery' (FPRB), in which the same 40 persons (very well-known at the national level) should be identified through face and voice recognition, was used to clarify this issue. The FPRB was administered to a 56-year-old woman (BM) who complained, as early sign of a fronto-temporal degeneration, of familiar people recognition defects in a context of relatively intact cognitive functions. On the FPRB, BM showed a severe defect of people recognition (familiarity judgement) and identification through face and voice, but not through personal name. Voxel-based morphometry showed a focal atrophy of the right ATL (temporo-polar cortex and anterior parts of perirhinal and entorhinal cortices). the present case report seems to show that a unilateral right ATL atrophy can lead to a multimodal people recognition disorder through face and voice, in the absence of recognition difficulties through personal name.

A total of 582 cognitively healthy older adults enrolled in a longitudinal aging study completed the Uniform Data Set (UDS) neuropsychological battery (n = 374) or the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; n = 208) and were asked to wear a pedometer for 1 week. Bivariate correlations revealed associations between average daily steps and attention, executive functioning, language, and memory on one or both cognitive batteries. Multiple regression analyses controlling for demographic, health, and mobility variables demonstrated a significant relationship between average daily steps and the executive functioning composite of the UDS battery and average daily steps and the attention index of the RBANS battery. Both of these composites include measures of processing speed and, therefore, the most robust link between daily steps and cognition may be its association with processing speed. Step counts as measured by a pedometer, a simple and inexpensive measure of daily physical activity, are robustly associated with aspects of cognition. As pedometer-based interventions have shown success in increasing daily physical activity in older adults, a greater number of future studies should consider measuring cognitive outcomes of these interventions.

Some studies show a gradient, implying better access to more remote autobiographical memories, whereas others do not. These conflicting results likely reflect differences in the test methodologies, accentuating the need for replications and extensions. Forty-five older adults diagnosed with AD (via Mini-Mental State Examination, M = 19.89, SD = 4.05) and a matched sample of 44 healthy older adults were assessed on two different autobiographical memory measures: the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, Wilson, &amp; Baddeley, 1990) and the Galton-Crovitz task (word and object cueing) to examine the temporal distribution of personal autobiographical memories across the life span. The impairment of episodic and personal semantic remembering, as indexed by the Autobiographical Memory Interview, was associated with a negative temporal gradient with better preservation of memories from the remote past, relative to the recent one. The results from the word- and object-cueing task replicated the finding that AD is associated with markedly impaired recall of recent events. In addition, both groups showed a peak in the recollection of events from middle childhood and adolescence, consistent with research on the reminiscence bump. Older adults diagnosed with AD demonstrate increased recollection of personal semantic and episodic events from the remote past relative to the recent one.

Amusic and matched control participants were studied for emotion recognition and emotion intensity ratings of both musical excerpts and faces. Emotion recognition was found to be impaired in amusic participants relative to controls for the musical stimuli only. This impairment suggests that perceptual deficits in music processing reduce amusics' access to a verbal and conscious representation of musical emotions. Nevertheless, amusics' performance for emotion recognition was above chance level, and multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses revealed that their categorization of musical pieces was based on similar representation spaces of emotions as for control participants. The emotion intensity ratings, nonverbal and possibly more implicit than the categorization task, seemed to be intact in amusic participants. These findings reveal that pitch deficits can hinder the recognition of emotions conveyed by musical pieces, while also highlighting the (at least partial) dissociation between emotion recognition and emotion intensity evaluation. Our study thus sheds light on the complex interactions between perceptual and emotional networks in the brain, by showing that impaired central auditory processing partially alters musical emotion processing.

Persons (n = 1,862) from a geographically defined community without dementia at enrollment subsequently underwent clinical classification (248 with dementia, 611 with mild cognitive impairment, 1,003 with no cognitive impairment), memory testing, and self-appraisal of memory. Memory performance was regressed on self-appraised memory, and the residuals served as an index of memory awareness. After clinical classification, participants completed brief cognitive testing at 3-year intervals for up to 15 years. When unawareness was defined as a score at or below thresholds ranging from the 15th to 25th percentiles, it was more common in dementia (67%-83%) and mild cognitive impairment (15%-33%) than in no cognitive impairment (2%-6%; all p &lt; .001).

Higher premorbid neuroticism was associated with better memory awareness in dementia. Higher memory awareness was not related to mortality in mild cognitive impairment or dementia but had a marginal association with slower cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment.

In this study, healthy participants were trained to self-regulate the activation of their NAcc, a brain region that plays an important role in motivation, using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback. The experimental group (N = 19) received feedback from the NAcc, whereas the control group (N = 5) received \"sham\" feedback from the posterior parahippocampal gyrus, a control brain region not normally related to motivation. All participants were trained to use mental strategies to regulate their NAcc activations in a 3T MRI scanner. For the learning effect of NAcc regulation, we found that the majority of participants (74%) in the experimental group successfully learned to self-regulate the NAcc. They also showed improved behavioral performance in motivation and decreased functional connectivity between the NAcc and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and an increase in small-world properties in the reward circuit after training, indicating improved information integration in reward processing. However, improvement in motivation and modification of function connectivity were not observed in the sham control group and the participants who failed to self-regulate the NAcc in the experimental group. Self-regulation was influenced by the baseline motivation. These findings suggest that the NAcc could be self-regulated using real-time fMRI neurofeedback and can result in improved motivation in cognitive tasks.

In this study, we assessed the effects of an interruption on the performance of older individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) completing everyday tasks in a naturalistic apartment setting. Thirty-two persons with MCI and 64 cognitively healthy older adults (HOA) completed two different sets of everyday activities, of which one received an interruption. Participants also completed tests assessing cognitive constructs thought to be important in interruption recovery including retrospective memory, prospective memory, planning, working memory, and executive function. As a consequence of an interruption, participants with MCI took longer to complete primary task demands and made more substitution errors, but did not make more omission errors. In contrast, an interruption led HOAs to make more omission errors, but their time on task was not affected. Results from a hierarchical linear regression suggest that the ecologically valid interruption task time was more predictive of everyday functional status than the traditional neuropsychological measures. Results suggest that a brief task interruption taxed cognitive resources of both MCI and HOA groups, but was more detrimental to MCI in terms of time on task and total errors committed. Participant groups appeared to use a speed-accuracy trade-off to mitigate negative effects, where HOAs emphasized speed and MCI participants focused on accuracy. Amount of cognitive engagement\/disengagement was also theorized to have played a role, where MCI may have maintained information online throughout the interruption, and HOAs disengaged and reengaged resulting in worse reactivation of goals. Although MCI held onto task goals, their execution of details was imperfect over the interruption delay resulting in substitution errors likely due to further taxed executive abilities.

Participants were 669 adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (aged 18-30 years at baseline, 52% female, 38% Black). We calculated scores reflecting occupational cognitive complexity using Census Occupation Codes (years 10 and 15) and Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data. At year 25, participants had structural brain magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and cognitive testing (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Stroop). In adjusted mixed models, we examined associations between occupational cognitive complexity during early to midadulthood and midlife brain structure, specifically gray matter volume and white matter fractional anisotropy, and cognition in midlife (all outcomes converted to z-scores). Higher occupational cognitive complexity was associated with greater white matter fractional anisotropy (estimate = 0.10, p = .01) but not gray matter volume. Higher occupational cognitive complexity was associated with better Digit Symbol Substitution Test (estimate = 0.13, p &lt; .001) and Stroop (estimate = 0.09, p = .01) performance but not Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test performance.

This study attempted to learn whether the allocation of focal attention to a line segment is distracted by global attention allocated to the entire line and whether there are right-left distraction asymmetries when allocating focal or global attention. Twenty-four healthy adults (12 &gt; 65 years old) attempted to bisect horizontal lines composed of 2 segments of unequal length, with the larger segment placed to the right or left. They were also asked to bisect the longer segment of these lines. When allocating focal attention to the larger segment, healthy participants were more distracted when the smaller segment was on the left than on the right. In contrast, when attempting to allocate global attention to the entire line, participants were more distracted when the larger segment was on the right side. There were no significant differences between older and younger participants. The asymmetrical global distraction during segment bisection might be related to the right hemisphere's dominance in mediating global attention and allocating attention leftward. In contrast, the asymmetrical focal distraction during full-line bisection might be related to the left hemisphere's dominance in mediating focal attention and allocating attention toward the right.

However, because of its multimodal nature, no single test can capture all the signs of SN. To provide a clinically feasible solution, we used conventional neuropsychological tests as well as the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) via the Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process (KF-NAP). The goal was to add evidence that a global approach should detect better even subtle signs of SN. Fourteen individuals with lesions located in the right cerebral hemisphere participated in the study. Participants were assessed with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, comprising a set of visuospatial tests to evaluate several spatial domains. In addition, patients underwent functional assessment with the Barthel Index, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and the CBS via KF-NAP. The CBS via KF-NAP was associated with the visuospatial paper-based tests (p = .004) as well as the Motor FIM (p = .003), and was more sensitive than the Behavioral Inattention Test-Conventional in detecting SN (p = .014). We showed that the CBS via KF-NAP was able: (a) to detect functional impairment, especially motor, related to SN; (b) to selectively measures spatial rather than nonspatial dysfunctions; and (c) to be highly sensitive in detecting SN signs especially in those patients with mild severity, covering several aspects of SN manifestations. The patient's SN diagnosis based on the CBS via KF-NAP is clinically important and directly relevant to care planning and goal setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved).

This study aimed to evaluate memory skills in school-age children who were exposed to AEDs prenatally. The sample comprised of 105 children aged 6 to 8 years. Information on AED exposure, maternal epilepsy, pregnancy, and medical history was prospectively obtained. Children completed a neuropsychological assessment including measures of verbal and nonverbal memory. Children exposed to VPA performed lower than expected on list learning, story recall, and figure recall tasks. Those exposed to VPA in a polytherapy regime achieved poorer verbal memory scores compared with other drug exposure groups. VPA dose was negatively correlated with both verbal and nonverbal memory measures. Language ability predicted performance on all verbal memory measures and VPA dose was an additional predictor of retroactive interference on the list learning task. Performance on figure recall was predicted by exposure to VPA in polytherapy. Children exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ) also showed a higher rate of impairment on nonverbal memory measures. Both verbal and nonverbal memory skills are at risk in children exposed prenatally to VPA, particularly in those exposed to higher VPA doses. There may also be a selective vulnerability of the medial temporal lobe to VPA exposure. Our data highlight the possibility that nonverbal memory may also be affected in children exposed to CBZ. These findings have significant implications for the provision of cognitive and educational strategies to children exposed to AEDs in utero.

This study also used virtual reality (VR) as a proxy to measure transfer in a real life related context. Sixty participants (30 older and 30 younger adults) were randomized to either: (a) single-task training (two tasks practiced in focused attention; visual detection and alphanumeric equation task); or (b) divided attention variable-priority training (varying the amount of attention to put on each task when performed concurrently). Training effects were assessed at pre- and post-training with tasks similar to the one used in training. Transfer was measured with the virtual car ride, an immersive dual-task scenario and a self-reported questionnaire. In older adults, variable-priority improved attentional control abilities and led to better transfer in the VR dual-task scenario compared with single-task. Younger adults benefited equally from the two types of training and transfer was found on the Alpha span task when performed concurrently in VR. Single-task improved the ability of all participants to carry out the tasks in the focused attention condition. No transfer effects were found on the self-reported measure for either training type or age. Attention remains plastic in old age and programs designed to improve attentional control might be beneficial to older adults. Importantly, training can produce transfer to more real life related tasks and transfer remains possible throughout the life span.

Thirty-nine children and adolescents (20 survivors of moderate-severe TBI and 19 healthy controls) completed (i) a newly developed time-based prospective memory task (TBPMT), embedded in an ongoing lexical-decision task, with two conditions: low and high working memory load; and (ii) tests of working memory components from the Automated Working Memory Assessment. Compared to controls, participants with TBI had significantly lower prospective memory accuracy on the TBPMT across working memory loads (low, high). In contrast, the groups did not differ in time monitoring or accuracy on the ongoing task. In the TBI group, higher scores on tests of the central executive (but not phonological loop or visuospatial sketchpad) were associated with higher prospective memory accuracy and time monitoring (controlling for age). Time-based prospective memory is impaired following moderate-severe pediatric TBI, irrespective of the level of working memory demand.

(PsycINFO Database Record ","320":"A critical barrier to the understanding of disruptions to cognitive flexibility following sports-related concussion is the use of assessments that conflate shifts of visuospatial attention and contextual rules. Because these dissociable forms of cognitive flexibility are subserved by distinct neural networks, the utility of a cognitive flexibility assessment following concussion may be reduced, depending upon the extent to which the task requires shifting visuospatial attention relative to shifting contextual rules. Accordingly, the current investigation examined the extent to which these aspects of cognitive flexibility exhibit differential trajectories of recovery following a sports-related concussion. Twenty-two athletes with sports-related concussions were assessed on a cognitive flexibility task with 2 switch conditions (i.e., perceptual-based and contextual rule-based) within 72 hr of injury, after return to play, and within 1 month following return to play. Thirty-three healthy control athletes were tested at the same intervals. Findings revealed that concussed athletes demonstrated protracted disruptions in task performance on a visuospatial attention-based cognitive flexibility task relative to healthy controls, whereas disruptions in task performance on a contextual rule-based cognitive flexibility task resolved after the acute phase of injury. These findings suggest that dissociable forms of cognitive flexibility exhibit differential trajectories of recovery. Therefore, evaluations detecting sports-related concussion disruptions in cognitive flexibility may be reduced depending on the extent to which they rely on contextual rule-based decisions.

The present study tested the spontaneous retrieval deficit hypothesis, which predicts that people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), who are at increased risk of developing AD, are particularly impaired on tasks that rely on spontaneous retrieval processes. Twenty-three participants with aMCI and 25 healthy controls (HC) completed an easy vigilance task and thought probes (reporting what was going through their mind), which were categorized as spontaneous thoughts about the past (i.e., involuntary memories), current situation, and future (i.e., spontaneous prospection). Participants with aMCI reported significantly fewer spontaneous thoughts or mind-wandering than HC. This effect was driven by significantly fewer involuntary memories, although groups did not differ in the number of current and future thoughts. Findings provide strong support for the spontaneous retrieval deficit hypothesis. Implications for research on mind-wandering and the default network, early cognitive markers of the disease, and our theoretical understanding of the nature of cognitive deficits in AD are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record ","323":"Numerous studies documenting cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) revealed impairment in a variety of tasks related to memory, learning, and attention. One ubiquitous task that has not received much attention, is categorization system-switching. Categorization system-switching is a form of task-switching requiring participants to switch between different categorization systems. In this article, we explore whether older adults and people with PD show deficits in categorization system-switching. Twenty older adults diagnosed with PD, 20 neurologically intact older adults, and 67 young adults participated in this study. Participants were first trained in rule-based (RB) and later information-integration (II) categorization separately. After training on the tasks, participants performed a block of trial-by-trial switching where the RB and II trials were randomly intermixed. Finally, the last block of trials also intermixed RB and II trials were randomly but additionally changed the location of the response buttons. Contrary to our hypothesis, the results show no difference in accuracy between older adults and people with PD during the intermixed trial block, as well as no difference in response time (RT) switch cost. However, both groups were less accurate during intermixed trial blocks and had a higher RT switch cost when compared with young adults. In addition, the proportion of participants able to switch systems was smaller in people with PD than in young adults. The results suggest that older adults and people with PD have impaired categorization system-switching ability, and that this ability may be related to a decrease in tonic dopamine (DA) levels associated with normal aging and PD.

The primary purpose of this study was to identify differences in the cognitive performance between elderly individuals with MS and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Three groups ranging in age from 60 to 80 were compared: patients with MS (n = 64), patients with aMCI (n = 58), and healthy adults (n = 70). All participants completed a standard neuropsychological test battery that evaluated domains of attention, processing speed, executive function, memory, language, and visual spatial function. Compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls, elderly MS patients exhibited a pattern of cognitive impairment centering on information processing speed and memory that was consistent with the deficits observed in other studies of MS patients regardless of age. Compared to aMCI patients, the MS patients exhibited worse performance on measures of processing speed, but better performance on a measure of memory under cued conditions (Selective Reminding Test), a nonspeeded measure of language (Boston Naming Test), and measures of executive function with processing speed statistically controlled (Trail Making Test, Stroop Test). Differences on neuropsychological measures can serve to distinguish aMCI from MS-related cognitive impairment in older patients, but it is essential that these measures control for the deficit in processing speed that is such a primary feature of MS.

The present study aims to comprehensively analyze differences between patients with \"poor\" and \"fair\" mentalizing abilities, as identified through a median-split procedure on mental state attribution task, and healthy controls, as well as to explore the role of clinical, demographical, and neurocognitive predictors of ToM performance within groups. One hundred twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and 67 healthy controls were assessed for ToM, attention, and executive functioning. In addition, patients' daily functioning and psychopathological profiles were also rated. \"Fair\" mentalizers perform significantly better than \"poor\" mentalizers on cognitive abilities and quality of life and they differ from healthy controls in neurocognition and cognitive ToM performance, even though the global ToM performance is similar. Furthermore, regression models showed distinct contributing factors in each sub group: ToM is related to neurocognitive abilities and education in healthy subjects, while it is mainly associated with attention in \"fair\" group and it is related to clinical variables and executive functions in \"poor\" mentalizers. Although preliminary, these data shed new light on the heterogeneity of ToM deficit among patients with schizophrenia and could reflect on daily clinical practice, as they are important to develop individualized step-by-step rehabilitative programs.

The aim of the present study was to investigate global versus local visuospatial processing in individuals with ASD, comparing them with typically developing (TD) controls in visuoconstructive and visuospatial memory tasks. There were 21 participants with ASD without intellectual disability, and 21 TD controls matched for chronological age (M = 161.37 months, SD = 38.19), gender, and perceptual reasoning index who were tested. Participants were administered tasks assessing the visuoconstructive domain and involving fine motor skills, and visuospatial memory tasks in which visuospatial information had to be manipulated mentally. Using a mixed-effects model approach, our results showed different effects of local bias in the ASD group, depending on the domain considered: the use of a local approach only emerged for the visuoconstructive domain-in which fine motor skills were involved. These results seem to suggest that the local bias typical of the cognitive profile of ASD without intellectual disability could be a property of specific cognitive domains rather than a central mechanism.

Questions concerning everyday functionality became primarily important and, thus, ecologically valid neuropsychological assessments are mandatory. Virtual reality (VR) environments might provide a way of implementing immersive cognitive assessments with a higher degree of everyday-life-related cognitive demands. We report on a VR-based episodic memory examination in N = 30 young and N = 18 healthy older adults (HOA) using a kitchen scene. The test procedure was designed to be structurally comparable to clinically used California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) in terms of repeated learning trials as well as short and long delayed recall measures. The results showed that age-related learning and performance decrements were mainly evident in the CVLT but not in the VR-memory examination. The ecologically valid VR-memory examination might provide a more accurate \"age-fair\" estimation of everyday-life-related memory demands in HOA than the frequently and clinically used CVLT. We concluded this from our finding of context-related automatic and effortless activations of deeply experience based encoding and retrieval strategies with regard to everyday-life-related objects in the HOA, which might not be paralleled by learning arbitrary word associations. (PsycINFO Database Record ","330":"Metacognition, or the ability to accurately identify, appraise, and monitor one's deficits, is commonly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Poor metacognition prevents correct appraisal of a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms and facilitates anosognosia, which has important clinical implications for individuals (e.g., diminished treatment adherence, increased engagement in high-risk situations) and caregivers (e.g., higher burden). However, the neural correlates of metacognitive disturbance are still debated in the literature, partly because of the subjective nature of traditional awareness measures. An objective Feeling of Knowing (FOK) task was used to measure metamemory capacity in a group of cognitively diverse older adults, including 14 with mild to moderate AD and 20 cognitively healthy older adults. The association between three different objective metamemory measures of the FOK task and regional cortical thickness (12 bilateral regions of interest [ROIs] hypothesized to support self-awareness) was analyzed using partial correlations. Less accurate metamemory at the local and global levels was associated with reduced right posterior cingulate cortical thickness, r = -0.42, p = .02 and reduced right medial prefrontal, r = -0.39, p = .029, respectively. To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine metacognition in relation to cortical thickness. Both global and local metamemory functions appear to rely on the integrity of right sided midline regions, known to be important for processing self-referential information. Findings are conceptualized with regard to the Default Mode Network, and also considered in relation to recent findings pointing to the right insula as a region critical for self-awareness.

This study aimed to predict neuropsychological outcome after pediatric concussion by using a sufficiently large sample to explore a vast array of predictors. A total of 311 children and adolescents (6-18 years old) with concussion were assessed in the emergency department to document acute symptomatology and to screen for cognitive functioning. At 4 and 12 weeks postinjury, they completed tests of intellectual functioning, attention\/working memory, executive functions, verbal memory, processing speed, and fine motor abilities. Multiple hierarchical logistic and linear regressions were performed to assess the contribution of premorbid factors, acute symptoms, and acute cognitive screening (Standardized Assessment of Concussion-Child) to aspects of neuropsychological outcome: (a) cognitive inefficiency (defined using a modified Neuropsychological Impairment Rule; Beauchamp et al., 2015) and (b) neuropsychological performance (defined using principal component analysis). Neuropsychological impairment was present in 10.3% and 4.5% of participants at 4 and 12 weeks postinjury, respectively. At 4 weeks postinjury, cognitive inefficiency was predicted by premorbid factors and acute cognitive screening, whereas at 12 weeks it was predicted by acute symptoms. Neuropsychological performance at 4 weeks was predicted by a combination of premorbid factors, acute symptoms, and acute cognitive screening, whereas as at 12 weeks, only acute cognitive screening predicted performance. Neuropsychological outcome after pediatric concussion is not attributable solely to preexisting problems but is instead associated with a combination of preexisting and injury-related variables. Acute cognitive screening appears to be particularly useful in predicting neuropsychological status after concussion.

A sample of 62 individuals (TBI n = 34; healthy control [HC] n = 28) were included in the study. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data were collected for all participants during the same visit. MC was quantified using an approach borrowed from signal detection theory (Type II area under the receiver operating characteristic curve calculation) to evaluate judgments during a modified version of the 3rd edition of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale's Matrix Reasoning subtest where half of the items were presented randomly and half were presented in the order of increasing difficulty. Retrospective confidence judgments were collected on an item-by-item basis. Brain volumetric analyses were conducted using FreeSurfer software. Analyses of the modified Matrix Reasoning task data demonstrated that HCs significantly outperformed TBIs (ordered: d = .63; random: d = .58). There was a significant difference between groups for MC for the randomly presented stimuli (d = .54) but not the ordered stimuli. There was an association between GMV and MC in the TBI group between the right orbital region and MC (R2 = .11). In the HC group, there were associations between the left posterior (R2 = .17), left orbital (R2 = .29), and left dorsolateral (R2 = .21) regions and MC.

Individuals with TBI underperformed HC adults in the ERT and self-reported, as well as were reported by close others, as having more communication problems than did HC adults. TBI group ERT scores were significantly and negatively correlated with LCQ-Other (but not LCQ-Self) scores (i.e., participants with lower emotion-recognition scores were rated by close others as having more communication problems). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that adults with higher ERT scores self-reported more problems with disinhibition-impulsivity and partner sensitivity and had fewer other-reported problems with disinhibition-impulsivity and conversational effectiveness. Our findings support growing evidence that emotion-recognition deficits play a role in specific aspects of social-communication outcomes after TBI and should be considered in treatment planning.

Three central research objectives were examined including whether (a) olfactory function, vision, and audition exhibited significant longitudinal declines in nondemented older adults; (b) multiwave change for these sensory function indicators predicted risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); and (c) change within persons for each sensory measure shared dynamic time-varying associations with within-person change in cognitive functioning. A longitudinal sample (n = 408) from the Victoria Longitudinal Study was assembled. Three cognitive status subgroups were identified: not impaired cognitively, single-assessment MCI, and multiple-assessment MCI. We tested independent predictive associations, contrasting change in sensory function as predictors of cognitive decline and impairment, utilizing both linear mixed models and logistic regression analysis. Olfaction and, to a lesser extent, vision were identified as the most robust predictors of cognitive status and decline; audition showed little predictive influence. These findings underscore the potential utility of deficits in olfactory function, in particular, as an early marker of age- and pathology-related cognitive decline. Functional biomarkers may represent potential candidates for use in the early stages of a multistep screening approach for detecting those at risk of cognitive impairment, as well as for targeted intervention.

The aim of this study was to investigate the brain mechanisms associated with semantic performance in aMCI patients. A group of aMCI patients and a group of healthy controls carried out a semantic categorization task while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). During the task, participants were shown famous faces and had to determine whether each famous person matched a given occupation. The main hypotheses were that (a) semantic processing should be compromised for aMCI patients, and (b) these deficits should be associated with cortical dysfunctions within specific areas of the semantic network. Behavioral results showed that aMCI participants were significantly slower and less accurate than controls at the semantic task. Additionally, relative to controls, a significant pattern of hyperactivation was found in the aMCI group within specific regions of the extended semantic network, including the right anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and fusiform gyrus. Abnormal functional activation within key areas of the semantic network suggests that it is compromised early in the disease process. Moreover, this pattern of right ATL and fusiform gyrus hyperactivation was positively associated with gray matter integrity in specific areas, but was not associated with any pattern of atrophy, suggesting that this pattern of hyperactivation may precede structural alteration of the semantic network in aMCI.

Survival analyses were used to determine if a history of TBI predicted progression from MCI to AD up to 8 years. Random regression models were used to examine whether TBI history also predicted rate of decline on the Clinical Dementia Rating scale Sum of Boxes score (CDR-SB) among subjects who progress to AD. Across 8 years, TBI history was not significantly associated with progression from MCI to a diagnosis of AD in unadjusted (HR = 0.80; 95% CI [0.63, 1.01]; p = .06) and adjusted (p = .15) models. Similarly, a history of TBI was a nonsignificant predictor for rate of decline on CDR-SB among subjects who progressed to AD (b = 0.15, p = .38). MCI was, however, diagnosed a mean of 2.6 years earlier (p &lt; .001) in TBI+ subjects compared with the TBI- group. A history of TBI with LOC was not associated with progression from MCI to AD, but was linked to an earlier age of MCI diagnosis.

Participants had to actively reproduce a path that included 5 intersections with one landmark at each intersection that they had seen previously during a learning phase. Three cueing conditions for navigation were offered: salient landmarks, directional arrows and a map. A path without additional visual stimuli served as control condition. Navigation time and number of trajectory mistakes were recorded. With the presence of directional arrows, no significant difference was found between groups concerning the number of trajectory mistakes and navigation time. The number of trajectory mistakes did not differ significantly between patients with AD and patients with MCI on the path with arrows, the path with salient landmarks and the path with a map. There were significant correlations between the number of trajectory mistakes under the arrow condition and executive tests, and between the number of trajectory mistakes under the salient landmark condition and memory tests. Visual cueing such as directional arrows and salient landmarks appears helpful for spatial navigation and memory tasks in patients with AD and patients with MCI.

These behaviors are commonly attributed to executive dysfunction. However, inconsistent associations between EDS and poor executive performance has led to an alternative \"social hypothesis,\" instead implicating patients' misinterpretation of the examiner's intention. We investigated the possible explanatory cognitive mechanisms of EDS in bvFTD by relating UB and IB to performance on tests of executive functioning and theory of mind (ToM). This study analyzed retrospective data of 32 bvFTD patients. Data included scores of UB and IB, various executive measures, and ToM assessment using the faux pas test, from which we extracted a mental attribution score. Of the patients, 15.6% and 40.6% exhibited UB and IB, respectively. We conducted an automatic linear modeling analysis with executive and mental attribution measures as predictor variables, and UB and IB sequentially considered as target variables. ToM mental attribution score, visual abstraction and flexibility measures from the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and motor sequence performance significantly (corrected ps &lt; .05) predicted IB. No executive or ToM measures significantly predicted UB. These findings reveal a complex interaction between executive dysfunction and mental attribution deficits influencing the prevalence of EDS in bvFTD.

Research has found that ToM-age associations are often mediated by other cognitive abilities particularly executive function. However, older adults rarely complain about real-world ToM difficulties. It has been suggested that older adults may perform better in real-world situations compared with experimental settings. We examined performance on the Strange Stories Film Task (SSFT) which has been designed to assess ToM using naturalistic, video scenarios. Sixty adults aged between 17- and 95-years-old completed the SSFT, inhibitory control (Stroop) and working memory (letter-number sequencing) measures, the basic empathy scale (cognitive and affective empathy), and the broad autism phenotype questionnaire. ToM performance correlated significantly with age, whereas performance on a control task did not. Partial correlations and stepwise regression analyses demonstrated that performance on the three SSFT ToM measures was explained by a combination of executive function and empathy measures, with age explaining none of the variance. Using a naturalistic test of ToM, performance was shown to decline with age for ToM but not control scenarios. Across the lifespan, the variance in ToM performance was explained by cognitive abilities and empathy but not age. Age alone may not influence ToM ability, but may be associated with age-related changes in cognition and social-cognition.

The mental-orientation task differentiated mild cognitively impaired and healthy controls at 95% accuracy, while the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, Mini-Mental State Examination and standard-orientation achieved 74%, 70% and 50% accuracy, respectively. Functional MRI revealed the mental-orientation task to preferentially recruit brain regions exhibiting early Alzheimer's-related atrophy, unlike the standard-orientation test.

Large differences between AD patients and HA controls emerged in the basic inhibition conditions of many of the tasks with AD patients often performing slower, overall d = 1.17, 95% CI [0.88-1.45], and making more errors, d = 0.83 [0.63-1.03]. However, comparably large differences were also present in performance on many of the baseline control-conditions, d = 1.01 [0.83-1.19] for RTs and d = 0.44 [0.19-0.69] for error rates. A standardized derived inhibition score (i.e., control-condition score - inhibition-condition score) suggested no significant mean group difference for RTs, d = -0.07 [-0.22-0.08], and only a small difference for errors, d = 0.24 [-0.12-0.60]. Effects systematically varied across tasks and with AD severity. Although the error rate results suggest a specific deterioration of inhibitory-control abilities in AD, further processes beyond inhibitory control (e.g., a general reduction in processing speed and other, task-specific attentional processes) appear to contribute to AD patients' performance deficits observed on a variety of inhibitory-control tasks. Nonetheless, the inhibition conditions of many of these tasks well discriminate between AD patients and HA controls.

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of moderate to severe TBI on activity and functional connectivity in the well-documented right-lateralized frontal-subcortical-parietal sustained attention network, and to assess the effects of alerting cues. Using multivariate analysis of fMRI data, TBI patients and matched neurologically healthy (NH) comparison participants were scanned as they performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in 60-s blocks, with or without exogenous cueing through brief auditory alerting tones. Results documented inefficient voluntary control of attention in the TBI patients, with reduced functional connectivity in the sustained attention network relative to NH participants. When alerting cues were present during the SART, however, functional connectivity increased and became comparable to activity patterns seen in the NH group. These findings provide novel evidence of a neural mechanism for the facilitatory effects of alerting cues on goal-directed behavior in patients with damaged attentional brain systems, and support their use in cognitive rehabilitation.

Psychopathic traits may partly relate to disrupted connections between brain regions. The aim of the present study was to link abnormalities in microstructural integrity of white-matter tracts to the severity of different psychopathic traits in 15 male offenders with impulse control problems and 10 without impulse control problems. Psychopathic traits were assessed using the Psychopathy Checklist-revised (PCL-R). Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to examine white-matter tracts. Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white-matter integrity, was calculated for each voxel. Clusters of voxels showing a significant relationship with psychopathy severity were submitted to probabilistic tractography. No significant correlations between psychopathy severity and FA were present in the whole group of impulsive and nonimpulsive offenders. In impulsive offenders, interpersonal-affective traits (PCL-R Factor 1) were negatively correlated with FA in the anterior and posterior temporal lobe and orbitofrontal area. Further analyses indicated that elevated affective traits (PCL-R Facet 2) were specifically related to reduced FA in the right temporal lobe. Our findings suggest that white-matter abnormalities in temporal and frontotemporal tracts may be linked to the interpersonal-affective deficits of psychopathy in offenders with relatively severe impulse control problems.

Patients in the active control group received the memory therapy usually provided in the rehabilitation center. Both groups received nine hours of therapy. Prior (T0) and subsequent (T1) to the therapy, patients were evaluated on an everyday memory test (EMT) as well as on a neuropsychological test battery. Based on factor analysis of the neuropsychological test scores at T0 we calculated composite scores for working memory, verbal learning and word fluency. After treatment, the intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement for WM performance compared with the active control group. More importantly, performance on the EMT also improved significantly in patients receiving the recollection and working memory training compared with patients with standard memory training. Our results show that combining working memory and recollection training significantly improves performance on everyday memory tasks, demonstrating far transfer effects.

The aim of the current study was to characterize reduced awareness for apraxic as well as aphasic deficits in patients suffering from LH stroke. After the assessment of apraxia and aphasia, patients (n = 32) were asked to rate their performance on a 1- to 5-point rating scale. An unawareness score (UAS) was computed as the difference between the examiners' ratings and self-ratings, resulting in negative scores for patients who overestimated their performance in a given assessment, that is, exhibited reduced awareness for their stroke-related deficits. Patients with apraxia (n = 14) and aphasia (n = 16) significantly overestimated their performance in the respective assessment. However, the level of awareness was not generally related to the severity of apraxia, and there were no group differences in other variables between patients with full (n = 7) and reduced awareness (n = 7) for apraxic deficits. The reduction of awareness for apraxic deficits did not differ significantly for buccofacial versus limb gestures.

This study aimed to address this issue by exploring the potential benefits of specific encoding strategies on memory for intentions across healthy adulthood and in the early stages of cognitive impairment. PM performance was explored through an experimental paradigm in 96 participants: 32 amnestic mild cognitively impaired patients aged 64-87 years (M = 6.75, SD = 5.88), 32 healthy older adults aged 62-84 years (M = 76.06, SD = 6.03), and 32 younger adults 18-22 years (M = 19.75, SD = 1.16). The potential benefit of the use of enactment (i.e., physically simulating the intended action) at encoding to support an autonomous performance despite neuronal degeneration was assessed. PM was consistently identified as a sensitive and specific indicator of cognitive impairment. Importantly, enacted encoding was consistently beneficial for PM performance of all the participants, but especially so in the case of healthy and cognitively impaired older adults. These positive results have unveiled the potential of this encoding technique to optimize attentional demands through an adaptive allocation of strategic resources across both healthy and cognitively impaired samples. Theoretical implications of this work are discussed as well as the considerable translational potential to improve social well-being.

Our aim was to investigate whether nondemented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show an impairment in the strategic exploration of the semantic store and whether the tested semantic category has an impact on multiple measures of performance. We compared 74 nondemented PD patients with 254 healthy subjects in a semantic fluency test using relatively small (fruits) and large (animals) semantic categories. Number of words produced, number of explored semantic subcategories, and degree of order in the produced sequences were computed as dependent variables. PD patients produced fewer words than healthy subjects did, regardless of the category. Number of subcategories was also lower in PD patients than in healthy subjects, without a significant difference between categories. Critically, PD patients' sequences were less semantically organized than were those of controls, but this effect appeared in only the smaller category (fruits), thus pointing to a lack of strategy in exploring the semantic store. Our results show that the semantic fluency deficit in PD patients has a strategic component, even though that may not be the only cause of the impaired performance. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that the semantic category used in the test influences performance, hence providing an explanation for the failure by previous studies, which often used large categories such as animals, to detect strategy deficits in PD.

Approximately half were cognitively normal at baseline (global Clinical Dementia Rating M = 0.5). Of the patients with dementia, most (79%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). MRI measures of gray matter volume (baseline and change), and hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes (baseline), were used to predict change in global cognition. Multilevel latent variable modeling was used to test the hypothesis that brain effects on cognitive change differed across ethnoracial groups. In a multivariable model, global gray matter change was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline in Whites and African Americans and specific temporal lobe change added incremental explanatory power in Whites. Baseline WMH volume was the strongest predictor of cognitive decline in Hispanics and made an incremental contribution in Whites. We found ethnoracial group differences in associations of brain variables with cognitive decline. The unique patterns in Whites appeared to suggest a greater influence of AD in this group. In contrast, cognitive decline in African Americans and Hispanics was most uniquely attributable to global gray matter change and baseline WMH, respectively. Brain changes underlying cognitive decline in older adults are heterogeneous and depend on fixed and modifiable risk factors that differ based on ethnicity and race.

The evidence is mixed, however, with regard to which neurocognitive abilities account for these relations. A well-characterized group of 117 children ages 8-13 (M = 10.45, SD = 1.53; 43 girls; 69.5% Caucasian\/Non-Hispanic) with ADHD (n = 77) and without ADHD (n = 40) were administered multiple, counterbalanced tests of neurocognitive functioning and assessed for social skills via multi-informant reports. Bayesian linear regressions revealed strong support for working memory and cross-informant interfering behaviors (inattention, hyperactivity\/impulsivity) as predictors of parent- and teacher-reported social problems. Working memory was also implicated in social skills acquisition deficits, performance deficits, and strengths based on parent and\/or teacher report; inattention and\/or hyperactivity showed strong correspondence with cross-informant social problems in all models. There was no evidence for, and in most models strong evidence against, effects of inhibitory control and processing speed. The ADHD group was impaired relative to the non-ADHD group on social skills (d = 0.82-0.88), visuospatial working memory (d = 0.89), and phonological working memory (d = 0.58). In contrast, the Bayesian ANOVAs indicated that the ADHD and non-ADHD groups were equivalent on processing speed, IQ, age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). There was no support for or against group differences in inhibition. These findings confirm that ADHD is associated with impaired social performance, and implicate working memory and core ADHD symptoms in the acquisition and performance of socially skilled behavior.

A total of 37 healthy participants were recruited to match spatial dots with an auditory tone sequence in a 3T GE Discovery MR750 scanner. In addition, they were examined with the sensory integration subscale of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory. We found that the bilateral occipital-parietal conjunction cortex and the precentral frontal gyrus were activated during the matching condition rather than in the nonmatching condition. Activation of the occipital-parietal conjunction cortex was associated with integration of information across visual and auditory modalities, whereas activation of the precentral frontal gyrus was associated with decision making of movements. In addition, activation of the left superior frontal gyrus was associated with scores on the sensory integration subscale of the Cambridge Neurological Inventory. These findings suggest that the bilateral occipital-parietal conjunction cortex is responsible for matching information input from multiple modalities during audiovisual sensory integration.

Moreover, to review the anatomo-functional correlates of PN, focusing on group studies that used modern voxel-based lesion-symptoms mapping.

Relevant clinical data for each study were reported in a table, which was used as a reference for developing the discussion on the points of interest. Evaluation tools for PN suffer from limitations and should include both face- and body-related testing as well as require both basic exploration and object use in the same personal space. Dedicated rehabilitative procedures are lacking and advocated, given that recovery of PN and extrapersonal neglect can be dissociated and their degree is not correlated. PN is almost constantly associated with a cohort of body representation disorders that do not reveal themselves unless specifically investigated. PN is significantly correlated to alterations at the level of both the anterior parietal cortex and the underlying fronto-parietal fiber bundles. The discussed data point to the need for a diagnostic and rehabilitative update. Following the topological and hodological lesional pattern, PN might emerge from the combination of a body representation disorder and a spatial inattention for half of the space.

However, not much research was done on their abilities to process noncountable magnitudes. An example of noncountable magnitude is conceptual size (e.g., mouse is small and elephant is big). Recently, we found that adults process conceptual size automatically. The current study examined automatic processing of conceptual size in students with DD and developmental dyslexia. Conceptual and physical sizes were manipulated orthogonally to create congruent (e.g., a physically small apple compared to a physically large violin) and incongruent (e.g., a physically large apple compared to a physically small violin) conditions. Participants were presented with 2 objects and had to choose the larger one. Each trial began with an instruction to respond to the physical or to the conceptual dimension. Control and the dyslexic groups presented automatic processing of both conceptual and physical sizes. The dyscalculic group presented automatic processing of physical size but not automaticity of processing conceptual size. Our results fit with previous findings of weaker magnitude representation in those with DD, specifically regarding noncountable magnitudes, and support theories of a shared neurocognitive substrate for different types of magnitudes.

We expected that the EF components would be separate but related, and that a bifactor model would best represent the data relative to alternative models. We assessed EF with 27 measures in a large sample (N = 846) of late elementary school-age children, many of whom were struggling in reading, and who were demographically diverse. We tested structural models of EF, from unitary models to methodological models, utilizing model-comparison factor analytic techniques. We examined both a common factor as well as a bifactor structure. Initial models showed strong overlap among several latent EF variables. The final model was a bifactor model with a common EF, and five specific EF factors (working memory-span\/manipulation and planning; working memory-updating; generative fluency, self-regulated learning; metacognition). Results speak to the commonality and potential separability of EF.

We also examined longitudinal relations between SD and internalizing problems postinjury. Participants (N = 87) ages 8-15 included youth with TBI, EI, and TD children. Injury groups were recruited from a Level 1 trauma center after sustaining vehicle-related injuries. Parent-reported SD and internalizing problems were assessed at preinjury\/baseline, and 6 and 12 months postinjury. Linear mixed models evaluated the relation of group and time of assessment on outcomes. Controlling for age, the combined traumatic injury group experienced significantly higher postinjury levels of SD (p = .042) and internalizing problems (p = .024) than TD children; however, TBI and EI injury groups did not differ from each other. Injury severity was positively associated with SD in the EI group only, but in both groups SD was associated with additional postinjury sequelae, including fatigue and externalizing behavior problems. Internalizing problems predicted subsequent development of SD but not vice versa. The relation between injury and SD 1 year later was consistent with mediation by internalizing problems at 6 months postinjury. Children with both types of traumatic injury demonstrated higher SD and internalizing problems than healthy children. Internalizing problems occurring either prior to or following pediatric injury may be a risk factor for posttraumatic SD. Consequently, internalizing problems may be a promising target of intervention to improve both SD and related adjustment concerns.

In support of this notion, face recognition deficits have been demonstrated in developmental dyslexia. Here we test whether the opposite association can also be found, that is, impaired reading in developmental prosopagnosia. We tested 10 adults with developmental prosopagnosia and 20 matched controls. All participants completed the Cambridge Face Memory Test, the Cambridge Face Perception test and a Face recognition questionnaire used to quantify everyday face recognition experience. Reading was measured in four experimental tasks, testing different levels of letter, word, and text reading: (a) single word reading with words of varying length,(b) vocal response times in single letter and short word naming, (c) recognition of single letters and short words at brief exposure durations (targeting the word superiority effect), and d) text reading. Participants with developmental prosopagnosia performed strikingly similar to controls across the four reading tasks. Formal analysis revealed a significant dissociation between word and face recognition, as the difference in performance with faces and words was significantly greater for participants with developmental prosopagnosia than for controls. Adult developmental prosopagnosics read as quickly and fluently as controls, while they are seemingly unable to learn efficient strategies for recognizing faces. We suggest that this is due to the differing demands that face and word recognition put on the perceptual system.

Yet the perceptual strategies underlying this advantage are unclear. Here, we aimed to verify whether both the self-face advantage and the right perceptual bias emerge in an explicit task, and whether those effects are linked to a different scanning strategy between the self-face and unfamiliar faces. Eye movements were recorded from 7 CPs and 13 controls, during a self\/other discrimination task of stimuli depicting the self-face and another unfamiliar face, presented upright and inverted. Individuals with CP and controls differed significantly in how they explored faces. In particular, compared with controls, CPs used a distinct eye movement sampling strategy for processing inverted faces, by deploying significantly more fixations toward the nose and mouth areas, which resulted in more efficient recognition. Moreover, the results confirmed the presence of a self-face advantage in both groups, but the eye movement analyses failed to reveal any differences in the exploration of the self-face compared with the unfamiliar face. Finally, no bias toward the right-half of the self-face was found. Our data suggest that the self-face advantage emerges both in implicit and explicit recognition tasks in CPs as much as in good recognizers, and it is not linked to any specific visual exploration strategies.

Norms were calculated based on the cognitive performances of n = 1,888 dementia-free participants (60-79 years) from the population-based German LIFE-Adult-Study. Multiple regressions were used to examine the association of the CERAD-NAB scores with age, sex, and education. In order to calculate the norms, quantile and censored quantile regression analyses were performed estimating marginal means of the test scores at 2.28, 6.68, 10, 15.87, 25, 50, 75, and 90 percentiles for age-, sex-, and education-specific subgroups. Multiple regression analyses revealed that younger age was significantly associated with better cognitive performance in 15 CERAD-NAB measures and higher education with better cognitive performance in all 17 measures. Women performed significantly better than men in 12 measures and men than women in four measures. The determined norms indicate ceiling effects for the cognitive performances in the Boston Naming, Word List Recognition, Constructional Praxis Copying, and Constructional Praxis Recall tests. The new norms for the extended CERAD-NAB will be useful for evaluating dementia-free German-speaking adults in a broad variety of relevant cognitive domains.

However, higher education may possibly protect against HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The aim of the current cross-sectional study was to assess the effect of age and education in an HIV-1 clade C infected adult population in urban Zambia. Demographically corrected Zambian norms on a neuropsychological (NP) test battery were used to correct for normal age and education effects. The study assessed 286 HIV positive (+) males (37.1%) and females (62.9%) with a mean age of 41.35 (SD = 8.56) and mean years of education = 10.16 (SD = 2.18). A comprehensive NP test battery was used to assess cognitive domains frequently affected by HIV: attention\/working memory, learning\/and delayed recall, executive function, verbal fluency, processing speed, verbal and visual episodic memory, and fine motor skills. In younger HIV+ Zambians, higher education evidenced protective effects against NC impairments overall, and for the specific domains of executive functions, learning and speed of information processing. Impairment scores did not support accelerated overall brain aging although the restricted age range and relative youth of our total sample may have precluded detection of such tendencies. The present study raises the need to investigate factors that could be implicated in the poor neurocognitive performance among the younger, less educated HIV+ individuals in Zambia.

Participants were 460 older adults enrolled in a longitudinal aging study. Cognitive outcomes were measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and spatial ability derived from the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS). Latent variable multilevel modeling of the four cognitive outcomes as parallel longitudinal processes identified intercepts for each outcome and a second order global change factor explaining covariance among the highly correlated slopes. We examined how baseline brain volumes (lobar gray matter, hippocampus, and white matter hyperintensity) and change in brain volumes (lobar gray matter) were associated with cognitive intercepts and global cognitive change. Lobar volumes were dissociated into global and specific components using latent variable methods. Cognitive change was most strongly associated with brain gray matter volume change, with strong independent effects of global gray matter change and specific temporal lobe gray matter change. Baseline white matter hyperintensity and hippocampal volumes had significant incremental effects on cognitive decline beyond gray matter change. Baseline lobar gray matter was related to cognitive decline, but did not contribute beyond gray matter change. Cognitive decline was strongly influenced by gray matter volume change and, especially, temporal lobe change. The strong influence of temporal lobe gray matter change on cognitive decline may reflect involvement of temporal lobe structures that are critical for late life cognitive health but also are vulnerable to diseases of aging.

The present research report aims to investigate hemispheric asymmetries in such a basic musical ability, very poorly investigated in the domain of cognitive neurosciences. Sixty-three musicians underwent lateralized tachistoscopic presentation of musical notes on staves, 50% in the left and 50% in the right visual field, associated with each of the 7 musical clefs. The subjects' task was to pronounce as fast as possible the name of the presented note, taking into account the current clef symbol. Mixed directions of asymmetry with different involvements of the left and right hemisphere in each clef were observed. Whereas reading in the treble, bass, alto, tenor, and mezzosoprano clef showed no lateral asymmetries, a left hemisphere asymmetry was observed with the soprano clef and a right hemisphere asymmetry with the baritone clef. This effect was observed with accuracy but not with reaction time. These results suggest that there is not a univocal hemispheric balance in musical setticlavio reading, reflecting several possible underlying reading mechanisms. Moreover, inversely proportional results between performance (both accuracy and reaction time) and distance from the reference clef (treble) suggest that setticlavio reading is based on a spatial rather than verbal code.

In a divided visual field paradigm, we presented happy and angry faces to 16 healthy participants, either unilaterally or bilaterally, in order to test the aforementioned theories. Behavioral results provided support for the VH and correlational analysis revealed that handedness influences the rightward bias for positive emotions. The amplitude of P1, N170, and P2 event-related potential components at parietal sites (selected by means of topographic maps) was larger in the right than in the left hemisphere, independently of the emotional expression of the stimuli, supporting the RHH. At frontal sites, no asymmetry was found in bilateral conditions, whereas in unilateral conditions, a mixed pattern of hemispheric asymmetries emerged.

Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for sex, education, and race compared groups on clinician-estimated age of symptom onset and age of diagnosis. Average age of onset was 2.34 years earlier (p = .01) for the TBI+ group (n = 194) versus the TBI- group (n = 1900). Dementia was diagnosed on average 2.83 years earlier (p = .002) in the TBI+ group (n = 197) versus the TBI- group (n = 1936).

With the complete mapping of the human genome, genome-wide association studies for many complex traits have proliferated; however, the highly polygenic nature of intelligence has made the identification of the precise genes that influence both global and specific cognitive abilities more difficult than anticipated. Here, we review the latest developments in the genomics of cognition, including a discussion of methodological advances in the genetic analysis of complex traits, and shared genetic contributions to cognitive abilities and neuropsychiatric disorders. A wealth of twin and family studies have provided compelling evidence for a strong heritable component of both global and specific cognitive abilities, and for the existence of \"generalist genes\" responsible for a large portion of the variance in diverse cognitive abilities. Increasingly sophisticated analytic tools and ever-larger sample sizes are now facilitating the identification of specific genetic and molecular underpinnings of cognitive abilities, leading to optimism regarding possibilities for novel treatments for illnesses related to cognitive function.

Cognitive control differences were measured by assessing selective attention-based abilities both with and without distracting stimuli, and visuomotor differences were measured by characterizing visuomotor tracking and tracing skills. Performance in cognitive control and visuomotor domains were investigated globally as composite scores, and specifically within each task. Our results indicated that though the ASD group showed the most impaired selective attention performance, the SPD group had intermediate abilities-performing above the ASD group but below the TDC group. Furthermore, both the SPD and ASD groups demonstrated equally impaired visuomotor abilities relative to the TDC group. A correlational analysis between cognitive and visuomotor control suggest a relationship between these overlapping control networks.

Subject MM was interviewed about his personal life and administered standard clinical tests of cognition and personality, as well as experimental tasks assessing personal and generic episodic and semantic memory. Finally, he was studied with high resolution structural MRI of the medial temporal lobes, as well as brain connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI.

Unlike most mnemonists, he denies using any specific mnemonic strategy and, unlike many other HSAM cases, is unable to recall highly specific details of days in his adult life. Structural brain imaging in MM reveals atypical anatomy in his left temporal lobe, and functional neuroimaging suggests greater than usual connectivity of the left hippocampus with premotor, prefrontal and retrosplenial cingulate cortex.

Multiregional psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was used to examine effective connectivity between these regions. During switching trials, behavioral performance declined and activation of a generic cognitive control network increased. Concurrently, task-related connectivity increased within and between cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal cognitive control networks. Notably, the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) was most consistently coactivated with the 2 cognitive control networks. Furthermore, switching-dependent effective connectivity was negatively correlated with behavioral switch costs. The strength of effective connectivity between left IFJ and other regions in the networks predicted individual differences in switch costs. Task switching was supported by coactivated connections within cognitive control networks, with left IFJ potentially acting as a key hub between the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks.

Eleven LBD patients and 12 control participants performed 3 original experimental tasks: Use-Length (visual evaluation of the length of a stick to bring down a target), Visual-Length (to visually compare objects of different lengths) and Addition-Length (to visually compare added lengths). Participants were also tested on conventional tasks: Familiar Tool Use and Mechanical Problem-Solving (novel tools). LBD patients had more difficulties than controls on both conventional tasks. No significant differences were observed for the 3 experimental tasks. These results extend the reasoning-based approach, stressing that it might not be the representation of length that is impaired in LBD patients, but rather the ability to generate mechanical actions based on physical object properties.

We adapted a verbal memory test to evaluate long-term memory consolidation in healthy volunteers. A sample of 238 participants (M = 42.23 years old, SD = 16.45) was administered an adapted version of the French RL\/RI-16 (Van der Linden &amp; the members of GREMEM, 2004), the One-Week Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test-word version, in which special feature relies on a 30-min and a 1-week-delayed recall after encoding. We proposed normative data on 4 indicators, depending on participants' own performance during the test, to measure their encoding, storage and consolidation abilities, with a method using an ascendant step-by-step linear regression model and a percentile procedure. Results showed a better performance in women than in men for encoding and cueing scores (p &lt; .01 and p &lt; .05, respectively). We also highlighted an increase of the forgetting score according to the recall delay after encoding (30 min vs. 7 days; Z = 12.49, p &lt; .001), the forgetting percentage 7 days after encoding being largely influenced by participants' age and gender (F[2, 236] = 248.1, p &lt; .001; adjusted R2 = 67%). This study emphasized the role of demographic factors on long-term memory consolidation. The demographically adjusted normative data we provide for the One-Week Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test-word version make it a sensitive tool for long-term memory consolidation assessment in clinical and forensic practice. (PsycINFO Database Record ","380":"Closing-in behavior (CIB) defines the abnormal misplacement of the copy performance, positioned very closed to or on the top of the model. This symptom is observed in graphic copying by patients suffering from different neurological diseases, most commonly dementia. The cognitive origins of this behavior are still a matter of investigation, and research of the last 10 years has been focused on exploring 2 main accounts of CIB, the compensation and the attraction hypotheses, providing evidence in both directions. While the first account defines CIB as a compensatory strategy to overcome visuospatial and\/or working memory deficits during copying tasks, the attraction hypothesis looks at CIB as primitive default behavior in which attention and action are closely coupled and movements are performed toward the focus of attention. We explored these 2 hypotheses in a sample of patients with and without CIB, and controls in 5 experiments: Experiments 1 and 2 tested the attraction hypothesis and, respectively, the prediction that CIB can be elicited in a noncopying dual task condition loading upon attentional resources or by irrelevant attentional grabbing stimuli. The other experiments investigated the compensation hypothesis manipulating the distance between model and copying space (Experiment 3), the task demand (single or dual task loading on verbal working memory; Experiment 4), the task requirements (copying and tracing) and visual demand (visual copy and memory; Experiment 5). The results support the attraction hypothesis of CIB. CIB reflects an impairment of the attention and action system, rather than a compensatory strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record ","381":"Decreased processing speed in schizophrenia patients has been identified as a major impairment factor in various neuropsychological domains. Working memory span has been found to be involved in several deep or effortful cognitive processes. We investigated the impact that these 2 cognitive functions may have on phonological and semantic fluency in schizophrenia patients and healthy participants. Fifty-five patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy participants were administered a neuropsychological battery including phonological and semantic fluency, working memory, and cognitive and motor speed. Regression analyses revealed that motor speed was related to phonological fluency in female patients, whereas cognitive speed was related to semantic fluency in male patients. In addition, working memory span was related to verbal fluency in women from both the patient and the healthy control groups. Decreased processing speed, but not decreased working memory span, accounted for the verbal fluency deficit in patients. Verbal fluency was inversely related to attention deficit in female patients and to negative symptoms in male patients. Decreased processing speed may be the main factor in verbal fluency impairment of patients. Further, the cognitive and clinical predictors of verbal fluency efficiency are different in men and women.

In a within-subjects study, 21 PD participants and 20 age-matched healthy controls performed both static and dynamic emotion recognition tasks. The authors used a 2-way analysis of variance (controlling for individual participant variance) to determine the effect of group (PD, control) on emotion recognition performance in static and dynamic facial recognition tasks. Groups did not significantly differ in their performances on the static and dynamic tasks; however, the trend was suggestive that PD participants performed worse than controls. PD participants may have subtle emotion recognition deficits that are not ameliorated by the addition of contextual cues, similar to those found in everyday scenarios. Consistent with previous literature, the results suggest that PD participants may have underlying emotion recognition deficits, which may impact their social functioning.

Numerous rehabilitation clinics offer animal-assisted therapy (AAT) to address these difficulties. The authors' aim was to investigate the immediate effects of AAT on the concentration and attention span of brain-injured patients. Nineteen patients with acquired brain injury were included in a randomized, controlled, within-subject trial. The patients alternately received 12 standard therapy sessions (speech therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy) and 12 paralleled AAT sessions with comparable content. A total of 429 therapy sessions was analyzed consisting of 214 AAT and 215 control sessions. Attention span and instances of distraction were assessed via video coding in Noldus Observer. The Mehrdimensionaler Befindlichkeitsbogen ([Multidimensional Affect Rating Scale] MDBF questionnaire; Steyer, Schwenkmezger, Notz, &amp; Eid, 1997) was used to measure the patient's self-rated alertness. Concentration was assessed through Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) via self-assessment and therapist's ratings. The patients' attention span did not differ whether an animal was present or not. However, patients displayed more instances of distraction during AAT. Moreover, patients rated themselves more concentrated and alert during AAT sessions. Further, therapists' evaluation of patients' concentration indicated that patients were more concentrated in AAT compared with the control condition. Although the patients displayed more instances of distraction while in the presence of an animal, it did not have a negative impact on their attention span. In addition, patients reported to be more alert and concentrated when an animal was present. Future studies should examine other attentional processes such as divided attention and include neurobiological correlates of attention.

Patients with mild (n = 47) and moderate-severe TBI (n = 59) were included, in addition to healthy controls (HCs; n = 51). Assessment consisted of EF tests (Trail Making Test, Zoo Map Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test) and questionnaires examining EF (Dysexecutive Questionnaire) and coping styles (Utrecht Coping List). Moderate-severe TBI patients showed significant more EF deficits, lower active coping and higher passive coping than mild TBI patients and HCs, whereas mild TBI patients did not differ from HCs. In the moderate-severe TBI group, a higher number of self-reported EF problems was related to lower levels of active coping, r = -.43, p &lt; .01 and higher levels of passive coping, r = .58, p &lt; .001, with proxy-reports relating to lower levels of active coping, r = -.33, p &lt; .05.

Except for mental flexibility, EF performances were not associated with coping. This study shows strong associations between reported EF problems in daily life and coping styles. For moderate-severe TBI, proxy-reports may reflect EF impairments that complicate active problem-solving. However, reported EF problems by mild and moderate-severe TBI patients are also likely to reflect a psychological distress related to the way patients are inclined to deal with stressing situations that put a demand on their executive abilities.

A total of 903 cognitively healthy older adults enrolled in a longitudinal aging study completed the UDS neuropsychological battery (measuring attention, executive functioning, episodic memory, language and processing speed). Subclinical depressive symptoms were also assessed and self-reported measures of sleep were administered. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses separately assessing the effects of daytime and insomnia-related sleep problems on cognition identified relationships between both daytime and insomnia-related sleep problems with a composite measure of executive functioning; however, the former was related more to speed of processing and the latter to higher order executive abilities. Age moderated the relationship between insomnia severity and executive functioning, and subclinical depressive symptoms moderated the relationship between insomnia-related sleep problems and performance on measures of attention. Among older adults, sleep problems have a deleterious effect on executive functioning regardless of whether they occur during the day or nighttime; however, age and subclinical depressive symptoms differentially impact relationships between sleep variables and cognitive domains.

SALSA followed a large cohort of older Latinos for up to 7 assessment waves from 1998 to 2007. Global cognition was assessed by using the Modified Mini Mental State Examination, and the Spanish English Verbal Learning Test was used to measure episodic memory. Education, country of origin, and language usage patterns were collected at the baseline assessment and used as predictors of longitudinal trajectories of cognition. Parallel process mixed effects models were used to examine effects of education and language variables on baseline cognition and rate of cognitive decline. Mixed effects longitudinal models showed that education had strong effects on baseline global cognition and verbal memory but was not related to decline over up to 9 years of longitudinal follow-up. Differences in education effects between subgroups educated in Mexico and in the United States were minor. Monolingual-bilingual language usage was not related to cognitive decline, and bilinguals did not significantly differ from monolingual English speakers on baseline cognitive scores. Hypotheses that higher education and bilingualism protect against late life cognitive decline were not supported and education effects on late-life cognitive trajectories did not substantially differ across U.S.- and Mexico-educated groups. (PsycINFO Database Record ","387":"The primary goal of the current study was to investigate factors contributing to more negative cognitive change at older ages. Longitudinal data on 12 cognitive tests were examined in 2,637 adults ranging from 18 to 85 years of age. Because both the intervals between measurement occasions and the number of occasions varied across participants, it was possible to investigate effects of interval and number of measurement occasions on cognitive change in adults of different ages. In addition, about 1\/2 of the participants performed alternate versions of the tests on a second and third session on the first occasion, which allowed change to be monitored over intervals of less than 1 week. Regression analyses revealed that cognitive change was more negative with increases in the interval between occasions but was more positive with additional measurement occasions. Both the effects of interval and of number of measurement occasions were similar across adulthood. Increased age was associated with more positive gains over a period of a few days but was associated with more negative declines when the intervals between occasions averaged about 3 years. This combination of results suggests that longitudinal change in cognitive functioning is more negative at older ages not because of greater declines with increases in the interval between measurement occasions, or because of smaller gains with additional measurements. Instead most of the age differences in change may be due to greater losses of benefits associated with the initial assessment over intervals of months or more from the initial assessment.

We reviewed the past 25 years of literature in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, focusing on the relation and interplay of fMRI studies and studies utilizing the \"lesion method\" in human participants with focal brain damage. Our review highlights the state of localist\/connectionist research debates in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology circa 1992, and details how the introduction of fMRI into the field at that time catalyzed a new wave of efforts to map complex human behavior to specific brain regions. This, in turn, eventually evolved into many studies that focused on networks and connections between brain areas, culminating in recent years with large-scale investigations such as the Human Connectome Project. We argue that throughout the past 25 years, neuropsychology-and more precisely, the \"lesion method\" in humans-has continued to play a critical role in arbitrating conclusions and theories derived from inferred patterns of local brain activity or wide-spread connectivity from functional imaging approaches. We conclude by highlighting the future for neuropsychology in the context of an increasingly complex methodological armamentarium. (PsycINFO Database Record ","389":null,"390":"Fear generalization, the generalization of fear to innocuous stimuli, is a characteristic component of pathological anxiety. Neural models of fear generalization suggest the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, conflicting empirical findings complicate our understanding of the role of the mPFC in pathological anxiety. To address important unanswered questions in this area, a detailed review and synthesis of results from human and nonhuman animal investigations of conditioned fear generalization was conducted. Empirical articles were identified through March 2017 and selected if they used fear conditioning, measured fear generalization, and included a measure of activity in the mPFC or manipulation of mPFC functioning. In human cued fear conditioning, the ventral mPFC plays an important role in the inhibition of fear generalization, whereas dorsal mPFC is important for the activation of generalized fear. This pattern remains to be further investigated in nonhuman animal models. Nonhuman animal research suggests an interaction between the neural correlates of contextual fear generalization and timing, such that the mPFC appears to increase fear generalization at remote time points and reduce generalization at recent time points following acquisition. The literature suggests a key role for the mPFC in fear generalization, but empirical details vary depending on specific regions within the mPFC, the animal model used, and the timing of the generalization test. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of the mPFC in fear generalization, which could in turn facilitate more effective pharmacological interventions for pathological anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record ","391":"The current fMRI study examined the role of phonology in the extraction of meaning from print in each hemisphere by comparing homophonic and heterophonic homographs (ambiguous words in which both meanings have the same or different sounds respectively, e.g., bank or tear). The analysis distinguished between the first phase, in which participants read ambiguous words without context, and the second phase in which the context resolves the ambiguity. Native Hebrew readers were scanned during semantic relatedness judgments on pairs of words in which the first word was either a homophone or a heterophone and the second word was related to its dominant or subordinate meaning. In Phase 1 there was greater activation for heterophones in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), pars opercularis, and more activation for homophones in bilateral IFG pars orbitalis, suggesting that resolution of the conflict at the phonological level has abolished the semantic ambiguity for heterophones. Reduced activation for all ambiguous words in temporo-parietal regions suggests that although ambiguity enhances controlled lexical selection processes in frontal regions it reduces reliance on bottom-up mapping processes. After presentation of the context, a larger difference between the dominant and subordinate meaning was found for heterophones in all reading-related regions, suggesting a greater engagement for heterophones with the dominant meaning. Altogether these results are consistent with the prominent role of phonological processing in visual word recognition. Finally, despite differences in hemispheric asymmetry between homophones and heterophones, ambiguity resolution, even toward the subordinate meaning, is largely left lateralized. (PsycINFO Database Record ","392":"The last 25 years have seen profound changes in neurocognitive rehabilitation that continue to motivate its evolution. Although the concept of nervous system plasticity was discussed by William James (1890), the foundation for experience-based plasticity had not reached the critical empirical mass to seriously impact rehabilitation research until after 1992. The objective of this review is to describe how the emergence of neural plasticity has changed neurocognitive rehabilitation research. The important developments included (a) introduction of a widely available tool that could measure brain plasticity (i.e., functional MRI); (b) development of new structural imaging techniques that could define limits of and opportunities for neural plasticity; (c) deployment of noninvasive brain stimulation to leverage neural plasticity for rehabilitation; (d) growth of a literature indicating that exercise has positively impacts neural plasticity, especially for older persons; and (e) enhancement of neural plasticity by creating interventions that generalize beyond the boundaries of treatment activities. Given the massive literature, each of these areas is developed by example. The expanding influence of neural plasticity has provided new models and tools for neurocognitive rehabilitation in neural injuries and disorders, as well as methods for measuring neural plasticity and predicting its limits and opportunities. Early clinical trials have provided very encouraging results. Now that neural plasticity has gained a firm foothold, it will continue to influence the evolution of neurocognitive rehabilitation research for the next 25 years and advance rehabilitation for neural injuries and disease.

This Common EF factor is highly stable in adolescence through young adulthood, correlates with other important cognitive abilities, and is explained largely by genetic influences. However, little is known about Common EF beyond young adulthood. This study examines 3 hypotheses regarding the latent structure, genetic\/environmental etiology, and cognitive correlates of Common EF in middle age. We examined data from 1,284 middle-aged twins (51-60 years) in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging who completed 7 neuropsychological measures of EFs, as well as measures of general cognitive ability and processing speed. Our confirmatory factor analysis indicated that Common EF explained variation across all 7 EF tasks. Inhibition and shifting were subsumed entirely under the Common EF factor, and there was an additional working memory span-specific factor. Common EF was heritable in midlife (a2 = .46), with additional evidence for both shared environmental influences (c2 = .41) and nonshared environmental influences (e2 = .13). Higher Common EF was moderately associated with higher general cognitive ability, measured both in early adulthood and midlife, and faster processing speed in midlife. These correlations were primarily driven by shared genetic influences. These results support the hypothesis that Common EF captures similar EF abilities in midlife as in adolescence and young adulthood. However, environmental influences may explain a larger portion of variance in this construct as individuals age.

Because schizophrenia patients usually have high suicide rates and numerous studies have suggested that BDNF may contribute to the psychopathology of schizophrenia, we hypothesized that the functional polymorphism of BDNF (Val66Met) was associated with suicide attempts in patients with schizophrenia in a Chinese Han population. This polymorphism was genotyped in 825 chronic schizophrenia patients with (n = 123) and without (n = 702) suicide attempts and 445 healthy controls without a history of suicide attempts using a case-control design. The schizophrenia symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. There were no significant differences in BDNF Val66Met genotype and allele distributions between the patients and healthy controls. However, we found the Val allele (p = .023) and the Val\/Val genotypes (p = .058) to be associated with a history of suicide attempts. Moreover, some clinical characteristics, including age and cigarettes smoked each day, interacted with the BDNF gene variant and appeared to play an important role in suicide attempts among schizophrenia patients. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism itself and its interaction with some clinical variables may influence suicide attempts among schizophrenia patients.

To this end, the current study utilized a person-centered approach to examine the different profiles of cognitive impairment in an older age Chinese community sample. Additionally, the current study also examined whether functional impairments differ across the different profiles. A total of 220 older people (Mage = 70.9 years) who were assessed to have an objective impairment in any of 7 domains (immediate memory, delayed memory, attention, inhibition, verbal fluency, working memory, and processing speed) were entered in a latent class analysis. Subsequently, functional impairment (both self-reported and clinician-rated) between the different profiles of cognitive impairments that emerged from the analyses were compared. A 4-class solution was chosen based on fit statistics and interpretability. Three profiles were characterized by impairments in cognitive rigidity, memory, and other executive functions, and the 4th with impairments in both executive functions and memory. Furthermore, relative to the non-memory-impaired groups, the memory-impaired groups were significantly more likely to report a higher level of clinician-rated functional impairments even though these groups did not differ significantly in self-reported functional impairments. The observed cognitive impairments in the current sample can be classified into 4 distinct profiles along the lines of memory and\/or executive functions impairment. The memory-impaired groups were significantly impaired relative to the non-memory-impaired groups, at least in terms of clinician-rated functional outcomes. These findings present some important implications. (PsycINFO Database Record ","396":"Cognitive aging varies widely among individuals. Whereas optimal cognitive agers show highly preserved cognitive functions throughout life, other subjects experience cognitive deficits in various cognitive domains. Among them, elderly individuals frequently report difficulties in spatial navigation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether elderly participants with different cognitive profiles would perform differently at a navigation task, and explore underlying medial hippocampal activity. Two groups of elderly subjects were selected, high- and low-performing (HP and LP, respectively), based on their performance on a detailed neuropsychological examination. A group of young adults was recruited as controls. Cerebral activity was recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) during a virtual navigation task in which participants had 3 trials to find their way in mazes. We analyzed theta activity during navigation in the mazes and performed source reconstruction analyses. The LP group was less accurate than the HP group during the navigation task. Theta activity during navigation was greater in HP subjects compared with controls, whereas that theta activity was reduced in LP subjects. Moreover, theta activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus increased across trials in HP, but not in LP, subjects. Elderly participants performed differently at a navigation task according to their cognitive profile: elderly with cognitive deficits seem to have greater difficulties in spatial navigation than HP elderly. Navigational difficulties in elderly with cognitive deficits might be related to functional alteration of the parahippocampal gyrus.

This finding suggests that impaired memory hampers descriptions of scenarios more broadly. However, no such impairment in picture description in amnesic patients was observed in a related study. One key methodological difference between these studies was the complexity of the pictures to be described, hinting that group differences might be marked only if pictures are sufficiently complex to tax aspects of memory. To test this complexity hypothesis, we examined whether differences in picture description between amnesic patients and controls increase with increasing picture complexity. As in previous studies, we also assessed our participants' ability to describe imagined scenarios. Amnesic patients reported significantly fewer elements than did controls when describing pictures and imagined scenarios. The group difference in picture description was significantly larger for complex than for simple pictures. Although variations in lesion sites might have accounted for the aforementioned cross-study differences in picture description in amnesic patients, our results suggest that, at least in amnesic patients with extramedial temporal lobe lesions, the complexity of pictures can determine whether or not a (substantial) picture-description deficit is observed. We interpret these findings in terms of a narrative-construction deficit. We hypothesize that, whereas brief narrative can be constructed via nonmemory cognitive processes, the construction of more detailed narrative depends upon intact functioning of a temporary memory system, such as the episodic buffer.

However, the question of whether recently acquired knowledge is more impaired than remotely acquired knowledge remains a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of semantic memory impairment in aMCI and AD by investigating 2 factors that may influence the retrieval of such knowledge, namely remoteness and frequency of repetition of information over time. Three groups (19 controls, 20 aMCI, and 20 AD patients) were compared on a test assessing general and specific biographical knowledge about famous people, where the period of acquired fame (remote vs. recent) and the type of fame (enduring vs. transient) were controlled for. Global performance of aMCI and AD patients was significantly poorer than that of controls. However, different patterns of recall were observed as a function of time and type of fame. A temporal gradient was found in both patient groups for enduring names but not for transient ones, whereby knowledge about remote enduring famous persons was better recalled. Patients were more impaired at questions assessing specific biographical knowledge (unique to an individual) than more general knowledge. Tests of famous people knowledge offer a unique opportunity to investigate semantic deficits in aMCI and AD, because they make it possible to estimate the time at which memories were acquired, as well as the type of fame.

Fasting blood samples were used to detect serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels along with ApoE4 status. DTI was used to determine whole brain fractional anisotropy (FA). Composite executive and memory scores were derived from item response theory. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores provided informant-based measures of daily functioning. Triglyceride levels were inversely correlated with executive function, but there was no relationship with memory. Controlling for age, gender, and education did not affect this correlation. This relationship persisted after controlling for vascular risk factors like LDL, total cholesterol, CDR and ApoE4 status. Lastly, adding whole-brain FA to the model did not affect the correlation between triglycerides and executive function. Triglyceride levels are inversely correlated with executive function in nondemented elderly adults after controlling for age, education, gender, total cholesterol, LDL, ApoE4 status, CDR, and white-matter microstructure.

The PD and HC groups were matched on cognitive ability, depression, and mood. We also explored possible relationships between task results and antiparkinsonian treatment effects, as measured by levodopa equivalent dosages (LED), in the PD group. The results show that PD patients use a larger emotional range compared with HCs when reporting their impression of emotional faces on rated emotional valence, arousal, and potency. The results also show that dopaminergic therapy was correlated with stimulus rating results such that PD patients with higher LED scores rated negative faces as less arousing, less negative, and less powerful. Finally, results also show that PD patients display a general slowing effect in the visual search tasks compared with HCs, indicating overall slowed responses. There were no group differences observed in the STM or categorical perception tasks. Our results indicate a relationship between emotional responses, PD, and dopaminergic therapy, in which PD per se is associated with stronger emotional responses, whereas LED levels are negatively correlated with the strength of emotional responses.

Soon after injury and at the longer term follow-up, families completed measures of parental psychological distress, family functioning, and quality of the home environment. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined group differences in academic outcomes and their associations with measures of the early and later family environment. The severe TBI group, but not the moderate TBI group, performed worse than did the OI group on all achievement tests, parent ratings of academic performance, and teacher ratings of internalizing problems. Higher quality early and late home environments predicted stronger academic skills and better classroom behavior for children with both TBI and OI. The early family environment more consistently predicted academic achievement, whereas the later family environment more consistently predicted classroom functioning. The quality of the home environment predicted academic outcomes more strongly than did parental psychological distress or family functioning. TBI in early childhood has long-term consequences for academic achievement and school performance and behavior.

Fifty-eight patients with stroke and 22 healthy controls matched in age, gender, and education level underwent robust neuropsychological examination of their pragmatic abilities, executive functions, attention, memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial abilities as well as a cognitive and affective ToM assessment. Patients with stroke demonstrated impaired performance in all ToM tasks. While pragmatic competence and, to a lesser degree, executive functions had the strongest contribution to ToM impairments, attention and general cognitive functioning did not directly affect mentalizing abilities, as demonstrated by a path analysis. Our study reveals the different roles of cognitive functions in cognitive and affective components of ToM. Executive functions contributed only to the cognitive components of ToM. Deficits in cognitive aspects of ToM are best explained by impairment of pragmatic competence and executive functions. In contrast, executive dysfunction does not affect the ability to understand the affective mental states of others.

Boliek (Neuropsychology, 2016[May], Vol 30[4], 385-397). In the article, the fifth author's name [Bakhtiari] was misspelled. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-49069-001.) Objective: The neural circuitry associated with language processing is complex and dynamic. Graphical models are useful for studying complex neural networks as this method provides information about unique connectivity between regions within the context of the entire network of interest. Here, the authors explored the neural networks during covert reading to determine the role of feedforward and feedback loops in covert speech production. Brain activity of skilled adult readers was assessed in real word and pseudoword reading tasks with functional MRI (fMRI). The authors provide evidence for activity coherence in the feedforward system (inferior frontal gyrus-supplementary motor area) during real word reading and in the feedback system (supramarginal gyrus-precentral gyrus) during pseudoword reading. Graphical models provided evidence of an extensive, highly connected, neural network when individuals read real words that relied on coordination of the feedforward system. In contrast, when individuals read pseudowords the authors found a limited\/restricted network that relied on coordination of the feedback system. Together, these results underscore the importance of considering multiple pathways and articulatory loops during language tasks and provide evidence for a print-to-speech neural network. (PsycINFO Database Record ","410":"Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been conceptualized as a motor disorder, but nonmotor symptoms also manifest in the disease and significantly reduce quality of life. Anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are prevalent nonmotor symptoms, even in early disease stages, but the relation between these symptoms remains poorly understood. We examined self-reported anxiety and neurocognitive function, indexed by measures of executive function (set-shifting and phonemic fluency), categorical fluency, and attention\/working memory. We hypothesized that anxiety would correlate with cognitive performance. The Beck Anxiety Inventory and cognitive tests (Trail Making, Verbal Fluency, Digit Span) were administered to 77 nondemented adults with mild to moderate idiopathic PD (39 men, 38 women; Mage = 62.9 years). Higher anxiety was associated with more advanced disease stage and severity and with poorer set-shifting when using a derived metric to account for motoric slowing. Depression correlated with greater anxiety and disease severity, but not with cognitive performance. Our findings support the association of anxiety with a specific domain of executive function, set-shifting, in nondemented individuals with mild to moderate PD, raising the possibility that treatment of anxiety may alleviate aspects of executive dysfunction in this population. (PsycINFO Database Record ","411":"Cognitive deficits are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and exacerbate the functional limitations imposed by PD's hallmark motor symptoms, including impairments in walking. Though much research has addressed the effect of dual cognitive-locomotor tasks on walking, less is known about their effect on cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between gait and executive function, with the hypothesis that dual tasking would exacerbate cognitive vulnerabilities in PD as well as being associated with gait disturbances. Nineteen individuals with mild-moderate PD without dementia and 13 age- and education-matched normal control adults (NC) participated. Executive function (set-shifting) and walking were assessed singly and during dual tasking. Dual tasking had a significant effect on cognition (reduced set-shifting) and on walking (speed, stride length) for both PD and NC, and also on stride frequency for PD only. The impact of dual tasking on walking speed and stride frequency was significantly greater for PD than NC. Though the group by condition interaction was not significant, PD had fewer set-shifts than NC on dual task. Further, relative to NC, PD showed significantly greater variability in cognitive performance under dual tasking, whereas variability in motor performance remained unaffected by dual tasking. Dual tasking had a significantly greater effect in PD than in NC on cognition as well as on walking. The results suggest that assessment and treatment of PD should consider the cognitive as well as the gait components of PD-related deficits under dual-task conditions.

The aim of this study was to explore the progression of the rehabilitation of motor deficits in a chronic stroke patient for a period of 7 months. A reversal design (ABAB) was implemented in a chronic stroke patient where no treatment was provided in the A periods and MST was applied in the B periods. Each period comprised of 4 weeks and an extensive evaluation of the motor function using clinical motor tests and 3D movement analysis was performed weekly. During the MST periods, a keyboard task was recorded daily. A follow-up evaluation was performed 3 months after the second MST treatment. Improvements were observed during the first sessions in the keyboard task but clinical gains were noticeable only at the end of the first treatment and during the second treatment period. These gains were maintained in the follow-up evaluation. This is the first study examining the pattern of motor recovery progression in MST, evidencing that gradual and continuous motor improvements are possible with the repeated application of MST training. Fast-acquisition in specific motor abilities was observed at the beginning of the MST training but generalization of these improvements to other motor tasks took place at the end or when another treatment period was provided.

Sixteen children with DS who did not recite the count list participated in Experiment 1, along with 2 comparison groups: 1 of 16 children with DS who recited up to 10, paired by chronological age, and another of 16 typically developing children paired by their ability to recite the list. The understanding of the principle was evaluated by a preferential looking task. Children saw 1 of 2 conditions. In the number condition, they heard number words and in the beep condition they heard computerized beeps. In both conditions, children saw videos depicting counting events that were principle-consistent or principle-inconsistent. Experiment 2 evaluated 25 children with DS using the Give-a-Number task and the Receptive Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III. In Experiment 1, children in the number condition preferred principle-consistent videos, independent of their ability to recite the count list. Experiment 2 showed a strong correlation between number word knowledge and receptive vocabulary scores, independent of chronological age. The results suggest that the difficulty of children with DS in acquiring counting ability might not reflect a lack of understanding of the one-to-one correspondence principle, but might instead be related to vocabulary development.

However, research shows that people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), who are at a higher risk of developing the disease than healthy controls, are particularly impaired in remembering to do things in the future or prospective memory (PM). The aim of this study was to establish which type of event-based PM is particularly disrupted in aMCI, focal PM, based on spontaneous retrieval, or nonfocal PM that relies on strategic monitoring processes. Thirty-eight aMCI individuals and 46 age- and education-matched healthy older adults identified the profession of each famous face presented (ongoing task) and, additionally, responded to certain professions (focal PM condition), or to certain physical features of a person presented (nonfocal PM). Only 4 aMCI individuals could not remember PM instructions at the end of the session, and were excluded from analyses. In comparison with healthy controls, participants with aMCI were significantly impaired in the focal PM task, but not on the nonfocal task. In both groups, monitoring indices were significantly higher in the nonfocal than focal PM condition. The results fully replicate and extend initial findings of Chi et al. (2014) and McDaniel, Shelton, Breneiser, Moynan, and Balota (2011), showing substantial spontaneous retrieval deficits in PM performance of aMCI individuals. Possible brain mechanisms involved in this deficit are discussed and a novel hypothesis of more generic spontaneous retrieval deficits in aMCI is proposed.

To explore affective and cognitive ToM and their neuropsychological correlates in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). Forty MS patients and 40 matched control individuals underwent tasks assessing cognitive (the ToM Pictures Sequencing Task and the Advanced Test of ToM) and affective ToM (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task and the Emotion Attribution Task), in both verbal and nonverbal modality, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, and questionnaires for behavioral disorders. MS patients performed significantly worse than controls on tasks assessing cognitive and affective ToM, in verbal and nonverbal modality. Moreover, MS patients achieved significantly lower scores on tests assessing visuospatial learning and speed of spatial information processing, and significantly higher scores on scales for alexithymia and depression with respect to controls. After covarying for cognitive and behavioral variables different in the 2 groups, the differences between patients and controls on ToM tasks remained significant. ToM abilities were significantly related to executive functions, but not to depressive, anxious and apathetic symptoms. Higher alexithymia scores were associated with poor recognition of others' mental states. The findings demonstrated that both affective and cognitive aspects of ToM are impaired in nondemented and mildly to moderately disabled MS and suggest that impaired social cognition can occur independently from behavioral disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record ","416":"Evidence from several cross-sectional studies indicates that an increase in omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) may negatively affect cognition in old age. The hippocampus is among the first neural structures affected by age and atrophy in this brain region is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we hypothesized that a lower omega-6:3 FA ratio would predict better hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and a higher general cognitive status. Fifty-two healthy older adults completed a Food Frequency Questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA; a test of global cognition) and virtual navigation tasks that assess navigational strategies and spatial memory. In this cross-sectional study, a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 FA intake strongly predicted more accurate hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and faster learning on our virtual navigation tasks, as well as higher cognitive status overall. These results may help elucidate why certain dietary patterns with a lower omega-6:3 FA ratio, like the Mediterranean diet, are associated with reduced risk of cognitive decline.

We focus on sustained attention, which plays a critical role in driving cognitive growth, and use an innovative, gaze-based task that minimizes demands on the limited verbal and motor abilities associated with RTT. The task required the ability to sustain attention on a visual target (a butterfly) while inhibiting a prepotent response to look to moving distractors (trees and clouds) presented in the peripheral visual field. The sample included children with RTT (N = 32) and their typically developing (TD) counterparts (N = 32), aged 2-12 years. Our findings revealed that children with RTT had more difficulty sustaining attention (with the TD group averaging 60% looking at the butterfly vs. only 25% for the RTT group). Furthermore, RTT was associated with difficulties in 3 fundamental factors influencing sustained attention: engagement, distractibility, and reengagement. The RTT group was slower to engage, more distractible, and slower to reengage. Our findings identify a fundamental disruption to sustained attention in RTT, determine factors related to this impairment, and pinpoint cognitive areas that could serve as markers for evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacological and behavioral interventions.

Forty-nine preoperative brain tumor patients completed a new testing protocol (the BLAST) which assesses 8 well documented, \"core\" cognitive skills required for language: auditory word recognition, accessing semantic knowledge, lexical selection, phonological encoding, verbal short-term memory, goal-driven language selection, verb retrieval, and articulatory-motor planning. Patients were unselected with respect to lesion location. A surprising 65% of patients scored below controls on at least 1 core skill. Patients with left temporal tumors, as a group, had lower scores than the remaining patients on phonological encoding, accessing semantic knowledge and verbal short-term memory (STM). Those with left frontal tumors had the lowest scores on articulatory-motor planning. These findings are broadly consistent with previous studies examining the anatomical substrates of our \"core\" cognitive processes. We conclude that selective impairments in key language skills are common in brain tumor patients, but many of these are not adequately assessed on conventional aphasia assessments. Our protocol may provide a useful resource for preoperative, postoperative and intraoperative language assessment in this population.

Moreover, both processes activate similar brain regions within the parietal cortex, in particular, the intraparietal sulcus; however, it is still unclear whether the neuronal underpinnings of VSTM directly correlate with mathematical operation and reasoning abilities. The main objective was to investigate the association between parieto-occipital brain activity during the retention period of a VSTM task and performance in mathematics. The authors measured mathematical abilities and VSTM capacity as well as brain activity during memory maintenance using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 19 healthy adult participants. Event-related magnetic fields (ERFs) were computed on the MEG data. Linear regressions were used to estimate the strength of the relation between VSTM related brain activity and mathematical abilities. The amplitude of parieto-occipital cerebral activity during the retention of visual information was related to performance in 2 standardized mathematical tasks: mathematical reasoning and calculation fluency. The findings show that brain activity during retention period of a VSTM task is associated with mathematical abilities. Contributions of VSTM processes to numerical cognition should be considered in cognitive interventions.

A community-based sample of 646 Italian children aged 6-11 years was assessed with a comprehensive battery of language and cognitive tests. A mediation analysis was used to examine whether memory mediates environmental\/biological effects on language.

Patients with the AHS typically complain about a loss of agency associated with a feeling of estrangement for actions performed by the affected limb. The present study explores the integrity of the body representation in AHS, focusing on 2 main processes: multisensory integration and visual self-recognition of body parts. Three patients affected by AHS following a right-hemisphere stroke, with clinical symptoms akin to the posterior variant of AHS, were tested and their performance was compared with that of 18 age-matched healthy controls. AHS patients and controls underwent 2 experimental tasks: a same-different visual matching task for body postures, which assessed the ability of using your own body schema for encoding others' body postural changes (Experiment 1), and an explicit self-hand recognition task, which assessed the ability to visually recognize your own hands (Experiment 2). As compared to controls, all AHS patients were unable to access a reliable multisensory representation of their alien hand and use it for decoding others' postural changes; however, they could rely on an efficient multisensory representation of their intact (ipsilesional) hand. Two AHS patients also presented with a specific impairment in the visual self-recognition of their alien hand, but normal recognition of their intact hand. This evidence suggests that the AHS following a right-hemisphere stroke may involve a disruption of the multisensory representation of the alien limb; instead, self-hand recognition mechanisms may be spared.

However, although CPs' abnormal gaze behavior for upright faces has already been demonstrated, neither their scanning strategy for inverted faces, nor the possibility that their abnormal gaze behavior with upright faces is because of reasons other than the holistic deficit have been investigated yet. We recorded the eye movements of a congenital prosopagnosic and a control group during the encoding of unknown faces, objects, and flowers. Two types of stimuli (faces and objects) were presented upright and inverted. CPs explored upright and inverted faces in the same way (i.e., similar number of fixations of the same duration and similarly distributed), whereas controls increased the number of fixations and their duration during the presentation of inverted faces. By contrast, the 2 groups showed a similar inversion effect during the encoding of objects. Finally, CPs showed anomalous exploration of within-class objects (i.e., flowers) and impairment in subordinate-level object discrimination. Our results demonstrate that: (a) CPs use the same part-based strategy in encoding both upright and inverted faces, suggesting a possible interpretation of the lack of inversion effect in this population; (b) CPs' lack of inversion effect is face-specific and does not affect objects; (c) however, CPs' deficit seems not to be limited to faces, and to extend to individual-item recognition within a class.

Predictive validity of cognitive clusters in relation to symptoms and functioning was also investigated. A comprehensive cognitive battery was administered to 133 FEP participants and 46 healthy controls. Ward's method hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis with k-means verification was used to determine clusters. Clusters were externally validated and 6-month predictive validity was also examined. Three distinct clusters were identified and were defined by degree of impairment rather than specific deficit profiles. Social-cognitive performance mirrored neurocognitive performance in each cluster. Cluster 1 was characterized by significant widespread cognitive impairments (1-2 SD below the mean) and solely comprised FEP participants (n = 24). Cluster 2 suggested moderately impaired cognitive functioning (within 0.5 SD below the mean), and comprised mostly FEP participants and 2 healthy controls (n = 73). Cluster 3 showed a pattern of cognitively intact performance across domains and comprised 37 FEP participants and 44 healthy controls (n = 81). Premorbid IQ, negative symptom severity, and functioning were significantly associated with cluster membership at baseline. At 6-month follow-up, cluster membership remained significantly associated with negative symptoms and functioning. The heterogeneity of cognition in FEP may be based on degree of impairment across both neurocognitive and social-cognitive domains. Cognitive clusters were associated with symptom and functional outcome, suggesting that measurement of cognition at entry to treatment may be useful for prognosis and treatment.

We investigated the hemispheric processing of metaphors in 24 adult participants diagnosed with ADHD and 24 control participants. The hemispheric processing was examined using a divided visual field paradigm, in which different kinds of metaphors as well as literal word pairs and unrelated word pairs were presented either to the right visual field\/left hemisphere (RVF\/LH) or to the left visual field\/right hemisphere (LVF\/RH). Control participants processed metaphors more efficiently when presented in the LVF\/RH than when presented in the RVF\/LH, whereas participants with ADHD demonstrated attenuated asymmetry of hemispheric processing. Furthermore, asymmetry of hemispheric processing, together with sustained attention, contributed significantly to the prediction of self-report of ADHD symptoms. Our results suggest that the hemispheric processing of adults with ADHD is less lateralized than the hemispheric processing of control participants. Moreover, the diminished lateralization of metaphor processing along with deficient sustained attention may reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms underlying ADHD and as such our results support multiple pathway models of ADHD.

Neuropsychological data showing that brain-damaged patients with left neglect experience difficulties in solving subtraction but not addition problems support this hypothesis. However, the reverse dissociation is needed to establish the causal role of spatial attention in mental arithmetic. R.H., a 65-year-old left-brain-damaged patient exhibiting right unilateral visuospatial and representational neglect, was tested with various numerical tasks including numerical comparison, arithmetic problem-solving, and numerical interval bisection. In numerical comparison, R.H. showed a selective response latency increase when judging numbers larger than the references whereas his performance was normal for numbers smaller than the references. In the arithmetic task, R.H. was impaired in solving addition but not subtraction problems. In contrast, performance in number bisection shows a deviation toward larger numbers. These results establish a double dissociation between subtraction and addition solving in patients with left versus right neglect and demonstrate clear evidence that attentional mechanisms are crucial for mental arithmetic. We suggest that attention shifts are involved whenever a number is represented relative to another on a mental continuum, be it during numerical comparison or arithmetic problem-solving. R.H.'s performance in numerical interval bisection indicates that this task involves processes that are distinct from those involved in number comparison and mental arithmetic.

A total of 288 HIV-infected persons underwent standardized neuropsychological testing. Participants were profiled based on neuropsychological and clinical assessments into 2 groups, neurocognitively normal (NN, n = 205) and HAND (n = 83). Risk-based decision-making was assessed via the Game of Dice Task (GDT). Sample characteristics were summarized by principal component analysis (PCA) prior to regression analyses predicting GDT performance. The NN group performed within the normative range of the GDT, but the HAND group was impaired in all GDT measures. Across all participants, GDT performance was predicted by a combination of psychiatric comorbidities, alcohol abuse, education\/premorbid IQ, and neuropsychological performance. Further analyses revealed marijuana use as an important additional predictor of impaired GDT performance. Within the GDT-impaired HAND group only, past or present immunosuppression emerged as the most robust predictor of GDT performance. Metabolic disorders and antiretroviral toxicity were also predictors of GDT performance in the HAND group. The majority of HIV-infected individuals were unimpaired in the GDT. Some influence of psychiatric and substance use comorbidities on GDT performance emerged in the entire cohort. However, GDT deficits were restricted to individuals with HAND, related to immunosuppression, metabolic disorders and antiretroviral toxicity in this group only.

Performance normality was defined using normative data for 8 basic California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 2000) recall and recognition trials. Schizophrenia patients (n = 155) and healthy control participants (n = 74) were assessed for performance normality, defined as scores within 1 SD of the normative mean on all 8 trials, and assigned to normal- and below-NR memory groups. NR schizophrenia patients (n = 26) and control participants (n = 51) did not differ in general verbal ability, on a reading-based estimate of premorbid ability, across all 8 CVLT-II-score comparisons or in terms of intrusion and false-positive errors and auditory working memory. NR memory patients did not differ from memory-impaired patients (n = 129) in symptom severity, and both patient groups were significantly and similarly disabled in terms of functional status in the community. These results confirm a subpopulation of schizophrenia patients with normal, verbal-declarative-memory performance and no evidence of decline from higher premorbid ability levels.

Resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were analyzed by sample entropy and multiscale entropy methods in 10 children with Tourette syndrome and 10 healthy gender- and age-matched controls. Except for the Fp2 channel, the complexity index values in all channels were reduced in children with Tourette syndrome compared with those in normal controls. A statistically significant reduction in EEG complexity was found in the bilateral central, parietal, occipital, and left temporal regions, indicating disturbed brain connectivity in Tourette syndrome. Although there was no difference of complexity in the higher frequency spectra, there was a statistically significant difference of complexity in lower frequency in F3 channel, pointing to the importance of examining a range of time scales in exploring EEG signals. Our preliminary study demonstrated that EEG complexity was significantly lower in children with Tourette syndrome than in normal controls. This difference may serve as a marker of disturbed brain connectivity in such individuals and suggests that further clinical studies are warranted.

The authors investigated facial emotion recognition, face scan paths, and face perception in 29 children with NF1 compared to 29 chronological age-matched typically developing controls. Correlations between facial emotion recognition, face scan paths, and face perception in children with NF1 were examined. Children with NF1 displayed significantly poorer recognition of fearful expressions compared to controls, as well as a nonsignificant trend toward poorer recognition of anger. Although there was no significant difference between groups in time spent viewing individual core facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, and nonfeature regions), children with NF1 spent significantly less time than controls viewing the face as a whole. Children with NF1 also displayed significantly poorer face perception abilities than typically developing controls. Facial emotion recognition deficits were not significantly associated with aberrant face scan paths or face perception abilities in the NF1 group. These results suggest that impairments in the perception, identification, and interpretation of information from faces are important aspects of the social-cognitive phenotype of NF1.

Twenty-two PD patients and 17 healthy adults performed an automatic affective priming task while ERPs were recorded using 128 channels. Prime-target word pairs of negative or neutral valence were presented at a stimulus onset asynchrony of 250 ms. Participants were asked to evaluate the valence of the target word by button press. A larger N400 amplitude for incongruent compared with congruent neutral targets was observed at right central and parietal regions and did not differ between PD and controls. PD and controls also displayed larger P300 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for negative compared with neutral targets at central parietal and right frontal regions. In contrast, whereas controls showed a larger slow negative wave (SNW) for negative targets compared with neutral targets at left frontal and left central regions, PD group demonstrated a significant reduction in SNW amplitude difference at the left central region. N400 is intact in PD when processing evaluative judgments of emotional words. P300 and LPP were also intact in PD. The altered left central SNW in PD suggests an ERP marker for emotional dysfunction in PD.

In light of prior evidence indicating that lateralization of cognitive functions (such as language) may depend on normal visual development, we investigated whether the lack of prior visual experience would have an impact on the development of specialized hemispheric lateralization in emotional processing. We addressed this issue by comparing performance in early blind and sighted controls on a dichotic listening task requiring the detection of specific emotional vocalizations (i.e., suggestive of happiness or sadness) presented independently to either ear. Consistent with previous studies, we found that sighted individuals showed enhanced detection of positive vocalizations when presented in the right ear (i.e., processed within the left hemisphere) and negative vocalizations when presented in the left ear (i.e., right hemisphere). It is interesting to note that although blind individuals were as accurate as sighted controls in detecting the valance of the vocalization, performance was not consistent with any pattern of specialized hemispheric lateralization. Overall, these results suggest that although the lack of prior visual experience may not lead to impaired emotion processing performance, the underlying neurophysiological substrate (i.e., degree of special hemispheric lateralization) may depend on normal visual development.

Age-matched boys (ages 8-12 years) with (n = 20) and without (n = 20) ADHD completed 1 experimental (phonological) and 2 clinical (digit span, letter-number sequencing) WM measures. The use of partial scoring procedures, administration of greater trial numbers, and high central executive demands yielded moderate-to-large between-groups effect sizes. Moreover, the combination of these best-case procedures, compared to worst-case procedures (i.e., absolute scoring, administration of few trials, use of discontinue rules, and low central executive demands), resulted in a 12.5% increase in correct group classification. Collectively, these findings explain inconsistent ADHD-related WM deficits in previous reports, and highlight the need for revised clinical measures that utilize best-case procedures.

However, because earlier studies relied on multidetermined attentional tasks, uncertainty still abounds regarding the differential deficit across attentional subcomponents. Likewise, the evolution of these deficits during the successive stages of HD remains unclear. The present study simultaneously explored 3 distinct networks of attention (alerting, orienting, executive conflict) in preclinical and clinical HD. Thirty-eight HD patients (18 preclinical) and 38 matched healthy controls completed the attention network test, an integrated and theoretically grounded task assessing the integrity of 3 attentional networks. Preclinical HD was not characterized by any attentional deficit compared to controls. Conversely, clinical HD was associated with a differential deficit across the 3 attentional networks under investigation, showing preserved performance for alerting and orienting networks but massive and specific impairment for the executive conflict network. This indexes an impaired use of executive control to resolve the conflict between task-relevant stimuli and interfering task-irrelevant ones. Clinical HD does not lead to a global attentional deficit but rather to a specific impairment for the executive control of attention. Moreover, the absence of attentional deficits in preclinical HD suggests that these deficits are absent at the initial stages of the disease. In view of their impact on everyday life, attentional deficits should be considered in clinical contexts. Therapeutic programs improving the executive control of attention by neuropsychology and neuromodulation should be promoted.

On the 7-day verbal memory free recall, left discordant performed significantly worse than controls and right concordant, recognized fewer words, and had more recognition errors than all other groups, including left concordant. For nonverbal memory, right discordant performed significantly worse than controls on delayed recall, and attained lower scores than other groups on immediate and 7-day recall, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Left discordant had higher scores of memory complaints than controls and disclosed a trend toward accentuated memory impairment compared with the other groups over time. Our results suggest that contralateral electrographic involvement in uMTS was associated with more pronounced memory impairment for verbal material in left discordant patients, and to a lesser extent, for nonverbal material in right discordant patients. Left discordant group also had increased memory complaints. (PsycINFO Database Record ","437":"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), leading to its accumulation in the brain. Phe levels can be controlled following a protein-free diet, but cognitive impairments are still present. A number of questions remain to be answered related to which type of metabolic control is important, the age when it is important, the cognitive functions which are most affected and, the best tests to use to monitor cognitive health. We investigated the impact of metabolic control at different ages on cognitive performance in 37 early treated adults with PKU. (a) Phe variation was as associated to performance as average Phe showing that stable dietary control is as important as strict control; (b) For some tasks, current and adult Phe were stronger predictors of performance than childhood or adolescent Phe, showing the importance of a strict diet even in adulthood; and (c) The relationship between performance and Phe levels varied depending on time and cognitive domain. For some functions (sustained attention, visuomotor coordination), Phe at the time of testing was the best predictor. While for other functions (visual attention, executive functions) there was a diminishing or stable relationship across time. Results show the importance of selecting the right tasks to monitor outcomes across ages, but also that the impact of bio-chemical disruptions is different for different functions, at different ages. We show how inherited metabolic diseases offer us a unique vantage point to inform our understanding of brain development and functioning.

The aim of this study was to verify whether the cerebellum mediates the processing of navigational sequential information and to determine whether it is influenced by the modality of the stimuli presentation. We tested 12 cerebellar patients and 12 healthy age-matched participants in 2 comparable navigational tasks (Walking Corsi Test and the Magic Carpet) requiring to memorizing a sequence of spatial locations. The 2 tasks differ each other for the modality of stimuli presentation: in the Walking Corsi Test the sequence is shown by an examiner that walks on the carpet, whereas in the Magic Carpet it is shown by a computer that lights up the tiles in the sequence. We hypothesize that different mental processes are implicated between the Walking Corsi Test and the Magic Carpet. Indeed, whereas watching the examiner, who performs the sequence on the carpet, allows the patient to simulate the action mentally in the Walking Corsi Test, such simulation cannot be triggered in the Magic Carpet. Our results showed that cerebellar patients obtained scores significantly lower than control participants only in the Magic Carpet. We interpreted the patients' performance as a specific deficit in detecting and ordering single independent stimuli as a sequence, when the maintenance of stimulus-response associations is more demanding. (PsycINFO Database Record ","439":"Recollection and familiarity are independent processes that contribute to memory performance. Recollection is dependent on attentional control, which has been shown to be disrupted in early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas familiarity is independent of attention. The present longitudinal study examines the sensitivity of recollection estimates based on Jacoby's (1991) process dissociation procedure to AD-related biomarkers in a large sample of well-characterized cognitively normal middle-aged and older adults (N = 519) and the extent to which recollection discriminates these individuals from individuals with very mild symptomatic AD (N = 64). Participants studied word pairs (e.g., knee bone), then completed a primed, explicit, cued fragment-completion memory task (e.g., knee b_n_). Primes were either congruent with the correct response (e.g., bone), incongruent (e.g., bend), or neutral (e.g., &amp;&amp;&amp;). This design allowed for the estimation of independent contributions of recollection and familiarity processes, using the process dissociation procedure. Recollection, but not familiarity, was impaired in healthy aging and in very mild AD. Recollection discriminated cognitively normal individuals from the earliest detectable stage of symptomatic AD above and beyond standard psychometric tests. In cognitively normal individuals, baseline CSF measures indicative of AD pathology were related to lower initial recollection and less practice-related improvement in recollection over time. Finally, presence of amyloid plaques, as imaged by PIB-PET, was also related to less improvement in recollection over time. These findings suggest that attention-demanding memory processes, such as recollection, may be particularly sensitive to both symptomatic and preclinical AD pathology.

Duration is an important feature to be defined, as it may contribute to heterogeneous outcome. This study compares 2 treatment durations, 3 versus 6 months, to analyze their effects on both cognition and daily functioning. Fifty-seven outpatients with schizophrenia received 3 months of CACR and 41 received 6 months of CACR. All patients were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months with the Brief Assessment for Cognition in Schizophrenia and with the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Repeated measures ANOVA showed significant improvements in all cognitive domains after 3 months. A significant effect of treatment duration was observed only for executive functions, with significantly higher scores among patients treated for 6 months. Significant improvements in QLS were also observed after 6 months in both groups, with a significant time by treatment interaction for QLS Total Score. Results confirm the efficacy of 3-months CACR in terms of both cognitive and functional improvements, suggesting that an extended intervention may lead to further benefits in executive functions and daily functioning.

The goals of the current longitudinal study were to determine whether these findings are the result of a brain-injury-specific effect or rather a general-injury effect, to examine the long-term evolution of ToM skills following preschool mTBI, as well as to investigate the links between ToM abilities and general social functioning. Seventy-two children who sustained mTBI between the ages of 18 and 60 months were evaluated 6 and 18 months postinjury on ToM tasks including desires and emotions reasoning and false belief understanding. They were compared with 58 participants who sustained an orthopedic injury (OI) and 83 typically developing children (TDC). The 3 groups did not differ on demographic and baseline characteristics. The mTBI group obtained poorer scores relative to both comparison groups on the desires and emotions reasoning task, both at 6 and 18 months injury. No correlations were found between injury characteristics and ToM performance. For the mTBI group, associations were found between ToM performance and global social competence. These findings suggest a brain-injury-specific effect that persists in the long-term following mTBI in preschool children. (PsycINFO Database Record ","444":"Interest continues in neuropsychological measures as cross-disorder intermediate phenotypes in understanding psychopathology. A central question concerns their specificity versus generalizability to particular forms of psychopathology, particularly for executive functioning (EF) and response speed. Three conceptual models examining these relationships were tested to clarify this picture at different levels in the diagnostic hierarchy. Participants (total n = 641, age 18-60) yielded complete structured diagnostic interviews and a neuropsychological test battery comprising measures of executive function, processing speed, and IQ. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance, linear regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test (a) a specificity model, which proposes that individual disorders are associated with component EF processes and speed; (b) a severity model, which proposes that the total number of comorbid disorders explain poor EF and\/or slow speed; and (c) a higher-order dimensional model, which proposes that internalizing versus externalizing disorders are differentially related to EF or speed. EF effects were best explained by a specificity model, with distinct aspects of EF related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder versus antisocial substance use disorders. Speed, on the other hand, emerged as a general indicator of externalizing psychopathology in the dimensional model, as well as overall severity of psychopathology in the severity model. Granular approaches are likely to be most productive for linking EF to psychopathology, whereas response speed has underused potential as an endophenotype for psychopathology liability. Results are discussed in terms of an integrated conceptualization of neuropsychological processes and putative neural systems involved in general and specific aspects of psychopathology.

PKU can be effectively treated with a low phenylalanine diet, but some cognitive deficits remain. Studies have reported impairments, especially for processing speed and executive functions, but there is a lack of comprehensive assessment across cognitive domains. Moreover, it is important to establish outcomes in early treated adults with PKU (AwPKU) who have better metabolic control than groups previously reported in the literature. We tested 37 AwPKU with an unprecedented number of tasks (N = 28) and measures (N = 44) and compared results with 30 controls matched for age and education. We found (a) group impairments, particularly in tasks tapping speed of processing and complex executive functions; (b) high variability across participants, with a sizable number of AwPKU with completely normal performance (about 38%); (c) but also a sizable number of participants who were clearly impaired (about 24%); and (d) good performance in tasks tapping verbal learning, verbal memory and orthographic processing, indicating no generalized learning impairment.

Recently abstinent cocaine users (N = 113) completed measures sensitive to the effects of cocaine on cognition: Conners' Continuous Performance Task-II (CPT-II), n-back working memory test, and Hopkins Verbal Learning Task-Revised (HVLT-R). Premorbid IQ was calculated using the Oklahoma Premorbid Intelligence Estimate, which integrates scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and demographic variables. Participants were grouped according to their premorbid IQ using commonly accepted classifications of ability level (above average [&gt;110], average [90-109], and below average [&lt;90]) and comparisons in neurocognitive performance were performed using one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were detected between groups on the HVLT-R including Trial 1 (p = .002), total word recall across the 3 list-learning trials (p &lt; .001), and recall following a delay (p &lt; .001). Significant differences were also detected on the N-back, including auditory and visual accuracy (p = .022 and p &lt; .001, respectively) and mean and maximum block length (p &lt; .001). Although significant differences were observed between the above average and average groups (mean effect size = .418 [Cohen's d]), the magnitude of group differences was greatest between the average and below average groups (mean effect size = .716). These results raise questions as to whether the neurocognitive impairment observed in individuals diagnosed with CUD predated the onset of cocaine use or whether the impairments were caused by cocaine use. Because these impairments are potential risk factors for poor treatment outcomes, it is important to consider the need to modify treatment programs to account for lower premorbid IQ.

However, given the 50% lifetime prevalence rate of depression in MS, it may be useful to consider not only currently depressed versus nondepressed patients, but to evaluate groups that better characterize the complexity of MS depression. The objective of the current study was to examine demographic, cognitive, illness, and psychosocial variables thought to associate with depression in MS across 3 groups: currently depressed, remitted depression, and never been depressed. Fifty-four individuals with MS were examined. Current depression status was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 2000). Past depression was evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-IV; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1998) and a semistructured psychosocial interview. The results of the current study show that evaluating depression in 3 groups is useful for exploring risk, protective, and compensatory factors of depression in MS. A consistent grouping pattern (e.g., the remitted depression group always functioning the same as the never been depressed group) was not found among the variables examined; rather, several different patterns were observed. Several of these patterns revealed differences between the remitted depression and never been depressed groups; these differences would not have been observed had these 2 groups been combined into a \"not currently depressed\" group. These different patterns yield important information about the complex relationships of depression in MS that may be obscured when depression is viewed as a binary construct.

In this study, we sought to (a) confirm recent findings of impaired EFT in patients with lesions to the vmPFC (vmPFC patients) using a new task, and (b) investigate the influence of nonepisodic mechanisms, namely, narrative construction and working memory maintenance, on vmPFC patients' EFT performance. vmPFC patients and healthy participants imagined future events using pictures as cues, described pictures, or described pictures while maintaining them in working memory after an observation phase. Compared with the controls, vmPFC patients produced less specific reports across all conditions, as indicated by fewer internal (episodic) but a similar number of external (semantic) details. However, controlling for description and working memory performance did not eliminate group differences in EFT. Moreover, vmPFC damage reduced the proportion of internal-to-total details for EFT only. These results indicate that EFT problems in vmPFC patients are not merely the reflection of problems in maintaining in working memory and narrating events, but, more likely, of an impairment upstream, in creating novel events.

Previous studies of emotion processing in ALS have inconsistent results, and are limited by variations in task difficulty, modalities examined, and participants' cognitive status. The current study used a battery of emotion processing tasks at differing levels of difficulty and across different modalities (facial affect and voice prosody) to assess the extent of emotion processing deficits in nondemented ALS. 33 ALS participants with intact basic cognition and 22 healthy controls completed the abbreviated Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS), which assesses simple and complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, cross-modal face-prosody integration, and semantic comprehension of affect. Participants also completed measures of executive function, mood, and functional impairment. ALS participants showed impairments on complex facial affect recognition, affective prosody recognition, and cross-modal integration. In contrast, simple facial affect recognition and semantic comprehension of affect were intact. ALS participants did not have significant mood symptoms, and neither mood nor functional impairment was related to emotion processing. Performance on the cross-modal composite was related to executive function, however, this relationship was not apparent for facial or prosody recognition within a single modality. These results indicate that people living with ALS without dementia often have subtle difficulties with recognizing emotions in both faces and voices, even in the context of intact basic cognition. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for these emotion processing difficulties to be present in ALS and to affect interpersonal behavior and quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record ","451":"The notion that artistic capability increases with dementia is both novel and largely unsupported by available literature. Recent research has suggested an emergence of artistic capabilities to be a by-product of involuntary behaviour seen with dementia, as opposed to a progression in original thinking (de Souza, et al., 2010). A far more complementary explanation comes from Hannemann (2006), who suggests that art offers an outlet for dementia patients to refine and sharpen their cognitive abilities. As dementia severely impedes linguistic skills, non-verbal therapeutic methods such as painting can permit dementia patients to express themselves in a way not possible verbally. Fractal analysis has been used to determine the authenticity of major works of art. Taylor et al., (1999) found that through a fractal analysis of Jackson Pollock's paintings it was possible to distinguish authentic works from a large collection of fakes, demonstrating that when artists paint they instill within their work their own pattern of unique fractal behaviour. Can age-indexed variations in the fractal dimension of the works of artists anticipate specific cognitive deteriorations? To answer this question we analysed age-related variations in the fractal dimension of a large corpus of digital images (n = 2092) of work created by seven notable artists who experienced both normal ageing and neurodegenerative disorders. The results of our analysis showed that patterns of change in the fractal dimension of the paintings differentiated artists who suffered neurological deterioration from those of normal aging controls. These findings are of importance for two reasons. Our work adds to studies that demonstrate that fractal analysis has the potential to determine the provenance of paintings. Secondly, our work suggests that may be possible to identify a-typical changes in the structure of an artist's work; changes that may be early indicators of the onset of neurological deterioration.

Little has been reported about the progressive cognitive impairment associated with ADCA-DN. Our objective is to provide a detailed characterization of the cognitive profile of ADCA-DN. Three members of a kindred with ADCA-DN underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging. At baseline, 2 individuals demonstrated cognitive profiles with executive difficulties in some areas consistent with frontal-system dysfunction behaviorally and on standardized testing. The third individual was further in the disease course and exhibited more globally impaired cognition consistent with a diagnosis of dementia. This family demonstrated progressive neurodegeneration beginning with isolated areas of executive dysfunction and leading to globally impaired cognition and dementia. Cognitive decline occurred in parallel with neurological deterioration. The cognitive profile is similar to case reports of other individuals with an allelic neurological phenotype, Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathy 1E, also caused by DNMT1 mutations.

As a main result, we observed that children with ADHD were impaired in performing inferential reasoning problems. The deficit in relational reasoning was found to be related to the difficulty in managing a unified representation of ordered items. The present finding documented a novel deficit in ADHD, contributing to improving the understanding of the disorder.

Data from the 6 months immediately before memory testing were averaged. In a single testing session participants were administered the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision (MINI-DSM-IV-TR), measures of PM (event-based and time-based), and retrospective memory (RM). Based on the average score of six consecutive monthly responses to the SREA, TLFB, and AEQ, students were classified as nondrinkers, light drinkers, or heavy drinkers (as defined previously; Dager et al., 2013). Alcohol-induced amnesia (blackout) was measured with the BYAACS. We found a relationship between these alcohol use classifications and time-based PM, such that participants who were classified as heavier drinkers were more likely to forget to perform the time-based PM task. We also found that self-reported alcohol-induced amnesia (blackouts) during the month immediately preceding memory testing was associated with lower performance on the event-based PM task. Participants' ability to recall the RM tasks suggested the PM items were successfully encoded even when they were not carried out, and we observed no relationship between alcohol use and RM performance.

The purposes of the present study, the Trajectories Related to ADHD in College project, a longitudinal study following the 4-year outcomes of college students with and without ADHD, were to (a) examine the performance of 436 first-year college students with and without ADHD (51.6% female) on measures of executive function (EF) and intelligence and (b) investigate the association of self-reported use of stimulant medication and neuropsychological performance in students with ADHD. Participant data from their first year of involvement in the study were analyzed. Participants with ADHD performed more poorly on task-based and self-report EF measures relative to the comparison group. In contrast, no significant group differences were found with respect to intellectual performance. Within the ADHD group, use of prescription stimulant medication was associated with improved performance on some, but not all, neuropsychological tasks. Additional analyses also revealed significant group differences in EF based on clinical diagnostic status. College students with ADHD demonstrated poorer EF than their peers without ADHD and psychostimulant medication was associated with improved EF performance.

Falls and fall-related injuries represent a major cost to health care systems, it is therefore critically important to find measures that can readily identify older adults at greater risk of falling. Cognitive and motor function were investigated in 108 adults aged 53 to 93 years (M = 73.49) recruited across the local community and hospital outpatient department. Forty-two participants had experienced either an injurious fall, or multiple falls, in the previous 2 years. Logistic regression suggested that fallers could be distinguished from nonfallers by greater medication use, IIV, postural sway, weaker grip strength and slower gait speed. Structural equation models revealed that IIV was predictive of falls via the mediating variable of motor function (e.g., gait). IIV also predicted higher order cognition (executive function) but higher order cognitive function did not uniquely predict falls or account for the associations between IIV and falls. These findings indicate that IIV measures capture important aspects of cognitive and motor decline and may have considerable potential in identifying older adults at risk of falling in health care and community settings.

Recent studies in the visual domain support this proposal. Here we hypothesize that ASD involves an enhanced perceptual capacity that also operates across sensory modalities, and test this prediction, for the first time using a signal detection paradigm. Seventeen neurotypical (NT) and 15 ASD adolescents performed a visual search task under varying levels of visual perceptual load while simultaneously detecting presence\/absence of an auditory tone embedded in noise. Detection sensitivity (d') for the auditory stimulus was similarly high for both groups in the low visual perceptual load condition (e.g., 2 items: p = .391, d = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.39, 1.00]). However, at a higher level of visual load, auditory d' reduced for the NT group but not the ASD group, leading to a group difference (p = .002, d = 1.2, 95% CI [0.44, 1.96]). As predicted, when visual perceptual load was highest, both groups then showed a similarly low auditory d' (p = .9, d = 0.05, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.74]). These findings demonstrate that increased perceptual capacity in ASD operates across modalities.

An estimate of general cognitive functioning based on the first principal factor was regressed from the observed cognitive scores to derive an estimate of specific influences on each measure, and this value was subtracted from the observed score to provide an estimate of general influences on the measure. Longitudinal change was assessed by the (T2 - T1) difference between scores on the 2 occasions. Although increased age was associated with specific influences on speed in cross-sectional comparisons, and in memory change in longitudinal comparisons among older adults, most of the relations between age and cognitive functioning in both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons were manifested as general influences shared with other cognitive measures. Differences in cognitive functioning associated with aging are often attributed to domain-specific effects, but results from this and other recent studies suggest that large proportions of the age differences are associated with general influences shared across different types of cognitive measures.

All SANS subscales, but Avolition-Apathy, had significant negative impact on social cognition. The effects of positive symptoms were complex. High levels of delusions were associated with higher premorbid IQ. In the presence of high levels of negative symptoms, high levels of positive symptoms were associated with the most comprehensive deficits in social perception, while, in the absence of negative symptoms, high levels of positive symptoms were not associated with such deficits.

We identified target engagement of auditory system processing efficiency by modeling subject-specific trajectories of auditory processing speed (APS) over time. Lowess analysis, mixed models repeated measures analysis, and latent growth curve modeling were used to examine whether APS trajectories were moderated by age and illness duration, and mediated improvements in cognitive outcome measures. We observed significant improvements in APS from baseline to 20 hours of training (initial change), followed by a flat APS trajectory (plateau) at subsequent time-points. Participants showed interindividual variability in the steepness of the initial APS change and in the APS plateau achieved and sustained between 20 and 40 hours. We found that participants who achieved the fastest APS plateau, showed the greatest transfer effects to untrained cognitive domains. There is a significant association between an individual's ability to generate and sustain auditory processing efficiency and their degree of cognitive improvement after TCT, independent of baseline neurocognition. APS plateau may therefore represent a behavioral measure of target engagement mediating treatment response. Future studies should examine the optimal plateau of auditory processing efficiency required to induce significant cognitive improvements, in the context of interindividual differences in neural plasticity and sensory system efficiency that characterize schizophrenia.

Patients with aSAH scored significantly lower than healthy controls on measures of memory, processing speed, and attention, but anSAH patients did not. In the higher-order prefrontal functions (EF and emotion recognition), aSAH patients were clearly impaired when compared to healthy controls. However, anSAH patients did not perform significantly better than aSAH patients on the majority of the tests. In the subacute phase after SAH, cognitive functions, including the higher-order prefrontal functions EF and emotion recognition, were clearly impaired in aSAH patients. Patients with anSAH did not perform better than aSAH patients, which indicates that these functions may also be affected to some extent in anSAH patients. Considering the importance of these higher-order prefrontal functions for daily life functioning, and following the results of the present study, tests that measure emotion recognition and EF should be part of the standard neuropsychological assessment after SAH. (PsycINFO Database Record ","470":"Delayed recall of the first words of a list-the primacy position-is thought to be particularly dependent on intact memory consolidation. Hippocampal volume has been suggested as the primary neuronal correlate of delayed primacy recall in cognitively normal elderly individuals. Here, we studied the association of hippocampal volume with primacy recall in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We investigated serial position performance in 88 subjects with aMCI using a 16-word list (the California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]). Primacy and recency performance were measured during learning and delayed recall. Hippocampal volumes were automatically determined from structural MRI scans. We conducted regression analyses with bilateral hippocampal volumes as predictors and serial position indices as outcomes. After controlling for age, gender, and total intracranial volume, bilateral hippocampal volume was not associated with primacy recall either during learning or delayed recall. Primacy performance during learning was associated with the right inferior and middle temporal gyrus as well as the right inferior parietal cortex and supramerginal gyrus. During delayed recall, primacy performance was related to the bilateral supramarginal gyri. Our findings suggest a reduced primacy effect in aMCI already during learning, contrasting previous findings in normal cognitive aging. This might indicate impaired encoding and consolidation processes at an early stage of episodic memory acquisition. Furthermore, our data indicate that hippocampal volume may not be a relevant determinant of residual primacy performance in the stage of aMCI, which may rather depend on temporal and parietal neocortical networks.

Studies to date have not investigated ABM retrieval in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a multisystem disorder that may be associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia. The integrity of autobiographical memory was evaluated in 22 ALS patients compared with 28 age-matched controls using the Autobiographical Interview (AI), a semistructured interview assessing autobiographical events from discrete time periods across the life span. ABM retrieval was preserved in ALS and remained rich in detail for personal events in recent (last 12-months) and remote (teenage years) time epochs. ABM retrieval was positively correlated with months since ALS symptom onset, with a greater number of contextual details being recalled as ALS progressed. A shift in how ABMs were perceived in ALS patients became apparent, with more recurrent reflection of recent life, which was also weighted with greater personal importance. The preservation of ABM in ALS has clinical implications for the use of life review as a therapeutic tool in a multidisciplinary care setting.

PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched (from January 1999 to present) for relevant original research and review articles on bilingualism (but not multilingualism) paired with each target neuropsychological variable published in English. A qualitative review of these articles was conducted. It has long been known that mean scores of bilinguals fall below those of monolinguals on vocabulary and other language, but not visual-perceptual, format cognitive tests. Contemporary studies that have reported higher mean scores for bilinguals than monolinguals on executive function task-switching or inhibition tasks have not always been replicated, leading to concerns of publication bias, statistical flaws, and failures to match groups on potentially confounding variables. Studies suggesting the onset of Alzheimer's disease occurred about 4 years later for bilinguals versus monolinguals have not been confirmed in longitudinal, cohort, community-based, incidence studies that have used neuropsychological testing and diagnostic criteria to establish an age of dementia diagnosis. Neuroimaging studies of regional gray and white matter volume in bilinguals versus monolinguals show inconsistencies in terms of both the regions of difference and the nature of the difference. Resolving inconsistencies in the behavioral data is necessary before searching in the brain for neuroanatomical correlation. Comparisons of balanced versus language-dominant groups within the same ethnoculture combined with objective measurement of bilingualism could better match groups on potentially confounding variables.

Although episodic future thinking has been studied extensively in neuroscience, this construct has not been explored in depth from the perspective of clinical neuropsychology. The aim of this critical narrative review is to assess the validity and clinical implications of episodic future thinking. A systematic review of episodic future thinking literature was conducted. PubMed and PsycInfo were searched through July 2015 for review and empirical articles with the following search terms: \"episodic future thinking,\" \"future mental simulation,\" \"imagining the future,\" \"imagining new experiences,\" \"future mental time travel,\" \"future autobiographical experience,\" and \"prospection.\" The review discusses evidence that episodic future thinking is important for adaptive functioning, which has implications for neurological populations. To determine the validity of episodic future thinking, the construct is evaluated with respect to related constructs, such as imagination, episodic memory, autobiographical memory, prospective memory, narrative construction, and working memory. Although it has been minimally investigated, there is evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for episodic future thinking. Research has not addressed the incremental validity of episodic future thinking. Practical considerations of episodic future thinking tasks and related constructs in a clinical neuropsychological setting are considered. The utility of episodic future thinking is currently unknown due to the lack of research investigating the validity of episodic future thinking. Future work is discussed, which could determine whether episodic future thinking is an important missing piece in standard clinical neuropsychological assessment.

Functional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other brain regions may be particularly abnormal. The goal of the present study was to characterize the temporal dynamics of the default mode network (DMN) connectivity in BD and examine its association with cognition. In a preliminary study, euthymic BD (n = 15) and healthy comparison (HC, n = 19) participants underwent resting-state functional MRI, using high-resolution sequences adapted from the Human Connectome Project, and completed neuropsychological measures of processing speed and executive function. A seed-based approach was used to measure DMN correlations in each participant, with regions of interest in the mPFC, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and lateral parietal cortex. Subsequently, to characterize temporal dynamics, correlational analyses between the mPFC and other DMN nodes were repeated using a sliding-window correlational analysis with subsets of the time series. When averaged across the entire scan, there were no group differences in overall connectivity strength between the mPFC and other regions of the DMN. However, dynamic connectivity between the mPFC and PCC was altered in BD, such that connectivity was less variable (i.e., more rigid) over time. Decreased connectivity variability was associated with slower processing speed and reduced cognitive set-shifting in BD patients. Variability in resting-state functional connectivity may be an index of internetwork flexibility that is reduced in BD and a correlate of ongoing cognitive impairment during periods of euthymia.

Such maintenance is often not satisfactorily achieved. Additional practice, or overtraining, may play a key role in long-term maintenance. In particular, the literature on learning in cognitively intact persons has suggested that it is testing, and not studying, that contributes to maintenance of learning. The present study investigates the hypothesis that continuing to test relearned words in persons with anomia will lead to significantly greater maintenance compared with continuing to study relearned words. The current study combines overtraining with the variable of test versus study in examining the effects of overtesting and overstudying on maintenance of word finding in 3 persons with aphasia. First, treatment successfully reestablished the connections between known items and their names. Once the connections were reestablished (i.e., items could be named successfully), each item was placed into 1 of 4 overtraining conditions: test and study, only test, only study, or no longer test or study. Maintenance was probed at 1 month and 4 months following the end of overtraining. The results are consistent with an advantage of testing compared with studying. All 3 participants showed significantly greater maintenance for words that were overtested than for words that were overstudied. This testing benefit persisted at 1 month and 4 months after completion of the treatment. In fact, there was no clear evidence for any benefit of overstudying. The present study demonstrates that overtesting, but not overstudying, leads to lasting maintenance of language rehabilitation gains in patients with anomia. The implications for the design of other treatment protocols are immense.

Data arising from these tasks have been used to support myriad theories regarding the integrity, or otherwise, of particular brain areas or cognitive processes in ASD. The drift diffusion model (DDM) provides an account of the underlying processes which give rise to accuracy and reaction time (RT) distributions, and parameterizes these processes in terms which have direct psychological interpretation. Importantly, the DDM provides further insight into the origin of potential group differences in task performance. Here, for the first time, we used the DDM to investigate perceptual decision making in ASD. Adults with (N = 25) and without ASD (N = 32) performed an orientation discrimination task. A drift diffusion model was applied to the full RT distributions. Participants with ASD responded more slowly than controls, the groups did not differ in accuracy. Modeled parameters indicated that: (a) participants with ASD were more cautious than controls (wider boundary separation); (b) nondecision time was increased in ASD; and (c) the quality of evidence extracted from the stimulus (drift rate) did not vary between groups. Taking the behavioral data in isolation would suggest reduced perceptual sensitivity in ASD. However, DDM results indicated that despite response slowing, there was no evidence of differential perceptual sensitivity between participants with and without ASD. Future use of the DDM in investigations of perception and cognition in ASD is highly recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record ","477":"Cognitive deficits are frequently observed in major depression. Yet, when these deficits emerge and how they relate to the depressed state is unclear. The aim of this 2-part systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the pattern and extent of cognitive deficits during a first-episode of depression (FED) and their persistence following FED remission. Published, peer-reviewed articles on cognitive function in FED patients through October 2015 were searched. Meta-analyses with random-effects modeling were conducted. Part 1 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of cognitive function in FED patients relative to healthy controls. Moderator analyses of clinical and demographical variables effects were conducted. Part 2 assessed weighted, mean effect sizes of change in cognitive function at remission compared with acute FED performance in longitudinal studies. Thirty-one studies including 994 FED patients were retained in Part 1. Relative to healthy controls, small to large impairments were observed across most cognitive domains. Remission was associated with a normalization of function in processing speed, learning and memory, autobiographical memory, shifting, and IQ. Lower FED age was associated with higher IQ, but more impairment in word-list delayed memory. Four studies including 92 FED patients were retained in Part 2. Following remission, FED patients showed small improvements in processing speed and shifting but persistent impairment in inhibition and verbal fluency. Significant cognitive deficits are already identifiable during a FED, with some functions showing persistent impairment upon remission. Clinicians must consider cognitive impairment alongside mood symptoms to ensure functional recovery from the FED.

This was a cross-sectional assessment study evaluating combat exposure, PTSD, mTBI history, sleep quality, and neuropsychological functioning. One hundred and nine eligible male Iraq\/Afghanistan combat veterans completed an assessment consisting of a structured clinical interview, neuropsychological battery, and self-report measures. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, combat experiences and mTBI history were not directly associated with sleep quality. PTSD was directly associated with sleep quality, which contributed to deficits in neuropsychological functioning independently of and in addition to combat experiences, PTSD, and mTBI history. Combat experiences and PTSD were differentially associated with motor speed. Sleep affected cognitive function independently of combat experiences, PTSD, and mTBI history. Sleep quality also contributed to cognitive deficits beyond effects of PTSD. An evaluation of sleep quality may be a useful point of clinical intervention in combat veterans with cognitive complaints. Improving sleep quality could alleviate cognitive complaints, improving veterans' ability to engage in treatment.

Subsequently, the authors evaluated whether the fronto-temporal brain indices, and proxy measures of neurodevelopment and acquired brain insult\/risk exposure differentiated members of the 3 distinct neurocognitive clusters. Greater frontal and temporal gyrification and more proxies of aberrant neurodevelopment were associated with the lowest functioning neurocognitive cluster (Cluster 3). Further, for older participants (50+ years), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions was associated with the higher functioning neurocognitive cluster (Cluster 1). Finally, the greatest acquired brain insult\/risk exposure was associated with the cluster characterized by selective decision-making impairment (Cluster 2). Fronto-temporal structural brain indices, and proxies of neurodevelopment and acquired brain insult\/risk exposure were differentially associated with neurocognitive profiles in socially marginalized persons.

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying comorbid PTSD following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) have not been fully investigated, especially among children. This study prospectively examined the influence of theorized neurocognitive deficits at 3 months post pediatric TBI on the development of PTSD symptoms 6 months postinjury. One hundred sixty-six children aged between 6 and 14 years were recruited after sustaining a TBI. Their demographic information and injury severity were assessed at 2 months postinjury, their neurocognitive outcomes in selective attention, sustained attention, verbal learning, working memory, and processing speed were assessed at 3 months postinjury, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 6 months postinjury. Consistent with the Neurobiological Theory of PTSD, sustained attention deficits 3 months postinjury emerged as the key predictor for greater future PTSD severity at 6 months, especially following a mild TBI. However, contrary to the expectations of the Emotional Processing Theory and Dual Representation Theory, verbal learning and working memory deficits at 3 months postinjury protected children from the development of PTSD symptoms 6 months postinjury. PTSD involves a complex interplay between attention and memory functions post pediatric TBI. When trauma memory is relatively intact, difficulties disengaging from distractors contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms.

The second experiment examined bisection performance in a larger TBI sample against a matched control group. In both experiments, participants bisected lines in near and far space using an apparatus that allowed for the fractionation of spatial Aiming versus Where error components. In the first experiment, participants with severe injuries tended to incur rightward error when starting from the right in far space, compared with participants with mild injuries. In the second experiment, when performance was examined at the individual level, more participants with TBI tended to incur rightward motor error compared to controls.

ND is usually assessed with standardized reading texts in clinical settings. However, particularly in the chronic phase of ND, patients often report reading deficits in everyday situations but show (nearly) normal performances in test situations that are commonly well-structured. To date, sensitive and standardized tests to assess the severity and characteristics of ND are lacking, although reading is of high relevance for daily life and vocational settings. Several studies found modulating effects of different word features on ND. We combined those features in a novel test to enhance test sensitivity in the assessment of ND. Low-frequency words of different length that contain residual pronounceable words when the initial letter strings are neglected were selected. We compared these words in a group of 12 ND-patients suffering from right-hemispheric first-ever stroke with word stimuli containing no existing residual words. Finally, we tested whether the serially presented words are more sensitive for the diagnosis of ND than text reading. The severity of ND was modulated strongly by the ND-test words and error frequencies in single word reading of ND words were on average more than 10 times higher than in a standardized text reading test (19.8% vs. 1.8%). The novel ND-test maximizes the frequency of specific ND-errors and is therefore more sensitive for the assessment of ND than conventional text reading tasks.

Some of these symptoms also occur in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The current study examined the unique contribution of mTBI and PTSD to PPCS. The roles of neurocognitive and motivational factors were also addressed. Sixty one children and adolescents (ages 6-18), at least 3 months post motor vehicle accident (MVA), participated in the study. All participants were diagnosed with PTSD symptoms. Thirty three participants met mTBI criteria, and 28 did not. Standard instruments for assessment included a semistructured clinical interview, self-report questionnaires, and a neuropsychological evaluation. No differences were found between the mTBI and non-TBI groups on any of the emotional or neurocognitive measures, including PPCS symptoms. Multiple regression analyses revealed that emotional status, such as state anxiety and depression, were the best predictors of PPCS. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses revealed a double mediation model, in which suboptimal effort mediated the relationship between neurocognitive performance and PPCS, and emotional status mediated the relationship between suboptimal effort and PPCS. These findings underscore the importance of emotional status in the diagnosis of PPCS among children who suffer from PTSD. It is possible that PPCS reflect a more general expression of accident-related emotional distress, rather than being a direct result of the injury.

Cross-sectional, baseline data were collected with computerized and traditional neuropsychological tests assessing 8 functional domains expressed as composite scores. General additive modeling evaluated factors potentially modulating performance (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and pubertal developmental stage). Older no\/low-drinking participants achieved better scores than younger ones on 5 accuracy composites (general ability, abstraction, attention, emotion, and balance). Speeded responses for attention, motor speed, and general ability were sensitive to age and pubertal development. The exceeds-threshold group (accounting for age, sex, and other demographic factors) performed significantly below the no\/low-drinking group on balance accuracy and on general ability, attention, episodic memory, emotion, and motor speed scores and showed evidence for faster speed at the expense of accuracy. Delay Discounting performance was consistent with poor impulse control in the younger no\/low drinkers and in exceeds-threshold drinkers regardless of age. Higher achievement with older age and pubertal stage in general ability, abstraction, attention, emotion, and balance suggests continued functional development through adolescence, possibly supported by concurrently maturing frontal, limbic, and cerebellar brain systems. Determination of whether low scores by the exceeds-threshold group resulted from drinking or from other preexisting factors requires longitudinal study.

Greater decrements in verbal STM and verbal WM skills were associated with longer time postinjury. Larger deficits were observed in verbal WM abilities in individuals with older age at injury. Evidence for WM impairments following TBI is consistent with previous research. Larger verbal STM and verbal WM deficits were related to a longer time postinjury, suggesting that these aspects of memory do not \"recover\" over time and instead, individuals might show increased rates of cognitive decline.

The disinhibition domain of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and the interpersonal relationships subscale of the Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale (SPRS-IR) were completed by a close other. Fifteen control participants provided norms against which to assess performance on the emotion intensity rating task. BSIT scores predicted informant-reported change in interpersonal relationships on the SPRS-IR. Hyposmia, though, was not associated with informant-reported or observed social disinhibition. An impairment in accuracy scores on both emotion perceptions tasks was found for participants with TBI, yet intensity ratings did not differ between groups. This suggests that people with TBI are not actually impaired at detecting intensity of emotion but are less likely to perceive the target emotion as the dominant emotion. Emotion perception was not related to disinhibition or change in interpersonal relationships. These results support previous claims that hyposmia has prognostic significance following TBI. On the other hand, emotion perception impairment measured by standardized tasks does not appear to be an important factor in interpersonal outcomes.

The authors used sigmoid mixed models based on the 4-parameter logistic distribution to decompose nonlinear global cognitive trajectories into components and assess the relation of each neuropathologic marker to each trajectory component. Cognitive function was assessed for a mean of 10.5 years before death. In the absence of pathology, global cognition was relatively stable before declining moderately in the last 3 to 4 years of life. Tangles were related to all trajectory components except initial level. TDP-43 pathology was the only marker related to initial level of function. It was also associated with an earlier midpoint of decline but not to slope of decline. Hippocampal sclerosis was related to an earlier midpoint of decline and more rapid slope of decline. Lewy bodies were associated with faster slope of decline and lower level of function proximate to death.

However, SMCs may be multiply determined, and often correlate with affective or psychosocial variables rather than with performance on memory tests. Our objective was to identify sensitive and selective methods to disentangle the underlying causes of SMCs. Because preclinical dementia pathology targets the hippocampus, we hypothesized that performance on hippocampally dependent relational memory tests would correlate with SMCs. We thus administered a series of memory tasks with varying dependence on relational memory processing to 91 older adults, along with questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, and memory self-efficacy. We used correlational, regression, and mediation analyses to compare the variance in SMCs accounted for by these measures. Performance on the task most dependent on relational memory processing showed a stronger negative association with SMCs than did other memory performance metrics. SMCs were also negatively associated with memory self-efficacy. These 2 measures, along with age and education, accounted for 40% of the variance in SMCs. Self-efficacy and relational memory were uncorrelated and independent predictors of SMCs. Moreover, self-efficacy statistically mediated the relationship between SMCs and depression and anxiety, which can be detrimental to cognitive aging. These data identify multiple mechanisms that can contribute to SMCs, and suggest that SMCs can both cause and be caused by age-related cognitive decline. Relational memory measures may be effective assays of objective memory difficulties, while assessing self-efficacy could identify detrimental affective responses to cognitive aging.

The objective of the current report is to investigate the cause of perseveration in verbal fluency in individuals with TBI and compare those results to a recent study of individuals with AD. In a previous study, conducted by Miozzo, Fischer-Baum, and Caccappolo-van Vliet (2013), perseveration errors produced by individuals with AD were shown to have long lags between the 1st occurrence of a word and its repetition in verbal fluency, suggesting that perseverations were caused by a failure of the working memory mechanisms that control response monitoring. In the present investigation, we applied the same analysis to the perseveration errors produced during 197 administrations of the verbal fluency task with 143 individuals with TBI. The perseverations of individuals with TBI showed a lag distribution similar to that of the AD population, with the lag between the 1st occurrence of a word and its repetition systematically longer than would be expected by chance.

Data were retrospectively gathered on 128 controls (no concussion) and 24 concussed college-age athletes on measures of spatial navigation, whole body reaction, attention, and balance in a virtual environment. Concussed athletes were tested within 10 days (M = 8.33, SD = 1.06) of concussion and were clinically asymptomatic at the time of testing. A priori alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. Spatial navigation (sensitivity 95.8%\/specificity 91.4%, d = 1.89), whole body reaction time (sensitivity 95.2%\/specificity 89.1%, d = 1.50) and combined virtual reality modules (sensitivity 95.8%,\/specificity 96.1%, d = 3.59) produced high sensitivity\/specificity values when determining performance-based variability between groups. Use of a virtual reality-based NP platform can detect lingering cognitive abnormalities resulting from concussion in clinically asymptomatic participants. Virtual reality NP platforms may compliment the traditional concussion assessment battery by providing novel information. (PsycINFO Database Record ","504":"Although reasoning and attention are 2 cognitive processes necessary for ensuring the efficiency of many everyday activities in older adults, the role of white matter integrity in these processes has been little studied. This is an important question due to the role of white matter integrity as a neural substrate of cognitive aging. Here, we sought to examine the white matter tracts subserving reasoning and visuospatial attention in healthy older adults. Sixty-one adults ages 60 and older completed a battery of cognitive tests to assess reasoning and visuospatial attention. In addition, diffusion tensor images were collected to assess fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter integrity. A principle components analysis of the test scores yielded 2 components: reasoning and visuospatial attention. Whole-brain correlations between FA and the cognitive components were submitted to probabilistic tractography analyses for visualization of cortical targets of tracts. For reasoning, bilateral thalamo-anterior prefrontal, anterior corpus callosum, and corpus callosum body tracts interconnecting the superior frontal cortices and right cingulum bundle were found. For visuospatial attention, a right inferior fronto-parietal tract and bilateral parietal and temporal connections were found. We conclude that in older adults, prefrontal cortex white matter tracts and interhemispheric communication are important in higher order cognitive functioning. On the other hand, right-sided fronto-parietal tracts appear to be critical for supporting control of cognitive processes, such as redirecting attention. Researchers may use our results to develop neuroscience-based interventions for older adults targeting brain mechanisms involved in cognitive plasticity.

Yet, it is not known what memory stages are most impaired in those with early marijuana use. Forty-eight young adults, aged 18-25, who used marijuana at least once per week and 48 matched nonusing controls (CON) completed the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II). Marijuana users were stratified by age of initial use: early onset users (EMJ), who started using marijuana at or before age 16 (n = 27), and late onset marijuana user group (LMJ), who started using marijuana after age 16 (n = 21). Outcome variables included trial immediate recall, total learning, clustering strategies (semantic clustering, serial clustering, ratio of semantic to serial clustering, and total number of strategies used), delayed recall, and percent retention. Learning improved with repetition, with no group effect on the learning slope. EMJ learned fewer words overall than LMJ or CON. There was no difference between LMJ and CON in total number of words learned. Reduced overall learning mediated the effect on reduced delayed recall among EMJ, but not CON or LMJ. Learning improved with greater use of semantic versus serial encoding, but this did not vary between groups. EMJ was not related to delayed recall after adjusting for encoding. Young adults reporting early onset marijuana use had learning weaknesses, which accounted for the association between early onset marijuana use and delayed recall. No amnestic effect of marijuana use was observed.

However, previous research has focused on how emotion valence translates into motivated behavior, ignoring the fact that emotion arousal should also modulate emotion-behavior coupling. Few studies have examined emotion-behavior coupling in prepsychotic conditions. This investigation aimed to examine the nature and extent of emotion valence- and arousal-behavior coupling across the schizophrenia spectrum. We examine how emotional valence and arousal couple with behavior in 3 groups of individuals (25 individuals with chronic schizophrenia; 27 individuals early in the disease course, and 31 individuals reporting negative schizotypal symptoms). Participants completed a task using slides to elicit emotion and evoke motivated behavior. We compared participants with their respective matched control groups to determine differences in the correspondence between self-reported emotion valence\/arousal and motivated behavior. Both groups with schizophrenia reported similar affective experiences as their controls, whereas individuals reporting negative schizotypal symptoms showed \"in-the-moment\" anhedonia but not emotion-behavior decoupling. In addition, the schizophrenia groups' affective experiences corresponded less well to their behavior relative to controls. Our findings suggest emotion-behavior decoupling along both valence and arousal dimensions in schizophrenia but not in participants with high levels of schizotypal symptoms. Findings appear to support the idea that emotion-behavior decoupling differs in nature and extent across the schizophrenia spectrum. Interventions to recouple emotion and behavior may be particularly helpful in allowing people with schizophrenia to gain functional independence. (PsycINFO Database Record ","508":"Schizophrenia is associated with poor spatial attention. However, although this deficit undermines the perception of target information, it may be helpful for ignoring irrelevant inputs. The present study examined whether event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of visual spatial attention predicted the magnitude of the brain response to interference in schizophrenia. ERPs were recorded in 16 schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy control participants who had to indicate whether the target E was global or local in compound letter stimuli. The nontarget could be either highly similar to the target (i.e., a global E composed of local Ss and vice versa) and thus produce more interference, or it could be dissimilar (i.e., a global E composed of local Hs and vice versa) and generate less interference. Both groups' responses were slowed by interference. Voltage amplitudes of the P1, and of ERP interference effects from 300-500 ms after stimulus onset, were significantly smaller in schizophrenia patients than in healthy participants when the target was global. In patients, larger P1 amplitudes were correlated with larger interference effects and with more severe symptoms of attentional deficits and conceptual disorganization. Schizophrenia participants thus exhibited abnormal ERPs to interference despite normal behavioral performance. Schizophrenia patients likely pay less attention to stimuli in general; however, the impact of this impairment on target detection is compensated by relatively greater inattention to irrelevant components of the stimuli, and this explains why they are not more influenced by interference than healthy participants at the behavioral level. (PsycINFO Database Record ","509":"We examined biological motion perception in Parkinson's disease (PD). Biological motion perception is related to one's own motor function and depends on the integrity of brain areas affected in PD, including posterior superior temporal sulcus. If deficits in biological motion perception exist, they may be specific to perceiving natural\/fast walking patterns that individuals with PD can no longer perform, and may correlate with disease-related motor dysfunction. Twenty-six nondemented individuals with PD and 24 control participants viewed videos of point-light walkers and scrambled versions that served as foils, and indicated whether each video depicted a human walking. Point-light walkers varied by gait type (natural, parkinsonian) and speed (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 m\/s). Participants also completed control tasks (object motion, coherent motion perception), a contrast sensitivity assessment, and a walking assessment. The PD group demonstrated significantly less sensitivity to biological motion than the control group (p &lt; .001, Cohen's d = 1.22), regardless of stimulus gait type or speed, with a less substantial deficit in object motion perception (p = .02, Cohen's d = .68). There was no group difference in coherent motion perception. Although individuals with PD had slower walking speed and shorter stride length than control participants, gait parameters did not correlate with biological motion perception. Contrast sensitivity and coherent motion perception also did not correlate with biological motion perception. PD leads to a deficit in perceiving biological motion, which is independent of gait dysfunction and low-level vision changes, and may therefore arise from difficulty perceptually integrating form and motion cues in posterior superior temporal sulcus.

During the construction of the lexico-semantic network, the features of the objects are progressively stored to build our knowledge. Alzheimer's disease (AD) disrupts conceptual links that support semantic memory. Individuals suffering from AD lose access to words as well as to meaning. Some researchers have made the assumption that cognitive retrogenesis leads to a cognitive decline that reverses acquisition steps in childhood. This study proposes to analyze the validity of this theory applied to semantic knowledge. We administered a semantic knowledge questionnaire (SKQ) featuring 30 objects associated with 4 questions (2 superordinate questions; Q1 = general; Q2 = intracategorial; and 2 subordinate questions; Q3 = perceptual; Q4 = thematical\/functional) to 93 children (30 5-year-old children; 30 7-year-old children; and 33 9-year-old children), 32 healthy elderly people, and 66 AD patients (20 in the initial stage of the disease, AD1; 16 in the intermediate stage, AD2; and 30 in the advanced stage, AD3). Our results show that the total number of errors in the SKQ evolved in a \"u-shaped\" curve: children made less and less errors at the SKQ during development while AD patients presented the reverse pattern. Moreover, the performance of 5-year-old children was identical to that of AD3 patients. Similar results were observed with 7-year-old children and AD2 patients, and with 9-year-old children and AD1 patients. These data are consistent with the idea of a lexico-semantic retrogenesis process. (PsycINFO Database Record ","512":"Poor performance on confrontation naming tasks by children and adolescents with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy has been interpreted as indicating impairments of lexicon, that is, the store of words in long-term memory. However, confrontation naming performance crucially depends not only on word knowledge but also on other functions such as fluency. We applied an alternative method to assess lexicon with the aim of tracing deficits in lexicon before and after surgery in adolescents with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. Sixteen patients and 32 age- and sex-matched controls completed the Dutch version of the controlled oral word production task. Responses were used to calculate indices of lexical fluency (retrieval efficiency), lexical breadth (vocabulary size), and lexical depth (knowledge of word properties), as well as use of search strategies. Adolescents with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy had lower lexical fluency scores than healthy peers, but did not differ from them on the dimensions of lexical breadth and lexical depth. Patients demonstrated reduced use of search strategies. In fact, the difference in lexical fluency between patients and controls disappeared after controlling for Full Scale IQ (obtained using the Dutch version of the 3rd edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IIINL; Kort et al., 2005; Wechsler, 2002) or-for older children-the Dutch version of the first edition of the Kaufman Adult and Adolescent Intelligence Test (KAIT; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1993; Mulder, Dekker, &amp; Dekker, 2004) and use of search strategies. In patients, changes in the use of the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were associated with lexical fluency. Adolescents with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy differ from their healthy peers mainly in lexical fluency, rather than word knowledge per se.

Although damage\/removal of regions of the anterior temporal neocortex including the temporal pole is considered critical for those difficulties, 1 relevant hypothesis proposes that hippocampal damage also has a role. Our aim was to better understand the specific involvement of temporal pole and hippocampus in visual object naming. We assessed 2 types of patients with TLE on a visual confrontation-naming task: patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS; n = 16) and patients with a lesion on the tip of the temporal pole that spared the hippocampus entirely (n = 18). A common battery of verbal and nonverbal semantic tasks was administered and used as a semantic memory background. Control group were 20 matched healthy participants. Patients with lesions on their temporal poles differed from patients with HS and control group on naming ability, proportion and rate of error type, and influence of concept familiarity. Of note, naming performance was not affected by hippocampal damage. Using a Bayesian model averaging approach, we found that the number of omission errors distinguished patients with temporal pole damage from patients with HS and controls. This differential pattern occurred despite similar impairment on the semantic memory background in both clinical groups. Current findings provide evidence that temporal pole damage produces or contributes to naming impairment in TLE, while also suggesting that the hippocampus is not critical for naming. They also highlight the importance of error-type analysis when evaluating visual naming in TLE. (PsycINFO Database Record ","514":"Retrieval of lexical (names) and conceptual (semantic) information is frequently impaired in individuals with neurological damage. One category of items that is often affected is musical instruments. However, distinct neuroanatomical correlates underlying lexical and conceptual knowledge for musical instruments have not been identified. We used a neuropsychological approach to explore the neural correlates of knowledge retrieval for musical instruments. A large sample of individuals with focal brain damage (N = 298), viewed pictures of 16 musical instruments and were asked to name and identify each instrument. Neuroanatomical data were analyzed with a proportional MAP-3 method to create voxelwise lesion proportion difference maps. Impaired naming (lexical retrieval) of musical instruments was associated with damage to the left temporal pole and inferior pre- and postcentral gyri. Impaired recognition (conceptual knowledge retrieval) of musical instruments was associated with a more broadly and bilaterally distributed network of regions, including ventromedial prefrontal cortices, occipital cortices, and superior temporal gyrus. The findings extend our understanding of how musical instruments are processed at neural system level, and elucidate factors that may explain why brain damage may or may not produce anomia or agnosia for musical instruments. Our findings also help inform broader understanding of category-related knowledge mapping in the brain, as musical instruments possess several characteristics that are similar to various other categories of items: They are inanimate and highly manipulable (similar to tools), produce characteristic sounds (similar to animals), and require fine-grained visual differentiation between each other (similar to people). (PsycINFO Database Record ","515":"The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is often regarded as a prototypical neuropsychological test of set-shifting ability. However, it has been proposed that WCST performance involves cognitive processes other than set shifting, such as set maintenance and rule inference. Distinguishing between these processes is necessary for the meaningful interpretation of WCST performance deficits in neuropsychological populations. In the present studies, we aimed to concurrently measure processes of set shifting, set maintenance and rule inference in a computerized version of the WCST, and to dissociate these processes based on their dependence on working memory capacity. In Study 1, we manipulated the number of card-sorting rules to vary the demands placed on working memory-dependent processes of rule inference. As predicted, integration errors as a novel measure of rule-inference efficiency were selectively affected by increasing the number of rules from 3 to 4. In Study 2, we examined age-related changes in set shifting, set maintenance, and rule inference. We found a specific association between age and integration errors, indicating that rule inference, but not set shifting or set maintenance, is affected in older individuals. Rule inference on WCST-like card-sorting tasks appeared to be selectively impaired when the amount of information to be integrated in working memory increases or when working memory capacity is reduced (as in older individuals). Our findings indicate that measuring integration errors as an index of a distinct rule-inference process can improve the understanding and interpretability of WCST performance. (PsycINFO Database Record ","516":"In tasks involving hierarchical stimuli, young subjects typically show faster RTs and higher accuracy rates in discriminating target stimuli at the global level than at the local level. This pattern of performance is called the global precedence effect (GPE). As individuals age, this patterns shifts to a local precedence effect (LPE). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the decline in GPE in older adults may be due to impairment of grouping processes. The authors recorded event-related potentials (ERP) while young and elderly subjects performed a global\/local task in response to hierarchical stimuli, and they focused on the P300 component as an index of grouping processes. Compared to young subjects, elderly individuals showed a lower rate of correct discrimination in global processing conditions, but a higher rate of correct responses in local processing conditions, confirming a shift from a GPE to a LPE during aging. Interestingly, the P300 amplitude increased selectively during global processing in young adults but was not modulated by processing level in older participants. By contrast, the modulation of the early component N2 as a function of precedence level remained preserved in older subjects. The results suggest that the precedence level may depend on early processes that are unaffected during aging. This may explain the preservation of local precedence effect in elderly individuals. However, global processing may depend on extra attentional processing occurring at later stages. The alteration of later processing may explain the decline in global precedence during aging.

Only a recent neuropsychological case study has provided initial evidence for the idea that these elements can be differentiated at a functional level. The aim of the current study was therefore to critically verify this double dissociation by adopting a systematic, large-scale approach. Sixty-five chronic stroke patients and 60 matched healthy controls watched a route through a realistic virtual environment. They were assessed on their knowledge of this route in 4 different tasks after the learning phase. Performance on the scene recognition and route continuation tasks was taken as an indication of knowledge of the spatial route aspects. By contrast, spatiotemporal knowledge of the route was assessed in the route order and route progression tasks. Based on single case statistics, 6 patients showed an exceptionally large difference in their performance on the spatial and spatiotemporal tasks. Moreover, 2 patients satisfied formal criteria for a classical dissociation. Our findings showed that spatial and spatiotemporal performance was closely associated in most patients. Nonetheless, the study also provided partial support for the notion of separate space- and time-based processing mechanisms in the context of navigation. This distinction is of particular relevance to the investigation into the cognitive structure underlying navigation behavior.

The current study applies a novel data-analytic technique to a well-established sequence learning paradigm to investigate reactions to disruption of learned behavior in ADHD. Children (ages 8-12) with and without ADHD completed a serial reaction time task in which they implicitly learned an 8-item sequence of keypresses over 5 training blocks. The training sequence was replaced with a novel sequence in a transfer block, and returned in 2 subsequent recovery blocks. Response time (RT) data were fit by a Bayesian hierarchical version of the linear ballistic accumulator model, which permitted the dissociation of learning processes from performance monitoring effects on RT. Sequence-specific learning on the task was reflected in the systematic reduction of the amount of evidence required to initiate a response, and was unimpaired in ADHD. When the novel sequence onset, typically developing children displayed a shift in their attentional state while children with ADHD did not, leading to worse subsequent performance compared to controls. Children with ADHD are not impaired in learning novel action sequences, but display difficulty monitoring their implementation and engaging top-down control when they become inadequate. These results support theories of ADHD that highlight the interactions between monitoring processes and changing cognitive demands as the cause of self-regulation and information-processing problems in the disorder.

Subjects were either instructed to perform optimally (not feigning) or to perform \"as if they had a mild traumatic brain injury with memory impairment\" (feigning). A voxel-based multiple regression analysis revealed that during correct responses there was greater activation in the superior and medial prefrontal cortex during the feigning versus the not-feigning responses.

Children treated with cranial-spinal radiation also exhibited lower processing speed scores relative to healthy control subjects (p = .002).

Former studies predominantly focused on investigating these deficits applying verbal or static visual stimuli, but little is known about WM processes that involve dynamic visual movements. We examined WM for visual motion directions, its susceptibility to distraction and the effect of serial positioning. Twenty-three patients with paranoid SZ and 23 healthy control subjects (HC) took part in the study. We conducted an adapted Sternberg-type recognition paradigm: three random dot kinematograms (RDKs) that depicted coherent visual motion were used as stimuli and a distractor stimulus was incorporated into the task. SZ patients performed significantly worse in the WM visual motion task, when a distractor stimulus was presented. While HC showed a recency effect for later RDKs, the effect was absent in SZ patients. WM deficits were associated with more severe psychopathological symptoms, poor visual and verbal learning, and a longer duration of illness. Furthermore, SZ patients showed impairments in several other neurocognitive domains. Findings suggest that early WM processing of visual motion is susceptible to interruption and that WM impairments are associated with clinical symptoms in SZ. The absence of a recency effect is discussed in respect of 3 theoretical approaches-impaired WM for serial order information, abnormalities in early visual representations (i.e., masking effects), and deficits in later visual processing (i.e., attentional blink effect).

The effect of frontal lesions on recognition memory performance is less clear with some studies reporting recognition memory impairments but others not. The majority of these studies do not directly compare recall and recognition within the same group of frontal patients, assessing only recall or recognition memory performance. Other studies that do compare recall and recognition in the same frontal group do not consider recall or recognition tests that are comparable for difficulty. Recognition memory impairments may not be reported because recognition memory tasks are less demanding. This study aimed to investigate recall and recognition impairments in the same group of 47 frontal patients and 78 healthy controls. The Doors and People Test was administered as a neuropsychological test of memory as it assesses both verbal and visual recall and recognition using subtests that are matched for difficulty. Significant verbal and visual recall and recognition impairments were found in the frontal patients.

Cross-sectional, baseline data were collected with computerized and traditional neuropsychological tests assessing 8 functional domains expressed as composite scores. General additive modeling evaluated factors potentially modulating performance (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and pubertal developmental stage). Older no\/low-drinking participants achieved better scores than younger ones on 5 accuracy composites (general ability, abstraction, attention, emotion, and balance). Speeded responses for attention, motor speed, and general ability were sensitive to age and pubertal development. The exceeds-threshold group (accounting for age, sex, and other demographic factors) performed significantly below the no\/low-drinking group on balance accuracy and on general ability, attention, episodic memory, emotion, and motor speed scores and showed evidence for faster speed at the expense of accuracy. Delay Discounting performance was consistent with poor impulse control in the younger no\/low drinkers and in exceeds-threshold drinkers regardless of age. Higher achievement with older age and pubertal stage in general ability, abstraction, attention, emotion, and balance suggests continued functional development through adolescence, possibly supported by concurrently maturing frontal, limbic, and cerebellar brain systems.

Children with NF1 made significantly more errors than unaffected controls on most ToM stories while demonstrating no difficulty sequencing physical cause-and-effect stories. Performance on the picture sequencing task was not related to lower intellectual function, symptoms of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or parent ratings of executive function. Results suggest a generalized ToM deficit in children with NF1 that appears to be independent of general cognitive abilities and ADHD symptoms.

Forty-nine youth between 8 and 18 years (M = 12.34) old with SBM underwent a 3T MRI including diffusion tensor imaging. Neurobehavioral measures of parent-rated executive function and fine motor dexterity were obtained from a standardized neuropsychological evaluation. Relations among indices of gray matter microstructural integrity (mean diffusivity [MD], fractional anisotropy [FA], cortical thickness) and neurobehavior were examined using 3 correlational methods to enhance reliability of brain-behavior relations. In SBM, higher FA values in the caudate were associated with poorer behavioral regulation. Higher FA values in the putamen and greater DLPFC thickness were both associated with poorer fine motor dexterity. Behavioral regulation and FA in the caudate related to behavioral inhibition in SBM. Similarly, associations between fine motor dexterity and indices of gray matter integrity in the putamen and DLPFC support fronto-striatal involvement in motor control in SBM. Examination of these neurobehavioral correlates revealed a pattern of attenuated behavioral impairments when gray matter structure was more similar to that of typically developing youth.

In a subsample (246 subjects aged 14-22), IQ data (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Adults; WAIS) were available. Validity and reliability were assessed by Cronbach's alpha, comparisons of scores between Dutch and U.S. samples, and investigation of how a CNB-based common factor compared to a WAIS-based general factor of intelligence (g). Linear and nonlinear age dependencies covering the life span were modeled through regression. Heritability was estimated from twin data and from entire pedigree data. Internal consistency of all tests was moderate to high (median = 0.86). Effects of gender, age, and education on cognitive performance closely resembled U.S. The CNB-based common factor was completely captured by the WAIS-based g. Some domains, like nonverbal reasoning accuracy, peaked in young adulthood and showed steady decline. Other domains, like language reasoning accuracy, peaked in middle adulthood and were spared decline. CNB-test heritabilities were moderate (median h2 = 31%). Heritability of the CNB common factor was 70%, similar to the WAIS-based g-factor.

Analyses in both datasets suggested that NP and FC measures were explained by a single underlying factor in BPI and SCZ patients, both when analyzed separately or as in a combined sample. The factor structure in both studies was similar, with or without inclusion of FC measures; homogeneous loadings were observed for that single factor across cognitive and FC domains across the samples. The empirically derived factor model suggests that NP performance and FC are best explained as a single latent trait applicable to people with SCZ and BPD.

TPH1 alleles showed no association with demographic characteristics, general intelligence, impulsive personality traits, or accuracy and response latency indices on the go\/no-go task. Participants carrying the risk alleles, however, showed less activity primarily in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and medial PFC under conditions of response inhibition.

An indirect relationship was found between executive function and psychosocial adjustment through maladaptive coping strategies: behavioral and mental disengagement, and substance abuse; adaptive coping strategies: acceptance, active, positive reinterpretation, and growth, as well as for an index of adaptive coping. In general, a relationship was found between better performance on tasks of executive function and psychosocial adjustment when adaptive coping strategies were low, as opposed to high, or maladaptive coping strategies were high, as opposed to low. Some unexpected findings are also discussed. Executive function and psychosocial adjustment is mediated and moderated by coping strategies used by PwMS. Well-preserved executive function provides relative protection from poorer adjustment in the presence of high maladaptive or low adaptive coping. PwMS who perform poorly on tasks of executive function benefit from using less cognitively demanding adaptive coping strategies to enhance adjustment outcomes and further research in this area would be advantageous to underpin effective intervention strategies. ","533":"Previous research has demonstrated that prefrontal activity is related to control over stress responses. However, the causal mechanisms are not well understood. In this study we investigated the possible influence of brain stimulation on the physiological stress response system. Because an increased stress response is known to precipitate psychiatric disorders, further inquiry can have important clinical implications. In 38 healthy, right-handed female participants, we examined the effects of a single sham-controlled high-frequency (HF) repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) session over the left (n = 19) and right (n = 19) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the autonomic nervous system stress response, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV). Stress was transiently induced through evaluative negative feedbacks. Although the induction procedure was efficient in increasing self-reported distress in all groups and conditions, only after real HF-rTMS over the left DLPFC the physiological stress response was diminished, as indicated by a significant increase in HRV. No effects were found in the sham or right side stimulation condition. These findings demonstrate that increasing brain activity by HF-rTMS over the left DLPFC can help attenuating physiological stress reactions. Results are indicative of the positive effects of rTMS on stress resilience and underscore the possible benefit of HF-rTMS as a transdiagnostic intervention. Finally, the results also show that effects only occur when stimulating the left DLPFC, which is in line with the therapeutic effects of HF-rTMS in affective disorders.

However, it is not known whether and how geographical and physical characteristics of lived environments contribute to cognitive aging. Evidence of higher prevalence of dementia in rural rather than urban contexts suggests that urban environments may be more stimulating either cognitively, socially, or in terms of lifestyle. The present study explored urban\/rural differences in cognition for healthy community-dwelling older people while controlling for a comprehensive spectrum of confounding factors. Cognitive performance of 3,765 healthy Irish people aged 50+ years participating in Wave 1 of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging was analyzed in relation to current location of residence-urban, other settlements, or rural areas-and its interaction with childhood residence. Regression models controlled for sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors. Urban residents showed better performance than the other 2 residence groups for global cognition and executive functions after controlling for covariates. Childhood urban residence was associated with a cognitive advantage especially for currently rural participants. Our findings suggest higher cognitive functioning for urban residents, although childhood residence modulates this association. Suggestions for further developments of these results are discussed.

We investigated whether the negative relation between preschoolers' ADHD symptoms and 8-year-old reading achievement is directly related to the severity of inattention or is mediated by early language skills. Children (n = 150; 76% boys) were evaluated at 3 time points: preschool (T1), mean (SD) age = 4.24 (.49) years; 1 year later (T2), mean (SD) age = 5.28 (.50) years; and during school age (T3), mean (SD) age = 8.61 (.31) years. At T1, parents' Kiddie-SADS responses were dimensionalized to reflect ADHD severity. Children completed the Language domain of the NEPSY (i.e., A Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment) at T1 and again at T2. At T3, children completed the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test, Second Edition Word Reading, Pseudoword Decoding, Reading Comprehension, and Spelling subtests, and their teachers completed ratings of Reading and Written Expression performance in school. The mediating effect of T2 Language on the relation between preschool Inattention and age 8 Reading was examined using the nonparametric bootstrapping procedure, while controlling for T1 Language. Language ability at T2 mediated the path from preschool inattention (but not hyperactivity\/impulsivity) to 8-year-old reading achievement (both test scores and ratings) after controlling for preschoolers' language ability. Early attentional deficits may negatively impact school-age reading outcomes by compromising the development of language skills, which in turn imperils later reading achievement. Screening children with attentional problems for language impairment, as well as implementing early intervention for both attentional and language problems may be critical to promote reading achievement during school years. (PsycINFO Database Record ","537":"General intelligence is important for success in daily life, fueling interest in developing cognitive training as an intervention to improve fluid ability (Gf). A major obstacle to the design of effective cognitive interventions has been the paucity of hypotheses bearing on mechanisms underlying transfer of cognitive training to Gf. Despite the large amounts of money and time currently being expended on cognitive training, there is little scientific agreement on how, or even whether, Gf can be heightened by such training. We review the relevant strands of evidence on cognitive-training-related changes in (a) cortical mechanisms of distraction suppression, and (b) activation of the dorsal attention network (DAN). We hypothesize that training-related increases in control of attention are important for what is termed far transfer of cognitive training to untrained abilities, notably to Gf. We review the evidence that distraction suppression evident in behavior, neuronal firing, scalp electroencephalography, and hemodynamic change is important for protecting target processing during perception and also for protecting targets held in working memory. Importantly, attentional control also appears to be central to performance on Gf assessments. Consistent with this evidence, forms of cognitive training that increase ability to ignore distractions (e.g., working memory training and perceptual training) not only affect the DAN but also affect transfer to Gf. Our hypothesis is supported by existing evidence. However, to advance the field of cognitive training, it is necessary that competing hypotheses on mechanisms of far transfer of cognitive training be advanced and empirically tested.

We examined changes in CR in older adults participating over 4 years in the Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project. A sample of 459 healthy older adults between 50 and 79 years of age underwent a comprehensive annual assessment of current CR, neuropsychological function, and psychosocial factors over a 4-year period. The intervention group of 359 older adults (M = 59.61 years, SD = 6.67) having completed a minimum of 12 months part-time university study were compared against a control reference group of 100 adults (M = 62.49 years, SD = 6.24) who did not engage in further education. Growth mixture modeling demonstrated that 44.3% of the control sample showed no change in CR, whereas 92.5% of the further education participants displayed a significant linear increase in CR over the 4 years of the study. These results indicate that older adults engaging in high-level mental stimulation display an increase in CR over a 4-year period. Increasing mental activity in older adulthood may be a viable strategy to improve cognitive function and offset cognitive decline associated with normal aging. (PsycINFO Database Record ","540":"The goal of this study was to explore whether the tool-use disorders observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and semantic dementia (SD) are of the same nature as those observed in left brain-damaged (LBD) patients. Recent evidence indicates that LBD patients with apraxia of tool use encounter difficulties in solving mechanical problems, characterized by the absence of specific strategies. This pattern may show the presence of impaired mechanical knowledge, critical for both familiar and novel tool use. So, we explored the strategies followed by AD and SD patients in mechanical problem-solving tasks in order to determine whether mechanical knowledge is also impaired in these patients. We used a mechanical problem-solving task in both choice (i.e., several tools were proposed) and no-choice (i.e., only 1 tool was proposed) conditions. We analyzed quantitative data and strategy profiles. AD patients but not SD patients met difficulties in solving mechanical problem-solving tasks. However, the key finding is that AD patients, despite their difficulties, showed strategy profiles that are similar to that of SD patients or controls. Moreover, AD patients exhibited a strategy profile distinct from the one previously observed in LBD patients. Those observations lead us to consider that difficulties met by AD patients to solve mechanical problems or even to use familiar tools may not be caused by mechanical knowledge impairment per se. In broad terms, what we call apraxia of tool use in AD is certainly not the same as apraxia of tool use observed in LBD patients.

Graphical models are useful for studying complex neural networks as this method provides information about unique connectivity between regions within the context of the entire network of interest. Here, the authors explored the neural networks during covert reading to determine the role of feedforward and feedback loops in covert speech production. Brain activity of skilled adult readers was assessed in real word and pseudoword reading tasks with functional MRI (fMRI). The authors provide evidence for activity coherence in the feedforward system (inferior frontal gyrus-supplementary motor area) during real word reading and in the feedback system (supramarginal gyrus-precentral gyrus) during pseudoword reading. Graphical models provided evidence of an extensive, highly connected, neural network when individuals read real words that relied on coordination of the feedforward system. In contrast, when individuals read pseudowords the authors found a limited\/restricted network that relied on coordination of the feedback system. Together, these results underscore the importance of considering multiple pathways and articulatory loops during language tasks and provide evidence for a print-to-speech neural network.

We investigated associations between age, sex, education, and cognitive performance in young or middle-aged adults and evaluated data reduction methods to optimally capture cognitive performance in our population-based data. This study is part of the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. The 3,596 randomly selected subjects (aged 3-18 years in 1980) have been followed up for 30 years. In 2011, a computer-based cognitive testing battery (the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [CANTAB]) was used to assess several cognitive domains. Principal component analysis, categorical and standardized classifications were applied to the cognitive data. Among 34- to 49-year-old participants, cognitive performance declined with age, while education associated with better cognitive functions in several cognitive domains. Men had higher performance on all cognitive domains except visual or episodic memory, in which women outperformed men. The results were similar regardless of the data reduction method used. The associations between sex, age, education, and cognitive performance are already apparent in young adulthood or middle age. Principal component analyses, categorical and standardized classifications are useful tools to analyze CANTAB cognitive data. (PsycINFO Database Record ","543":"The Tower of London (TOL) is widely used to assess planning ability as a prototypical executive function in healthy and clinical populations. Despite its popularity, there is still no consensus on (a) whether the TOL measures a psychometrically unidimensional trait, and (b) how differences in problem structure relate to the difficulty of individual items. Employing the framework of factor analysis and item response theory we investigated these issues of construct validity in a sample of 798 participants (443 female; 16 to 84 years). Participants worked on the TOL-Freiburg version (TOL-F) comprising a set of 24 4- to 6-move problems, which--based on comprehensive cognitive task analyses-systematically differ with regard to several structural problem parameters (minimum number of moves, search depth, goal hierarchy). Results revealed that TOL-F performance is mainly explained by 1 major factor, while further minor factors additionally account for smaller, but possibly still informative, shares of variance. Individual item difficulties can be predicted by the experimentally varied problem parameters to a high degree (r = .89) and can be considered stable across different levels of age, sex, education, and planning ability. These findings demonstrate the TOL-F's construct validity as measuring planning ability in terms of an essentially unidimensional cognitive function while adhering to theory-driven concepts of task difficulty. TOL-F task performance hence represents an accurate, robust, and theoretically grounded estimation of a participant's planning ability. The results further highlight the merit of using established concepts from experimental psychology for improving neuropsychological assessment. ","544":"This study examined the relationship between cortical thickness in executive control networks and neuropsychological measures of executive function. Forty-one community-dwelling older adults completed an MRI scan and a neuropsychological battery including 5 measures of executive function. Factor analysis of executive function measures revealed 2 distinct factors: (a) Complex Attention Control (CAC), comprised of tasks that required immediate response to stimuli and involved subtle performance feedback; and (b) Sustained Executive Control (SEC), comprised of tasks that involved maintenance and manipulation of information over time. Neural networks of interest were the frontoparietal network (F-P) and cingulo-opercular network (C-O), which have previously been hypothesized to relate to different components of executive function, based on functional MRI studies, but not neuropsychological factors. Linear regression models revealed that greater cortical thickness in the F-P network, but not the C-O network, predicted better performance on the CAC factor, whereas greater cortical thickness in the C-O network, but not the F-P network, predicted better performance on the SEC factor. The relationship between cortical thickness and performance on executive function measures was characterized by a double dissociation between the thickness of cortical regions hypothesized to be involved in executive control and distinct executive processes. Results indicate that fundamentally different executive processes may be predicted by cortical thickness in distinct brain networks. ","545":"Deficits in cognitive flexibility have been suggested to underlie the repetitive and stereotyped behavior in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because cognitive flexibility is primarily mediated by the frontal lobe, where structural and functional abnormalities have been extensively found in these individuals, it is conceivable that their deficits in cognitive flexibility are related to abnormal activations of the frontal lobe. The present study investigates cognitive flexibility and its underlying neurophysiological activities as indicated by theta oscillations in children with ASD. Twenty-five children with high-functioning ASD and 25 IQ- and age-matched typically developing (TD) children were subjected to neuropsychological assessments on cognitive flexibility and electroencephalography recordings. The children with ASD performed significantly worse than the TD children across the tasks of cognitive flexibility, including the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). These children also demonstrated a reduced increase of the theta power localized in multiple brain regions, including various sectors of the frontal lobe at the late stage (i.e., 600 ms-900 ms poststimulus interval) but not the early stage (i.e., 250 ms-550 ms poststimulus interval) of the performance of the modified WCST. The suppressed late frontal theta activities were further shown to be significantly correlated with a poorer performance on the cognitive flexibility measures. Our findings suggest that abnormal activations of multiple cortical regions, especially the frontal lobe, form the neural basis of the cognitive flexibility deficits in children with ASD. In addition, we found an EEG marker of cognitive flexibility which could be used to monitor treatment outcomes objectively. ","546":"Hoarding disorder (HD) is an often incapacitating psychiatric illness associated with a wide range of neurocognitive abnormalities. Some prior neuropsychological studies have found executive dysfunction in HD, but no clear pattern has emerged. One potential reason for discrepant results in previous studies might be the inclusion of patients on psychotropic and other medications that can affect neurocognitive performance. Therefore, we examined neurocognitive functioning in medication-free HD patients. We also added a novel investigation of implicit learning, which has been found to be abnormal in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders. Twenty-six participants meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) diagnostic criteria for HD and 23 normal controls were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and symptom rating scales. All participants were free of psychotropic medications for at least 6 weeks prior to the study. HD participants showed no significant differences from normal controls on measures of verbal memory, attention, or executive functioning, including response inhibition, planning, organization, and decision making. However, HD participants demonstrated a trend toward less implicit learning and greater use of explicit learning strategies during perceptual categorization compared to normal controls. HD participants who used an implicit strategy performed significantly worse than controls who used an implicit strategy. Hoarding symptom severity was not associated with neurocognitive performance. HD patients may have a tendency to use explicit rather than implicit learning strategies for perceptual categorization but perform as well as normal controls on many other neurocognitive measures. Future studies should assess unmedicated participants and examine test strategies, not just outcomes. ","547":"Emotion recognition has been widely studied in Huntington disease (HD), but only a few studies have investigated more complex social cognition and, when so, exclusively in manifest HD. The present study sought to investigate social-cognitive functions in a large, consecutive cohort of premanifest and manifest HD gene expansion carriers using tests assessing sarcasm detection, theory of mind (ToM), and emotion recognition. Fifty manifest, 50 premanifest HD gene expansion carriers, and 39 at risk gene expansion negative healthy controls were included. All participants were tested with sarcasm detection, ToM, and emotion recognition tasks. Between-group comparisons of test performances and correlation analyses of test performances and disease burden scores were made. Group comparisons showed significant differences in performances on the social-cognitive tests between manifest HD gene expansion carriers and healthy controls, but differences in performances between premanifest HD gene expansion carriers and healthy controls were not statistically significant. Correlation analysis showed that the worse test performances were associated with higher disease burden scores in all HD gene expansion carriers. Our findings support a theory of impaired social-cognitive functions in the early stages of HD. Test performances decreased with increasing disease burden in all HD gene expansion carriers, suggesting that social-cognitive tests may be useful for tracking disease progression. Simple emotion recognition tasks are just as sensitive for measuring social-cognitive deficits as more complex measures, but knowledge of the quality of social-cognitive impairments in HD can be of great importance to both patients and caregivers. ","548":"Given poor sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria in identifying dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the use of cognitive and olfactory measures to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from DLB was assessed. Twenty-six patients with DLB and 60 patients with AD were administered several cognitive measures and the Brief Smell Identification Task (BSIT). Patients with DLB performed significantly worse on the BSIT and visuoconstruction tasks than patients with AD, but significantly better on delayed recall of a word list. Sensitivity and specificity of these measures in identifying DLB are presented for each of these tasks alone and in combination. The best balance of sensitivity and specificity was found with a combination of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and BSIT (81% sensitivity, 90% specificity). These data have practical implications by providing cut scores than can be used to emphasize either specificity or sensitivity in identifying patients with DLB. ","549":"An increasing number of results show that specific language impairment (SLI) is often associated with impairments in executive functions (EF), but the nature, extent, and generality of these deficits is yet unclear. The aim of the paper is to present results from verbal and nonverbal tasks examining EF in children with SLI and their age-matched typically developing (TD) peers. 31 children with SLI were tested on verbal and nonverbal versions of simple and complex span, fluency, N-back, and Stroop tasks. Their performance was compared with 31 TD children matched on age and nonverbal IQ. The design allows us to examine whether executive functions are similarly affected in SLI in verbal and nonverbal tasks. The SLI group showed difficulties in verbal versions of complex span (listening span task) and fluency but not in inhibition (Stroop tasks) relative to TD age-matched children. Including simple verbal span (digit span) as a covariate eliminated group differences on both verbal tasks. Children with SLI were found to be impaired on several verbal measures of EF, but these differences were largely due to more fundamental deficits in verbal short-term span. ","550":"Anticipatory and consummatory dissociation of hedonic experience may manifest as trait anhedonia in healthy and clinical populations. It is still unclear whether the underlying neural mechanisms of the monetary-based and affect-based incentive delay paradigms are distinct from each other. The present study aimed to examine the similarities and differences between the Affect Incentive Delay (AID) and the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) imaging paradigms in relation to brain activations. We administered the AID and the MID imaging tasks to 28 adolescent participants. A cue signaling the type of forthcoming feedback (reward or punishment) was displayed to the participants, followed by a target-hit task with corresponding reward or punishment. The striatal and limbic regions were activated during the anticipatory phase of MID, while there was no brain activation during the anticipatory phase of AID. In the consummatory phase, the MID task activated the medial frontal cortex, while the AID task activated the frontal and dorsal limbic regions. We further found that the anhedonic group exhibited significant hypoactivation than the nonanhedonic group at the left pulvinar, the left claustrum and the left insula to positive cues in the anticipatory phase of the AID task. The results suggest that the AID and the MID tasks have unique activation patterns. Our findings also suggest that the AID task may be more sensitive in detecting anhedonia in people with trait anhedonia. ","551":"Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember to carry out intended actions after a delay. PM impairments are common in schizophrenia patients and are thought to be related to their prefrontal cortex dysfunction; however, this has not yet been examined directly in the research literature. The current study aimed to examine abnormalities in brain activation during PM task performance in schizophrenia patients. Twenty-two schizophrenia patients and 25 matched healthy controls were scanned in a 3-T MRI machine while performing a PM task. The results showed that compared to the healthy controls, schizophrenia patients performed significantly worse on the PM task. Furthermore, they exhibited decreased brain activation in frontal cortex including the right superior frontal gyri (Brodmann area 10), and other related brain areas like the anterior cingulate gyrus, parietal and temporal cortex, including precuneus, and some subcortext, including parahippocampal gyrus and putamen. These findings confirm the involvement and importance of the prefrontal cortex in PM and show evidence of hypofrontality in schizophrenia patients while performing a PM task.

Older participants (n = 1,965) in 3 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies who had no cognitive impairment at baseline underwent annual clinical evaluations for a mean of 8.0 years (SD = 5.0). The authors defined depression diagnostically, as major depression during the study period, and psychometrically, as elevated depressive symptoms during the study period, and established their relation to cognitive outcomes (incident dementia, rate of cognitive decline). A total of 657 participants died and underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination. The authors estimated the association of depression with 6 dementia-related markers (tau tangles, beta-amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, gross and microscopic infarcts) in logistic regression models. In the full cohort, 9.4% were diagnosed with major depression and 8.6% had chronically elevated depressive symptoms, both of which were related to adverse cognitive outcomes. In the 657 persons who died and had a neuropathologic examination, higher beta-amyloid plaque burden was associated with higher likelihood of major depression (present in 11.0%; OR = 1.392, 95% CI = 1.088, 1.780) but not with elevated depressive symptoms (present in 11.3%; OR = 0.919, 95% CI = 0.726, 1.165). None of the other pathologic markers was related to either of the depression measures. Neither dementia nor antidepressant medication modified the relation of pathology to depression. The results do not support the hypothesis that major depression is associated with dementia-related pathology. ","553":"Deficits in working memory (WM) are commonly observed after brain injuries and cause severe impairments in patients' everyday life. It is still under debate if training can enhance or rehabilitate WM in case of malfunction. The current meta-analysis investigates this issue from a clinical point of view. It addresses under which conditions and for which target group WM training may be justifiable. Relevant WM training studies were identified by searching electronic literature databases with a comprehensive search term. In total, 103 studies, which added up to 112 independent group comparisons (N = 6,113 participants), were included in the analysis. Overall, WM training caused a moderate and long-lasting improvement in untrained WM tasks. Moreover, improvement of WM functioning led to sustainable better evaluation of everyday life functioning, however, effect sizes were small. Concerning transfer effects on other cognitive domains, long-lasting improvements with small effect sizes were observed in cognitive control and reasoning\/intelligence. In contrast, small immediate, but no long-term effects were found for attention and long-term memory. Studies with brain injured patients demonstrated long-lasting improvements in WM functions with moderate to large effect sizes. A main moderator variable of intervention efficacy is the number of training sessions applied. WM training produces long-lasting beneficial effects which are strongly pronounced in patients with acquired brain injuries. This finding supports the application of WM training in clinical settings. To determine optimal training conditions, future studies must systematically investigate the characteristics of interventions as they are at present inevitably confounded. ","554":"Previous studies have reported deficits in decision making under ambiguity for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). It is unknown whether mTLE is also associated with alterations at a predecisional stage. This study aimed to gain insight into predecisional processing of patients with mTLE. We compared performance of patients with mTLE (n = 25) with that of healthy controls (n = 75) on the information sampling task (IST), a task assessing reflection-impulsivity and predecisional information sampling. Patients and healthy controls showed a similar performance pattern in both conditions of the IST as indicated by the amount of information gathered, the degree of uncertainty tolerated, and the number of decision errors made. They both also demonstrated a significant sensitivity to the different reward characteristics of the task. For the patient group, we found no significant effects on performance on the IST of epilepsy lateralization, abnormality side, structural abnormality (hippocampus vs. amygdala), and medication (monotherapy vs. polytherapy). Reflection processes and predecisional information sampling as tested by the IST are intact in mTLE. Patients collect as much information as healthy individuals and adapt their behavior according to the changing reward conditions. Our findings indicate that in well-defined risk situations, where memory demands are sufficiently minimized, patients with mTLE should be able to gather sufficient information, weight risks and benefits, and make advantageous decisions. ","555":"Processing speed (PS) and working memory (WM), core abilities that support learning, are vulnerable to disruption following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Developmental increases in WM are related to age-related changes in PS. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether WM deficits in children with TBI are mediated by PS. The performance of children with complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (n = 77) was examined relative to an orthopedic injury (n = 30) and a healthy comparison group (n = 40) an average of 4 years after injury (range 8 months to 12 years). Coding was utilized as a measure of PS, while the WM measures included complex verbal and visual-spatial span tasks with parallel processing requirements. Mediation analysis examined whether TBI might have an indirect effect on WM through PS. Children in the TBI group performed more poorly than the combined comparison groups on coding and visual-spatial WM. Verbal WM scores were lower in TBI and the healthy comparison relative to the orthopedic group. TBI severity group differences were found on coding, but not WM measures. The relation between coding and both the WM tasks was similar. Bootstrap regression analyses suggested that PS, as measured by coding, might partially mediate the effect of group performance on WM. TBI disrupts core PS and WM abilities that scaffold more complex abilities. Importantly, slowed PS was associated with WM deficits commonly identified following pediatric TBI. Implications of our findings regarding the relation between PS and WM may suggest interventions for children and adolescents following TBI. ","556":"Few studies have attempted to describe the range of cognitive impairments in individuals with psychiatric disorders who experienced maltreatment as children. The aims of this meta-analysis were to establish the impact of maltreatment and psychiatric disorders on cognition, and to examine the change in impact from childhood to adulthood. Twelve publications from 1970 to 2013 were included, with the following inclusion criteria: (a) individuals with a psychiatric disorder who experienced maltreatment, (b) use of at least 1 standardized neuropsychological measure, and (c) use of a control group without any psychiatric disorder or mistreatment. The majority of studies (10\/12) were about posttraumatic stress disorder. Several effect sizes were calculated (Hedge's g) according to the cognitive domains. The results of the meta-analysis demonstrate that the combination of psychiatric disorders and childhood maltreatment has a negative impact on global cognitive performance, with a moderate effect size (g = -0.59). The most affected cognitive domains for individuals aged 7- to 18-years-old were visual episodic memory (g = -0.97), executive functioning (g = -0.90), and intelligence (g = -0.68). For individuals over the age of 18-years-old, the most affected cognitive domains were verbal episodic memory (g = -0.77), visuospatial\/problem solving (g = -0.73), and attention (g = -0.72). The impact of maltreatment and psychiatric disorders was greater in children than in adults (slope = 0.008, p &lt; .002). The results suggest that exposure to maltreatment and the presence of psychiatric disorders have a broad impact on cognition, with specific neuropsychological profile. ","557":null,"558":"According to a still-controversial view of recognition, projections between the perirhinal cortex and the medial subdivision of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (mMDT) support the mnemonic processes underlying familiarity, whereas a separate extended hippocampal system is critical for the recollection of episodic details during recognition. In this study, we examined item recognition, familiarity, and recollection for faces and words in a patient (OG) with a right-sided lesion centered on the mMDT, which encroached on the central medial midline nucleus and may have resulted in partial disconnection of the mammillothalamic tract. On the basis of OG's neuropathology, the dual-process signal-detection (DPSD) high-threshold theory and the material-specific hypothesis of long-term memory together predicted a material-specific impairment in familiarity for novel facial memoranda, with a lesser decline in recollection of novel faces at short retention intervals. No abnormalities in either familiarity- or recollection-driven recognition of verbal memoranda were expected. Comparing the performance of OG and that of a group of 10 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched healthy controls, the remember-know procedure revealed the dissociations predicted by the material-specific and DPSD hypotheses: With recognition of previously novel faces, OG showed a deficit in familiarity-driven recognition that was significantly greater than the insignificant reduction in his recollection. All components of his word recognition were, however, preserved. A memory profile, marked by a dissociation between familiarity and recollection, fits naturally with the DPSD model and is incompatible with the idea that these kinds of memories reflect different degrees of trace strength. ","559":"Executive dysfunctions in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are often described but poorly understood. Specifically, research on patients' ability to flexibly shift between cognitive sets is still scarce and unsystematic. The present study set out to compensate for this lack by providing an in-depth analysis of ALS-related set-shifting impairments. We first present a quantitative overview of the literature revealing that the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is sensitive to set-shifting impairments in ALS. Moreover, we evaluated patients' performance on a computerized task-switching paradigm modeled after the WCST to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying their set-shifting impairments. Twenty-one ALS patients and 21 age- and education-matched controls were required to respond to changing task demands while their EEG was being measured. Behavioral results revealed significant set-shifting deficits in patients suffering from ALS. Executive deficits were accompanied by substantial alterations of event-related brain activity. While switch cues elicited a more positive posterior event-related potential (ERP) waveform than repeat cues in healthy controls, ERP amplitudes did not vary as a function of switching demand in ALS patients. Individual differences in posterior switch positivity were reliably associated with patients' performance on neuropsychological tests of executive functioning. The absence of switch-related ERP modulations appears to be a sensitive indicator of executive deficits in ALS patients. Our results suggest that ALS compromises the frontoparietal brain networks involved in anticipatory set-shifting, rendering patients unable to flexibly adapt to changes in environmental contingencies. ","560":"The Navon effect (Navon, 1977) is an automatic tendency to process the global picture prior to local details when processing compound patterns. However, several recent studies have reported that this effect is lacking in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although previous research has shown that the Navon effect is strongly affected by visual angles, whether this phenomenon will also be observed in ADHD is yet to be understood. We examine the lack of the Navon effect in ADHD under various visual angles to ensure that this phenomenon is not an artifact of saliency. By employing three different visual angles for the local stimuli, global and local processing of Navon-type hierarchical letters was examined in participants with ADHD (n = 15) and a comparison group (n = 17). ADHD participants presented with a lack of the Navon effect without local processing deficit regardless of visual angle, in comparison to non-ADHD participants. A lack of global precedence and global-to-local interference without local processing deficit can be generalized in ADHD. This suggests that people with ADHD experience difficulties in processing the \"whole picture,\" and it also challenges the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria of ADHD in which the failure to pay close attention to details was emphasized. Moreover, the current results have important implications for understanding ADHD and could also have significant clinical value. ","561":"Anxiety following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common problem; however, disparate prevalence estimates limit the clinical utility of research. The purpose of the current study was to examine how differences in methodological variables and sample characteristics impact on the prevalence of anxiety. Data from 41 studies that examined either the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) diagnoses or clinically significant \"cases\" of self-reported anxiety following adult, nonpenetrating TBI were analyzed, and the impact of diagnostic criteria, measure, postinjury interval and injury severity was evaluated. Overall, 11% of people were diagnosed with GAD and 37% reported clinically significant levels of anxiety following TBI. Prevalence estimates varied for different diagnostic criteria (range: 2%-19%), interview schedules (range: 2%-28%), and self-report measures (range: 36%-50%). GAD and \"cases\" of anxiety were most prevalent 2 to 5 years postinjury. The rates of GAD increased with injury severity (mild: 11%, severe 15%), but \"cases\" decreased (mild: 53%, severe: 38%), although neither difference was significant. Anxiety is common after a TBI and ongoing monitoring and treatment should be provided. Methodological and sample characteristics should be clear and well-defined, as differences across studies (e.g., how anxiety is conceptualized, which measure is used, time since injury, injury severity) impact prevalence rates. ","562":null,"563":"Cognitive slowing is a core neuropsychological symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess the extent to which cognitive slowing in MS was predicted by changes in dorsolateral prefrontal networks. We assessed patients with relapsing-remitting MS and healthy controls (HCs) on measures of processing speed. Participants underwent a functional MRI while performing a processing speed task to allow assessment of task-based connectivity. Patients were slower than HCs on the processing speed tasks. Patients showed attenuated connectivity between right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and task-relevant brain regions compared to HCs during processing speed task performance. Patients' connectivity with DLPFC in these group-disparate networks accounted for significant variability in their performance on processing speed measures administered both in and out of the imaging environment. Specifically, patients who had stronger functional connections with DLPFC in group-disparate networks performed faster than patients with weaker connections with DLPFC in group-disparate networks. Results suggest that MS-related cognitive slowing can be accounted for by systemic alterations in executive functional networks. ","564":"The present study aimed to investigate theory of mind (the ability to infer others' mental states) deficit in 20 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy controls, with 2 theory of mind tasks, 1 of them being a real interactive task. Previous results concerning preserved or altered theory of mind abilities in Alzheimer's disease have been inconsistent and relationships with other cognitive dysfunctions (notably episodic memory and executive functions) are still unclear. The first task we used was a false belief paradigm as frequently used in literature whereas the second task, a referential communication task, assessed theory of mind in a real situation of interaction. Participants also underwent neuropsychological evaluation to investigate potential relationships between theory of mind and memory deficits. The results showed that Alzheimer patients presented a genuine and significant theory of mind deficit compared to control participants characterized notably by difficulties to attribute knowledge to an interlocutor in a real social interaction. These results further confirm that theory of mind is altered in early stages of Alzheimer dementia which is consistent with previous works. More specifically, this study is the first to objectivize this impairment in social interaction. ","565":"To examine changes in odor identification performance and cognitive measures in healthy aging individuals. While cross-sectional studies reveal associations between odor identification and measures of episodic memory, processing speed, and executive function, longitudinal studies so far have been ambiguous with regard to demonstrating that odor identification may be predictive of decline in cognitive function. One hundred and 7 healthy aging individuals (average age 60.2 years, 71% women) were assessed with an odor identification test and nonolfactory cognitive measures of verbal episodic memory, mental processing speed, executive function, and language 3 times, covering a period of 6.5 years. The cross-sectional results revealed odor identification performance to be associated with age, measures of verbal episodic memory, and processing speed. Using linear mixed models, the longitudinal analyses revealed age-associated decline in all measures. Controlling for retest effects, the analyses demonstrated that gender was a significant predictor for episodic memory and mental processing speed. Odor identification performance was further shown to be a significant predictor for episodic verbal memory. This study shows age-related decline in odor identification as well as nonolfactory cognitive measures. The finding showing that odor identification is a significant predictor for verbal episodic memory is of great clinical interest as odor identification has been suggested as a sensitive measure of incipient pathologic cognitive decline. ","566":"To explore the frequency of posttraumatic olfactory (dys)function 1 year after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and determine whether there is a relationship between olfactory identification and neuropsychological test performance, injury severity and TBI-related disability. A population-based multicenter study including 129 individuals with severe TBI (99 males; 16 to 85 years of age) that could accomplish neuropsychological examinations. Olfactory (dys)function (anosmia, hyposmia, normosmia) was assessed by the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) or the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). Three tests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) were used to assess processing speed, verbal fluency, inhibition and set-shifting, and the California Verbal Learning Test-II was used to examine verbal memory. The Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) was used to measure disability level. Employing 2 different smell tests in 2 equal-sized subsamples, the UPSIT sample (n = 65) classified 34% with anosmia and 52% with hyposmia, while the B-SIT sample (n = 64) classified 20% with anosmia and 9% with hyposmia. Individuals classified with anosmia by the B-SIT showed significantly lower scores for set-shifting, category switching fluency and delayed verbal memory compared to hyposmia and normosmia groups. Only the B-SIT scores were significantly correlated with neuropsychological performance and GOSE scores. Brain injury severity (Rotterdam CT score) and subarachnoid hemorrhage were related to anosmia. Individuals classified with anosmia demonstrated similar disability as those with hyposmia\/normosmia. Different measures of olfaction may yield different estimates of anosmia. Nevertheless, around 1 third of individuals with severe TBI suffered from anosmia, which may also indicate poorer cognitive outcome. ","567":"It is known that some environmental variables can significantly affect the development of executive functions (EF). The primary aim of this study was to analyze whether some family conditions, such as the adolescent's perception of the quality of parent-child relationships and the socioeconomic status (SES; assessed according to education, occupational status, and income) are significantly associated with EF test scores. There were 370 Pakistani participants ranging in age 13 to 19 years who were selected and then individually administered the following tests taken from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS): Trail Making Test (TMT), Design Fluency Test (DFT), Color Word Interference Test (CWIT), and Card Sorting Test (CST). In addition, a Parent-Child Relationship Scale (PCRS) also was administered. Results showed that perceived \"neglect\" in the PCRS was negatively associated with the 4 EF test scores. Parents' education and SES were positively associated with 3 EF measures: DFT, CWIT, and CST. Further correlational analyses revealed that inhibition (as measured with the CWIT) and problem-solving ability (as measured with the CST) were significantly associated with the perceived parent-child relationships. Some gender differences also were observed: males outperformed females on TMT, DFT, and CST, while females outperformed males in the CWIT. It was concluded that perceived parent-child relationships, SES, and parents' education are significantly associated with executive function test performance during adolescents. ","568":"Although Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation, its phenotypic presentation differs widely. Variability in clinical phenotypes of HD may reflect the existence of disease subtypes. This hypothesis was tested in prodromal participants from the longitudinal Neurobiological Predictors of Huntington Disease (PREDICT-HD) study. We performed clustering using longitudinal data assessing motor, cognitive, and depression symptoms. Using data from 521 participants with 2,716 data points, we fit growth mixture models (GMM) that identify groups based on multivariate trajectories. In various GMM, different phases of disease progression were partitioned by progression trajectories of motor and cognitive signs, and by overall level of depression symptoms. More progressed motor signs were accompanied by more progressed cognitive signs, but not always by higher levels of depressive symptoms. In several models, there were at least 2 groups with similar trajectories for motor and cognitive signs that showed different levels for depression symptoms-one with a very low level of depression and the other with a higher level of depression. Findings indicate that at least intermediate HD progression might be associated with different levels of depression. Depression is one of the few symptoms that is treatable in HD and has implications for clinical care. Identification of potential depression subtypes may also help to select appropriate patients for clinical trials. ","569":"To ascertain whether the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) could be used to detect and identify measurable cognitive differences between older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as compared with healthy older controls (HC). Older adults with self-identified SCD and age-matched controls completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment battery including the clinical version of the IGT, as well as self-report measures of mood and personality. The groups did not differ on clinically normed scores on the IGT. However, the groups did differ in the specific decks chosen as they progressed through the task, with the SCD group choosing the advantageous, high loss-frequency deck (Deck C) more often toward the end of the task. Using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation, we show that the prospect valence learning (PVL) model outperforms the expectancy valence learning (EVL) model in parsimoniously accounting for task performance by both groups. The PVL model explains the difference in deck choices between groups as being because of an underlying difference in their learning rate, with the SCD group emphasizing the current outcome over past outcomes more than the HC group. Behavioral results indicate measureable differences in risky decision making in older adults with SCD as compared with healthy controls. Modeling results allow us to interpret this difference as potentially being because of rapid forgetting of trial-to-trial information. This work furthers our understanding of SCD, while demonstrating the use of computational modeling in the interpretation of neuropsychological data. ","570":"Time is an elusive phenomenon that is difficult to grasp with our senses. Recent work has shown how spatial representations often lie beneath temporal ones, as shown by a family of spatiotemporal congruency effects. For instance, individuals who have been exposed to left-to-right orthographic systems are better at judging short durations with their left effector and long durations with their right effector than vice versa, a phenomenon known as the spatial-temporal association of response codes (STEARC) effect. In the present neuropsychological study, we aimed to provide evidence that spatial attention mechanisms play a crucial role in generating this spatially organized mental time line. A group of 13 patients suffering from right hemisphere lesions with different degrees of spatial neglect signs and a control group of 15 age- and education-matched neurologically healthy participants were administered a unimanual version of a spatiotemporal compatibility task (STEARC task). The main results showed that the more a patient suffered from spatial neglect signs, the smaller the accuracy difference was between the left and right side responses for short durations. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that the presence of disorders in spatial attention affects the left-to-right mental time line representation, especially in its leftward segment, proportionally with the amount of deficit. This study therefore suggests the critical role of spatial attention for the emergence of a spatial representation of time durations. ","571":null,"572":"Math and attention are related in neurobiological and behavioral models of mathematical cognition. This study employed model-driven assessments of attention and math in children with spina bifida myelomeningocele (SBM), who have known math difficulties and specific attentional deficits, to more directly examine putative relations between attention and mathematical processing. The relation of other domain general abilities and math was also investigated. Participants were 9.5-year-old children with SBM (n = 44) and typically developing children (n = 50). Participants were administered experimental exact and approximate arithmetic tasks, and standardized measures of math fluency and calculation. Cognitive measures included the Attention Network Test (ANT), and standardized measures of fine motor skills, verbal working memory (WM), and visual-spatial WM. Children with SBM performed similarly to peers on exact arithmetic, but more poorly on approximate and standardized arithmetic measures. On the ANT, children with SBM differed from controls on orienting attention, but not on alerting and executive attention. Multiple mediation models showed that fine motor skills and verbal WM mediated the relation of group to approximate arithmetic; fine motor skills and visual-spatial WM mediated the relation of group to math fluency; and verbal and visual-spatial WM mediated the relation of group to math calculation. Attention was not a significant mediator of the effects of group for any aspect of math in this study. Results are discussed with reference to models of attention, WM, and mathematical cognition. ","573":"The primary aim of this study was to examine whether there is an association between magnetoencephalography-based (MEG) indices of basic cortical auditory processing and vocal affect recognition (VAR) ability in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). MEG data were collected from 25 children\/adolescents with ASD and 12 control participants using a paired-tone paradigm to measure quality of auditory physiology, sensory gating, and rapid auditory processing. Group differences were examined in auditory processing and vocal affect recognition ability. The relationship between differences in auditory processing and vocal affect recognition deficits was examined in the ASD group. Replicating prior studies, participants with ASD showed longer M1n latencies and impaired rapid processing compared with control participants. These variables were significantly related to VAR, with the linear combination of auditory processing variables accounting for approximately 30% of the variability after controlling for age and language skills in participants with ASD. VAR deficits in ASD are typically interpreted as part of a core, higher order dysfunction of the \"social brain\"; however, these results suggest they also may reflect basic deficits in auditory processing that compromise the extraction of socially relevant cues from the auditory environment. As such, they also suggest that therapeutic targeting of sensory dysfunction in ASD may have additional positive implications for other functional deficits. ","574":"Substance dependent individuals (SDIs) typically overvalue immediate and undervalue (discount) delayed rewards, and level of discounting significantly predicts posttreatment relapse and other behavioral outcomes. Delay discounting has potential significance for studies of HIV prevention and adherence to antiretroviral therapy; but effects of HIV infection on delay discounting rates among SDIs are not well understood, although discounting rates are higher among individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this study, we investigated potential additive or interactive effects of HIV and HCV infection on delay discounting performance among a group of 239 SDIs with verified HIV and HCV serostatus. All participants were verified abstinent from drugs and alcohol at testing. All participants completed measures of substance abuse characteristics and comorbid disorders, and the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, a well-known measure used to derive k coefficients, which index discounting rates. Groups were comparable on demographic, substance use, and comorbid characteristics. Compared with uninfected controls, discounting rates were significantly higher among individuals seropositive for HCV but not HIV. Additionally, no significant group differences in discounting rates were observed among HCV+ participants with or without coinfection with HIV. Group differences could not be attributed to aging or nonspecific effects of drug addiction. Additionally, increased discounting rates were associated with riskier injection practices. Potential mechanisms contributing to this discrepancy in discounting rates between HIV+ and HCV+ SDIs, including decision making, are discussed and await further study. ","575":"Studies of adolescents with histories of maltreatment typically report specific cognitive deficits in higher order functioning and attention. Emerging evidence suggests that the cognitive difficulties seen in maltreated adolescents are much broader, and go beyond executive functioning impairments. This study examined whether maltreated adolescents exhibited cognitive deficits across a number of cognitive domains, in addition to executive functioning. A group of 39 adolescents with documented histories of severe maltreatment were compared with 43 controls on measures of learning and memory, executive function, processing speed, working memory, visuoperceptual function, and language. Groups were matched demographically and on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ; Wechsler, 2003). Using multivariate analyses, the maltreated group showed significant impairments on measures of executive function and attention, working memory, learning, visuospatial function and visual processing speed. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. The FSIQ indicated that these adolescents were performing comparably with their nonmaltreated peers, though this was not the case when specific cognitive functions were measured. This demonstrates that maltreated adolescents are more likely to have a range of cognitive deficits that can only be identified with thorough neuropsychological assessment. Such deficits have the potential to significantly impair adaptive, social, emotional, and academic functioning, explaining many of the typical difficulties seen in maltreated adolescents. ","576":"Contraversive pushing (CP) is a neurologic disorder characterized by a lateral postural imbalance. Pusher patients actively push toward their contralesional side due to a misperception of the body's orientation in relation to gravity. Although not every patient with CP suffers from spatial neglect (SN), both phenomena are highly correlated in right-hemispheric patients. The present study investigates whether peripersonal visuospatial functioning differs in neglect patients with versus without CP (NP+ vs. NP- patients). Eighteen right-hemispheric stroke patients with SN were included, of which 17 in a double-blind case-control study and 1 single case with posterior pushing to supplement the discourse. A computer-based visuospatial navigation task, in which lateralized deviation can freely emerge, was used to quantify visuospatial behavior. In addition, visuospatial orienting was monitored using line bisection. Significant intergroup differences were found. The NP+ patients demonstrated a smaller ipsilesional navigational deviation and more cross-over (contralesional instead of ipsilesional deviation) in long line bisection. As such, they demonstrated a contraversive (contralesionally directed) shift in comparison with the NP- patients. These findings highlight the similarity between 2 systems of space representation. They are consistent with a coherence between the neural processing system that mainly provides for postural control, and the one responsible for nonpredominantly postural, visuospatial behavior.

However, the findings across different studies have been inconsistent, and the different neural mechanisms between adults and children with ADHD remain unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of fMRI studies to further investigate and compare the abnormalities in adults and children with ADHD during motor response inhibition. Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) was used to investigate brain activation differences between ADHD patients and controls, and a subtraction meta-analysis was performed to compare adult and child patients. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis using ALE detected significantly decreased activation during response inhibition in ADHD in the supplementary motor area, insula, caudate, and precentral gyrus, as well as increased activation in the postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. The activation decreases in the right caudate were greater in child ADHD patients than adult ADHD patients. This meta-analysis identified dysfunction in several areas of the motor inhibition network that may play a role in the abnormal neural mechanisms of response inhibition in ADHD. The comparison of child and adult subgroups raises the possibility that the persistence of functional abnormalities of the caudate may be an important factor in whether ADHD persists. ","580":"The imagination inflation effect is a type of memory distortion defined as an increased tendency to falsely remember that an item has been seen, or an action has been performed, when it has only been imagined. For patients with very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), susceptibility to the imagination inflation effect could have significant functional consequences in daily life. We assessed whether patients with very mild AD were more or less susceptible to the imagination inflation effect when compared with healthy older adults. In the first session, participants were read an action statement such as \"fill the pillbox\" and engaged in 1 of 3 activities: listened to the statement being read, performed the action, or imagined performing the action. During the second session, participants imagined action statements from the first session, as well as new action statements. During the recognition test, participants were asked to determine whether action statements were or were not performed during the first session. We found that imagining performing actions increased the tendency of patients with very mild AD to falsely recall the action as having been performed to an extent similar to that of healthy older adults. We concluded that, similar to healthy older adults, patients with very mild AD were susceptible to the imagination inflation effect, which we attributed to difficulties with source monitoring and reliance on familiarity. ","581":"The clinical differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) can no longer rely only on episodic memory impairment or executive dysfunctions, as highlighted by recent findings showing that both diseases could present with similar impairments. Objective cognitive tests assessing specific symptoms, such as impulsivity in bvFTD, are thus crucially needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in impulsivity between bvFTD and AD using a delay-discounting paradigm. An ecological delay-discounting test was administrated to 70 participants including 30 ADs, 20 bvFTD and 20 controls. AD patients were divided according to the severity of the disease into mild or moderate group. The delay-discounting score, reflecting the total percentage of impulsive choice across the entire task, was analyzed for each group. This score showed that bvFTD patients were significantly more impulsive than controls and AD patients at mild or moderate stage. AD patients, regardless of disease stage, did not differ from controls. ROC analyses revealed high and significant area under the curve (AUC, 95% confidence interval) for this score to differentiate bvFTD from AD (0.704) or controls (0.904), or both group (AD + controls; AUC = 0.791). The total delay-discounting score provided by our task showed that it could accurately differentiate bvFTD patients from AD and controls. These results support the relevancy of using tests inspired by experimental psychoeconomics and taping into reward processing to increase the distinction between both diseases. ","582":"Although loss of consciousness associated with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is thought to interfere with encoding of the TBI event, little is known about the effects of mild TBI (mTBI), which typically involves only transient disruption in consciousness. Blast-exposed Afghanistan and Iraq War veterans were asked to recall the blast event. Participants were stratified based on whether the blast was associated with probable mTBI (n = 50) or not (n = 25). Narratives were scored for organizational structure (i.e., coherence) using the Narrative Coherence Coding Scheme (Reese et al., 2011) and episodic recollection using the Autobiographical Interview Coding Procedures (Levine et al., 2002). The mTBI group produced narratives that were less coherent but contained more episodic details than those of the no-TBI group. These results suggest that mTBI interferes with the organizational quality of memory in a manner that is independent of episodic detail generation. ","583":"The precuneus is 1 of the major cortical hubs and plays an important role in normal aging and verbal fluency processing. The main aim of present study was to investigate how intrinsic brain activity in the precuneus at rest predicts individual differences in verbal fluency ability among elderly adults. Regional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis and a correlation-based functional connectivity (FC) approach were used to analyze data acquired from 101 cognitively normal elderly. ALFF in the precuneus declined with normal aging and was significantly correlated with individual differences in performance on the verbal fluency test (VFT). Specifically, ALFF in the precuneus was reduced in elderly with high fluency (HF) ability compared with those with low fluency (LF) ability. In addition, the HF individuals displayed increased functional connectivity of the precuneus with the lateral temporal area and prefrontal lobe, including the inferior frontal, medial frontal, superior temporal, middle temporal, and superior frontal gyri. Spontaneous activity in the precuneus could predict individual differences in verbal fluency processing. Our results suggest that spontaneous activity in the precuneus is an indicator of aging-related changes in semantic verbal fluency processing, or even a potential biomarker for the early detection of semantic verbal fluency deterioration. ","584":"Few studies have examined whether psychological distress and pain affect cognitive functioning in the acute to subacute phase (up to 30 days postinjury) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The current study explored whether acute posttraumatic stress, depression, and pain were associated with performance on a task of selective and sustained attention completed under conditions of increasing cognitive demands (standard, auditory distraction, and dual-task), and on tests of working memory, memory, processing speed, reaction time (RT), and verbal fluency. At a mean of 2.87 days (SD = 2.32) postinjury, 50 adult mTBI participants, consecutive admissions to a Level 1 trauma hospital, completed neuropsychological tests and self-report measures of acute posttraumatic stress, depression, and pain. A series of canonical correlation analyses was used to explore the relationships of a common set of psychological variables to various sets of neuropsychological variables. Significant results were found on the task of selective and sustained attention. Strong relationships were found between psychological variables and speed (r(c) = .56, p = .02) and psychological variables and accuracy (r(c) = .68, p = .002). Pain and acute posttraumatic stress were associated with higher speed scores (reflecting more correctly marked targets) under standard conditions. Acute posttraumatic stress was associated with lower accuracy scores across all task conditions. Moderate but nonsignificant associations were found between psychological variables and most cognitive tasks. Acute posttraumatic stress and pain show strong associations with selective and sustained attention following mTBI. ","585":"Seeing a face in motion can improve face recognition in the general population, and studies of face matching indicate that people with face recognition difficulties (developmental prosopagnosia; DP) may be able to use movement cues as a supplementary strategy to help them process faces. However, the use of facial movement cues in DP has not been examined in the context of familiar face recognition. This study examined whether people with DP were better at recognizing famous faces presented in motion, compared to static. Nine participants with DP and 14 age-matched controls completed a famous face recognition task. Each face was presented twice across 2 blocks: once in motion and once as a still image. Discriminability (A) was calculated for each block. Participants with DP showed a significant movement advantage overall. This was driven by a movement advantage in the first block, but not in the second block. Participants with DP were significantly worse than controls at identifying faces from static images, but there was no difference between those with DP and controls for moving images. Seeing a familiar face in motion can improve face recognition in people with DP, at least in some circumstances. The mechanisms behind this effect are unclear, but these results suggest that some people with DP are able to learn and recognize patterns of facial motion, and movement can act as a useful cue when face recognition is impaired. ","586":"The corpus callosum (CC), the largest commissure in the human brain, is thought to play an essential part in the formation and maintenance of lateralized cognitive and motor functions. In particular, it has been suggested that inhibition of the subdominant hemisphere via commissural fiber tracts plays a crucial role for functional lateralization. However, many studies supporting this idea have either been conducted in nonhuman model species or used indirect measures of callosal functioning. In order to directly assess the impact of the presence or absence of the CC on both the existence and the extent of functional hemispheric asymmetries, we investigated handedness and language lateralization, as well as interhemispheric information integration, in 6 high-functioning individuals with partial or complete agenesis of the CC (AgCC). Performance was compared with that of 30 IQ- and age-matched controls with intact CC. We found a stronger predisposition for ambidexterity in individuals with AgCC. Similarly, the typical right ear advantage in the dichotic listening task was significantly reduced in AgCC. Furthermore, AgCC patients generally reacted slower than controls in a test of interhemispheric information integration, and showed reduced accuracy in trials that required interhemispheric integration. These findings indicate that reduced hemispheric specialization in the acallosal brain might be due to a higher degree of hemispheric autonomy in AgCC. ","587":null,"588":"Developmental dyslexia is presumed to arise from specific phonological impairments. However, an emerging theoretical framework suggests that phonological impairments may be symptoms stemming from an underlying dysfunction of procedural learning. We tested procedural learning in adults with dyslexia (n = 15) and matched-controls (n = 15) using 2 versions of the weather prediction task: feedback (FB) and paired-associate (PA). In the FB-based task, participants learned associations between cues and outcomes initially by guessing and subsequently through feedback indicating the correctness of response. In the PA-based learning task, participants viewed the cue and its associated outcome simultaneously without overt response or feedback. In both versions, participants trained across 150 trials. Learning was assessed in a subsequent test without presentation of the outcome, or corrective feedback. The dyslexia group exhibited impaired learning compared with the control group on both the FB and PA versions of the weather prediction task. The results indicate that the ability to learn by feedback is not selectively impaired in dyslexia. Rather it seems that the probabilistic nature of the task, shared by the FB and PA versions of the weather prediction task, hampers learning in those with dyslexia. Results are discussed in light of procedural learning impairments among participants with dyslexia. ","589":"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are associated with deficits in prospective memory (PM). However, most PM research in HIV has used single-event tasks as opposed to habitual PM paradigms, which may be more relevant to clinical populations for whom many health-care behaviors must be performed both frequently and routinely. For the current study, we examined habitual PM and its associations with real-world functioning outcomes in 36 HIV+ individuals with HAND (HAND+), 70 HIV+ individuals without HAND (HAND-), and 115 HIV- individuals. The ongoing task consisted of 24 1-min Stroop trial blocks in which the emotive and cognitive load was manipulated. The habitual PM task required participants to press the spacebar once per block, but only after 20 s had elapsed. A series of MANOVAs covarying for relevant clinicodemographic factors revealed a main effect of study group on habitual PM, such that the HAND+ cohort made significantly more repetition errors than the HIV- and HAND- groups, particularly during early trial blocks. There was no main effect of ongoing task demands, nor was there an interaction between HAND group and task demands. Within the entire HIV+ sample, poorer habitual PM was associated with deficits in learning and dysfunction in real-world outcomes, including medication nonadherence and failures on a naturalistic health-care task. Findings indicate that HAND may be associated with deficient internal source monitoring or temporal discrimination for habitual PM output that may play a critical role in real-world functioning, including HIV disease management. ","590":"Adults diagnosed with attentional deficit disorder (ADHD) are easily distracted in many tasks. Yet ADHD performance on inattentional blindness (IB) tasks has not been examined. Such investigation may aid in discriminating between 3 ADHD models: the neurological model, the perceptual load theory, and the \"hunter versus farmer\" hypothesis. Distractibility was assessed in ADHD and non-ADHD college students using the MOXO task that involves detection of a single attended stimulus that repeatedly appears in the same place and in the well-known IB \"gorilla\" video which involves tracking of a stimulus moving at a fast pace in a dynamic, complex manner. ADHD college students showed increased distractibility in the MOXO task. By contrast, they performed better than controls in the attended channel of the IB task, while they were also better at noticing the unattended stimuli and thus exhibiting little-to-no inattentional blindness. As no attentional tradeoffs were evident in the IB task, it appears that the results are most consistent with the \"hunter versus farmer\" hypothesis, which postulates that ADHD individuals have an alternative cognitive style which is less equipped to deal with detection of repeated stimuli while comprising advantages in the tracking of stimuli moving in a fast dynamic manner. ","591":"There is cross-sectional evidence that neurocognitive intra-individual variability (IIV), or dispersion, is elevated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and is associated with declines in activities of daily living, including medication adherence. This longitudinal study extends this literature by examining whether increased neurocognitive IIV in HIV-positive persons over time predicts declines in medication adherence above and beyond changes in mean level of performance over a 6-month observation. After controlling for drug use, declines in mean performance, and changes in depressive symptoms, results confirmed that increases in IIV were associated with overall poorer antiretroviral medication adherence. HIV-positive individuals with the greatest increases in dispersion demonstrated marked reductions in adherence by the third month that exceeded what was observed in less variable individuals. Our results indicate that increases in dispersion are associated with poorer declines in medication adherence in HIV disease, which may have implications for the early detection and remediation of suboptimal antiretroviral adherence. ","592":"The present study explored the role of self-referencing on false alarm rates among people with mild cognitive impairment suggestive of the early signs of the Alzheimer's disease pathophysiologic process (MCI-AD). Given that people with MCI-AD demonstrate higher rates of false alarms and that false alarms have been shown to increase for self-relevant information, it was predicted that people with MCI-AD would experience a disproportionate increase in memory errors for highly self-related information. Patients with a diagnosis of MCI-AD (n = 23) and healthy control participants (n = 27) rated words for self-descriptiveness or commonness and completed a surprise recognition test. Contrary to expectations, results indicated that people with MCI-AD were at no greater risk for false alarms than were control participants as a function of self-descriptiveness, relative to a control condition. Despite the MCI-ADs' greater bias to say \"yes\" in the self condition, increasing self-descriptiveness did not lead to higher false alarm rates and did not impair performance in the self condition relative to commonness judgments. Therefore, although people with MCI-AD may be more susceptible to memory errors, they are at no greater risk of self-related errors than healthy control participants.

We investigated these abilities in individuals with the HD gene who were yet to exhibit motor onset. Participants were HD gene carriers (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 26). Gene carriers were prescreened for motor symptoms. Participants completed tasks assessing the understanding of socially inappropriate behaviors, recognition of complex mental states from photographs of peoples' eyes, everyday perspective taking, and executive functions. Gene carriers' task performance was compared to controls', and relationships were explored between ToM, executive functions, and clinical factors including disease burden and mood disorder. Performance was intact on nine of the ten executive measures in premanifest HD, with only a mild deficit in semantic fluency. However, gene carriers exhibited impairments in recognizing faux pas and complex mental states. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index yielded evidence of reduced everyday perspective taking in HD, and differences for empathy and personal distress. Everyday perspective taking was predicted by disease burden and recognition of complex mental states. We provide evidence that premanifest HD can be associated with changes in ToM. Furthermore, these deficits appear unlikely to result from executive dysfunction. HD gene carriers' impairments highlight the possibility of a relatively selective impact of early neurodegenerative changes in the striatum on ToM. Neuroimaging studies should investigate whether ToM deficits may arise in premanifest HD because of early neuropathology rather than the psychological effects of diagnostic status.

Behavioral and ERP responses were examined using a 4-stimulus visual oddball task, combining facial and nonfacial stimuli. Responses to target and nontarget stimuli were compared across groups of young adults with ADHD and comparison subjects. Participants with ADHD had poorer performance than controls on all indices of the oddball task. Higher rates of omissions and slower reaction times (RTs) of ADHD participants compared with controls had been found only in response to face targets but not in response to nonfacial targets. ERP results indicated that ADHD significantly interacted with the type of target stimuli. Participants with ADHD, compared with controls, showed a pronounced reduction in P3 and N3 amplitudes in response to face targets but not in response to nonfacial targets. The current results provide indication of modulation of face processing in adults with ADHD. ERP alterations, reflected in abnormally reduced P3 and N3 to face targets, may suggest ADHD-related abnormal recruitment of neural resources to process face stimuli. Behavioral and brain function measures of face processing may provide valuable additional tools for use in clinical assessment of ADHD in adulthood. ","597":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impairs emotion perception. Perception of negative emotions (sadness, disgust, fear, and anger) is reportedly affected more than positive (happiness and surprise) ones. It has been argued that this reflects a specialized neural network underpinning negative emotions that is vulnerable to brain injury. However, studies typically do not equate for differential difficulty between emotions. We aimed to examine whether emotion recognition deficits in people with TBI were specific to negative emotions, while equating task difficulty, and to determine whether perception deficits might be accounted for by other cognitive processes. Twenty-seven people with TBI and 28 matched control participants identified 6 basic emotions at 2 levels of intensity (a) the conventional 100% intensity and (b) \"equated intensity\"-that is, an intensity that yielded comparable accuracy rates across emotions in controls. (a) At 100% intensity, the TBI group was impaired in recognizing anger, fear, and disgust but not happiness, surprise, or sadness and performed worse on negative than positive emotions. (b) At equated intensity, the TBI group was poorer than controls overall but not differentially poorer in recognizing negative emotions. Although processing speed and nonverbal reasoning were associated with emotion accuracy, injury severity by itself was a unique predictor. When task difficulty is taken into account, individuals with TBI show impairment in recognizing all facial emotions. There was no evidence for a specific impairment for negative emotions or any particular emotion. Impairment was accounted for by injury severity rather than being a secondary effect of reduced neuropsychological functioning. ","598":"Previous findings suggest that, in anosognosic patients, their illusory motor experience is based on a \"normal\" motor intention and planning for the paralyzed limbs. However, these studies involved proximal muscles (shoulder) that can be mediated by the ipsilateral (intact) cortex more than distal muscles (fingers). In the present study, we asked whether, in anosognosic patients, the spared motor intention for the paralyzed limb can go as far as to influence kinematic parameters of distal movements. Six hemiplegic patients (1 with and 5 without anosognosia) were required to reach and grasp with both hands targets of the same or different size, attached to a plinth. Maximum grip aperture of the right (intact) hand was recorded using an infrared motion capture system. All patients were evaluated with a specific battery for anosognosia and different neurpsychological test. In the patient affected by anosognosia for hemiplegia, the grip aperture of the healthy hand was influenced by the intended (but not executed) movement of the plegic hand when the patient was trying to reach to grasp targets of different size, F(2, 14) = 11.87, p &lt; .001. Patients affected by hemiplegia (without anosognosia) didn't show any interference effect between the plegic and healthy hand even when they were asked to reach to grasp targets of different size. Our results confirm the hypothesis that a spared intention-programming system within the contralateral (damaged) cortex can go as far as to influence distal kinematic parameters of the healthy hand of patients affected by anosognosia for hemiplegia.

In Experiment 1, to investigate the N170 adaptation effect between faces and printed language, 18 bilingual participants (7 males) were recruited, and the N170 response elicited by faces and words was recorded using a 128-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net. To address whether this asymmetrical between-category N170 adaptation effect generalizes to any object of expertise, in Experiment 2, 19 participants (9 males) were recruited by training to become Greeble experts. The N170 component elicited by faces and Greebles was recorded before and after training. In Experiment 1, the authors found that only faces can affect the N170 response elicited by words but words cannot affect the N170 response elicited by face. In Experiment 2, both before and after training, Greeble adaptors did not affect the N170 response elicited by faces. It is important to note that after training, the faces decreased the N170 response elicited by the Greebles. These results suggest that not only is there some commonality of N170 response elicited by face and nonface objects of expertise but also the kinds of functions associated with the N170 neural selectivity to faces were more than that to nonface expert objects. ","602":"Numerous studies using dual-task paradigms (postural and cognitive) have shown that postural control requires cognitive resources. However, the influence of postural control on attention components has never been directly addressed. Using the attention network test (ANT), which assesses specifically each of the 3 components of attention-alertness, orientation, and executive control-within a single paradigm, we investigated the effect of postural balance demand on these 3 components. Forty-two participants completed the ANT in 3 postural conditions: (a) supine, a very stable position; (b) sitting on a chair, an intermediate position; and (c) standing with feet lined up heel to toe, a very instable position known as the Romberg position. Our results revealed that the difficulty of postural control does modulate alerting in such a way that it improves with the level of instability of the position. Regarding the orienting and executive control components of attention, performance was not different when participants were standing upright or seated, whereas in the supine position, performance dropped. The strong and specific interaction between postural control and the alerting system suggests that these mechanisms may share parts of the underlying neural circuits. We discuss the possible implication of the locus coeruleus, known to be involved in both postural balance and alerting. Also, our findings concerning orienting and executive control systems suggest that supine posture could have a specific effect on cognitive activities. These effects are discussed in terms of particularities resulting from the supine position. ","603":"Low-frequency electrical stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a therapeutic approach aiming to improve motor symptoms such as freezing of gate and postural instability in parkinsonian disorders. Because the PPN is a component of the reticular activating system, we tested whether PPN stimulation directly affects attention and consciousness. Eight patients with parkinsonian disorders and implanted with electrodes in the bilateral PPN underwent computerized assessment of attention. Performance in 3 standard reaction time (RT) tasks was assessed at 5 different stimulation frequencies in 5 consecutive sessions. Stimulation of the PPN at low (8 Hz) and therapeutic (20 Hz) frequencies led to a significant improvement of performance in a simple RT task. Patients' RTs were significantly faster at stimulation frequencies of 8 Hz and 20 Hz relative to no stimulation. Stimulation did not affect patients' performance in more complex attentional tasks. Low-frequent stimulation of PPN improves basal attentional processing in patients with parkinsonian disorders, leading to an improved tonic alertness. As successful performance in this task requires the intrinsic ability to build up and keep a certain level of attention, this might be interpreted as attentional augmentation related to stimulation features. Stimulation had no effect on more complex attentional processing. Our results suggest an influence of the PPN on certain aspects of attention, supporting attentional augmentation as one possible mechanism to improve motor action and gait in patients with parkinsonian disorders. ","604":"The objective of this study was to establish whether or not dyslexics are impaired at the recognition of faces and other complex nonword visual objects. This would be expected based on a meta-analysis revealing that children and adult dyslexics show functional abnormalities within the left fusiform gyrus, a brain region high up in the ventral visual stream, which is thought to support the recognition of words, faces, and other objects. 20 adult dyslexics (M = 29 years) and 20 matched typical readers (M = 29 years) participated in the study. One dyslexic-typical reader pair was excluded based on Adult Reading History Questionnaire scores and IS-FORM reading scores. Performance was measured on 3 high-level visual processing tasks: the Cambridge Face Memory Test, the Vanderbilt Holistic Face Processing Test, and the Vanderbilt Expertise Test. People with dyslexia are impaired in their recognition of faces and other visually complex objects. Their holistic processing of faces appears to be intact, suggesting that dyslexics may instead be specifically impaired at part-based processing of visual objects. The difficulty that people with dyslexia experience with reading might be the most salient manifestation of a more general high-level visual deficit. ","605":"Self-assessment deficits, often referred to as impaired insight or unawareness of illness, are well established in people with schizophrenia. There are multiple levels of awareness, including awareness of symptoms, functional deficits, cognitive impairments, and the ability to monitor cognitive and functional performance in an ongoing manner. The present study aimed to evaluate the comparative predictive value of each aspect of awareness on the levels of everyday functioning in people with schizophrenia. We examined multiple aspects of self-assessment of functioning in 214 people with schizophrenia. We also collected information on everyday functioning rated by high contact clinicians and examined the importance of self-assessment for the prediction of real-world functional outcomes. The relative impact of performance-based measures of cognition, functional capacity, and metacognitive performance on everyday functioning was also examined. Misestimation of ability emerged as the strongest predictor of real-world functioning and exceeded the influences of cognitive performance, functional capacity performance, and performance-based assessment of metacognitive monitoring. The relative contribution of the factors other than self-assessment varied according to which domain of everyday functioning was being examined, but, in all cases, accounted for less predictive variance. These results underscore the functional impact of misestimating one's current functioning and relative level of ability. These findings are consistent with the use of insight-focused treatments and compensatory strategies designed to increase self-awareness in multiple functional domains. ","606":"Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to keep in memory and realize future intentions. We aimed at investigating whether in Parkinson's disease (PD) PM deficits are related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Other aims were to investigate the cognitive abilities underlying PM performance, and the association between PM performance and measures of daily living functioning. The study included 15 PD patients with single domain MCI, 15 with multiple domain MCI, 17 PD patients without cognitive disorders (PDNC) and 25 healthy controls (HCs). All subjects were administered a PM procedure that included focal (PM cue is processed in the ongoing task) and nonfocal (PM cue is not processed in the ongoing task) conditions. PD patients were administered an extensive neuropsychological battery and scales to assess daily living abilities. PD patients with MCI (both single and multiple domains) showed lower accuracy on all PM conditions than both HC and PDNC patients. This was predicted by their scores on shifting indices. Conversely, PM accuracy of PDNC patients was comparable to HCs. Regression analyses revealed that PD patients' PM performance significantly predicted scores on daily living scales Conclusions: Results suggest that PM efficiency is not tout-court reduced in PD patients, but it specifically depends on the presence of MCI. Moreover, decreased executive functioning, but not episodic memory failure, accounts for a significant proportion of variance in PM performance. Finally, PM accuracy indices were found to be associated with measures of global daily living functioning and management of medication. ","607":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) research typically focuses on memory. However, executive functioning (EF) deficits are also common among AD patients; these deficits are associated with decreased functioning in activities of daily living, an important criterion in diagnosing AD. A classic test of EF ability, the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST), has demonstrated sensitivity to differentiating individuals with AD from healthy controls, discriminating AD groups based on disease severity, and distinguishing AD from other types of dementia. Such sensitivity to AD raises the possibility that the WCST is also sensitive to very early, preclinical differences between those who have heightened risk for AD and those with lower risks. The current study, therefore, examined WCST performance in healthy, cognitively intact older adults with a first-degree (i.e., sibling or parent) family history (FH) of AD (n = 18) and those with no such FH of AD (n = 24). Results revealed significant group differences for Categories Achieved, Percent Conceptual Level Responses, Total Errors, Perseverative Errors, and Non-Perseverative Errors, with the FH+ group consistently exhibiting poorer performance. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that after accounting for age, sex, and education, FH significantly predicted all 5 of these variables. These results speak to the potential role of EF in bolstering the current understanding of early cognitive markers of future decline. Furthering what is known about the relationship between AD and nonmemory specific domains of cognition such as executive functioning may allow for better prediction of cognitive decline and potential progression to AD. ","608":"A number of cognitive underpinnings of auditory hallucinations have been established in schizophrenia patients, but few have, as yet, been uncovered for visual hallucinations. In previous research, we unexpectedly observed that auditory hallucinations were associated with poor recognition of color, but not black-and-white (b\/w), pictures. In this study, we attempted to replicate and explain this finding. Potential associations with visual hallucinations were explored. B\/w and color pictures were presented to 50 schizophrenia patients and 45 healthy individuals under 2 conditions of visual context presentation corresponding to 2 levels of visual encoding complexity. Then, participants had to recognize the target pictures among distractors. Auditory-verbal hallucinations were inversely associated with the recognition of the color pictures presented under the most effortful encoding condition. This association was fully mediated by working-memory span. Visual hallucinations were associated with improved recognition of the color pictures presented under the less effortful condition. Patients suffering from visual hallucinations were not impaired, relative to the healthy participants, in the recognition of these pictures. Decreased working-memory span in patients with auditory-verbal hallucinations might impede the effortful encoding of stimuli. Visual hallucinations might be associated with facilitation in the visual encoding of natural scenes, or with enhanced color perception abilities. ","609":"Prospective monitoring of posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) is recommended following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, few studies have examined the typical order in which items recover on PTA scales. Different methods have been used to define recovery, and the order reported is not consistent across the literature. The purpose of this study was to improve understanding of the progression of PTA by reporting the duration to recovery of items and categories on the Westmead Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale (WPTAS) according to different criteria. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 66 patients with TBI who were administered the WPTAS during hospital admission. The duration to recovery of items and categories was determined according to 3 criteria: first correct, correct 3 times in a row, and consistently correct. On the basis of the sample mean, date of birth (DOB), year, age, place, month, day, name, and memory for the 3 pictures recovered in this order according to all 3 criteria. However, the significance of differences between items and the order of recovery of categories depended on the criterion adopted. Although DOB recovered first in 74% of cases and the 3 pictures last in 63% of cases, there was a high degree of individual variability in the precise sequence of recovery. The traditional view of PTA recovering in the order of person, place, time, and memory does not adequately describe the profile of recovery on the WPTAS. Considering the recovery of individual items is necessary to understand and account for individuals differences in the order of recovery. ","610":"Co-occurring cannabis and tobacco use has become increasingly prevalent among young adults, but it is not clear how tobacco use may alter the neurocognitive profile typically observed among cannabis users. Although there is substantial evidence citing cannabis and tobacco's individual effect on episodic memory and related brain structures, few studies have examined the effect of combined cannabis and tobacco use on memory. This investigation examined relationships between amount of past year cannabis and tobacco use on 4 different indices of episodic memory among a sample of young adults who identified cannabis as their drug of choice. Results indicated that more cannabis use was linked with poorer initial acquisition, total learning, and delayed recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, but only among cannabis users who sporadically smoked cigarettes in the past year. Conversely, the amount of past year cannabis use was not associated with episodic memory performance among individuals who more consistently smoked cigarettes in the past year. These differences could not be explained by several relevant potential confounds. These findings provide important insight into a potential mechanism (i.e., attenuation of cognitive decrements) that might reinforce use of both substances and hamper cessation attempts among cannabis users who also smoke cigarettes. Ongoing and future research will help to better understand how co-use of cannabis and tobacco affects memory during acute intoxication and abstinence and the stability of these associations over time.

BCoS was designed for stroke-specific problems across 5 cognitive domains: (a) controlled and spatial attention, (b) language, (c) memory, (d) number processing, and (e) praxis. On the basis of specific inclusion criteria, this cross-section observational study analyzed cognitive profiles of 657 subacute stroke patients, 331 of them reassessed at 9 months. Impairments on 32 measures were evaluated by comparison with 100 matched healthy controls. Measures of affect, apathy, and activities of daily living were also taken. Between-subjects group comparisons of mean performance scores and impairment rates and within-subject examination of impairment rates over time were conducted. Logistic regressions and general linear modeling were used for multivariate analysis of domain-level effects on outcomes. Individuals with repeated stroke experienced significantly less cognitive recovery at 9 months than those with a first stroke despite similar initial level of cognitive performance. Individuals with left hemisphere lesions performed more poorly than those with right hemisphere lesions, but both groups showed similar extent of recovery at 9 months. BCoS also revealed lesion-side-specific deficits and common areas of persistent problems. Functional outcome at 9 months correlated with domain-level deficits in controlled attention, spatial attention, and praxis over and above initial dependency and concurrent levels of affect and apathy. The study demonstrates how BCoS can identify differential cognitive profiles across patient groups. This can potentially help predict outcomes and inform rehabilitation.

By this method, we formed the consistent (low ICV; n = 20) and inconsistent (high ICV; n = 20) group: the age, speed, and accuracy performance of the 2 groups were matched. The prestimulus anticipatory PFC activity, as reflected by the prefrontal negativity (pN) wave, and the poststimulus P3 component were larger in the consistent than in the inconsistent group. In contrast, no differences were observed between groups in the brain activities associated to motor preparation and early sensory processing.

","614":"Given reports of high pain thresholds and reduced auditory response in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), this study investigated whether affected participants report atypical experiences and behaviors on a well-established sensory processing measure. Fourteen participants with AgCC (ages 11-59) completed the Adolescent\/Adult Sensory Profile (Brown &amp; Dunn, 2001). Sensory profile scales were classified as \"Atypical\" if they were more than 1 standard deviation from the mean. Fifty-seven percent of participants with AgCC reported reduced sensory registration as compared to an expected 16% of the normative sample. Similarly, 50% of the AgCC participants reported atypically increased auditory processing difficulties. Using a well-established sensory processing questionnaire, participants with AgCC reported measurable differences in multiple aspects of sensory processing. The most notable difference was in the quadrant of low sensory registration, suggesting that individuals with AgCC may require sensory information to be presented more slowly or at a higher intensity for adequate processing. The sensory modality that was most affected was the auditory system, which is consistent with increased rates of language disorders and autism spectrum disorders in this population. Understanding sensory processing in individuals with AgCC can both elucidate the role of interhemispheric transfer in the development of intact sensory processing as well as contribute to our knowledge of the role of the corpus callosum in a range of disorders in which sensory processes are impacted.

Repeated-measures logistic regression was used to determine if the rates of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors varied by group and sex. Overall rates of problem behaviors were significantly greater for both moderate\/severe TBI (OR = 4.00) and mild TBI (OR = 3.60) groups compared with orthopedic controls. Females were significantly more likely than males to report a history of internalizing problems (OR = 2.22), whereas males were more likely than females to report externalizing problems (OR = 2.10). The sex difference in internalizing\/externalizing problems was found consistently across TBI groups and controls. Childhood TBI is associated with psychosocial problems in adulthood, regardless of injury severity. How deficits are expressed differs between the sexes, with important implications for interventions strategies. ","616":"Prior research has shown that individuals with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) show a different pattern of error types on everyday tasks compared with individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study evaluated whether these groups would respond differently to cues designed to remind participants of task goals and improve performance of everyday tasks (i.e., goal cues). Participants with PDD (n = 20) and AD (n = 20), and a comparison group of individuals with Parkinson's disease and no dementia (n = 20), were administered performance-based tasks of everyday functioning that allowed for the quantification of errors before and after the presentation of goal cues. AD participants showed a significantly greater response to the goal cues as compared with individuals with PDD. The goal cues facilitated the completion of task goals but did not promote error correction (i.e., the undoing of errors that had been made earlier during the task). Not all dementia patients respond similarly to cues designed to improve everyday functioning. Understanding patients' specific form of everyday action impairment is crucial for developing individualized interventions that target specific functional deficits. ","617":"Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions are common in old age and are associated with cognitive decline. However, considerable heterogeneity remains in residual decline (i.e., person-specific trajectories of cognitive decline adjusted for these common neuropathologic conditions). The present study aimed to characterize profiles of residual decline in late life cognition. Up to 19 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 876 autopsied participants from 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Uniform neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. Random effects mixture models characterized latent profiles of residual decline in global cognition. We identified 4 latent groups, and each group demonstrated distinct residual decline profiles. On average, 44% of the participants had little or no decline, 35% showed moderate decline, 13% showed severe decline and the rest (8%) had substantial within-subject fluctuation of longitudinal cognitive measures. These latent groups differed in psychological, experiential and neurobiologic factors that have been previously shown to be associated with cognitive decline. Specifically, compared with nondecliners, decliners had more depressive symptoms, were more socially isolated; were less engaged in cognitive or physical activities; and had lower density of noradrenergic neurons in locus ceruleus. After controlling for common dementia related pathologies, considerable residual variability remains in cognitive aging trajectories and this variability is not random but rather is related to markers of cognitive and neural reserve. The mixture modeling approach provides a powerful tool to identify latent groups with distinct cognitive trajectories.

In the current project, we focused on the utility of using alternative statistics to estimate these relations. Fifty-four children with spina bifida meningomyelocele performed attention tasks and received MRI of the brain. Using a bootstrap sampling process, the Pearson product-moment correlation was compared with 4 robust correlations: the percentage bend correlation, the Winsorized correlation, the skipped correlation using the Donoho-Gasko median, and the skipped correlation using the minimum volume ellipsoid estimator. All methods yielded similar estimates of the relations between measures of brain volume and attention performance. The similarity of estimates across correlation methods suggested that the weak structure-function relations previously found in many studies are not readily attributable to the presence of outlying observations and other factors that violate the assumptions behind the Pearson correlation. Given the difficulty of assembling large samples for brain-behavior studies, estimating correlations using multiple, robust methods may enhance the statistical conclusion validity of studies yielding small, but often clinically significant, correlations.

Thirteen HD participants and 13 controls completed 2 dual task sets that varied in difficulty and complexity: Set 1 paired simple choice reaction time (RT) with digit forward, and Set 2 paired complex choice RT with digit backward. We found that HD participants were overall slower; however, although they maintained similar levels of accuracy in the simple choice RT tasks with controls, their accuracy decreased in the complex choice RT tasks. In addition, we found that HD participants were more susceptible to speed-accuracy trade-offs. Despite that, they did not show greater dual task costs than controls. Overall, our findings do not support the Multiple Resources Theory, but they do provide some support for the Unitary Resource Theory and the attentional impairment hypothesis.

Participants were 529 older people without cognitive impairment at study onset. They completed annual evaluations that included assessment of negative social interactions (e.g., unsympathetic behavior, rejection), cognitive testing, and clinical classification of mild cognitive impairment. During a mean of 4.8 years of follow-up (SD = 2.5), 198 individuals (37.4%) developed mild cognitive impairment. In a proportional hazards model, higher baseline frequency of negative social interactions (M = 1.51, SD = 0.43, skewness = 1.60) was associated with higher risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio = 1.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.07). Results were similar after adjustment for depressive symptoms, social network size, social activity, and loneliness. This association was mainly due to neglect and rejection. There was no change in negative social interaction rate over time (estimate = -0.003, SE = 0.004, p = .508). Higher baseline level of negative social interaction was associated with lower initial level of global cognition (estimate = -0.096, SE = 0.034, p = .005) but not with cognitive decline (estimate = -0.018, SE = 0.011, p = .098). A higher mean level of negative interactions across the study period was robustly related to faster cognitive decline (estimate = -0.036, SE = 0.012, p = .002). Frequent negative social interactions may be a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment and cognitive decline in old age. ","622":"Concerns persist that deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) increases impulsivity or induces excessive reward seeking. We report here the performance of PD patients with implanted subthalamic nucleus electrodes, with stimulation on and off, on 3 laboratory tasks of risk taking and decision making. They are compared with PD patients maintained on medication and healthy participants. In the Game of Dice Task, a test of \"risky\" decision making, PD patients with or without DBS made highest risk bets more often and ended up with less money than did healthy participants. There was a trend for DBS stimulation to ameliorate this effect. Deal or No-Deal is an \"ambiguous\" decision-making task that assessed preference for risk (holding on to one's briefcase) over a \"sure thing\" (accepting the banker's offer). Here, DBS patients were more conservative with stimulation on than with it off. They accepted smaller offers from the banker and won less money in the DBS-on condition. Overall, the 2 PD groups won less money than did healthy participants. The Framing Paradigm assessed willingness to gamble on a fixed (unambiguous) prize depending on whether the reward was \"framed\" as a loss or a gain. Nonsurgical PD patients tended to be more risk-averse than were healthy participants, whereas DBS patients were more willing to gamble for gains as well as losses both on and off stimulation. On risky decision-making tasks, DBS patients took more risks than did healthy participants, but stimulation may temper this tendency. In contrast, in an ambiguous-risk situation, DBS patients were more risk-averse (conservative) than were healthy participants, and this tendency was greatest with stimulation. ","623":"Many neuropsychiatric disorders involve abnormal attentional processing. Systematic investigations of how attention may affect tic frequency in Tourette syndrome are lacking. Patients performed rhythmic finger movements, approximately once every 2 s. Each movement triggered a unique visual color stimulus. Patients were asked to monitor and remember their finger actions, the external colors caused by their actions, or their tics. Sixteen adult Tourette syndrome patients performed each task twice: once while inhibiting tics, and once without inhibiting tics. During the \"freely tic\" condition, patients had significantly fewer tics when attending to finger movements, or to the ensuing colors, compared with when attending to their tics. Attention to fingers produced the fewest tics overall. During tic suppression, tic frequency was reduced to an equal level in all conditions. Focusing attention away from tics significantly reduces tic frequency. This attentional process may operate by regulating motor noise.

Thirty one individuals with documented neuroradiological abnormalities due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) referred for clinical evaluations. Cerebral integrity was measured with both functional (i.e., neuropsychological tests) and structural indices (i.e., MRI). Participants were administered comprehensive neuropsychological tests associated with general bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe functioning, a self-report measure of empathy (i.e., Penner's Prosocial Personality Battery), and an objective measure of empathy (i.e., Prisoner's Dilemma). Twenty participants also completed structural MRI analysis of the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular cortices measured in terms of volume. Pearson correlations indicated that empathy was related to increased neuropsychological indices of RPL and frontal lobe (primarily left frontal) functioning. The only MRI indices associated with empathy were the bilateral insula. Neither functional nor structural cerebral indices were significantly related to objective measures of empathy. Contrary to hypotheses, empathy appears to be associated with increased RPL functioning.

In a second investigation, healthy older adults (n = 30) were compared with younger adults (n = 30) on the IST and executive-function tasks. Results of the first investigation demonstrated that, in the IST, patients gathered significantly less information, made riskier and less accurate decisions, and showed less reward sensitivity relative to controls. We found a significant correlation between performance on the IST and performance on tests of verbal fluency, working memory, and recognition in patients but not in controls. Results of the second investigation indicated a largely similar performance pattern between healthy older adults and younger adults. There were no significant correlations for both groups between the IST and executive-function tasks. There are no relevant changes with healthy aging in predecisional processing. In contrast, mild DAT significantly affects predecisional information sampling. Thus, the problems shown in patients with mild DAT in decision making might be related to the patients' difficulties in predecisional processing. Decision-making performance in mild DAT might be improved by helping the patients at a predecisional stage to gather sufficient information and evaluate options more accurately. ","628":"It was hypothesized that neuropsychological impairments in children with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) are associated with brain areas of increased T2-weighted signal intensity on MRI. Systematic and extensive examination of this hypothesis remains however scarce, particularly regarding executive dysfunction whereas hyperintensities are located preferentially in frontal-sub-cortical networks. In this study, we compared the executive functioning profile with characteristics of brain hyperintensities in children with NF1. A sample of 36 school-age children with NF1 (7-12 years) underwent a detailed examination of executive function, including performance-based tests and child's behavior rating in daily life. Executive function measures were compared with the characteristics of the T2-weighted hyperintensities on parallel MRI scans. The presence, number, and size of hyperintensities in the whole brain were considered as well as their main cerebral locations. Executive dysfunction including traditional cognitive and ecological measures in children with NF1 is not significantly influenced by T2-weighted hyperintensities, in terms of presence or not, number, size, and location, whether in the whole brain or according to involved specific brain areas. T2-weighted hyperintensities, as they are currently measured, cannot be used as a strong indicator of executive dysfunction in children with NF1. Based on the available NF1 cognitive impairment pathogenesis models, a critical discussion on anatomical-functional relationships between hyperintensities and neuropsychological profile is proposed, especially the executive dysfunction. ","629":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting in a wide variety of symptoms. The current study examined the influence of apathy, depression and motor symptoms on quality of life (QoL) in PD patients. Information was drawn from an 18-month period. Participants (N = 397) were assessed for apathy (Apathy Scale; Starkstein et al., 1992), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II; Beck, Steer, Ball &amp; Ranieri, 1996), motor severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III; UPDRS; Fahn, Elton &amp; Committee, 1987), and QoL (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39; Jenkinson, Fitzpatrick, Peto, Greenhall, &amp; Hyman,1997) at 3 time points: an initial clinical evaluation (baseline), a 6-month follow-up, and an 18-month follow-up. Latent growth-curve models were used to determine the influence of apathy, depression, and motor symptoms on QoL trajectories. Greater difficulties with QoL at baseline showed the strongest relationship to more severe depression symptoms, followed by more severe motor symptoms, younger age, and less education (all p values &lt; .001). Worsening of QoL over the 18-month period was only predicted by a worsening of depression (p = .003). The relationship between QoL and depression symptoms remained significant in a subsample of nondepressed PD patients. Overall, findings from the current study suggest that self-reported QoL among PD patients is primarily related to depression. Future efforts to improving clinical care of PD patients may benefit by focusing on improving psychosocial adjustment or treatments targeting depression. ","630":null,"631":"This study aimed to provide more insight into the functional significance of electroencephalographic (EEG) deviances in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by evaluating quantitative EEG during performance on a task with a low activation level and a task tapping top-down executive control. Behavioral performance and EEG activity were compared between 24 adults with ADHD and 20 typically developing adults during a simple slow-paced 2-choice reaction time (2-CRT) task and a moderately paced flanker task. During the slow 2-CRT task, adults with ADHD responded slower, more variably, and tended to make more errors of commission. Although being slower, adults with ADHD showed equally large congruency effects during flanker task performance, indicating intact interference inhibition. In the slow 2-CRT task, (midline) theta and beta power were higher in the ADHD group than in the control group, whereas no significant EEG group differences were observed in the flanker task. A moderate positive correlation between theta power and errors of commission was found in the 2-CRT task for adults with ADHD. Adults with ADHD performed worse on a task inducing a low activation level but showed intact interference inhibition. The EEG findings are in accord with this, showing an abnormal EEG pattern in ADHD only when a low activation level was induced, not when top-down executive control load was high. Time-on-task effects could not explain the group deviances. The findings indicate that EEG deviances in ADHD are task-dependent and may be related to a suboptimal energetic state, rather than impaired top-down executive control. ","632":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) both have psychiatric comorbidities and distinctive profiles of executive dysfunction. Although there is evidence that executive function (EF) plays a role in the expression of specific behaviors and psychiatric symptoms, it is not known whether specific EF deficits in ASD and ADHD may be pathways to comorbidities in the disorders. This study examines whether parent reported problems with flexibility in ASD and inhibition in ADHD mediate the disorders' associations with anxiety\/depression and oppositional\/aggressive behavior, respectively. Parent report data from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were obtained for 125 children (70 ASD, 55 ADHD Hyperactive\/Impulsive or Combined type) as part of a neuropsychological assessment. Diagnostic status, BRIEF Shift (shifting\/flexibility) and Inhibit (behavioral inhibition) scale scores, and CBCL Anxious\/Depressed (anxiety\/depression) and Aggressive Behavior (oppositionality\/aggression) scale scores were analyzed with a path analysis to investigate the relation of flexibility and inhibition to comorbid symptoms in children with ASD and ADHD. In a path model with good fit ASD predicted greater inflexibility which predicted greater anxiety\/depression, while ADHD predicted greater disinhibition that predicted greater aggression, consistent with our mediational hypotheses. Unexpectedly, the greater inflexibility associated with ASD also predicted greater aggression. Findings support the importance of everyday EF problems in ASD and ADHD as predictors of comorbid psychopathology and as crucial intervention targets for potential prevention and mitigation of comorbid symptoms.

Barrett (Neuropsychology, Advanced Online Publication, Sep 1, 2014, np). The funding source information was missing from the author note, and A. M. Barrett's institutional affiliation was incorrect. The funding source information and Barrett's correct institutional affiliation are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-35685-001.) The sparse existing research on ipsilesional neglect supports an association of this disorder with damage to the right frontal and subcortical brain networks. It is believed that dysfunction in these networks may result in primarily \"aiming\" motor-intentional spatial errors. The purpose of this study was to confirm whether frontal-subcortical circuits are indeed commonly affected in ipsilesional neglect and to determine the relative presence of \"aiming\" motor-intentional versus \"where\" perceptual-attentional spatial errors in these individuals. We identified 12 participants with ipsilesional neglect based on a computerized line bisection task and used the line bisection data to quantify participants' perceptual-attentional and motor-intentional errors. We were able to discriminate between these 2 biases using the algebraic solutions for 2 separate equations, one for \"aiming\" and one for \"where\" biases. Lesion mapping was conducted for all participants using MRIcron software; lesion checklist and overlap analysis were created from these images. A greater percentage of participants with ipsilesional neglect had frontal\/subcortical damage (83%) compared with the expected percentage (27%) observed in published patient samples with contralesional neglect. We observed the greatest area of lesion overlap in frontal lobe white matter pathways. Nevertheless, participants with ipsilesional neglect made primarily \"where\" rather than \"aiming\" spatial errors. Our data confirm previous research suggesting that ipsilesional neglect may result from lesions to the right frontal-subcortical networks. Furthermore, in our group, ipsilesional neglect was also strongly associated with primarily \"where\" perceptual-attentional bias, and less so with \"aiming\" motor-intentional spatial bias. ","634":"Patients with left-sided neglect frequently show omissions and repetitive behavior on cancellation tests. Using a touch-screen-based cancellation task, we tested how visual feedback and distracters influence the number of omissions and perseverations. Eighteen patients with left-sided visual neglect and 18 healthy controls performed four different cancellation tasks on an iPad touch screen: no feedback (the display did not change during the task), visual feedback (touched targets changed their color from black to green), visual feedback with distracters (20 distracters were evenly embedded in the display; detected targets changed their color from black to green), vanishing targets (touched targets disappeared from the screen). Except for the condition with vanishing targets, neglect patients had significantly more omissions and perseverations than healthy controls in the remaining three subtests. Both conditions providing feedback by changing the target color showed the highest number of omissions. Erasure of targets nearly diminished omissions completely. The highest rate of perseverations was observed in the no-feedback condition. The implementation of distracters led to a moderate number of perseverations. Visual feedback without distracters and vanishing targets abolished perseverations nearly completely. Visual feedback and the presence of distracters aggravated hemispatial neglect. This finding is compatible with impaired disengagement from the ipsilesional side as an important factor of visual neglect. Improvement of cancellation behavior with vanishing targets could have therapeutic implications. ","635":"Xenomelia, that is, the nonacceptance of one's own limb, is an intriguing but little understood condition. We sought to further test the most prominent neuroscientific hypothesis that suggests xenomelia results from a breakdown in multisensory integration for the affected body part. A \"rubber foot illusion\" paradigm was developed and tested in healthy participants and in individuals with a desire for left foot amputation (xenomelia). Behavioral and physiological responses quantified illusory ownership of a fake foot after synchronous and asynchronous stroking of a visible rubber foot and the subject's own hidden foot. Healthy participants (n = 15) showed a rubber foot illusion similar to the well-known rubber hand illusion. Individuals with xenomelia (n = 9) experienced the rubber foot illusion in a way comparable to healthy controls. The only difference in the individuals with xenomelia was an increase in the vividness of the illusion for the undesired limb. This vividness of the illusion correlated positively with the strength of amputation desire. These findings might reflect the malleable sense of the body in xenomelia and suggest a weakened representation of the affected body part. These findings may support the use of multisensory stimulation in therapeutic settings. ","636":"Deficit in facial affect recognition is a well-documented impairment in schizophrenia, closely connected to social outcome. This deficit could be related to psychopathology, but also to a broader dysfunction in processing facial information. In addition, patients with schizophrenia inadequately use configural information-a type of processing that relies on spatial relationships between facial features. To date, no study has specifically examined the link between symptoms and misuse of configural information in the deficit in facial affect recognition. Unmedicated schizophrenia patients (n = 30) and matched healthy controls (n = 30) performed a facial affect recognition task and a face inversion task, which tests aptitude to rely on configural information. In patients, regressions were carried out between facial affect recognition, symptom dimensions and inversion effect. Patients, compared with controls, showed a deficit in facial affect recognition and a lower inversion effect. Negative symptoms and lower inversion effect could account for 41.2% of the variance in facial affect recognition. This study confirms the presence of a deficit in facial affect recognition, and also of dysfunctional manipulation in configural information in antipsychotic-free patients. Negative symptoms and poor processing of configural information explained a substantial part of the deficient recognition of facial affect. We speculate that this deficit may be caused by several factors, among which independently stand psychopathology and failure in correctly manipulating configural information. ","637":"Past studies have shown that measures of attentional control and semantic memory are sensitive markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of established biomarkers of AD (cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta42, positron emission tomography Pittsburgh compound-B, and apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype) on concurrent cognitive performance in cognitively normal individuals have been mixed. The present study examined the utility of combining attentional control with semantic retrieval as a sensitive correlate of AD biomarkers and used mediation analyses to examine possible mechanisms by which the biomarkers influence cognition. Three hundred sixty-three participants completed a category verification task (CVT), and 113 of them concurrently underwent biomarker assessments. On each trial, participants viewed a category (e.g., \"unit of time\") and verified whether a subsequent target item was an exemplar of the category (\"hour\") or not (\"clock\"). Importantly, the nonmembers of the category were associatively related to the category (e.g., \"clock\" is not \"a unit of time,\" but is highly related), and demanded attentional control to reject. Accuracy to the foil items was the strongest discriminator between healthy aging and very mild symptomatic AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers had independent yet synergistic influence on CVT performance in cognitively healthy older adults. Furthermore, the influence of the biomarkers and APOE genotype was mediated primarily through increased levels of PIB. The combined influence of attentional control with semantic retrieval is a marker of symptomatic AD and a sensitive correlate of established biomarkers for AD risk in cognitively healthy participants. The biomarkers influenced cognition primarily through increased levels of amyloid in the brain. ","638":"In light of growing debate over whether and how early life educational experiences alter late-life cognitive trajectories, this study sought to more thoroughly investigate the relationship between educational attainment and rates of late-life cognitive decline in a racially, ethnically, and educationally diverse population. Older adults (N = 3,435) in the community-based Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project were administered neuropsychological tests of memory, language, visuospatial function, and processing speed at approximate 24-month intervals for up to 18 years. Second-order latent growth curves estimated direct and indirect (through income) effects of educational attainment on rates of global cognitive decline separately in individuals with low (0-8 years) and high (9-20 years) educational attainment. More years of education were associated with higher cognitive level and slower cognitive decline in individuals with low or high educational attainment. The association between having more than 9 years of education and exhibiting slower cognitive decline was fully mediated by income. Although having additional years of education up to 8 years was also associated with higher income, this did not explain associations between education and cognitive change in the low-education group. Early education (i.e., up to 8 years) may promote aspects of development during a sensitive period of childhood that protect against late-life cognitive decline independent of income. In contrast, later education (i.e., 9 years and beyond) is associated with higher income, which may influence late-life cognitive health through multiple, nonmutually exclusive pathways. ","639":"Recent models on emotional processing consider a major role for the pulvinar in the coordination of emotion processing; however, these models do not specify the type of cognitive mechanisms that the pulvinar may be subserving during emotional processing. In this opinion paper, we focus on the role of the different pulvinar subdivisions in emotion and attention. First, we review a number of neuropsychology studies and recent models that indicate that the medial nucleus of the pulvinar is critical for intact emotional processing. Then, we suggest that the role of the medial pulvinar in emotional processing is binding emotionally relevant features during working memory updating. We carefully examined reports that describe different cognitive impairments following lesions to different pulvinar subdivisions. By linking these detailed neuropsychology reports to recent neuroimaging findings, we show that lesions to specific parts of the pulvinar can dramatically affect attentional processes while leaving emotion processing spared. We suggest a comprehensive model that specifies the functional role of the different pulvinar subdivisions in emotion-attention interplay. We propose that the impairments in emotional processing following lesions to the medial pulvinar may be related to the role of this nucleus in emotionally relevant working memory updating. The aim of this model is to foster future research examining specific functions along the different anatomical pulvinar subdivisions. ","640":"The Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) was designed to measure performance accuracy and speed on specific neurobehavioral domains using tests that were previously validated with functional neuroimaging. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the neuropsychological theory used to construct the CNB by confirming the factor structure of the tests composing it. In a large community sample (N = 9,138; age range 8-21), we performed a correlated-traits confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) on the 12 CNB measures of Efficiency (which combine Accuracy and Speed). We then performed EFAs of the Accuracy and Speed measures separately. Finally, we performed a confirmatory bifactor analysis of the Efficiency scores. All analyses were performed with Mplus using maximum likelihood estimation. RESULTS strongly support the a priori theory used to construct the CNB, showing that tests designed to measure executive, episodic memory, complex cognition, and social cognition aggregate their loadings within these domains. When Accuracy and Speed were analyzed separately, Accuracy produced 3 reliable factors: executive and complex cognition, episodic memory, and social cognition, while speed produced 2 factors: tests that require fast responses and those where each item requires deliberation. The statistical \"Fit\" of almost all models described above was acceptable (usually excellent). Based on the analysis from these large-scale data, the CNB offers an effective means for measuring the integrity of intended neurocognitive domains in about 1 hour of testing and is thus suitable for large-scale clinical and genomic studies.

White, Alan C. Evans, Vladimir Fonov, D. Louis Collins and Deborah P. Waber (Neuropsychology, Advanced Online Publication, Jul 7, 2014, np). In the original version of the article, Matthew T. White's name was missing his middle initial. All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-27816-001.) The frequent lack of correspondence between performance and observational measures of executive functioning, including working memory, has raised questions about the validity of the observational measures. This study was conducted to investigate sources of this discrepancy through correlation of volumetric and cortical thickness (CT) neuroimaging values with performance and questionnaire measures of working memory (WM). Using longitudinal data from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (Volumes, N= 347, 54.3% female; CT, N= 350, 54.6% female; age range: 6 to 16.9 years), scores on the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) WM, Emotional Control (EC) and Inhibition (INH) scales; Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children-III Digit Span; and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery Spatial Working Memory (CANTAB SWM) were correlated with each other and with morphometric measurements using mixed effects linear regression models. BRIEF WM was correlated with CANTAB SWM (p &lt; .001). With whole brain correction, BRIEF WM and EC were both correlated with CT of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), EC on the right side only. Performance measures of WM were unrelated to lobar volumes or CT, but were associated with volumes of hippocampus and amygdala. The known role of PHG in contextual learning suggests that the BRIEF WM assesses contextualized learning\/memory, potentially explaining its loose correspondence to the decontextualized performance measures. Observational measures can be useful and valid functional metrics, complementing performance measures. Labels used to characterize scales should be interpreted with caution, however.

","643":"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often characterized as having social engagement and language deficiencies, but a sparing of visuospatial processing and short-term memory (STM), with some evidence of supranormal levels of performance in these domains. The present study expanded on this evidence by investigating the observational learning of visuospatial concepts from patterns of covariation across multiple exemplars. Child and adult participants with ASD, and age-matched control participants, viewed multishape arrays composed from a random combination of pairs of shapes that were each positioned in a fixed spatial arrangement. After this passive exposure phase, a posttest revealed that all participant groups could discriminate pairs of shapes with high covariation from randomly paired shapes with low covariation. Moreover, learning these shape-pairs with high covariation was superior in adults with ASD than in age-matched controls, whereas performance in children with ASD was no different than controls. These results extend previous observations of visuospatial enhancement in ASD into the domain of learning, and suggest that enhanced visual statistical learning may have arisen from a sustained bias to attend to local details in complex arrays of visual features. ","644":"Routine naturalistic actions (NAs) are familiar activities that require the production of several actions in a particular order to achieve a specific goal, such as preparing a meal or paying bills. Given that amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has been shown to be a risk factor for dementia, a better understanding of the cognitive processes that mediate NA performance is needed in order to facilitate efforts to promote functional autonomy in this population. Performance of 2 highly familiar NAs, and their relationship to measures of episodic memory, semantic knowledge, and executive function was systematically investigated in a sample of healthy older adults (n = 24) and individuals with aMCI (n = 24). In general, measures of executive function were related to commission errors, while episodic memory was associated with the omission of supporting actions. However, both errors of omission and commission appeared to draw on a diverse array of cognitive processes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that the cognitive correlates of NA errors may not be as process pure as previously hypothesized in neuropsychological models. A more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive underpinnings of NAs in aMCI could lead to more effective intervention programs to promote functional autonomy and delay dementia onset. Furthermore, NAs may be administered in neurocognitive assessments to identify early changes in everyday functioning and facilitate differential diagnosis between healthy aging and aMCI. ","645":"There is ample evidence for cognitive deficits in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The present study investigated cerebral blood flow responses during arithmetic processing in FMS patients and its relationship with performance. The influence of clinical factors on performance and blood flow responses were also analyzed. Forty-five FMS patients and 32 matched healthy controls completed a mental arithmetic task while cerebral blood flow velocities in the middle (MCA) and anterior (ACA) cerebral arteries were measured bilaterally using functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD). Patients' cognitive processing speeds were slower versus healthy controls. In contrast to patients, healthy controls showed a pronounced early blood flow response (during seconds 4-6 after the warning signal) in all assessed arteries. MCA blood flow modulation during this period was correlated with task performance. This early blood flow response component was markedly less pronounced in FMS patients in both MCAs. Furthermore, patients displayed an aberrant pattern of lateralization, with right hemispheric dominance especially observed in the ACA. Severity of clinical pain in FMS patients was correlated with cognitive performance and cerebral blood flow responses. Cognitive impairment in FMS is associated with alterations in cerebral blood flow responses during cognitive processing. These results suggest a potential physiological pathway through which psychosocial and clinical factors may affect cognition.

Participants were to make numerical matches of digits only, dots only, and digits and dots mixed conditions to determine whether reaction time (RT), percentage error, and efficiency scores that combine latency and accuracy for match trials were better on within- versus across-hemisphere trials. Sixty-six younger and 42 older participants were screened with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale. They performed the three experimental conditions and were assessed with Digit Span Forward and Backward subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. Results for younger adults demonstrated a within-hemisphere advantage for the Digits and Mixed conditions and an across-hemisphere advantage for the Dots condition, consistent with previous literature. Older participants showed a stronger within-hemisphere advantage for the Digits condition compared with younger participants and no advantage for within- or across-hemisphere processing for the Mixed condition when RT was considered, but they performed similarly to younger adults when efficiency scores were used and showed a relative across-hemisphere advantage for the Dots condition. Although RT suggests age-related differences in how information is distributed across the hemispheres of the brain, more comprehensive efficiency scores indicate that younger and older adults appear to use similar strategies in the coordination of interhemispheric transfer of information. MMSE scores regardless of age were related to type of task but not to across- versus within-hemisphere performance.","649":"Psychopathy is a personality disorder with symptoms that include lack of empathy or remorse, antisocial behavior, and excessive self-focus. Previous neuroimaging studies have linked psychopathy to dysfunction in the default mode network (DMN), a brain network that deactivates during externally focused tasks and is more engaged during self-referential processing. Specifically, the DMN has been found to remain relatively active in individuals with psychopathic tendencies during externally focused tasks, suggesting a failure to properly deactivate. However, the exact extent and nature of task-induced DMN dysfunction is poorly understood, including (a) the degree to which specific DMN subregions are affected in criminal psychopaths, and (b) how activity in these subregions relates to affective\/interpersonal and antisocial\/lifestyle traits of psychopathy. We performed a group independent component analysis to assess DMN activation during a Go\/NoGo task in a group of 22 high-psychopathy and 22 low-psychopathy prisoners. The identified group-level DMN was parcellated into 6 subregions, and group differences in task-induced activity were examined. In general, DMN subregions failed to deactivate beneath baseline in the high-psychopathy group. A group comparison with the low-psychopathy group localized this attenuated task-induced deactivation to the posteromedial cortical (mPC) region of the DMN. Moreover, multiple regression analyses revealed that activity in the mPC was associated with affective\/interpersonal traits of psychopathy. These findings suggest that attenuated deactivation of the mPC subregion of the DMN is intrinsic to psychopathy, and is a pattern that may be more associated with affective psychopathic traits, including lack of concern for others. ","650":"To test the hypothesis that foreign language and music instruction in early life are associated with lower incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and slower rate of cognitive decline in old age. At enrollment in a longitudinal cohort study, 964 older persons without cognitive impairment estimated years of foreign language and music instruction by age 18. Annually thereafter they completed clinical evaluations that included cognitive testing and clinical classification of MCI. There were 264 persons with no foreign language instruction, 576 with 1-4 years, and 124 with &gt; 4 years; 346 persons with no music instruction, 360 with 1-4 years, and 258 with &gt; 4 years. During a mean of 5.8 years of observation, 396 participants (41.1%) developed MCI. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, higher levels (&gt; 4 years) of foreign language (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.687, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.482, 0.961]) and music (HR = 0.708, 95% CI [0.539, 0.930]) instruction by the age of 18 were each associated with reduced risk of MCI. The association persisted after adjustment for other early life indicators of an enriched cognitive environment, and it was stronger for nonamnestic than amnestic MCI. Both foreign language and music instruction were associated with higher initial level of cognitive function, but neither instruction measure was associated with cognitive decline. Higher levels of foreign language and music instruction during childhood and adolescence are associated in old age with lower risk of developing MCI but not with rate of cognitive decline. ","651":"The aim of this study was to examine the role of occipital face area (OFA) in mediating observers' tendency to perceive faces as \"wholes\" (holistic processing) both when detecting and discriminating faces. To investigate this issue, we modulated OFA activity using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In Experiment 1, participants performed a face detection task (the Mooney faces task) and a face discrimination task (the Composite faces task), which both assess holistic face processing. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to detect both Mooney faces and Mooney objects, to test face selectivity of OFA. In each experimental session, the tasks were presented once before (pre) and once after (post) administration of 20 min of excitability increasing anodal tDCS (real) and sham stimulation over the putative OFA. Compared with sham stimulation, we found that real anodal tDCS interfered with both Mooney faces and objects detection, whereas it had no effect on holistic processing involved in face discrimination, as measured by the Composite faces task. Our results suggest that OFA is causally implicated in facial detection at least in degraded conditions (i.e., when the \"face\" signal needs to be extracted from a noisy background). In turn, our data do not implicate OFA in holistic processing in face discrimination. Finally, our data suggest a possible role of OFA in categorization of other nonface stimuli, a conclusion that must be taken with caution, as stimulation over OFA may affect object-selective adjacent regions. ","652":"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited movement disorder characterized by choreiform movements and frontostriatal dysfunction. Previous studies have documented executive deficits in HD. We aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive deficits on patients' daily functioning. Furthermore, we sought to explore how independent patients' cognitive difficulties were from their motor and psychiatric symptoms. We administered a battery of neuropsychological tasks assessing broader cognitive abilities and executive functions (e.g., verbal fluency, working memory, response inhibition) to 25 patients with HD and 20 healthy controls. Clinical ratings of functional capacity and the severity of motor and psychiatric symptoms were also taken. After establishing that patients with HD demonstrated characteristic cognitive deficits, we explored relationships between performance on neuropsychological tasks and clinical ratings. Patients with HD exhibited deficits on all timed neuropsychological tasks but not on measures of accuracy. Poorer functional capacity was related to cognitive deficits and more severe motor symptoms. Motor and psychiatric symptoms were also related to cognitive performance. Category fluency scores alone predicted 54% of the variance in functional capacity. Patients with HD exhibited a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that may reflect a generalized slowing in processing. It is important to note that we found that certain cognitive measures may help predict functional capacity in HD. However, we also highlight that performance on neuropsychological tasks can be influenced by motor or psychiatric symptoms. Future studies should consider such confounds when seeking purer measures of cognitive capacity. ","653":null,"654":"Currently, it is unclear whether a radical-by-radical (RBR) reading strategy exists in Chinese pure alexia, compared to the letter-by-letter (LBL) reading strategy in alphabetic languages. In this study, we focus on exploring the reading features of a Chinese pure alexic patient during the process of language recovery. We investigated this issue using a series of neuropsychological tests at 4 days, 11 days, and 8 months after admission of a Chinese pure alexic patient. The results showed that most words could not be read aloud initially by the patient. One week later, 2 clinical features were noted: RBR reading strategy and integration impairment. Finally, there were statistically significant differences in the reaction time between the single characters and compound characters, which indicated that a radical number effect may exist. Combined with the results of previous studies, the current case study indicates that there is evidence suggesting that the RBR reading strategy in Chinese pure alexia is of limited benefit, a result that appears fundamentally different from the LBL reading strategy. ","655":"Healthy young adults are presumed to be in their cognitive prime, yet emerging evidence indicates that regular engagement in physical activity can still benefit their cognitive functioning. The mechanisms supporting these exercise-related cognitive benefits remain unclear, but recent research points to cerebral blood-flow (CBF) regulation as potentially important. The current study investigated the possibility that efficacy of CBF regulation underpins exercise-cognition links in this high functioning population. In 55 healthy young adults, cognitive control performance (inhibition and switching) was examined in relation to habitual physical activity, aerobic fitness, and CBF regulation (evidenced by blood-flow responsiveness to increases and decreases in carbon dioxide: hypercapnic reactivity, n = 43, and hypocapnic reactivity, n = 42). Multiple regression analyses revealed that more frequent physical activity, and to some extent better aerobic fitness, predicted both better CBF regulation and better cognitive inhibitory control. CBF regulation also predicted better cognitive inhibitory control. Moreover, mediation analyses indicated that more frequent participation in physical activity may bring about improvements in cognitive inhibitory control through improved CBF regulation. These results provide novel insight into the cognitive and cerebrovascular benefits that may be gained with regular engagement in physical activity, even in a high-functioning population. Moreover, they point to better CBF regulation as a specific mechanism that may drive physical activity-related cognitive benefits, which converges with recent data in older women (Brown et al., 2010). ","656":"The present study examined prospective and episodic memory in relation to age, functional independence, and hippocampal volume in younger to middle-aged adults with spina bifida myelomeningocele (SBM) and typically developing (TD) adults. Prospective and episodic memory, as well as hippocampal volume, was reduced in adults with SBM relative to TD adults. Neither memory performance nor hippocampal volume showed greater decrements in older adults. Lower hippocampal volume was associated with reduced prospective memory in adults with SBM, and this relation was specific to the hippocampus and not to a contrast structure, the amygdala. Prospective memory mediated the relation between hippocampal volume and functional independence in adults with SBM. The results add to emerging evidence for reduced memory function in adults with SBM and provide quantitative evidence for compromised hippocampal macrostructure as a neural correlate of reduced memory in this population.","657":"The neural systems most susceptible to age-related decline mirror the systems linked to decision making. Yet, the neural processes underlying decision-making disparities among older adults are not well understood. We sought to identify neural response patterns that distinguish 2 groups of older adults who exhibit divergent decision-making patterns. Participants were 31 healthy older adults (ages 59-88, 53% female), defined as advantageous or disadvantageous decision-makers based on Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) performance, who completed an alternate version of the IGT while undergoing functional MRI. The groups were indistinguishable on neuropsychological testing. We contrasted the BOLD signal between groups during 3 phases of the decision-making process: Prechoice (preselection), Prefeedback (postselection), and Feedback (receipt of gains\/losses). We further examined whether BOLD signal varied as a function of age in each group. We observed greater activation among the IGT-Disadvantageous relative to -Advantageous older adults in the prefrontal cortex during the early phases of the decision-making process (Prechoice), and in posterior brain regions (e.g., the precuneus) during the later phases (Prefeedback and Feedback). We also found that with increasing age, IGT-Advantageous older adults showed increasing activation in the prefrontal cortex during all phases and increasing activation in the posterior cingulate during earlier phases of the decision process. By contrast, the IGT-Disadvantageous older adults exhibited a reduced or reversed trend. These functional differences may be a consequence of altered reward processing or differing compensatory strategies between IGT-Disadvantageous and -Advantageous older adults. This supports the notion that divergent neurobiological aging trajectories underlie disparate decision-making patterns. ","658":"The study was designed to examine persistent (input selection) versus transient (input shifting) mechanisms of attention control in Parkinson's disease (PD). The study identifies behavioral and neural markers of selective control and shifting control using a novel combination of a flanker task with an attentional set-shifting task, and it compares patients with PD with matched controls. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded, and analyses focused on frontally distributed N2 waves, parietally distributed P3 waves, and error-related negativities (Ne\/ERN). Controls showed robust shifting costs (prolonged response times), but patients with PD did not show evidence for comparable shifting costs. Patients with PD made more errors than controls when required to shift between attentional sets, but also when they had to initially maintain an attentional set. At the neural level it was found that contrary to controls, patients with PD did not display any N2 and P3 augmentations on shift trials. Patients with PD further did not display any error-related activity or posterror N2 augmentation. Our results reveal that intact selective control and disrupted shifting control are dissociable in patients with PD, but additional work is required to dissect the proportionate effects of disease and treatment on shifting control in PD. Our ERP-based approach opens a new window onto an understanding of motor and cognitive flexibility that seems to be associated with the dopaminergic innervation of cortico-striatal loops. ","659":null,"660":"Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have impaired theory of mind (ToM). However, ToM involves a variety of processes, such as understanding a person's intentions (\"cognitive\" ToM) and emotional states (\"affective\" ToM). The objectives of the present study were to characterize ToM disorders in TLE patients, identify patients at risk of ToM disorders, and study the relationships between psychobehavioral and quality of life factors and ToM disorders. Fifty TLE patients and 50 controls performed ToM tasks assessing their understanding of verbal clumsiness (faux pas), sarcastic remarks, and mentalistic actions. Demographic, cognitive, and psychobehavioral data, and (for TLE patients) clinical and quality of life factors, were recorded. Compared with controls, TLE patients showed impairments in all ToM tasks: 84% misunderstood faux pas, and around 50% misunderstood sarcasm. A long duration of epilepsy and young age at onset were risk factors for ToM impairments. In TLE patients, ToM impairments were associated with impaired empathy and anhedonia. Their affective states were less positively and more negatively valenced than in controls. Low positive affectivity was predictive of greater cognitive and affective ToM impairments for the faux pas task, and high negative affectivity was predictive of greater cognitive ToM abilities for the sarcasm task. The lack of social support was correlated with impaired ToM but was not a predictive factor. Both cognitive and affective ToM processes are impaired in TLE patients. Impaired ToM has an impact on empathy abilities and is related to affective disturbances in TLE patients. ","661":"The objective of this study was to examine the dependence of item memory and relational memory on medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Patients with amnesia, who either had extensive MTL damage or damage that was relatively restricted to the hippocampus, were tested, as was a matched comparison group. Disproportionate relational memory impairments were predicted for both patient groups, and those with extensive MTL damage were also expected to have impaired item memory. Participants studied scenes, and were tested with interleaved 2-alternative forced-choice probe trials. Probe trials were either presented immediately after the corresponding study trial (Lag 1), 5 trials later (Lag 5), or 9 trials later (Lag 9) and consisted of the studied scene along with a manipulated version of that scene in which 1 item was replaced with a different exemplar (item memory test) or was moved to a new location (relational memory test). Participants were to identify the exact match of the studied scene. As predicted, patients were disproportionately impaired on the test of relational memory. Item memory performance was marginally poorer among patients with extensive MTL damage, but both groups were impaired relative to matched comparison participants. Impaired performance was evident at all lags, including the shortest possible lag (Lag 1). The results are consistent with the proposed role of the hippocampus in relational memory binding and representation, even at short delays, and suggest that the hippocampus may also contribute to successful item memory when items are embedded in complex scenes. ","662":"The study characterized the status of retrograde amnesia (RA) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We measured RA, anterograde amnesia (AA), brain measures, apolipoprotein-E status (ApoE), and conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) across 3 years in 15 individuals with MCI. We compared the severity of amnesia and brain atrophy in MCI to a group of patients with limited damage to the hippocampus (H) or more extensive damage to the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The MCI group exhibited modest AA, together with severe RA, covering nearly 4 decades before their diagnosis. Compared with H-MTL patients, the temporal extent of RA was disproportionate to the severity of AA. The MCI group exhibited more modest AA and MTL atrophy than H-MTL patients, together with more severe RA and neocortical atrophy than H-MTL patients. The severity of AA corresponded to the integrity of MTL structures, whereas the severity of RA corresponded to the integrity of both MTL and neocortical structures. RA (but not AA, nor measures of cognitive status) was related to ApoE status and subsequent diagnosis of probable AD. RA was predicted by heritable risk for AD, in addition to the integrity of MTL and neocortical structures. Compared with H-MTL patients, the MCI group exhibited RA that was disproportionate to their AA and that was more severe than would be expected if their atrophy were limited primarily to the MTL. Heritable risk for AD, as well as the integrity of brain regions within and beyond the MTL, are important for understanding RA in MCI. ","663":"Following recent findings that rhythmic priming can enhance speech perception, the aim of this experiment was to investigate whether this extends to speech production. The authors measured the influence of rhythmic priming on phonological production abilities in 14 hearing impaired children with hearing devices. Children had to repeat sentences that were or were not preceded by a rhythmical prime. In addition, this rhythmic prime either matched or mismatched the meter (i.e., stress contrasts) of the sentence. Matching conditions resulted in a greater phonological accuracy of spoken sentences compared to baseline and mismatching conditions. Cochlear implant users were also more sensitive to rhythmic priming than hearing aid users. These results suggest that musical rhythmic priming can enhance phonological production in HI children via an enhanced perception of the target sentence. Overall, these findings suggest that musical rhythm engages domain-general expectations which can enhance both in perception and production of speech. ","664":"This article reports findings of a meta-analysis and meta-regression summarizing research on implicit sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), as measured by the Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task. Following a systematic search of the literature, we analyzed a total of 27 studies, representing data from 505 participants with PD and 460 neurologically intact control participants. Overall, the meta-analysis indicated significantly (p &lt; .001) worse sequence learning by the PD group than the control group. The average weighted effect size was found to be .531 (95% CI [.332, .470]), which is a medium effect size. However, moderate to high levels of heterogeneity (differences) were found between study effect sizes (I(2) = 58%). Meta-regression analysis suggested that presentation of the SRT task under dual task conditions coupled with PD severity or characteristics of the sequence might affect study effect sizes. The meta-analysis provides clear support that learning in procedural memory (procedural learning), which underlies implicit sequence learning in the SRT task, is impaired in PD. ","665":"This study examines the magnitude and direction of nonword and word lexical decision repetition priming effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal aging, focusing specifically on the negative priming effect sometimes observed with repeated nonwords. Probable AD patients (30), elderly normal controls (34), and young normal controls (49) participated in a repetition priming experiment using low-frequency words and word-like nonwords with a letter-level orthographic orienting task at study followed by a lexical decision test phase. Although participants' reaction times (RTs) were longer in AD compared with elderly normal, and elderly normal compared with young normal, the repetition priming effect and the degree to which the repetition priming effect was reversed for nonwords compared to words was unaffected by AD or normal aging. AD patients, like young and elderly normal participants, are able to modify (in the case of words) and create (in the case of nonwords) long-term memory traces for lexical stimuli, based on a single orthographic processing trial. The nonword repetition results are discussed from the perspective of new vocabulary learning commencing with a provisional lexical memory trace created after orthographic encoding of a novel word-like letter string. ","666":"The frequent lack of correspondence between performance and observational measures of executive functioning, including working memory, has raised questions about the validity of the observational measures. This study was conducted to investigate sources of this discrepancy through correlation of volumetric and cortical thickness (CT) neuroimaging values with performance and questionnaire measures of working memory (WM). Using longitudinal data from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development (Volumes, N= 347, 54.3% female; CT, N= 350, 54.6% female; age range: 6 to 16.9 years), scores on the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) WM, Emotional Control (EC) and Inhibition (INH) scales; Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children-III Digit Span; and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Battery Spatial Working Memory (CANTAB SWM) were correlated with each other and with morphometric measurements using mixed effects linear regression models. BRIEF WM was correlated with CANTAB SWM (p &lt; .001). With whole brain correction, BRIEF WM and EC were both correlated with CT of the posterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), EC on the right side only. Performance measures of WM were unrelated to lobar volumes or CT, but were associated with volumes of hippocampus and amygdala. The known role of PHG in contextual learning suggests that the BRIEF WM assesses contextualized learning\/memory, potentially explaining its loose correspondence to the decontextualized performance measures. Observational measures can be useful and valid functional metrics, complementing performance measures. Labels used to characterize scales should be interpreted with caution, however. ","667":"The current study examined the relationship between mathematics and attention, working memory, and visual memory in children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and controls. Subjects were 56 children (29 AE, 27 CON) who were administered measures of global mathematics achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic &amp; WISC-III Written Arithmetic), attention, (WISC-III Digit Span forward and Spatial Span forward), working memory (WISC-III Digit Span backward and Spatial Span backward), and visual memory (CANTAB Spatial Recognition Memory and Pattern Recognition Memory). The contribution of cognitive domains to mathematics achievement was analyzed using linear regression techniques. Attention, working memory, and visual memory data were entered together on Step 1 followed by group on Step 2, and the interaction terms on Step 3. Model 1 accounted for a significant amount of variance in both mathematics achievement measures; however, model fit improved with the addition of group on Step 2. Significant predictors of mathematics achievement were Spatial Span forward and backward and Spatial Recognition Memory. These findings suggest that deficits in spatial processing may be related to math impairments seen in FASD. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with deficits in mathematics achievement, above and beyond the contribution of general cognitive abilities. ","668":"Two experiments were conducted to examine whether insufficient effort, negative symptoms (e.g., avolition, anhedonia), and psychological variables (e.g., anhedonia and perception of low cognitive resources) predict generalized neurocognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). In Experiment 1, participants included 97 individuals with SZ and 63 healthy controls (CN) who completed the Victoria Symptom Validity Test (VSVT), the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), and self-report anhedonia questionnaires. In Experiment 2, participants included 46 individuals with SZ and 33 CN who completed Green's Word Memory Test (WMT), the MCCB, and self-reports of anhedonia, defeatist performance beliefs, and negative expectancy appraisals. RESULTS indicated that a low proportion of individuals with SZ failed effort testing (1.0% Experiment 1; 15.2% Experiment 2); however, global neurocognitive impairment was significantly predicted by low effort and negative symptoms. Findings indicate that low effort does not threaten the validity of neuropsychological test results in the majority of individuals with schizophrenia; however, effort testing may be useful in SZ patients with severe negative symptoms who may be more likely to put forth insufficient effort due to motivational problems. Although the base rate of failure is relatively low, it may be beneficial to screen for insufficient effort in SZ and exclude individuals who fail effort testing from pharmacological or cognitive remediation trials. ","669":"Assessment of daily functions affected by cognitive loss in prodromal Huntington's disease (HD) is necessary in practice and clinical trials. We evaluated baseline and longitudinal sensitivity of the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scales in prodromal HD and compared self- and companion-ratings. Everyday cognition was self-assessed by 850 participants with prodromal HD and 768 companions. We examined internal structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on baseline data. For longitudinal analysis, we stratified participants into Low, Medium, and High disease progression groups. We examined ECog scores for group differences and participant-and-companion differences using linear mixed effects regression (LMER). Comparison with the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scale was made. CFA revealed good fit of a 5-factor model having a global factor (total score), and subfactors (subscales) of memory, language, visuospatial perception, and executive function. At study entry, participants and companions in the Medium and High groups reported significantly worsened everyday cognition as well as significant functional decline over time. Losses became more pronounced and participant and companion ratings diverged as individuals progressed. TFC showed significant functional loss over time in the High group but not in the Medium group. Disease progression is associated with reduced self- and companion-reported everyday cognition in prodromal HD participants who are less than 13 years to estimated motor onset. Our findings suggest companion ratings are more sensitive than participants' for detecting longitudinal change in daily cognitive function. ECog appears more sensitive to specific functional changes in the prodrome of HD than the TFC. ","670":"Cognitive reserve refers to how individuals actively utilize neural resources to cope with neuropathology to maintain cognitive functioning. The present review aims to critically examine the literature addressing the relationship between bilingualism and cognitive reserve to elucidate whether bilingualism delays the onset of cognitive and behavioral manifestations of dementia. Potential neural mechanisms behind this relationship are discussed. PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched (through January 2014) for original research articles in English or Spanish languages. The following search strings were used as keywords for study retrieval: \"bilingual AND reserve,\" \"reserve AND neural mechanisms,\" and \"reserve AND multilingualism.\" Growing scientific evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve and delays the onset of Alzheimer's disease symptoms, allowing bilingual individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease to live an independent and richer life for a longer time than their monolingual counterparts. Lifelong bilingualism is related to more efficient use of brain resources that help individuals maintain cognitive functioning in the presence of neuropathology. We propose multiple putative neural mechanisms through which lifelong bilinguals cope with neuropathology. The roles of immigration status, education, age of onset, proficiency, and frequency of language use on the relationship between cognitive reserve and bilingualism are considered. Implications of these results for preventive practices and future research are discussed. ","671":"In the cognitive and clinical neurosciences, the past decade has been marked by dramatic growth in a literature examining brain \"connectivity\" using noninvasive methods. We offer a critical review of the blood oxygen level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) literature examining neural connectivity changes in neurological disorders with focus on brain injury and dementia. The goal is to demonstrate that there are identifiable shifts in local and large-scale network connectivity that can be predicted by the degree of pathology. We anticipate that the most common network response to neurological insult is hyperconnectivity but that this response depends upon demand and resource availability. To examine this hypothesis, we initially reviewed the results from 1,426 studies examining functional brain connectivity in individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Based upon inclusionary criteria, 126 studies were included for detailed analysis. RESULTS from 126 studies examining local and whole brain connectivity demonstrated increased connectivity in traumatic brain injury and multiple sclerosis. This finding is juxtaposed with findings in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease where there is a shift to diminished connectivity as degeneration progresses. This summary of the functional imaging literature using fMRI methods reveals that hyperconnectivity is a common response to neurological disruption and that it may be differentially observable across brain regions. We discuss the factors contributing to both hyper- and hypoconnectivity results after neurological disruption and the implications these findings have for network plasticity. ","672":"Word-finding difficulties are a common complaint among individuals with left (domain) temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We tested the hypothesis that these difficulties stem from a deficit in semantic processing. We tested and compared semantic processing in left and right TLE patients and healthy controls. To avoid the confound of word retrieval, we used two semantic tasks (semantic priming and picture-matching) that did not require spoken word production. In addition to accuracy, we recorded response time in an effort to achieve a sensitive assessment of semantic processing. Semantic priming was in all respects comparable between left TLE patients with documented word-finding difficulty and right TLE patients without word-finding difficulty. Likewise, performances were comparable between groups on picture matching, which demanded knowledge of detailed semantic features for decisions regarding subtle differences in semantic relatedness. Overall, these results, which demonstrate a relative preservation of semantic processing in left TLE, suggest that the probable cause of word-finding difficulty in this group relates to processes that follow semantic retrieval in word production, involving the retrieval of lexical\/phonological information. In addition to clinical implications for remediation, these results refine our understanding of the neurocognitive organization of temporal mechanisms supporting spoken word production. ","673":"To explore perception of facial expressions of emotion and its link with voluntary facial musculature control in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated in 2 sets of experiments in PD patients and healthy controls the perceptual ability to discriminate (a) graded intensities of emotional from neutral expressions, (b) graded intensities of the same emotional expressions, (c) full-blown discrepant emotional expressions from 2 similar expressions and the more complex recognition ability to label full-blown emotional expressions. We tested an embodied simulationist account of emotion perception in PD, which predicts a link between the ability to perceive emotional expressions and facial musculature control. We also explored the contribution of the ability to extract facial information (besides emotion) to emotion perception in PD. Those with PD were, as a group, impaired relative to controls (with large effect sizes) in all measures of discrimination and recognition of emotional expressions, although some patients performed as well as the best performing controls. In support of embodied simulation, discrimination and recognition of emotional expressions correlated positively with voluntary control of facial musculature (after partialing out disease severity and age). Patients were also impaired at extracting information other than emotion from faces, specifically discriminating and recognizing identity from faces (with large effect sizes); identity discrimination correlated positively with emotion discrimination and recognition but not with voluntary facial musculature control (after partialing out disease severity and age). The results indicate that impaired sensory and sensorimotor processes, which are a function of disease severity, affect emotion perception in PD. ","674":"The assessment of cognitive functions of adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comprises self-ratings of cognitive functioning (subjective assessment) as well as psychometric testing (objective neuropsychological assessment). The aim of the present study was to explore the utility of these assessment strategies in predicting neuropsychological impairments of adults with ADHD as determined by both approaches. Fifty-five adults with ADHD and 66 healthy participants were assessed with regard to cognitive functioning in several domains by employing subjective and objective measurement tools. Significance and effect sizes for differences between groups as well as the proportion of patients with impairments were analyzed. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses were carried out in order to explore the validity of subjective and objective cognitive measures in predicting cognitive impairments. Both subjective and objective assessment tools revealed significant cognitive dysfunctions in adults with ADHD. The majority of patients displayed considerable impairments in all cognitive domains assessed. A comparison of effect sizes, however, showed larger dysfunctions in the subjective assessment than in the objective assessment. Furthermore, logistic regression models indicated that subjective cognitive complaints could not be predicted by objective measures of cognition and vice versa. Subjective and objective assessment tools were found to be sensitive in revealing cognitive dysfunctions of adults with ADHD. Because of the weak association between subjective and objective measurements, it was concluded that subjective and objective measurements are both important for clinical practice but may provide distinct types of information and capture different aspects of functioning. ","675":"Previous research has revealed the contribution of decreased processing speed and reduced working memory span in verbal and visual memory impairment in patients with schizophrenia. The role of affective symptoms in verbal memory has also emerged in a few studies. The authors designed a picture recognition task to investigate the impact of these factors on visual encoding. Two types of pictures (black and white vs. colored) were presented under 2 different conditions of context encoding (either displayed at a specific location or in association with another visual stimulus). It was assumed that the process of encoding associated pictures was more effortful than that of encoding pictures that were presented alone. Working memory span and processing speed were assessed. In the patient group, working memory span was significantly associated with the recognition of the associated pictures but not significantly with that of the other pictures. Controlling for processing speed eliminated the patients' deficit in the recognition of the colored pictures and greatly reduced their deficit in the recognition of the black-and-white pictures. The recognition of the black-and-white pictures was inversely related to anxiety in men and to depression in women. Working memory span constrains the effortful visual encoding processes in patients, whereas processing speed decrement accounts for most of their visual encoding deficit. Affective symptoms also have an impact on visual encoding, albeit differently in men and women. ","676":"A robust body of aging-related research has established benefits of both physical exercise (PE) and cognitive training (CT) on executive functions related to the activities of daily living of older adults; however, no meta-analysis has compared these treatments. The current quantitative review involved a comparison of the overall effect sizes of PE and CT interventions on executive functions (Morris, 2008; pre-post-controlled effect size: d(ppc)), while also exploring contextual moderators of treatment outcomes. A systematic review identified 46 studies (23 PE, 21 CT, and 2 both) meeting inclusion criteria (i.e., controlled interventions, executive-related outcomes, mean ages 65+, information to calculate d(ppc)). The weighted mean dppc values came to 0.12 (p &lt; .01) for PE and 0.24 (p &lt; .01) for CT. Treatment effects differed based on executive constructs for CT, with problem solving presenting the highest d(ppc) (0.47, p &lt; .01). Notably, PE produced similar effect sizes across distinct executive functions. Treatment characteristics (e.g., session length\/frequency) did not predict effect sizes. CT had a significant benefit on healthy participants (0.26, p &lt; .01), but cognitively impaired samples did not experience a significant effect. Both treatments improved executive functions, but CT presented a potential advantage at improving executive functions. Improvements in executive functions differed depending on construct for CT, whereas each construct produced similar, modest effect sizes for PE. Publication bias and study quality variability potentially bias these conclusions, as lower quality studies likely produced inflated effect sizes. ","677":"There is currently limited understanding of the course of change in everyday functioning that occurs with normal aging and dementia. To better characterize the nature of this change, we evaluated the types of errors made by participants as they performed everyday tasks in a naturalistic environment. Participants included cognitively healthy younger adults (YA; n = 55) and older adults (OA; n = 88), and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI: n = 55) and dementia (n = 18). Participants performed 8 scripted everyday activities (e.g., filling a medication dispenser) while under direct observation in a campus apartment. Task performances were coded for the following errors: inefficient actions, omissions, substitutions, and irrelevant actions. Performance accuracy decreased with age and level of cognitive impairment. Relative to the YAs, the OA group exhibited more inefficient actions which were linked to performance on neuropsychological measures of executive functioning. Relative to the OAs, the MCI group committed significantly more omission errors which were strongly linked to performance on memory measures. All error types were significantly more prominent in individuals with dementia. Omission errors uniquely predicted everyday functional status as measured by both informant-report and a performance-based measure. These findings suggest that in the progression from healthy aging to MCI, everyday task difficulties may evolve from task inefficiencies to task omission errors, leading to inaccuracies in task completion that are recognized by knowledgeable informants. Continued decline in cognitive functioning then leads to more substantial everyday errors, which compromise ability to live independently. ","678":"Unilateral hand contractions have been shown to induce relative activation of the contralateral hemisphere, which is in turn associated with distinct motivational states. Specifically, right hand contraction increases relative left activation and promotes an approach state, and left hand contractions promote relative right activation and withdrawal states. Using the same hand clenching technique, the present study extends this research to examine the incidental role of motivational tendency on interactive economic decision making. A total of 75 right-handed participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions, including withdrawal\/left-hand contractions, approach\/right-hand contractions, and control\/no contraction. Participants completed 2 well-known economic tasks, namely the Ultimatum Game (UG), Dictator Game (DG). In the UG, we found that relative to individuals in the withdrawal condition, those in the approach (right-hand contraction) condition made higher monetary offers to human partners who could either accept or reject these offers. Moreover, those in the approach condition rejected significantly more unfair offers from human partners. This study provides the first evidence that hemispheric activation, using unilateral muscle contractions, may play a causal role in biasing social economic decision making. Overall, there results suggest that greater relative left frontal activation promotes reward-maximizing strategies, consistent with an approach motivation, and relative right frontal activation may decrease such strategic tendencies.

This study refined and further validated the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study-Neurocognitive Questionnaire (CCSS-NCQ; Krull et al., 2008), a scale developed to screen for impairment in long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Items related to task efficiency, memory, organization, and emotional-regulation domains were examined using item response theory (IRT). Data were collected from 833 adult survivors of childhood cancer who completed self-report and direct neurocognitive testing for the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study. The revision process included: (a) content-validity mapping of items to domains, (b) constructing a revised CCSS-NCQ, (c) selecting items within specific domains using IRT, and (d) evaluating concordance between the revised CCSS-NCQ and direct neurocognitive assessment. Using content and measurement properties, 32 items were retained (8 items in 4 domains). Items captured low to middle levels of neurocognitive concerns. The latent domain scores demonstrated poor convergent\/divergent validity with the direct assessments. Adjusted ESs (ES; Cohen's d) for agreement between self-reported memory and direct memory assessment were moderate for total recall (ES = 0.66), long-term memory (ES = 0.63), and short-term memory (STM; ES = 0.55). ESs between self-rated task efficiency and direct assessment of attention were moderate for focused attention (ES = 0.70) and attention span (ES = 0.50), but small for sustained attention (ES = 0.36). Cranial radiation therapy and female gender were associated with lower self-reported neurocognitive function. The revised CCSS-NCQ demonstrates adequate measurement properties for assessing day-to-day neurocognitive concerns in childhood cancer survivors, and adds useful information to direct assessment. ","681":"When attention is attracted to an irrelevant location, performance on a subsequent target is hindered at that location in relation to novel, not previously attended, locations. This phenomenon is known as inhibition of return (IOR). Previous research has shown that IOR is not observed, or its onset is delayed, in schizophrenia patients. In the present study, the authors tested the hypothesis that IOR may be intact but masked by increased facilitation in schizophrenia patients. To test this hypothesis, they used a procedure that usually reduces or eliminates the early facilitation. In the first experiment, the authors used the typical single-cue IOR task in the group of healthy adults (N = 28) and in a group of schizophrenia patients (N = 32). In the second experiment, they manipulated cue-target discriminability by presenting spatially overlapping cues and targets where the cues were more intense than the targets. In Experiment 1, they did not find significant IOR effects in the group of schizophrenia patients, even with cue-target intervals as long as 3,200 ms. However, in Experiment 2, IOR effects were significant at the 350- and 450-ms cue-target intervals for healthy and patients, respectively. This is the first study that shows that schizophrenia patients can actually show inhibitory effects very similar to healthy controls, even when no help is provided to shift their attention away from the irrelevant location. The authors suggest that inhibition is intact in schizophrenia patients, but it is usually masked by increased facilitation. ","682":"To examine the longitudinal trajectories of everyday cognition and longitudinal associations with basic (i.e., laboratory and experimentally measured) cognitive abilities, including verbal memory, inductive reasoning, visual processing speed, and vocabulary. Participants were healthy older adults drawn from the no-treatment control group (N = 698) of the Advanced Cognitive Training for the Independent and Vital Elderly (Willis et al., 2006) randomized trial and were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years later. Analyses were conducted using latent growth models. Modeling revealed an overall inverted-U shape (quadratic) trajectory across cognitive domains. Among basic cognitive predictors, level and slope in reasoning demonstrated the closest association to level and slope of everyday cognition, and accounted for most of the individual differences in linear gain in everyday cognition. Everyday cognition is not buffered against decline, and is most closely related to inductive reasoning in healthy older adults. To establish the clinical utility of everyday cognitive measures, future research should examine these associations in samples with more cognitive impairment. ","683":"Cognitive deficits in patients with Wilson's disease (WD) have been reported in several studies, but there was no detailed analysis of the various components of attention, one of the most significant factors of the executive system. Our study determined the pattern of deficits in attention subsystems in WD patients, including selective attention, divided attention, attention switching, and sustained attention. We examined 67 WD patients using the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA)-33 participants with neurological symptoms and 34 who were neurologically asymptomatic, but most with mild hepatic dysfunctions. The results were compared with 43 matched healthy controls. The group of WD patients with neurological symptoms performed significantly worse (p &lt; .05) in all components of attention: sustained attention, selective attention, divided attention, and attentional switching. WD patients without neurological symptoms exhibited significantly lower results in one component-sustained attention (p &lt; .05). None of the TEA subtests scores were associated significantly with Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale scores, which may reflect that the cognitive and neurological consequences of WD are relatively independent. We found a deficiency in all components of attention in neurological WD patients. The most frequently disturbed function was attention switching. Relatively milder deficits concerned divided, selective, and sustained attention. These are all abilities creating the core of the executive system and are regulated by subcortical prefrontal circuits, which are usually dysfunctional in WD patients. In neurologically asymptomatic patients, an isolated deficit of sustained attention occurs; this may be a sign of mild hepatic encephalopathy. ","684":null,"685":"Our study assessed how nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) interpret the affective and mental states of others from spoken language (adopt a \"theory of mind\") in ecologically valid social contexts. A secondary goal was to examine the relationship between emotion processing, mentalizing, and executive functions in PD during interpersonal communication. Fifteen adults with PD and 16 healthy adults completed The Awareness of Social Inference Test, a standardized tool comprised of videotaped vignettes of everyday social interactions (McDonald, Flanagan, Rollins, &amp; Kinch, 2003). Individual subtests assessed participants' ability to recognize basic emotions and to infer speaker intentions (sincerity, lies, sarcasm) from verbal and nonverbal cues, and to judge speaker knowledge, beliefs, and feelings. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation was also conducted. Patients with mild-moderate PD were impaired in the ability to infer \"enriched\" social intentions, such as sarcasm or lies, from nonliteral remarks; in contrast, adults with and without PD showed a similar capacity to recognize emotions and social intentions meant to be literal. In the PD group, difficulties using theory of mind to draw complex social inferences were significantly correlated with limitations in working memory and executive functioning. In early PD, functional compromise of the frontal-striatal-dorsal system yields impairments in social perception and understanding nonliteral speaker intentions that draw upon cognitive theory of mind. Deficits in social perception in PD are exacerbated by a decline in executive resources, which could hamper the strategic deployment of attention to multiple information sources necessary to infer social intentions. ","686":"Computerized neuropsychological tests offered several advantages for large epidemiological studies to assess child neuropsychological development. We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties and criterion validity of 2 computerized tests (n-back and attentional network task [ANT]) used to assess the working memory and attention function, respectively. As part of the BREATHE (BRain dEvelopment and Air polluTion ultrafine particles in scHool childrEn) project, we evaluated the neuropsychological development of 2,904 children between 7 to 9 years of age. The main outcomes of the n-back test were d' scores and hit reaction time (RT) (HRT). The outcomes measured for ANT were incorrect responses, omissions, alerting, orienting, and conflict. We also collected data of child's sex, age, school achievement, ADHD symptomatology, behavioral problems, and maternal education. We observed that the d' scores and HRT showed acceptable internal consistency, reasonable factorial structure, as well as good criterion validity and statistical dependencies. Regarding the ANT, incorrect responses, omissions, and conflict score had acceptable criterion validity although the internal consistency of the ANT was low. We strongly recommend the use of these tests in environmental epidemiological studies as valid, objective, and easy-to-apply measures of child neuropsychological development.","687":"To assess cognition in populations born and living at high altitude (HA; 3,700 m) and low altitude (LA; 500 m) in Bolivia, who were similar for both socioeconomic status and genetic ancestry. To determine whether HA hypoxia influences cognitive decline across the life span. In total, 191 healthy participants aged 4 to 85 years were assessed at HA (N = 94; 33; 35% male) and LA (N = 97; 46, 47% male) on a battery of cognitive tasks: fluid intelligence, attention, short- and long-term memory, and psychomotor speed. Saliva samples were obtained for evaluation of genetic ancestry. HA participants were significantly slower on measures of processing speed and speed of attention than individuals born and living at LA. HA participants had slightly higher percentage of native Andean ancestry than LA participants, but this was not associated with cognitive performance. This is the first study of HA residence and neurocognition across the life span. Given the physiological challenges of HA living, the impact on cognition appears to be subtle and related only to the speed of more complex cognitive operations, rather than to their accuracy. Moreover, the impact on cognition does not appear to differ with increasing age or for different degrees of genetic admixture. Further studies recruiting HA participants with a broader range of native Andean ancestry will help to address the issue of to what extent Amerindian ancestry provides neuroprotection to chronic hypoxia in those living at HA. ","688":"The ability to see things from another's perspective, that is, have a theory of mind (ToM), is essential to effective communication. So too is the ability to regulate verbal output, that is, to exercise executive control. People with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) have impaired communication abilities, but the extent to which this reflects ToM versus executive dysfunction is unclear. This study explored the relative contributions of executive abilities, specifically flexibility and inhibition and ToM abilities in language production post-TBI. Twenty-five adults (18 males: mean age of 48.2 years, SD = 12.0 years) with moderate to severe TBI (posttraumatic amnesia = 69.2, SD = 54.6 days) and 28 noninjured adults (19 males: mean age 49.0, SD = 12.2 years) completed three sets of communication tasks with low executive demands, high flexibility, and high inhibition demands. Within each, parallel versions had low or high ToM requirements. For low executive and high flexibility tasks, scores on the high ToM versions were predicted by scores on the low ToM versions, suggesting that poor performance was explained by the executive demands the parallel tasks had in common. The exception was the high inhibition task. In this case, speakers with TBI had differential difficulty with the high ToM version, that is, they had specific difficulty inhibiting self-referential thoughts in order to cater for another's perspective. We found problems with inhibiting the self-perspective accords with descriptive accounts of the egocentric nature of some communication patterns following TBI, which points to potential targets for remediation. ","689":"Metamemory, or knowledge of one's memory abilities, is often impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the basis of this metacognitive deficit has not been fully articulated. Behavioral and imaging studies have produced conflicting evidence regarding the extent to which specific cognitive domains (i.e., executive function; memory) and brain regions contribute to memory awareness. The primary aim of this study was to disentangle the cognitive correlates of metamemory in AD by examining the relatedness of objective metamemory performance to cognitive tasks grouped by domain (executive function or memory) as well as by preferential hemispheric reliance defined by task modality (verbal or nonverbal). Eighty-nine participants with mild AD recruited at Columbia University Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania underwent objective metamemory and cognitive testing. Partial correlations were used to assess the relationship between metamemory and four cognitive variables, adjusted for recruitment site. The significant correlates of metamemory included nonverbal fluency (r = .27, p = .02) and nonverbal memory (r = .24, p = .04). Our findings suggest that objectively measured metamemory in a large sample of individuals with mild AD is selectively related to a set of interdomain nonverbal tasks. The association between metamemory and the nonverbal tasks may implicate a shared reliance on a right-sided cognitive network that spans frontal and temporal regions. ","690":"Little is known about genetic contributions to individual differences in cognitive plasticity. Given that the neurotransmitter dopamine is critical for cognition and associated with cognitive plasticity, we investigated the effects of 3 polymorphisms of dopamine-related genes (LMX1A, DRD2, COMT) on baseline performance and plasticity of working memory (WM), perceptual speed, and reasoning. One hundred one younger and 103 older adults underwent approximately 100 days of cognitive training, and extensive testing before and after training. We analyzed the baseline and posttest data using latent change score models. For working memory, carriers of the val allele of the COMT polymorphism had lower baseline performance and larger performance gains from training than carriers of the met allele. There was no significant effect of the other genes or on other cognitive domains. We relate this result to available evidence indicating that met carriers perform better than val carriers in WM tasks taxing maintenance, whereas val carriers perform better at updating tasks. We suggest that val carriers may show larger training gains because updating operations carry greater potential for plasticity than maintenance operations. ","691":"A short wakeful rest immediately after learning boosts memory retention in amnesic patients over several minutes. Here we investigated whether a short wakeful rest could boost memory retention in amnesic patients over a much longer period. The authors tested 15 patients with amnesia associated with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\/mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 15 age- and-education-matched controls. All participants learned 2 prose passages, 1 followed by a 10-min wakeful rest (minimal sensory stimulation), and the other by a 10-min visual spot the difference game. Participants were given a surprise delayed recall test for both prose passages after 15-30 min and after 7 days. Wakeful resting boosted memory substantially in the patients over 15-30 min and 7 days: After 7 days all 15 patients retained &gt;30% of the prose that had been learned prior to wakeful resting. In contrast, after 7 days, only 4 patients retained &gt;30% of the prose that had been learned prior to playing the spot the difference game. This striking 7-day memory boost via wakeful resting is remarkable, given that amnesic patients often struggle to remember new information over just a few minutes. Our novel findings indicate that there is substantial capacity for longer-term retention in patients with amnestic MCI\/mild AD, and bolster the hypothesis that wakeful resting boosts memory by protecting the compromised memory consolidation system from interfering incoming information. ","692":"To investigate brain-behavior relationships between morphometric brain measures and salient executive function (EF) measures of inhibition and switching. One hundred participants (49-80 years) performed the Color Word Interference Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Salient measures of EF components of inhibition and switching, of which the effect of more fundamental skills were regressed out, were analyzed using linear models and a conditional inference trees analysis taking intercorrelations between predictor variables (brain volumes, age, gender, and education) into account. The conditional inference trees analysis demonstrated a primary role of the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in explaining variations in the salient EF measure of switching and combined inhibition\/switching. Age predicted measures of inhibition. The study highlights the importance of considering fundamental cognitive skills and the use of a statistical method taking possible complex relationships between predictor variables into account when interpreting standard EF test results. Further studies should include MRI measures representing neural networks that may relate to CWIT performance, and longitudinal studies are required to investigate any causal relationships. ","693":"Prior research has found that within-person standard deviations across different neuropsychological domains are larger in various clinical groups than in healthy control groups, but little is known about the specificity of these measures to clinical conditions. Within-person standard deviations were computed across composite scores representing episodic memory, perceptual speed, inductive reasoning, and spatial visualization and compared in older adults differing in the amount of subsequent cognitive change, and as a function of age in a large sample of adults ranging from 18 to 89 years of age. The standard deviations at an initial occasion were significantly greater in older adults who experienced the most negative longitudinal change, but relations of the standard deviations with age were only evident in adults under 65 years of age, and they were negative rather than positive. These findings suggest that high values of within-person variability may have specificity in predicting late life cognitive decline. ","694":null,"695":"Body representation is a complex process involving different sources of top-down and bottom-up information. Processing the position and the relations among different body parts is necessary to build up a specific body representation, that is, the visuospatial body map (or topological map of the body). Here we aimed to investigate how the loss of peripheral or central information affects this representation by testing amputee and brain-damaged patients. Thirty-two unilateral brain-damaged patients (i.e., left-brain-damaged patients and right-brain-damaged patients who were or were not affected by personal neglect), 18 lower limb amputees and 15 healthy controls took part in the study. The topological body map was assessed by means of the \"Frontal body-evocation subtest\" (Daurat-Hmeljiak, Stambak, &amp; Berges, 1978), in which participants have to put tiles (each representing a body part) on a small wooden board on which a head is depicted. Group statistical analysis showed that in amputee patients the loss of peripheral information about the right lower limb affects the ability to represent relations among different body parts as much as the loss of top-down information in brain-damaged patients with personal neglect. Single case analysis of brain-damaged patients without personal neglect showed that the topological map of the body was deficient in 1 right-brain-damaged and 2 left-brain-damaged patients. Studying amputee and brain-damaged patients together allowed us to highlight the importance of visuospatial information about one's own limbs and the role of both hemispheres (not only the left one) in creating an efficient topological body representation. ","696":"The transition from childhood to adulthood is characterized by improved motor and cognitive performance in many domains. Developmental studies focus on average performance in single domains but ignore consistency of performance across domains. Within-individual variability (WIV) provides an index of that evenness and is a potential marker of development. We gave a computerized battery of 14 neurocognitive tests to 9138 youths ages 8-21 from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. As expected, performance improved with age, with both accuracy and speed peaking in adulthood. WIV, however, showed a U-shaped course: highest in childhood, declining yearly into mid-adolescence, and increasing again into adulthood. Young females outperformed and were less variable than males, but by early adulthood male performance matched that of females despite being more variable. We conclude that WIV declines from childhood to adolescence as developmental lags are overcome, and then increases into adulthood reflecting the emergence of cognitive specializations related to skill-honing and brain maturation. ","697":"Empathy refers to our ability to recognize and share emotions by another human being. Impairment may underlie many of the emotional deficits commonly associated with a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been implicated in these processes, but the specific contribution of subregions of the PFC remain unclear. Studies regarding the role of subregions of the prefrontal cortex such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-in facial emotion recognition have yielded inconsistent results. The present study aimed to investigate the capacity to recognize nonverbal emotional facial expressions in a group of patients with the following: (a) perfusion deficits in the vmPFC (vmPFC group; N = 13), (b) hypoperfusions sparing the vmPFC (nonvmPFC group; N = 12), and in (c) a control group of healthy volunteers (control group; N = 17). Regions of hypoperfusion were identified by means of Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Participants were asked to recognize facial expressions of the 7 basic emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness, or neutral). Detection of facial expressions of fear, disgust, and surprise was affected after functional disruption of the vmPFC. The present study confirms the role of the vmPFC in recognizing emotional facial expressions.","698":"Research on the long-term sequelae of treatment for pediatric brain tumors has identified significant neurocognitive deficits experienced by many survivors. Despite indications of deficits based on cognitive assessment, the identification of specific neurobiological mechanisms of these deficits using neuroimaging techniques has yet to be considered. This study used norm-referenced standardized assessment and functional MRI (fMRI) to examine attention and executive functioning deficits of survivors of pediatric brain tumors, as compared with healthy children. Survivors of pediatric brain tumors performed more poorly than healthy children on measures of overall cognitive ability, attention, and executive function during testing, as well as on a working memory task during fMRI. Survivors showed lower blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in bilateral frontal regions associated with sustained attention (BA6\/8) and greater BOLD signal in left cingulate regions associated with complex problem-solving and performance monitoring (BA32) during working memory task completion. Both group and brain activation accounted for significant variance in neurocognitive functioning. Survivors of pediatric brain tumor and healthy children differed in brain activation during completion of a working memory task, and brain activation was associated with deficits noted in testing. These findings may improve understanding of mechanisms of cognitive deficits and avenues for intervention for children with brain tumors. ","699":"Fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) have an expansion of 55-200 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Male fXPCs are at risk for developing a neurodegenerative motor disorder (FXTAS) often accompanied by inhibitory control impairments, even in fXPCs without motor symptoms. Inhibitory control impairments might precede, and thus indicate elevated risk for motor impairment associated with FXTAS. We tested whether inhibitory impairments are observable in fXPCs by assessing oculomotor performance. Participants were males aged 18-48 years asymptomatic for FXTAS. FXPCs (n = 21) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 22) performed four oculomotor tasks. In a Fixation task, participants fixated on a central cross and maintained gaze position when a peripheral stimulus appeared. In a Pursuit task, participants maintained gaze on a square moving at constant velocity. In a Prosaccade task, participants fixated on a central cross, then looked at a peripheral stimulus. An Antisaccade task was identical to the Prosaccade task, except participants looked in the direction opposite the stimulus. Inhibitory cost was the difference in saccade latency between the Antisaccade and Prosaccade tasks. Relative to controls, fXPCs had longer saccade latency in the Antisaccade task. In fXPCs, inhibitory cost was positively associated with vermis area in lobules VI-VII. Antisaccades require inhibitory control to inhibit reflexive eye movements. We found that eye movements are sensitive to impaired inhibitory control in fXPCs asymptomatic for FXTAS. Thus, eye movements may be useful in assessing FXTAS risk or disease progression. ","700":"Behavioral studies of spatial navigation in aging indicate that orientation using an allocentric reference frame (object-centered orientation) is impaired, whereas orientation using egocentric processes (self-centered orientation) is not. It has been proposed that navigational deficits may result from more general alterations of perception and attention or executive functions. The purpose of this study is to assess allocentric and egocentric representation in elderly individuals, and to determine if age-related deficits in spatial navigation are related to an attentional decline. We assessed encoding of the position of geometrical shapes, depending specifically on an allocentric or egocentric reference frame, during ERP recording in young and old subjects. Aging was associated with a performance decline in allocentric, but not egocentric, encoding. Both allocentric and egocentric conditions elicited parietal early components P1 and N1, reflecting top-down modulation, and components P2 and N2, reflecting selective attention and stimulus categorization. We observed age-associated effects on N1 and N2 amplitudes and on N2 latency in both spatial conditions. Moreover, impaired allocentric performance in older subjects was associated with a greater P2 amplitude and delayed P2 latency compared with younger subjects. These results suggest that elderly individuals present with deficits when spatial orientation relies on allocentric representation, and are associated with age-related deficits in spatial attention. ","701":"The spacing effect describes the typical finding that repeated items are remembered best when additional items are introduced between each repetition than when the repetitions occur in immediate succession. In this study, we investigated the nature and limits of the spacing effect in the developmental amnesic case H.C. In Experiment 1, we compared the performance of H.C. to that of controls on a short-term, free recall, verbal learning spacing paradigm while controlling for retention interval (timing of item review and recall). In Experiment 2, we compared the performance of H.C. to that of controls on a multiday, cued recall, verbal learning spacing paradigm, in which memory was assessed after 1 week. In both experiments, H.C. demonstrated a spacing effect comparable to the effect exhibited by controls. In Experiment 1, her final recall memory for long-lag (spaced) items was better than recall for no-lag (massed) items t(23) = 10.99, p &lt; .001, d = 2.5. In Experiment 2, her final cued recall memory for next-day-reviewed (spaced) items was better than cued recall for same-day-reviewed (massed) items, t(20) = 17.6, p &lt; .001, d = 4.1. This study demonstrates the spacing effect in a person with impaired episodic memory development and is the first to show long-term benefits of spacing in amnesia. Substantially slower learning-to-criterion suggests an alternate mechanism supporting the spacing effect, perhaps independent of the hippocampus. Spacing should be considered as a candidate memory intervention technique given its effectiveness in both short- and long-term learning settings.

This \"conversational synchrony\" enhances social affiliation and rapport. Here, we investigated the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in conversational synchrony. We focused on the vmPFC because this region is strongly implicated in social behaviors related to synchrony, such as empathy. To examine the role of the vmPFC role in conversational synchrony, convergence of total words and words per turn were measured in the discourse of participants with bilateral vmPFC damage, healthy comparison participants (CP), and a brain-damaged comparison group with bilateral hippocampal damage (HPC) as they interacted with an unfamiliar partner. CP and HPC interactions displayed convergence as the interactants' productions of words and words per turn became more similar across the sessions. In striking contrast, vmPFC interactions did not display convergence for either variable. A follow-up experiment revealed the same lack of convergence in the interactions of vmPFC participants with a more familiar conversational partner. Our results suggest that vmPFC is a crucial part of the neurobiological system that supports the ability to synchronize conversational rhythms by dynamically adjusting behavior to the social environment.

A cohort of 198 children born &lt; 30 weeks' gestational age and\/or &lt; 1,250 g and 70 term controls were examined. Neonatal MRI scans at term equivalent age were quantitatively assessed for white matter, cortical gray matter, deep gray matter, and cerebellar abnormalities. Attention and processing speed were assessed at 7 years using standardized neuropsychological tests. Group differences were tested in attention and processing speed, and the relationships between these cognitive domains and brain abnormalities at birth were investigated. At 7 years of age, the VPT\/VLBW group performed significantly poorer than term controls on all attention and processing speed outcomes. Associations between adverse attention and processing speed performances at 7 years and higher neonatal brain abnormality scores were found; in particular, white matter and deep gray matter abnormalities were reasonable predictors of long-term cognitive outcomes. Attention and processing speed are significant areas of concern in VPT\/VLBW children. This is the first study to show that adverse attention and processing speed outcomes at 7 years are associated with neonatal brain pathology. ","707":"We use psychophysical methods to examine the maximum time intervals over which discrete events can be temporally integrated into the percept known as apparent motion. We hypothesized that the maximum time interval would be shorter in participants with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than it would be in a control group. Thirty-five adults with ADHD and 40 adult controls without ADHD participated in an apparent motion task, in which they viewed a stimulus flashing in 2 different locations and were asked to complete the trajectory of motion that they perceived. The stimulus flashes were separated by varied temporal intervals ranging from 200 to 2300 ms. Clear trajectory perception in this task indicates successful temporal integration. At short intervals, we found evidence of clear trajectory perception in both groups, indicated by low variability in path estimations. At the longest intervals, neither group demonstrated path perception, evidenced by high variability in estimations. However, at intermediate intervals (1.7 s), the control group demonstrated path perception while the group with ADHD did not, indicating a difference between the 2 groups in the maximum interval over which apparent motion could be perceived. We suggest that ADHD is generally characterized by a contraction in the time scale governing the rate at which association strength decays. In contrast to theories that postulate general time-processing deficits, this work provides a precise sense in which temporality is disturbed in ADHD. ","708":"To examine whether a one-factor executive function (EF) model fit data for three groups of children differing in birth criteria (extremely low birth weight [ELBW], late preterm [LPT], and Term) at each of two chronological ages, 3 and 6 years, and whether the latent mean amount of EF differed. A retrospective observational cohort study of 1,079 participants; 668 aged 3 years born 2000-2009 (93 ELBW, 398 LPT, and 177 Term) and 411 aged 6 years born 1998-2006 (126 ELBW, 102 LPT, and 183 Term). Latent means analysis was conducted using five indicators for EF: noun fluency, action-verb fluency, similarities reasoning, matrices reasoning, and working memory. A one-factor model had acceptable fit for all groups (RMSEA&lt;.06, CFI &gt;0.95, SRMR &lt;0.08). Statistically significant between-groups differences were found for all comparisons except one; there were no statistically significant differences between LPT-Term at age 6. At age 3, ELBW was 0.98 and 1.70 SD below LPT and Term, respectively; LPT was 0.61 SD below Term. At age 6, ELBW was 0.70 and 0.78 SD below LPT and Term, respectively; LPT was 0.10 SD below Term. Executive deficit identified early in development after preterm birth could represent a transient developmental delay likely to resolve at older age or a more subtle adverse effect likely to persist over the life span. Study at multiple age points should assist in resolving this dilemma, which has important implications for early age neuropsychological screening and intervention. ","709":"Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments are reported by many cancer survivors. Research to date has not provided a clear description of their nature, extent, mechanisms, and duration. To investigate the impairments and factors that could influence their identification and severity, the present meta-analysis brings together research on this topic in adult cancer patients. Our random-model meta-analysis includes 44 studies investigating the cognitive performance of adults treated with chemotherapy for non-central nervous system malignancies, primarily breast and testicular cancer. We conducted several subgroup analyses to identify the level of cognitive impairments in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. We also pursued several multilevel model regressions to investigate the impact of methodological (study quality) and clinical moderators (diagnosis, age, time since treatment) on the observed effect sizes. Cognitive impairments were found in cross-sectional studies in immediate free recall, delayed memory, verbal memory, delayed recognition memory, selective attention, and attention capacity. Surprisingly, prior to chemotherapy, patients performed better than matched controls. In longitudinal studies, patients' performance increased from baseline to follow-up, an effect that was stronger in patients than controls. None of the chosen moderators influenced the magnitude of estimated summary effect sizes. The likelihood to identify impairments rests on the type of design employed, as memory and attention impairments are only detected in cross-sectional studies. We discuss the lack of significant impact of moderators on the effect sizes despite the heterogeneity of results, while providing recommendations toward decreasing the heterogeneity in future studies. ","710":"We describe population-level cognitive development in early middle-age and evaluate whether cardiovascular risk factors for late-onset dementia influence cognitive change in midlife. The sample from the PATH Through Life (PATH) Project (N = 2,530; 40-44 years of age at baseline) was drawn randomly from the community, followed for 8 years, and assessed on cognitive function, health, and lifestyle risk factors at 4 yearly intervals. A summary risk score (PATHrisk) was computed for presence of smoking, hypertension, depression, high body mass index, diabetes, and insufficient physical activity. Decline in processing speed and reaction time (RT) and improvement in memory and verbal ability were observed. Higher PATHrisk score was associated with poorer performance on all cognitive tests, except for RT. Participants with higher PATHrisk scores had greater slowing on choice RT over 8 years. Education was associated with cognitive test performance and was weakly protective against slowing of RT. Individual risk factors, primarily diabetes, smoking, and depression, were associated with cognitive function, and smoking was associated with decline in simple RT. Reliable change in cognitive function was detected in midlife, and decline occurred primarily in measures of cognitive speed. It appears that in midlife, the overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors is more important than individual risk factors. Midlife is a critical period for identifying modifiable risk factors for dementia in late-life, and evaluation of burden of risk factors is indicated for developing strategies to prevent cognitive decline in ageing. ","711":"To compare neuropsychological profiles of adults who had experienced an episode of moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition confined to the first year of life with that of a healthy community comparison group. We assessed neuropsychological functioning in a cohort of Barbadian adults, all of whom had birth weight &gt;2268 g. The previously malnourished group (N = 77, mean age = 38 years, 53% male) had been hospitalized during the first year of life for moderate to severe protein energy malnutrition and subsequently enrolled in a program providing nutrition education, home visits and subsidized foods to 12 years of age. They also had documented, adequate nutrition throughout childhood and complete catch-up in growth by the end of adolescence. The healthy comparison group (N = 59, mean age = 38 years, 54% male) were recruited as children from the same classrooms and neighborhoods. Adjusted for effects of standard of living during childhood and adolescence and current intellectual ability level, there were nutrition group differences on measures of cognitive flexibility and concept formation, as well as initiation, verbal fluency, working memory, processing speed, and visuospatial integration. Behavioral and cognitive regulation were not affected. Postnatal malnutrition confined to the first year of life is associated with neurocognitive compromise persisting into midlife. Early malnutrition may have a specific neuropsychological signature, affecting response initiation to a somewhat greater extent than response inhibition. ","712":"Suboptimal functioning of the basal ganglia is implicated in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These structures are important to the acquisition of associative knowledge, leading some to theorize that associative learning deficits might be expected, despite the fact that most extant research in ADHD has focused on effortful control. We present 2 studies that examined the acquisition of explicit rule-based (RB) and associative information integration (II) category learning among school-age children with ADHD. In Study 1, we found deficits in both RB and II category learning tasks among children with ADHD (n = 81) versus controls (n = 42). Children with ADHD tended to sort by the more salient but irrelevant dimension (in the RB paradigm) and were unable to acquire a consistent sorting strategy (in the II paradigm). To disentangle whether the deficit was localized to II category learning versus a generalized inability to consider more than 1 stimulus dimension, in Study 2 children completed a conjunctive RB paradigm that required consideration of 2 stimulus dimensions. Children with ADHD (n = 50) continued to underperform controls (n = 33). Results provide partial support for neurocognitive developmental theories of ADHD that suggest that associative learning deficits should be found, and highlight the importance of using analytic approaches that go beyond asking whether an ADHD-related deficit exists to why such deficits exist. ","713":"A current neuroanatomical model of anxiety posits that greater structural connectivity between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) facilitates regulatory control over the amygdala and helps reduce anxiety. However, some neuroimaging studies have reported contradictory findings, demonstrating a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and amygdala-vPFC white matter integrity. To help reconcile these findings, we tested the regulatory hypothesis of anxiety circuitry using aging as a model of white matter decline in the amygdala-vPFC pathway. We used probabilistic tractography to trace connections between the amygdala and vPFC in 21 younger, 18 middle-aged, and 15 healthy older adults. The resulting tract estimates were used to extract 3 indices of white-matter integrity: fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). The relationship between these amygdala-vPFC structural connectivity measures and age and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were assessed. The tractography results revealed age-related decline in the FA (p = .005) and radial diffusivity (p = .002) of the amygdala-vPFC pathway. Contrary to the regulatory hypothesis, we found a positive rather than negative association between trait anxiety and right amygdala-vPFC FA (p = .01). These findings argue against the notion that greater amygdala-vPFC structural integrity facilitates better anxiety outcomes in healthy adults. Instead, our results suggest that white matter degeneration in this network relates to lower anxiety in older adults. ","714":"The main purpose of this investigation was to identify patterns of intellectual performance in schizophrenia patients suggesting preserved, deteriorated, and premorbidly impaired ability, and to determine clinical, cognitive, and functional correlates of these patterns. We assessed 101 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 non-psychiatric control participants. The \"preserved\" performance pattern was defined by average-range estimated premorbid and current IQ with no evidence of decline (premorbid-current IQ difference &lt;10 points). The \"deteriorated\" pattern was defined by a difference between estimated premorbid and current IQ estimates of 10 points or more. The premorbidly \"impaired\" pattern was defined by below average estimated premorbid and current IQ and no evidence of decline greater than 10 points. Preserved and deteriorated patterns in healthy controls were also identified and studied in comparison to patient findings. The groups were compared on demographic, neurocognitive, clinical and functionality variables. Patients with the preserved pattern outperformed those meeting criteria for deteriorated and compromised intellectual ability on a composite measure of neurocognitive ability as well as in terms of functional competence. Patients demonstrating the deteriorated and compromised patterns were equivalent across all measures. However, \"preserved\" patients failed to show any advantage in terms of community functioning and demonstrated cognitive impairments relative to control participants. Our results suggest that proposed patterns of intellectual decline and stability exist in both the schizophrenia and general populations, but may not hold true across other cognitive abilities and do not translate into differential functional outcome. ","715":null,"716":"Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) damage has been associated with facial expression recognition deficits in some, but not all, previous studies. The pattern of performance of a group of patients with OFC damage was assessed across a series of facial expression recognition tasks. We aimed to determine whether some tasks were more sensitive at detecting deficits than others. Seven patients with damage to the OFC, 6 control patients with frontal lesions that spared the OFC, and a group of healthy controls completed a series of facial expression recognition tasks including 2 labeling tasks and 2 matching tasks. The OFC patient group demonstrated impaired labeling of negative facial expressions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, and sadness) shown for a short time (500 ms) relative to the comparison groups. When facial expressions were shown for a longer time (5,000 ms), the OFC patient group's performance did not differ significantly from either comparison group. The OFC patient group was impaired when matching subtle, low intensity negative facial expressions, but not when matching high intensity, prototypical facial expressions. The pattern of performance across tasks revealed that only certain facial expression recognition tasks appear to be sufficiently sensitive to detect deficits in patients with OFC damage. These findings have important implications for the assessment of facial expression recognition difficulties in patients with OFC damage and more broadly, for special populations. ","717":"Behavioral achievements are the product of brain maturation. During postnatal development, the medial temporal lobe completes its maturation, and children acquire new memory abilities. In recent years, virtual reality-based tasks have been introduced in the neuropsychology field to assess different cognitive functions. In this work, desktop virtual reality tasks are combined with classic psychometric tests to assess spatial abilities in 4- to 10-year-old children. Fifty boys and 50 girls 4-10-years of age participated in this study. Spatial reference memory and spatial working memory were assessed using a desktop virtual reality-based task. Other classic psychometric tests were also included in this work (e.g., the Corsi Block Tapping Test, digit tests, 10\/36 Spatial Recall Test). In general terms, 4- and 5-year-old groups showed poorer performance than the older groups. However, 5-year-old children showed basic spatial navigation abilities with little difficulty. In addition, boys outperformed girls from the 6-8-year-old groups. Gender differences only emerged in the reference-memory version of the spatial task, whereas both sexes displayed similar performances in the working-memory version. There was general improvement in the performance of different tasks in children older than 5 years. However, results also suggest that brain regions involved in allocentric memory are functional even at the age of 5. In addition, the brain structures underlying reference memory mature later in girls than those required for the working memory. ","718":"The primary aim of this study was to identify cognitive tests that differentiate between persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later develop cognitive decline and those who remain stable. This study used a prospective longitudinal design. One hundred twenty-two older adults with single-domain or multiple-domain amnestic MCI were recruited from memory clinics. They completed tests to measure baseline episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, perception, and language. They were then followed annually to determine with criteria independent from those tests whether they had remained stable or had developed dementia or significant cognitive decline. This was used as the reference standard to measure diagnostic test accuracy value. ANOVAs indicated that participants with progressive MCI showed more impaired performance than those with stable MCI at baseline on episodic memory (word and story recall), the Brown-Peterson working memory test, object naming, object decision, and position of gap test. Logistic regression derived a significant model with 87.8% overall predictive value. The model included delayed text memory, free recall, naming, orientation match, object decision, and alpha span. Its sensitivity was 86.2% and its specificity was 88.9%. Positive predictive value was 83.3%, and negative predictive value was particularly high at 90.9%. Identifying individuals with MCI who will progress to dementia or more severe cognitive impairment is a challenge. This study shows that cognitive measures provide valuable information regarding the predictive diagnosis of persons with MCI. Predictive accuracy of a cognitive battery might be optimized by selecting both memory and nonmemory measures. ","719":"The current study examined competing predictions of the default mode, cognitive neuroenergetic, and functional working memory models of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) regarding the relation between neurocognitive impairments in working memory and intraindividual variability. Twenty-two children with ADHD and 15 typically developing children were assessed on multiple tasks measuring intraindividual reaction time (RT) variability (ex-Gaussian: tau, sigma) and central executive (CE) working memory. Latent factor scores based on multiple, counterbalanced tasks were created for each construct of interest (CE, tau, sigma) to reflect reliable variance associated with each construct and remove task-specific, test-retest, and random error. Bias-corrected, bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that CE working memory accounted for 88% to 100% of ADHD-related RT variability across models, and between-group differences in RT variability were no longer detectable after accounting for the mediating role of CE working memory. In contrast, RT variability accounted for 10% to 29% of between-group differences in CE working memory, and large magnitude CE working memory deficits remained after accounting for this partial mediation. Statistical comparison of effect size estimates across models suggests directionality of effects, such that the mediation effects of CE working memory on RT variability were significantly greater than the mediation effects of RT variability on CE working memory. The current findings question the role of RT variability as a primary neurocognitive indicator in ADHD and suggest that ADHD-related RT variability may be secondary to underlying deficits in CE working memory. ","720":"It has been shown that verbal working and associative memory have different developmental trajectories with working memory, taking a linear course from early childhood to adolescence, whereas associative memory takes a curvilinear course asymptoting at about age 12. This study made a determination of whether these trajectories tracked with 2 magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging (MRSI) variables: phosphocreatine level (PCr) and gray matter percentage (GM%). In a cross-sectional study, 94 children ranging in age from 6-14 years were administered tests of verbal working and associative memory and underwent an MRSI procedure evaluating 6 major brain regions. The study considered PCr levels and GM% in the 6 regions. Loess curves were constructed plotting the memory tests and MRSI variables across age, and trajectories were evaluated. PCr showed a linear increase with age, particularly in the left superior temporal lobe with this increase closely tracking improvement in working memory but not associative memory scores. GM% did not increase with age in any brain region, and there was no tracking with either of the memory tests. Verbal working memory and verbal associative memory have differing age trajectories, with working memory showing close tracking with PCr level, mainly in the left superior temporal lobe. No such tracking was found for the associative memory tests. GM% curves were flat across regions, showing no association with age. ","721":null,"722":"Representational neglect (RN) is a neuropsychological deficit mostly occurring after right brain damage affecting the mental imagery domain. Patients suffering from RN are unable to represent, describe, or explore the contralesional side of their mental images. Since its first description in 1978, RN has been explored using different theoretical frameworks and experimental paradigms. After 35 years, the nature of its behavioral and anatomical correlates is still unclear. We reviewed studies on RN published from 1978-2013 to systematize available knowledge and to shed light on future research directions. The huge variety of tests used to diagnose RN reflects the different clinical features of the deficit, which can compromise space sectors and memory storage, depending on the stimulus to be imagined, even in a dissociated fashion. RN has been frequently described after parietal, temporal, and frontal right brain lesions, even though reliable group studies are scanty. A number of priorities concerning RN were identified. Future studies might take into account several aspects of RN that are still poorly explored, starting from a more systematized investigation of RN using larger group studies. RESULTS might add pieces to the puzzle of spatial cognition and its neural basis in mental imagery, paving the way for tailored motor and cognitive rehabilitation programs. ","723":"Impaired self-awareness is characteristic of nearly all dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the deficit is most severe in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). The prominence of frontal pathology in bvFTD suggests that failure of online monitoring, the process by which individuals monitor their own cognitive processing in real time, is an important contributor. Metacognitive research offers several approaches to measure self-assessment, some more and others less sensitive to online monitoring. The goal of this study was to assess metacognition in bvFTD using several approaches, and to compare the results with those in AD. We examined metacognition in 12 patients with bvFTD, 14 with AD, and 35 healthy controls using feeling of knowing (FOK), ease of learning (EOL), judgment of learning (JOL), and retrospective confidence rating (CR) tasks, as well as response to feedback about performance. BvFTD and AD were both impaired at FOK compared with controls, although AD showed some sparing. Both groups were similarly impaired at CR and neither group was impaired at JOL after accounting for memory performance. Most striking, bvFTD patients failed to appropriately adjust their predictions about future memory performance even after receiving explicit feedback that they had performed worse than they expected. Both bvFTD and AD show deficits in online monitoring, although the deficit appears more severe in bvFTD. The insensitivity of bvFTD patients to overt feedback may point to unique mechanisms, possibly frontally mediated, that add to their severe lack of self-awareness. ","724":"Attention research in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has produced conflicting results. Some findings demonstrate greater distractibility while others suggest superior focused attention. Applying Lavie's load theory of attention to account for this discrepancy led us to hypothesize increased perceptual capacity in ASD. Preliminary support for our hypothesis has so far been found for adults with ASD with reaction time (RT) and signal detection sensitivity measures. Here we test the novel prediction we derived from this hypothesis that children with ASD should have lower rates of inattentional blindness than controls. Twenty-four children with ASD (mean age = 10 years 10 months) and 39 typically developing children (age and IQ matched) took part in the study. We assessed the effects of perceptual load on the rates of inattentional blindness in each group. Participants performing a line discrimination task in either a high load or low load condition were presented with an unexpected extra stimulus on a critical trial. Performance on the line judgment task and rates of detection and stimulus identification were recorded. Overall rates of detection and identification were higher in the ASD group than in the controls. Moreover, whereas both detection and identification rates were significantly lower in the high (compared with low) load conditions for the controls, these were unaffected by load in the ASD group. Reduced inattentional blindness rates under load in ASD suggests higher perceptual capacity is a core feature, present from childhood and leading to superior performance in various measures of perception and attention. ","725":"Although it is well known that Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia results in functional decline, little is known about the impact of mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) on day-to-day functioning. Forty-one individuals with PD-MCI, 56 PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), and 47 healthy older adults were administered two performance-based measures of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) that evaluated medication and financial management. Informants of the PD patients were also administered an IADL questionnaire. There were no significant differences between PD-NC and healthy older adults on the performance-based measures of medication and financial management. However, PD-MCI patients demonstrated significantly lower scores on the performance-based measures of medication and financial management compared with healthy older adults. PD-MCI patients were also impaired compared with PD-NC patients on performance-based medication management, but no difference between these groups was observed for ability to manage finances. Performance-based financial and medication management did not correlate with scores on neuropsychological measures in PD-MCI patients. PD-MCI and PD-NC patients showed comparable scores on the informant-based IADL questionnaire. Performance-based measures of IADLs, particularly medication management ability, are sensitive to subtle functional declines in PD-MCI. Although impairment in performance-based measures is associated with cognitive status in PD, IADLs may be a separate domain of functioning from cognitive functioning in PD-MCI as these measures did not correlate with performance on the neuropsychological measures. Overall, performance-based assessment of IADLs may add to the clinical evaluation of PD-MCI. ","726":"This study aims to evaluate whether assessing memory using the visual recognition memory task DMS48 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) can contribute to the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In an 18-month follow-up study, we assessed if longitudinal change in aMCI patients who failed on the DMS48 differs from that of patients who succeeded on this task at baseline. Twenty-six controls and 33 aMCI patients underwent a complete neuropsychological assessment at baseline and at an 18-month follow-up. Patients were divided into two subgroups, according to their z score on the DMS48 (DMS48+ subgroup succeeding; DMS48- subgroup failing on the task). In order to detect sensitive longitudinal change over time, we calculated and compared the standardized response mean (SRM) of performance on neuropsychological tasks in the three groups. We found significant differences for the mean SRM of all neuropsychological tests when comparing DMS48+ vs. controls vs. DMS48-, which was greatest for the comparison between the DMS48- and the DMS48+ subgroup. Although cognitive profiles of the two patient subgroups at baseline did not differ in cognitive domains other than memory, we found a consistent decline on all neuropsychological tasks in the DMS48- subgroup compared with the DMS48+ subgroup, except for performance on a verbal fluency test. As the cognitive profile of the DMS48- subgroup at follow-up resembles the typical pattern of AD described in the literature, this study confirms that visual recognition memory tasks may be useful to anticipate covert cognitive decline in aMCI patients. ","727":"The advent of functional MRI (fMRI) enables the identification of brain regions recruited for specific behavioral tasks. Most fMRI studies focus on group effects in single tasks, which limits applicability where assessment of individual differences and multiple brain systems is needed. We demonstrate the feasibility of concurrently measuring fMRI activation patterns and performance on a computerized neurocognitive battery (CNB) in 212 healthy individuals at 2 sites. Cross-validated sparse regression of regional brain amplitude and extent of activation were used to predict concurrent performance on 6 neurocognitive tasks: abstraction\/mental flexibility, attention, emotion processing, and verbal, face, and spatial memory. Brain activation was task responsive and domain specific, as reported in previous single-task studies. Prediction of performance was robust for most tasks, particularly for abstraction\/mental flexibility and visuospatial memory. The feasibility of administering a comprehensive neuropsychological battery in the scanner was established, and task-specific brain activation patterns improved prediction beyond demographic information. This benchmark index of performance-associated brain activation can be applied to link brain activation with neurocognitive performance during standardized testing. This first step in standardizing a neurocognitive battery for use in fMRI may enable quantitative assessment of patients with brain disorders across multiple cognitive domains. Such data may facilitate identification of neural dysfunction associated with poor performance, allow for identification of individuals at risk for brain disorders, and help guide early intervention and rehabilitation of neurocognitive deficits. ","728":"Maturation of executive functioning (EF) is topical, especially in relation to adolescence, yet longitudinal research covering early and late adolescence is lacking. This, however, is a prerequisite for drawing conclusions on normal cognitive development, and understanding deviant maturation. The aim of this study is to longitudinally investigate 6 subcomponents of EF in early (mean age 11) and late adolescence (mean age 19) and to investigate the influence of sex and socioeconomic status (SES). We used data of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). A number of 2,217 participants carried out tasks of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT), measuring Focused Attention, Inhibition, Sustained Attention, Speed of Processing, Working Memory, and Shift Attention. Linear growth model with individual varying times of observation showed significant slopes for all 6 measures. Sex differences were found for the majority of the measures, where boys showed more maturation. Maturation was influenced by SES for Sustained Attention and Inhibition. Results show that significant maturation takes place for all the measured subcomponents over adolescence. Overall, girls show better baseline performance and smaller maturational rates, suggesting more mature skills in early adolescence. Maturation is only influenced by SES for Sustained Attention and Inhibition. Findings underline that for making statements about EF maturation in adolescence, it is essential to look at subcomponents. Furthermore, sex differences are an important factor when investing (ab)normal maturation of EF. ","729":"Compromised postnatal growth is an important risk factor accounting for poorer neuropsychological performance of preterm children during the preschool years, yet its unique contribution to explaining outcome variance within this high risk group has yet to be determined. Therefore, we examined within a large preterm sample (1) the relationships between head growth, measured either at birth or preschool age, and outcome; (2) the relationships of binary versus dimensional head growth measures and performance; and (3) the unique contribution of preschool-age head growth, after adjustment for general physical development (indexed by stature), to variance in neuropsychological functioning. We evaluated 264 preterm (&lt;36 weeks) preschoolers, without severe handicaps, using cognitive, language, and motor skill measures. Multiple regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and pre-, peri-, and postnatal confounds, were used to study associations between growth indices and performance. While suboptimal head growth classification at birth was significantly associated only with motor performance, suboptimal head growth at preschool age explained a significant portion of variance in intellectual and language measures (g = .46 to .60). Treating preschool head size as a continuous dimension yielded null results, however, with body-height explaining a significant portion of the variance across several domains. Among postnatal anthropometric indices, preschool stature, rather than head circumference, remains a consistent correlate of preschool outcome in preterm children, highlighting the contribution of general physical development to neuropsychological performance. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms likely involves exploration of complex relationships between postnatal nutrition, growth hormone levels, body and brain development, and neuropsychological functioning.

However, it is not known whether retrieving names for famous melodies is associated with the LTP. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that damage to the LTP would be associated with impaired naming of famous musical melodies. A Melody Naming Test was administered to patients with LTP damage, brain damaged comparison (BDC) patients, and normal comparison participants (NC). The test included various well-known melodies (e.g., \"Pop Goes the Weasel\"). After hearing each melody, participants were asked to rate their familiarity with the melody and identify it by name. LTP patients named significantly fewer melodies than BDC and NC participants. Recognition of melodies did not differ significantly between groups. The findings suggest that LTP supports retrieval of names for famous melodies. More broadly, these results extend support for the theoretical notion that LTP is important for retrieving proper names for unique concepts, irrespectively of stimulus modality or category. ","732":"Harm avoidance, a trait indicative of behavioral inhibition, is associated with disability and dementia in old age, but the basis of these associations is uncertain. We test the hypothesis that higher level of harm avoidance is associated with increased likelihood of cerebral infarction. Older persons without dementia completed a standard measure of harm avoidance. During a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up, 257 (of 1,082) individuals died of whom 206 (80%) underwent brain autopsy. The number of chronic cerebral infarcts (microscopic plus gross; expressed as 0, 1, or &gt;1) was assessed on neuropathologic examination, completed in 192 individuals at the time of analyses. On postmortem examination, chronic cerebral infarcts were found in 89 (42 with 1, 47 with &gt;1). Higher harm avoidance was associated with higher likelihood of infarcts (odds ratio = 1.083, 95% confidence interval = 1.040-1.128). A moderately high level of the trait (score = 17, 75th percentile) was associated with a 2.4-fold increase in the likelihood of infarction compared with a moderately low level of the trait (score = 6, 25th percentile). These associations persisted in models that controlled for other cardiovascular risk factors. Higher level of the harm avoidance trait may be a risk factor for cerebral infarction. ","733":"Our aim was to compare attentional control abilities in healthy older subjects and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subtypes. We also analyzed group differences in dynamic changes in performance across the entire reaction time (RT) distribution. Thirty-one multiple domain (mda-MCI), 31 single domain (sda-MCI), and 41 healthy control adults (HC) participated in the study. Participants performed a spatial stimulus-response consistency task in which relevant and irrelevant stimulus dimensions overlapped in the spatial response dimension. We analyzed reaction times (RTs), number of errors (NEs), and omitted responses (ORs), and implemented statistical procedures to neutralize age and processing speed effects. There were no significant RT group differences across consistency conditions. Accuracy (NE) was lower in the mda-MCI group than in HC for inconsistent trials. Distributional analysis revealed increased RT-Simon effect in longer RTs and increased NE-Simon effect in the faster quintiles in a similar way for all groups. NE-Simon effect was greater in the mda-MCI group than in the other groups in the faster quintiles. All groups displayed difficulty in suppression of automatic response pathway and in enacting the deliberate pathway to intentionally control the responses. The greater impairment in the mda-MCI group relative to the other groups is basically quantitative in nature and involves stronger activation of the pathway of automatic response. ","734":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between subjective and objective assessments of memory and attention in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), using tests that have previously detected deficits in CFS samples and measures of potential confounds. Fifty people with CFS and 50 healthy controls were compared on subjective (memory and attention symptom severity, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, Everyday Attention Questionnaires) and objective (California Verbal Learning Test, Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, Stroop task) measures of memory and attention. Fatigue, sleep, depression, and anxiety were also assessed. The CFS group reported experiencing more cognitive problems than the controls, but the two groups did not differ on the cognitive tests. Scores on the subjective and objective measures were not correlated in either group. Depression was positively correlated with increased severity of cognitive problems in both the CFS and control groups. There is little evidence for a relationship between subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning for both people with CFS and healthy controls, which suggests that they may be capturing different constructs. Problems with memory and attention in everyday life are a significant part of CFS. Depression appears to be related to subjective problems but does not fully explain them. ","735":null,"736":"Deficits in multiple aspects of attention are a hallmark of the cognitive impairments found with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). Given, however, that some attention components are hierarchically organized, it is possible that sustained attention, flexibility, and resistance to interference deficits observed in NF1 may be because of weakened lower order attention components. This study investigated the state of these low-level components in NF1. Twenty participants with NF1 (ages 7-13) and 20 matched controls participated in a visual task. They were required to locate a target as quickly and as accurately as possible and to ignore a potential distractor that could appear either before, at the same time, or after the target. Response times (RTs) were collected, and indices of alerting (i.e., reactivity to warning signals), distraction, and interruption (i.e., reactivity to signals appearing during attentive processing) were computed. The amplitude of the indices differed between the groups, F(2, 76) = 3.1, p &lt; .05. No difference was found with alerting (p &gt; .85) or distraction (p &gt; .84), but the interruption index was higher in the NF1 group than the controls (p &lt; .043). Elementary components on which more complex attention processes are based are not all ok in NF1. It is suggested that overreactivity to and longer inspection of visual signals occurring outside the current focus of attention characterizes NF1 and that this might be partially responsible for focus of attention instability and lower interference resistance in NF1. ","737":"To investigate the relationships between executive dysfunction, awareness deficits and perceptions of quality of life (QOL) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). We tested neuropsychological function with simultaneous measurement of awareness performance in 125 participants. Forty-five were carefully phenotyped patients with SVD, defined as a lacunar stroke with corresponding infarct on neuroimaging; and 80 were age-matched controls, providing a normal comparison for neuropsychological measures. Patients also completed the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale. In patients with SVD, the impact of executive dysfunction on awareness and QOL was examined simultaneously using structural equation modeling. A simple regression indicated a positive relationship between awareness and QOL. However, when executive function was added to the model, the results showed strong relationships between executive function and awareness, and executive function and QOL, but no direct relationship between awareness and QOL. Our results show that the main neuropsychological symptom associated with SVD, namely, executive dysfunction, may predict both reductions in awareness and QOL. However, there is no direct impact of awareness deficits on QOL in patients with SVD, when executive function is included in the model. ","738":"The present study examined verbal irony comprehension in 31 aMCI and 33 healthy control (HC) subjects. Although nonliteral language impairments have been evidenced in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD), verbal irony comprehension remained somewhat underinvestigated in these populations. A task measured the capacity to attribute Second-order mental state (i.e., theory of mind; ToM) as well as the ability to distinguish an ironic statement from a lie. Subjects were asked to identify, in a short story, whether the final assertion was a lie or an ironic joke. Our results showed lower performance on a verbal irony comprehension task for aMCI individuals compared with those in the HC group. This pattern of results was related to Second-order ToM and executive functions. These findings have implications for the conceptualization of aMCI, and foster investigation of social language comprehension in neurodegenerative diseases such as prodromal AD. Results are discussed in light of actual linguistic theories. The importance of evaluating the role of underlying cognitive processes in verbal irony comprehension is also emphasized. ","739":"Long-term memory functioning in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is marked by a characteristic pattern of impairments and strengths. Individuals with ASD show impairment in memory tasks that require the processing of relational and contextual information, but spared performance on tasks requiring more item-based, acontextual processing. Two experiments investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying this memory profile. A sample of 14 children with a diagnosis of high-functioning ASD (age: M = 12.2 years), and a matched control group of 14 typically developing (TD) children (age: M = 12.1 years), participated in a range of behavioral memory tasks in which we measured both relational and item-based memory abilities. They also completed a battery of executive function measures. The ASD group showed specific deficits in relational memory, but spared or superior performance in item-based memory, across all tasks. Importantly, for ASD children, executive ability was significantly correlated with relational memory but not with item-based memory. No such relationship was present in the control group. This suggests that children with ASD atypically employed effortful, executive strategies to retrieve relational (but not item-specific) information, whereas TD children appeared to use more automatic processes. The relational memory impairment in ASD may result from a specific impairment in automatic associative retrieval processes with an increased reliance on effortful and strategic retrieval processes. Our findings allow specific neural predictions to be made regarding the interactive functioning of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex in ASD as a neural network supporting relational memory processing. ","740":"To examine neuropsychological outcomes in veterans of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF\/OIF) with self-reported histories of blast exposure and determine the contribution of deployment-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression to performance. The effect of number of blast exposures and distance from the blast was also assessed. OEF\/OIF veterans who reported exposure to blast underwent structured interviews and were assigned to no-TBI (n = 39), mTBI without loss of consciousness (LOC; n = 53), or mTBI with LOC (n = 35) groups. They were administered tests of executive function, memory, and motor function at least 6 months after the index event. Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ as a function of mTBI group. Blast load and distance from the blast also did not affect neuropsychological performance. Both PTSD and depression symptoms were significantly associated with neuropsychological outcomes. A history of mTBI with or without LOC during deployment does not contribute to objective cognitive impairment in the chronic phase post injury. In contrast, PTSD and depression symptoms are associated with cognitive performance decrements. This finding is thought to reflect at least in part the impact of psychiatric distress on neuropsychological performance. ","741":"Children with temporal lobe epilepsy are at risk for deficits in new learning (episodic memory) and literacy skills. Semantic memory deficits and double dissociations between episodic and semantic memory have recently been found in this patient population. In the current study we investigate whether impairments of these 2 distinct memory systems relate to literacy skills. 57 children with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy completed tests of verbal memory (episodic and semantic) and literacy skills (reading and spelling accuracy, and reading comprehension). For the entire group, semantic memory explained over 30% of variance in each of the literacy domains. Episodic memory explained a significant, but rather small proportion (&lt; 10%) of variance in reading and spelling accuracy, but not in reading comprehension. Moreover, when children with opposite patterns of specific memory impairments (intact semantic\/impaired episodic, intact episodic\/impaired semantic) were compared, significant reductions in literacy skills were evident only in children with semantic memory impairments, but not in children with episodic memory impairments relative to the norms and to children with temporal lobe epilepsy who had intact memory. Our study provides the first evidence for differential relations between episodic and semantic memory impairments and literacy skills in children with temporal lobe epilepsy. As such, it highlights the urgent need to consider semantic memory deficits in management of children with temporal lobe epilepsy and undertake further research into the nature of reading difficulties of children with semantic memory impairments. ","742":"Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have resulted in more frequent detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Regardless of the method employed, most interventions to treat lesions have low morbidity and mortality rates. Recently, some studies have suggested that changes in cognitive status are one complication of microsurgical treatments. However, no study to date has performed any behavioral analysis. Moreover, cognitive assessment beyond 12 months after surgical intervention is missing. The current study sought to evaluate the long-term impact of clipping on the behavioral and cognitive functions of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. A within-subjects prospective clinical trial was performed to evaluate 40 patients who underwent microsurgical clipping for incidental unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The participants underwent a full neuropsychological evaluation during the preoperative period, at 3 months after surgery and at 3 years after surgery. Paired Student's t tests and an ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test, were used to examine group differences. The cognitive and behavioral test performance of the patients did not deteriorate during either the short or the long term following intervention. Moreover, the patients' clinical and demographic characteristics did not predict behavioral or cognitive changes, and neither the surgical approach nor the topography, multiplicity, or size of the aneurysms affected the results. In either the short or the long term following clipping for patients with incidental unruptured intracranial aneurysms, behavioral and cognitive functions had no significant change from baseline. The intervention demonstrated high efficacy and was associated with a low morbidity rate.

Anecdotally within clinical practice, verbal learning and memory performance frequently appears differentially reduced versus visual learning and memory scores. We sought to empirically investigate the robustness of a verbal versus visual learning and memory discrepancy and to explore potential mechanisms for a verbal\/visual performance split. Participants consisted of 103 veterans with reported history of mild traumatic brain injuries returning home from U.S. military Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom referred for outpatient neuropsychological evaluation. Findings indicate that visual learning and memory abilities were largely intact while verbal learning and memory performance was significantly reduced in comparison, residing at approximately 1.1 SD below the mean for verbal learning and approximately 1.4 SD below the mean for verbal memory. This difference was not observed in verbal versus visual fluency performance, nor was it associated with estimated premorbid verbal abilities or traumatic brain injury history. In our sample, symptoms of depression, but not posttraumatic stress disorder, were significantly associated with reduced composite verbal learning and memory performance. Verbal learning and memory performance may benefit from targeted treatment of depressive symptomatology. Also, because visual learning and memory functions may remain intact, these might be emphasized when applying neurocognitive rehabilitation interventions to compensate for observed verbal learning and memory difficulties. ","744":"Previous articles have reported that bilingualism is associated with a substantial delay in the onset of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The present study reports results from 74 MCI patients and 75 AD patients; approximately half of the patients in each group were bilingual. All patients were interviewed to obtain details of their language use, onset of their condition, and lifestyle habits. Patients performed three executive function (EF) tests from the D-KEFS battery (Trails, Color-Word Interference, Verbal Fluency) on 3 occasions over a period of approximately 1 year. Results replicated the finding that bilingual patients are several years older than comparable monolinguals at both age of symptom onset and date of first clinic visit. This result could not be attributed to language group differences in such lifestyle variables as diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, or social activity. On the first testing occasion, performance on the EF tasks was generally comparable between the language groups, contesting arguments that bilinguals wait longer before attending the clinic. Finally, EF performance tended to decline over the 3 sessions, but no differences were found between monolinguals and bilinguals in the rate of decline.","745":"Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember to perform actions in the future. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders show impairments in PM but neural correlates of these impairments remain unclear. The present study aimed to examine brain activation during PM to identify impairments in individuals with schizotypal personality features. Nineteen participants with schizotypal features and 22 healthy controls participated in a functional MRI experiment while performing a PM task. Results showed that the prefrontal cortex (including Brodmann Area [BA] 10), middle temporal gyrus, and precuneus were activated when performing the PM task compared with baseline. The schizotypal and control groups did not differ in behavioral PM performance. However, participants with schizotypal features showed decreased activations in the inferior and medial frontal lobes (BA 45, and 8). These results confirmed that the PM network involves prefrontal cortex, including BA 10. The lower activation in prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizotypal features when performing a PM task indicates brain activation abnormality. Notably, this abnormality may occur in the absence of any behavioral manifestation. Our findings support the hypothesis of frontal lobe involvement in PM deficits observed in individuals with schizotypal features. ","746":"This study investigated the effect of verbal prompting on elders' 10-year longitudinal change in everyday cognition. Differential effects of prompting associated with impaired cognitive status were also examined. At baseline, 2,802 participants (mean age = 73.6 years, mean education = 13.5 years) from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly trial were classified as unimpaired, having amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or nonamnestic MCI, based on psychometric algorithm. Participants were given the Observed Tasks of Daily Living (OTDL; a behavioral measure with tasks involving medication management\/finances\/telephone use) at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year follow-ups. When participants said \"I don't know\" or did not respond to an item, they received a standardized verbal prompt. At each occasion, unprompted (sum of items correct without prompting) and prompted (sum of items correct including both prompted and unprompted) scores were derived for each participant. Multilevel modeling, adjusting for demographics\/health\/training group, was used to determine the trajectories of OTDL performance. Persons with MCI performed at lower levels than those who were unimpaired (amnestic &lt; nonamnestic &lt; unimpaired), and for all groups, prompted performance exceeded unprompted in all years. There was differential performance of the prompting conditions over time; prompted performance, unlike unprompted, was relatively protected from age-related decline, and persons with MCI experienced greater improvement due to prompting. Very simple prompting appears to enhance and maintain performance on a task of everyday cognition over 10 years for both unimpaired and mildly impaired older adults. ","747":"Cocaine dependence often co-occurs with personality disorders from Clusters B and C, which are inherently associated with some of the executive dysfunctions found in addiction. We address the question of whether the comorbidity between cocaine dependence and different types of personality disorders is associated with differential profiles of executive deficits compatible with their personality dysfunction. We predicted that the comorbidity with Cluster B disorders would be associated with inhibition and shifting deficits, whereas the comorbidity with Cluster C disorders would be associated with working memory deficits. We tested 107 participants (22 cocaine users with Cluster B disorders, 15 cocaine users with Cluster C disorders, 36 cocaine users without comorbidities, and 34 controls) using tests of working memory, attention, inhibition, and shifting. Groups were statistically matched on IQ and had no Axis I comorbidities (other than substance-related). Based on the performance of the control group, we obtained z-score composite measures of working memory, attention\/inhibition, shifting, and global executive impairment. We tested group differences in these composite measures using univariate analyses of variance and Sidak tests corrected for multiple comparisons. Cocaine users with Cluster B disorders had poorer attention\/inhibition, whereas cocaine users with comorbid Cluster C disorders had poorer working memory. Cluster B and noncomorbid cocaine users (but not Cluster C users) differed from controls on the global executive impairment measure. The comorbidity between cocaine dependence and personality disorders from Clusters B and C is associated with executive function deficits that are compatible with their respective personality dysfunctions. ","748":"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, has become a growing public health concern, prevalent in both athletic and military settings. Many researchers have examined post-mTBI neuropsychological outcomes, leading to multiple meta-analyses amalgamating individual study results. Considering the plethora of meta-analytic findings, the next logical step stands as a systematic review of meta-analyses, effectively reporting key moderators that predict post-mTBI neuropsychological outcomes. A systematic review of reviews yielded 11 meta-analyses meeting inclusion criteria (i.e., English-language systematic reviews\/meta-analyses covering post-mTBI observational cognitive research on late adolescents\/adults), with their findings qualitatively synthesized based on moderator variables (i.e., cognitive domain, time since injury, past head injury, participant characteristics, comparison group, assessment technique, and persistent symptoms). The overall effect sizes ranged for both general (range: .07-.61) and sports-related mTBI (range: .40-.81) and differed both between and within cognitive domains, with executive functions appearing most sensitive to multiple mTBI. Cognitive domains varied in recovery rates, but overall recovery occurred by 90 days postinjury for most individuals and by 7 days postinjury for athletes. Greater age\/education and male gender produced smaller effects sizes, and high school athletes suffered the largest deficits post-mTBI. Control-group comparisons yielded larger effects than within-person designs, and assessment techniques had limited moderating effects. Overall, meta-analytic review quality remained low with few studies assessing publication or study quality bias. Meta-analyses consistently identified adverse acute mTBI-related effects and fairly rapid symptom resolution. Future meta-analyses should better operationally define cognitive constructs to produce more consistent effect estimates across domains.

Given that spatial cognition includes a wide range of cooperating abilities, we deemed that M.S.'s spatial disorientation could be ascribed to specific alterations within this multicomponent system where landmarks and spatial frames of reference contribute to organize information for different purposes. M.S. and 12 healthy elderly people (NCs) were submitted to an extensive neuropsychological assessment and to 2 ad hoc spatial tasks: (a) Object-Location Memory Task (what, where, and their binding); and (b) spatial memory task combining categorical (nonmetric)\/coordinate (metric) relations with egocentric\/allocentric frames of reference (in verbal and visuomotor conditions). M.S.'s performance was compared with that of NCs by means of a modified t test to small control sample size. M.S. met difficulty in positional processing and binding but not in object recognition. M.S. showed a selective deficit in the coordinate component in verbal (combined with both egocentric and allocentric frames) and visuomotor (only with the egocentric frame) spatial judgment tasks. In contrast, the categorical component looked always preserved in both frames of reference. The left posteromedial brain areas contribute in combining and translating metric relations according to frames of reference and in using these representations to guide actions according to an egocentric perspective. ","751":"The NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NTCB) was designed to provide a brief, efficient computerized test of key neuropsychological functions appropriate for use in children as young as 3 years of age. This report describes the performance of a large group of typically developing children and adolescents and examines the impact of age and sociocultural variables on test performance. The NTCB was administered to a sample of 1,020 typically developing males and females ranging in age from 3 to 20 years, diverse in terms of socioeconomic status (SES) and race\/ethnicity, as part of the new publicly accessible Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) data resource, at 9 sites across the United States. General additive models of nonlinear age-functions were estimated from age-differences in test performance on the 8 NTCB subtests while controlling for family SES and genetic ancestry factors (GAFs). Age accounted for the majority of the variance across all NTCB scores, with additional significant contributions of gender on some measures, and of SES and race\/ethnicity (GAFs) on all. After adjusting for age and gender, SES and GAFs explained a substantial proportion of the remaining unexplained variance in Picture Vocabulary scores. The results highlight the sensitivity to developmental effects and efficiency of this new computerized assessment battery for neurodevelopmental research. Limitations are observed in the form of some ceiling effects in older children, some floor effects, particularly on executive function tests in the youngest participants, and evidence for variable measurement sensitivity to cultural\/socioeconomic factors. ","752":null,"753":"The purpose was to describe clinical, cognitive, and personality characteristics at baseline assessment of 249 participants, 19 to 60 years of age, in a multinational longitudinal study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Participants (74% cognitively normal) were from ADAD families with mutations in 1 of 3 genes (APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2). Mixed model analyses, including family as a random variable and controlling for years from expected time of symptomatic onset of ADAD based on parental age at onset, compared 3 groups (cognitively normal mutation noncarriers, cognitively normal mutation carriers, very mildly impaired mutation carriers). Global cognitive deficits similar to those observed in late-life sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) existed in very mild ADAD compared with cognitively normal carriers and noncarriers on all but 2 measures (Digit Span Backward, Letter Fluency for FAS) of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, attention, and speeded visuospatial abilities. Demented individuals were less extraverted, open, and conscientious than cognitively normal participants on the International Personality Item Pool. Differences in the relation between 3 measures (Logical Memory, Digit Symbol, attention switching) and time to expected age at symptomatic onset indicate that cognitive deficits on some measures can be detected in mutation carriers prior to symptomatic AD, and hence should be useful markers in subsequent longitudinal follow-up. Overall cognitive and personality deficits in very mild ADAD are similar to those seen in sporadic AD. Cognitive deficits also occur in asymptomatic mutation carriers who are closer to the expected time of dementia onset. ","754":"Developmental Topographical Disorientation (DTD) is a selective difficulty in way-finding showed by individuals with normal intellectual ability. We aimed to clarify whether getting lost even in familiar contexts could be because of a variety of developmental deficits that may affect the acquisition of one or more navigational competencies. Two DTD individuals were submitted to neuropsychological assessment and MRI exam, to verify the absence of further cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities; navigational and visuospatial tasks, and Radial Arm Maze (RAM) paradigms to assess spatial competencies; and switching paradigms to assess backward inhibition processes in spatial- and no-spatial contexts. DTD performances were compared with those of controls matched for gender, age, and education. DTD participants were not able to retrace a previously showed route, but they could recognize previously seen landmarks. They performed RAM paradigms without significant differences from controls and adopted complex navigational strategies as the cognitive mapping. It is interesting that DTD participants exhibited a peculiar alteration of Backward Inhibition, a mechanism that allows flexibly adapting to continuously changing environments. These findings demonstrate that getting lost for DTD participants did not imply the lack of basic navigational strategies and was not related to visuospatial or spatial memory deficits. We discuss the hypothesis that Backward Inhibition might play a role in updating environment representation during navigation. ","755":"Closing-in (CI) in visuo-constructional tasks occurs when a drawing is reproduced close to or superimposed on the original model. CI has been often observed in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and only rarely investigated in patients with vascular dementia (VD). Recent studies suggested that CI in AD patients represents a default behavior released by frontal-executive impairments, but the cognitive mechanisms behind this phenomenon in VD patients have not been clarified. We aimed to ascertain whether the same mechanisms could determine CI in VD and in AD patients. For this purpose we explored whether CI is related to frontal-executive or visuospatial impairments in a prospective sample of AD and VD patients, and investigated whether CI can be induced by a secondary task in patients with either disease. Sixty-three VD patients and 70 AD patients underwent a neuropsychological assessment of frontal-executive and visuospatial skills, and a copying drawings task for CI. Moreover, VD and AD patients without CI also performed a drawing copying task combined with a simple or a demanding verbal task. In both VD and AD patients CI was related to frontal-executive impairments, with more severe forms of CI related to greater frontal-executive defects. In AD patients the tendency to deviate toward a salient model was significantly enhanced by reduction of cognitive resources, whereas VD could compensate for this tendency. CI is related to the tendency to deviate toward a salient model and can be released by frontal-executive impairments in demented patients, independently from clinical diagnosis. ","756":"Everyday decision making requires integration of a broad range of information from a variety of sources, including cognitive and emotional processes. For individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), everyday decision making can be difficult. The mechanisms that underlie decision making in young people diagnosed with ASD have not been fully explored. We studied children and young adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n = 48) compared with an age- and ability-matched typical control group (CON; n = 54). We evaluated performance and psycho-physiological responsivity during the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), an affective decision-making task. ASD participants were superior to control participants on overall performance (p &lt; .05), especially because of significantly better learning in later stages of the task. While both groups showed robust and equal psycho-physiological arousal to disadvantageous decks, the groups differed in their choice of card type, with the CON group choosing more often from the frequent-gain disadvantageous deck, despite occasional large losses; while the ASD group chose prominently from the advantageous decks. A decision-making style characterized by a drive to avoid potential loss rather than to seek possible reward may help decision making for ASD in some situations, but ultimately hinder functioning in relation to prosocial engagement and other complex situations where gain rather than punishment is the most effective motivating factor. ","757":null,"758":null,"759":"Impaired adherence to medication regimens is a serious concern for individuals with schizophrenia linked to relapse and poorer outcomes. One possible reason for poor adherence to medication is poor ability to remember future intentions, labeled prospective memory skills. It has been demonstrated in several studies that individuals with schizophrenia have impairments in prospective memory that are linked to everyday life skills. However, there have been no studies, to our knowledge, examining the relationship of a clinical measure of prospective memory to medication management skills, a key element of successful adherence. In this Study 41 individuals with schizophrenia and 25 healthy adults were administered a standardized test battery that included measures of prospective memory, medication management skills, neurocognition, and symptoms. Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated impairments in prospective memory (both time and event-based) relative to healthy controls. Performance on the test of prospective memory was correlated with the standardized measure of medication management in individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, the test of prospective memory predicted skills in medication adherence even after measures of neurocognition were accounted for. This suggests that prospective memory may play a key role in medication management skills and thus should be a target of cognitive remediation programs. ","760":"In the last decade the interest in the role of the visual system in schizophrenia has grown, with evidence pointing to dysfunction in bottom-up visual processing that leads to early visual processing deficits. A fundamental component of visual perception is binocular depth perception (BDP), that is, depth perception derived by the difference between the images impressed upon the left and right retina. Two studies reported impaired BDP in schizophrenia and suggested a possible developmental deficit of brain structures involved in early visual processing. The aim of this study was to examine BDP in a young population at clinical high risk (CHR) of developing psychosis to determine whether this dysfunction is present in this potentially prepsychotic period. Forty-two CHR participants and 44 healthy controls were assessed using a computerized test of depth perception; a subsample completed a test of stereopsis. The computerized test comprised two trial blocks, with four conditions at increasing level of difficulty, in which participants were asked to discriminate the relative depth of two stimuli simultaneously presented on the screen. BDP was not impaired in the CHR group, whose performance was similar to that of the control group on both measures. For the CHR group performance in both tests was not correlated to positive symptoms. These results indicate that BDP is preserved in individuals at CHR for psychosis, and impaired BDP should not be considered a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. Nevertheless future studies should verify BDP's potential power in predicting schizophrenia. ","761":"Patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) often develop synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease [PD], in particular). Cognitive disorders affecting different domains have been reported in patients with iRBD. Dysexecutive disorders seem to predominate, but there is no consensus on the nature of visuospatial disorders in iRBD. The objective is to identify and characterize visuospatial disorders in patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD - either idiopathic or associated with PD). Fifteen patients with iRBD, 30 patients with PD (15 of whom had RBD), and 20 healthy control subjects underwent an extensive assessment of visuospatial functions. Two computerized tasks were used: a Biederman task (to assess the 3 levels of visuoperceptive processing) and a Posner paradigm (to assess visual attention). The visual priming effects classically described for the Biederman task in healthy controls were not found in iRBD patients. Patients with iRBD were no quicker in naming objects with the same general structure as previously presented objects but did have a normal priming effect for strictly identical objects. Parkinson's disease patients with RBD had poorer visuoperceptive performance levels than PD patients without RBD. There were no significant differences between the 4 groups in the Posner attentional task. First, this study confirms the presence of visuoperceptive dysfunction in iRBD patients and revealed a selective defect in intermediate visuoperceptive processing (i.e., general object representation). Second, RBD in PD appeared to be associated with poorer visuoperceptive abilities. Third, this visuoperceptive dysfunction in RBD patients was not associated with impaired attention. ","762":"Hypoxic brain damage is characterized by widespread, diffuse-disseminated brain lesions, which may cause severe disturbances in binocular vision, leading to diplopia and loss of stereopsis, for which no evaluated treatment is currently available. The study evaluated the effects of a novel binocular vision treatment designed to improve binocular fusion and stereopsis as well as to reduce diplopia in patients with cerebral hypoxia. Four patients with severely reduced convergent fusion, stereopsis, and reading duration due to hypoxic brain damage were treated in a single-subject baseline design, with three baseline assessments before treatment to control for spontaneous recovery (pretherapy), an assessment immediately after a treatment period of 6 weeks (posttherapy), and two follow-up tests 3 and 6 months after treatment to assess stability of improvements. Patients received a novel fusion and dichoptic training using 3 different devices designed to slowly increase fusional and disparity angle. After the treatment, all 4 patients improved significantly in binocular fusion, subjective reading duration until diplopia emerged, and 2 of 4 patients improved significantly in local stereopsis. No significant changes were observed during the pretherapy baseline period and the follow-up period, thus ruling out spontaneous recovery and demonstrating long-term stability of treatment effects. This proof-of-principle study indicates a substantial treatment-induced plasticity after hypoxia in the relearning of binocular vision and offers a viable treatment option. Moreover, it provides new hope and direction for the development of effective rehabilitation strategies to treat neurovisual deficits resulting from hypoxic brain damage.

All testing was completed in a single visit at a Midwestern university hospital. Subjects in both the NSCL\/P (n = 80) and the control groups (n = 62) ranged in age from 7-26 years (average age = 17.60 and 17.66, respectively). Subjects completed a battery of standardized tests evaluating intelligence, neuropsychological skills, and word reading. Subjects with NSCL\/P also underwent speech assessment, and past audiology records were evaluated. After controlling for age and socioeconomic status, subjects with cleft performed significantly worse on a test of word reading. For subjects with cleft, word reading deficits were not associated with measures of speech or hearing, but were correlated with impairments in auditory memory. These findings show poorer reading among subjects with NSCL\/P compared with those without. Further work needs to focus on correlates of reading among subjects with cleft to allow early identification and appropriate intervention\/accommodation for those at risk. ","764":"Clinic-based studies suggest that dementia is diagnosed at older ages in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. The current study sought to test this hypothesis in a large, prospective, community-based study of initially nondemented Hispanic immigrants living in a Spanish-speaking enclave of northern Manhattan. Participants included 1,067 participants in the Washington\/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were tested in Spanish and followed at 18-24 month intervals for up to 23 years. Spanish-English bilingualism was estimated via both self-report and an objective measure of English reading level. Multilevel models for change estimated the independent effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline in 4 domains: episodic memory, language, executive function, and speed. Over the course of the study, 282 participants developed dementia. Cox regression was used to estimate the independent effect of bilingualism on dementia conversion. Covariates included country of origin, gender, education, time spent in the United States, recruitment cohort, and age at enrollment. Independent of the covariates, bilingualism was associated with better memory and executive function at baseline. However, bilingualism was not independently associated with rates of cognitive decline or dementia conversion. Results were similar whether bilingualism was measured via self-report or an objective test of reading level. This study does not support a protective effect of bilingualism on age-related cognitive decline or the development of dementia. In this sample of Hispanic immigrants, bilingualism is related to higher initial scores on cognitive tests and higher educational attainment and may not represent a unique source of cognitive reserve. ","765":"To study the pattern of cognitive development in relation to duration of epilepsy. Participants were 113 children with epilepsy referred because of concerns about their cognitive development and tested at least twice at tertiary epilepsy settings. Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ were measured with Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Various epilepsy and demographic variables were included. Change over time was modeled with multilevel analysis for longitudinal data with variable measurement occasion. The Verbal and Full Scales could be fitted best as a downward progressing function. Earlier in time, decline was likely to be largest; later in time, decline followed a continuous, dwindling course. A similar trend was seen for the Performance Scale. Initially, Verbal IQ was higher than Performance IQ but this discrepancy decreased over time. Later onset of epilepsy was associated with an attenuated decline of the Verbal Scale. None of the other epilepsy variables were related to the course of cognitive development. Higher parental education was associated with higher IQ, but was not protective against decline. Verbal IQ, though initially spared, drops. The Performance IQ, which may have shown its vulnerability earlier in the course of the epilepsy, shows overall smaller changes. It is suggested that seizures impact synergistically on an affected brain, which leads to progressive cognitive decline. Earlier onset of epilepsy is associated with relatively higher VIQ, larger VIQ &gt; PIQ discrepancies and more decline. ","766":"Prior literature has identified inconsistent longitudinal associations between total cholesterol and cognitive decline. The authors examined prospective nonlinear relations of coincident trajectories of total cholesterol and cognitive function among persons free of stroke, dementia, and other neurological disease. Up to 1,601 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (aged 19-93, 51% male, 75% White) underwent fasting cholesterol measurement and neuropsychological assessment on up to 12 occasions (M = 3.2, SD = 2.1) over up to 19 years (M = 6.4, SD = 5.3) of follow-up. Mixed-effects regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, lipid-lowering medication use, smoking, alcohol use, and depressive symptoms. Analyses revealed significant longitudinal associations between quadratic total cholesterol and performance on measures of global mental status, verbal learning, executive function, and language (all ps &lt; .05). In general, higher total cholesterol was associated with poorer middle-aged or young-old (60-69 years) cognitive performance, but better old-old (80-89 years) cognitive performance. Linear models also revealed an association between lower total cholesterol and accelerated decline in visual memory performance. Overall, results indicate nonlinear longitudinal relations of total cholesterol to cognitive decline. Whereas higher cholesterol levels were associated with cognitive decline in the middle-aged or young-old, lower cholesterol levels were related to cognitive decline among old-old participants. ","767":"Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to carry out an intended action. Working memory is the ability to store information in mind while processing potentially distracting information. The few previous studies of PM in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yielded inconsistent findings. Studies of working memory ability in ASD have suggested a selective impairment of \"visual working memory.\" However, it remains unclear whether any such impairment is the result of diminished (domain-specific; visual\/verbal) storage capacity or diminished (domain-general) processing capacity. We aim to clarify these issues and explore the relation between PM and working memory in ASD. Seventeen adults with ASD and 17 age- and IQ-matched comparison participants completed experimental measures of both event-based (perform action x when event y occurs) and time-based (perform action a at time b) PM, plus a self-report measure of PM skills. Participants also completed a working memory test battery. Participants with ASD self-reported diminished PM skill, and showed diminished performance on the time-based, but not event-based, PM task. On the working memory test battery, visual but not verbal storage capacity was diminished among participants with ASD, as was processing ability. Whereas visual storage was associated with event-based PM task performance among comparison participants, verbal storage was associated among ASD participants. ASD appears to involve a selective deficit in time-based PM and a selective difficulty with aspects of working memory that depend on the storage of visual information. However, event-based PM may be achieved through compensatory strategies in ASD. ","768":"Given the growing concern that children in today's industrialized and technologically advanced society are becoming more sedentary and less fit, a greater understanding of the extent to which aerobic fitness relates to brain health and cognition during development is of increasing importance. Accordingly, this study sought to use neuroelectric and behavioral measures during an attentional blink task to examine the temporal dynamics of attention as a function of children's aerobic fitness. Using a cross-sectional design, response accuracy and event-related brain potentials were assessed in preadolescent children with different levels of aerobic fitness. Results indicated that higher fit children exhibited greater task performance and better attentional resources distribution, as measured via the P3 component, compared to lower fit children. These findings indicate that aerobic fitness may benefit aspects of cognitive health that involve temporal dynamics of attentional processes during preadolescent maturation. ","769":"This study describes a follow-up investigation of numerical abilities and visuospatial memory in a patient suffering from semantic dementia whose progressive decline of semantic memory variably affected different types of knowledge. Crucially, we investigated in detail her outstanding performance with Sudoku that has been only anecdotally reported in the previous literature. We tested spatial cognition and memory, body representation, number processing, calculation, and Sudoku tasks, and we compared the patient's performance with that of matched controls. In agreement with the neuroanatomical data, showing substantial sparing of the parietal lobes in the face of severe atrophy of the temporal (and frontal) regions, we report full preservation of skills known to be supported by intact parietal-basal ganglia networks, and impaired knowledge related to long-term stored declarative information mediated by temporal regions. Performance in tasks sensitive to parietal dysfunction (such as right-left orientation, finger gnosis, writing, and visuospatial memory) was normal; within the numerical domain, preserved quantity-based number knowledge dissociated from increasing difficulties with nonquantitative number knowledge (such as knowledge of encyclopedic and personal number facts) and arithmetic facts knowledge. This case confirms the relation between numbers and space, and, although indirectly, their anatomical correlates, underlining which abilities are preserved in the case of severe semantic loss. In addition, although Sudoku is not inherently numerical, the patient was able to solve even the most difficult pattern, provided that it required digits and not letters, showing that digits have, in any case, a specific status. ","770":"We report preliminary findings on the efficacy of interactive metronome (IM) therapy for the remediation of cognitive difficulties in soldiers with persisting cognitive complaints following blast-related mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). Forty-six of a planned sample of 50 active duty soldiers with persistent cognitive complaints following a documented history of blast-related TBI of mild-to-moderate severity were randomly assigned to receive either standard rehabilitation care (SRC) or SRC plus a 15-session standardized course of IM therapy. Primary outcome measures were Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Index Scores. Secondary outcome measures included selected subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (Trail Making Test and Color-Word Interference) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (Symbol Search, Digit-Symbol Coding, Digit Span, and Letter-Number Sequencing) as well as the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test. Significant group differences (SRC vs. IM) were observed for RBANS Attention (p = .044), Immediate Memory (p = .019), and Delayed Memory (p = .031) indices in unadjusted analyses, with the IM group showing significantly greater improvement at Time 2 than the SRC group, with effect sizes in the medium-to-large range in the adjusted analyses for each outcome (Cohen's d = 0.511, 0.768, and 0.527, respectively). Though not all were statistically significant, effects in 21 of 26 cognitive outcome measures were consistently in favor of the IM treatment group (binomial probability = .00098). The addition of IM therapy to SRC appears to have a positive effect on neuropsychological outcomes for soldiers who have sustained mild-to-moderate TBI and have persistent cognitive complaints after the period for expected recovery has passed. ","771":"The nature of possible impairments in orienting attention to social signals in schizophrenia is controversial. The present research was aimed at addressing this issue further by comparing gaze and arrow cues. Unlike previous studies, we also included pointing gestures as social cues, with the goal of addressing whether any eventual impairment in the attentional response was specific to gaze signals or reflected a more general deficit in dealing with social stimuli. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and matched controls performed a spatial-cuing paradigm in which task-irrelevant centrally displayed gaze, pointing finger, and arrow cues oriented rightward or leftward, preceded a lateralized target requiring a simple detection response. Healthy controls responded faster to spatially congruent targets than to spatially incongruent targets, irrespective of cue type. In contrast, schizophrenic patients responded faster to spatially congruent targets than to spatially incongruent targets only for arrow and pointing finger cues. No cuing effect emerged for gaze cues. The results support the notion that gaze cuing is impaired in schizophrenia, and suggest that this deficit may not extend to all social cues. ","772":"Cognitive impairments in theory of mind (ToM), executive processing, and decision-making are frequent and highly relevant symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). These functions have been related to moral decision-making. Their association to moral decision-making in PD, however, has not been studied yet. It was hypothesized that moral decisions in patients with PD differ from those in healthy control participants, and that more egoistic decisions are related to ToM as well as executive dysfunctions in patients with PD. Nineteen patients with PD and 20 healthy control participants were examined with an everyday moral decision-making task, comprised of 10 low and 10 high emotional forced-choice moral dilemma short stories with egoistic and altruistic options. All participants received an elaborate neuropsychological test battery. Electrodermal skin conductance responses were recorded to examine possible unconscious emotional reactions during moral decision-making. The groups performed comparably in total scores of moral decision-making. Although ToM did not differ between groups, it was inversely related to altruistic moral decisions in the healthy control group, but not in patients with PD. Executive functions were not related to moral decision-making. No differences were found for skin conductance responses, yet they differed from zero in both groups. Our findings indicate that moral decisions do not differ between patients with PD and healthy control participants. However, different underlying processes in both groups can be presumed. While healthy control participants seem to apply ToM to permit egoistic moral decisions in low emotional dilemmas, patients with PD seem to decide independently from ToM. These mechanisms as well as neuropsychological and neurophysiological correlates are discussed. ","773":null,"774":"In the chordate and vertebrate central nervous system, sensory and motor nerve tracts cross from one side to the other as they connect the brain with sensory receptors and motor neurons. These \"decussations,\" crossings in the form of an X, relate each side of the brain to the opposite side of the body. The protochordates derive from an invertebrate ancestor, but no such contralateral arrangement occurs in any invertebrate phylum. No adaptive benefit of decussation has been established. What might explain the evolution of decussation? A brief review of relevant features of comparative morphology of invertebrates, chordates and vertebrates leads to an explanatory model of decussation. A \"somatic twist model\" of invertebrate-vertebrate transition accounts for decussations as byproducts of a more momentous change; the relocation of the neuraxis from the ventral to the dorsal aspect of the body. Evidence is presented that this inversion proceeded by means of a twisting of the body 180 degrees on its axis just behind its anterior pole. This rotation aligned the neuraxis with the dorsal head ganglia and brain and by twisting the nerve tracts it brought decussation in its wake. Decussation evolved as a byproduct of a genetically determined partial inversion of the body plan, which resulted in a 180 degree rotation posterior to the brain and oropharynx. ","775":"Effective decision-making is critical for resuming day-to-day activities after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Little is known, however, about how decision-making is affected after aSAH, particularly under ambiguous conditions in which neither the outcome nor the outcome probabilities are known. Here we examined the integrity of decision-making under ambiguity in a cohort of aSAH patients classified as having made a \"good outcome\" according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Thirty aSAH survivors and 33 healthy controls completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Mean time of assessment poststroke was 30 months. Although patients and controls had similar decision-making strategies on the IGT, patients made significantly fewer switches between decks, suggesting perseveration and cognitive inflexibility. On the BART, aSAH patients demonstrated significantly enhanced risk-taking behavior relative to controls. Examination of effect sizes revealed cognitive inflexibility in 33% to 35% of aSAH patients and enhanced risk-taking behavior in 35% to 40% of aSAH patients. Approximately one third of \"good outcome\" aSAH patients experience cognitive inflexibility and enhanced risk-taking behavior over 2 years poststroke, illustrating the persistence of aSAH-associated cognitive impairment. ","776":"This study investigated whether the observed absence of emotional memory enhancement in recognition tasks in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) could be related to their greater proportion of familiarity-based responses for all stimuli, and whether recognition tests with emotional items had better discriminative power for aMCI patients than those with neutral items. In total, 31 aMCI patients and 30 healthy older adults participated in a recognition test followed by remember\/know judgments. Positive, neutral, and negative faces were used as stimuli. For overall recognition performance, emotional memory enhancement was found only in healthy controls; they remembered more negative and positive stimuli than neutral ones. For \"remember\" responses, we found equivalent emotional memory enhancement in both groups, though a greater proportion of \"remember\" responses was observed in normal controls. For \"know\" responses, aMCI patients presented a larger proportion than normal controls did, and their \"know\" responses were not affected by emotion. A negative correlation was found between emotional enhancement effect and the memory performance related to \"know\" responses. In addition, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed higher diagnostic accuracy for recognition test with emotional stimuli than with neutral stimuli. The present results implied that the absence of the emotional memory enhancement effect in aMCI patients might be related to their tendency to rely more on familiarity-based \"know\" responses for all stimuli. Furthermore, recognition memory tests using emotional stimuli may be better able than neutral stimuli to differentiate people with aMCI from cognitively normal older adults. ","777":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and extensively treated psychiatric disorder in children, which often persists into adulthood. The core diagnostic symptoms include inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and\/or pervasive inattention. Another crucial aspect of the disorder involves aberrations in temporal perception, which have been well documented in behavioral studies and, recently, have been the focus of neuroimaging studies. These functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown reduced activation in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices in ADHD using a time-interval discrimination task, whereby participants distinguish intervals differing by only hundreds of milliseconds. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate the cortical network serving temporal perception during a continuous, long-duration (in minutes) time estimation experiment. Briefly, medicated and unmedicated persons with ADHD, and a control group responded each time they estimated 60 s had elapsed for an undisclosed amount of time in two separate MEG sessions. All MEG data were transformed into regional source activity, and subjected to spectral analyses to derive amplitude estimates of gamma-band activity. Compared to controls, unmedicated patients were less accurate time estimators and had weaker gamma activity in the anterior cingulate, supplementary motor area, and left prefrontal cortex. After medication, these patients exhibited small but significant increases in gamma across these same neural regions and significant improvements in time estimation accuracy, which correlated with the gamma activity increases. We found deficient gamma activity in brain areas known to be crucial for timing functions, which may underlie the day-to-day abnormalities in time perception that are common in ADHD. ","778":"Late preterm birth increases risk of perinatal health complications that typically resolve in the short term. Thus, early elective delivery is thought to have no long-term effects. Whether there is increased risk of adverse psychological outcomes that emerge in early childhood remains uncertain. The authors compared intellectual, neuropsychological, and behavioral outcomes in 278 late preterm (35-36 weeks) and 192 term (37-41 weeks) participants at age 3 years recruited from a single center, using analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and regression analyses. Late-preterm participants were further subgrouped by admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 202) or a well-baby unit (n = 76). Analyses included 132 additional participants born at 34 weeks. Late preterm participants had lower general conceptual ability (GCA; i.e., IQ); lower verbal, nonverbal, spatial, visuomotor, and dexterity scores; and poorer adaptability than term participants (p &lt; .01; -0.271 to -0.511 SDs). Gestational age was the most important predictor of these subtle outcomes, not neonatal medical variables; no differences were found between NICU admitted and nonadmitted late-preterm groups. A 1-week increase in gestational age resulted in a 1.941 increase in GCA (d = 0.127). Gestation is a developmental continuum best not interrupted during its natural course. Our data showing subtle but appreciable effects have important implications for obstetric practice and parental decision making regarding early elective delivery in the absence of maternal or fetal adverse indications. ","779":"Attention ability can be divided into three separate networks (executive, orienting, and alerting) that differ in their function and neurobiology. It has been suggested that the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ) can gate between the orienting and the alerting systems. Because there is converging evidence suggesting that the right TPJ functions abnormally in dyslexia, the current work examines behaviorally the independence of the orienting and the alerting systems in dyslexic readers. The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a nonlinguistic test designed to measure behaviorally the separate attention systems using a single test. One feature of the ANT test is that it captures the separability and independence of the normal attention networks. In the current study, dyslexic readers preformed the ANT test and their performance was compared with normal readers. Here we demonstrate, consistent with previous theories, impairment in executive and orienting networks in dyslexic readers; however, for the first time, we reveal unique situations in which the orienting spatial attention system in dyslexia is abnormally dependent on and negatively correlated with the alerting attention system. Dyslexics suffer from globally spread abnormal nonlinguistic attentional networks in what are considered separate attentional systems in the normal population; it appears that they are abnormally interrelated in the dyslexic population. ","780":"The aim of the study was to investigate whether, within the phonological short-term memory (STM) system, speech articulation disorders primarily due to cortical damage are associated with deficits in the phonological recoding of visual-verbal material, and whether the visual short-term store (STS) can compensate for inefficient access to the phonological STS, as suggested in previous reports. Two patients (AE and TM) with apraxia of speech due to atrophic cerebral damage were administered a battery of tasks devised to explore the organization of the phonological STM. AE's span was normal and TM's span was markedly reduced. Phonological similarity and word-length effects: Both patients showed the effects in visual presentation; the effect was less evident in verbal presentation. This suggests a phonological STS disorder and preserved rehearsal\/phonological recoding, consistently with involvement of the left parietal regions, which was documented by the MRI in both patients. Unexpectedly, TM had a longer span for similar than for dissimilar words in visually presented stimuli. Silent phonology (on written material): At variance with controls, stress assignment improved during unattended speech both in AE and TM, while in both patients and controls a detrimental effect of unattended speech was documented in the initial sound task. To account for this unusual pattern of results, we hypothesized that whenever possible, AE and TM adopt the strategy that takes advantage of the visual STM store to compensate for a defective phonological STS. ","781":null,"782":"Neuroimaging evidence suggests that ecstasy-related reductions in SERT densities relate more closely to the number of tablets typically consumed per session rather than estimated total lifetime use. To better understand the basis of drug related deficits in prospective memory (p.m.) we explored the association between p.m. and average long-term typical dose and long-term frequency of use. Study 1: Sixty-five ecstasy\/polydrug users and 85 nonecstasy users completed an event-based, a short-term and a long-term time-based p.m. task. Study 2: Study 1 data were merged with outcomes on the same p.m. measures from a previous study creating a combined sample of 103 ecstasy\/polydrug users, 38 cannabis-only users, and 65 nonusers of illicit drugs. Study 1: Ecstasy\/polydrug users had significant impairments on all p.m. outcomes compared with nonecstasy users. Study 2: Ecstasy\/polydrug users were impaired in event-based p.m. compared with both other groups and in long-term time-based p.m. compared with nonillicit drug users. Both drug using groups did worse on the short-term time-based p.m. task compared with nonusers. Higher long-term average typical dose of ecstasy was associated with poorer performance on the event and short-term time-based p.m. tasks and accounted for unique variance in the two p.m. measures over and above the variance associated with cannabis and cocaine use. The typical ecstasy dose consumed in a single session is an important predictor of p.m. impairments with higher doses reflecting increasing tolerance giving rise to greater p.m. impairment. ","783":"There appears to be a common network of brain regions that underlie the ability to recall past personal experiences (episodic memory) and the ability to imagine possible future personal experiences (episodic future thinking). At the cognitive level, these abilities are thought to rely on \"scene construction\" (the ability to bind together multimodal elements of a scene in mind--dependent on hippocampal functioning) and temporal \"self-projection\" (the ability to mentally project oneself through time--dependent on prefrontal cortex functioning). Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by diminished episodic memory, it is unclear whether episodic future thinking is correspondingly impaired. Moreover, the underlying basis of such impairments (difficulties with scene construction, self-projection, or both) is yet to be established. The current study therefore aimed to elucidate these issues. Twenty-seven intellectually high-functioning adults with ASD and 29 age- and IQ-matched neurotypical comparison adults were asked to describe (a) imagined atemporal, non-self-relevant fictitious scenes (assessing scene construction), (b) imagined plausible self-relevant future episodes (assessing episodic future thinking), and (c) recalled personally experienced past episodes (assessing episodic memory). Tests of narrative ability and theory of mind were also completed. Performances of participants with ASD were significantly and equally diminished in each condition and, crucially, this diminution was independent of general narrative ability. Given that participants with ASD were impaired in the fictitious scene condition, which does not involve self-projection, we suggest the underlying difficulty with episodic memory\/future thinking is one of scene construction. ","784":"The apparent contradiction between preserved or even enhanced perceptual processing speed on inspection time tasks in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and impaired performance on complex processing speed tasks that require motor output (e.g., Wechsler Processing Speed Index) has not yet been systematically investigated. This study investigates whether adding motor output demands to an inspection time task impairs ASD performance compared to that of typically developing control (TDC) children. The performance of children with ASD (n = 28; mean Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) = 115) and TDC (n = 25; mean FSIQ = 122) children was compared on processing speed tasks with increasing motor demand. Correlations were run between ASD task performance and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Communication scores. Performance by the ASD and TDC groups on a simple perceptual processing speed task with minimal motor demand was equivalent, though it diverged (ASD worse than TDC) on 2 tasks with the same stimuli but increased motor output demands. ASD performance on the moderate but not the high speeded motor output demand task was negatively correlated with ADOS communication symptoms. These data address the apparent contradiction between preserved inspection time in the context of slowed \"processing speed\" in ASD. They show that processing speed is preserved when motor demands are minimized, but that increased motor output demands interfere with the ability to act on perceptual processing of simple stimuli. Reducing motor demands (e.g., through the use of computers) may increase the capacity of people with ASD to demonstrate good perceptual processing in a variety of educational, vocational, and social settings.","785":"Classifiers play an important role in describing the quantity information of objects. Few studies have been conducted to investigate the brain organization for quantity processing of classifiers. In the current study, we investigated whether activation of numeral classifiers was specific to the bilateral inferior parietal areas, which are believed to process numerical magnitude. Using functional MRI, we explored the neural correlates of numeral classifiers, as compared with those of numbers, dot arrays, and nonquantity words (i.e., tool nouns). Our results showed that numeral classifiers and tool nouns elicited greater activation in the left inferior frontal lobule and left middle temporal gyrus than did numbers and dot arrays, but numbers and dot arrays had greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus, precuneus, and the superior and inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere. No differences were found between numeral classifiers and tool nouns. The results suggest that quantity processing of numeral classifiers is independent of that of numbers and dot arrays, supporting the notation-dependent hypothesis of quantity processing. ","786":"The present study investigates associations between brain white matter tract integrity and cognitive abilities in community-dwelling older people (N = 655). We explored two potential confounds of white matter tract-cognition associations in later life: (a) whether the associations between tracts and specific cognitive abilities are accounted for by general cognitive ability (g); and (b) how the presence of atrophy and white matter lesions affect these associations. Tract integrity was determined using quantitative diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography (tract-averaged fractional anisotropy [FA]). Using confirmatory factor analysis, we compared first-order and bifactor models to investigate whether specific tract-ability associations were accounted for by g. Significant associations were found between g and FA in bilateral anterior thalamic radiations (r range: .16-.18, p &lt; .01), uncinate (r range: .19-.26, p &lt; .001), arcuate fasciculi (r range: .11-.12, p &lt; .05), and the splenium of corpus callosum (r = .14, p &lt; .01). After controlling for g within the bifactor model, some significant specific cognitive domain associations remained. Results also suggest that the primary effects of controlling for whole brain integrity were on g associations, not specific abilities. Results suggest that g accounts for most of, but not all, the tract-cognition associations in the current data. When controlling for age-related overall brain structural changes, only minor attenuations of the tract-cognition associations were found, and these were primarily with g. In totality, the results highlight the importance of controlling for g when investigating associations between specific cognitive abilities and neuropsychology variables. ","787":"The present investigation examined whether higher functioning children with autism would demonstrate impaired response inhibition performance in an emotional go\/no-go task, and whether severity of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism symptoms correlated with performance. Forty-four children (21 meeting criteria for autism; 23 typically developing controls [TDCs]) completed an emotional go\/no-go task in which an emotional facial expression (angry, fearful, happy, or sad) was the go stimulus and a neutral facial expression was the no-go stimulus, and vice versa. The autism group was faster than the TDC group on all emotional go trials. Moreover, the children in the autism group who had the fastest reaction times on emotional go trials were rated as having the greatest number of symptoms (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Social + Communication score), even after accounting for the association with ADHD symptoms. The autism group also made more impulsive responses (i.e., lower d', more false alarms) than the TDC group on all trials. As d' decreased or false alarms increased, so did ADHD symptoms. Hyperactivity\/impulsivity symptoms were significantly correlated with false alarms, but inattention symptoms were not. There was not a significant relationship between no-go false alarms and autism symptoms; even after partialing out associations with autism symptoms, the significant correlation between ADHD symptoms and no-go false alarms remained. The present findings support a comorbidity model that argues for shared and independent risk factors, because ADHD and autism symptoms related to independent aspects of emotional go\/no-go performance. ","788":"\"Global processing bias\" is an automatic tendency to process the global picture prior to the local details. The right hemisphere is known to be more dominant in global processing, and some researchers have demonstrated its important role in alertness. Converging evidence implies some dysfunction in right hemisphere activation in people suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Global processing is yet to be understood in ADHD. We examined whether adults with ADHD show deficient global processing and whether this could be alleviated by the presence of an alerting signal. Adult participants (20 ADHD, 20 typically developing controls) responded to a global-local Navon task in which they were asked to respond to the large stimulus or the small component stimuli, and to a Navon-like task with an alerting cue. Reaction time and accuracy were measured. Unlike controls, adults with ADHD did not have global precedence; irrelevant global stimuli (when asked to respond to the local level) and irrelevant local stimuli (when asked to respond to the global level) produced similar interference in ADHD participants. Appearance of an alerting cue increased global processing bias (i.e., increased interference from global stimuli in the local block and reduced interference from local stimuli in the global block) for both groups, such that global processing in ADHD participants was comparable to that of controls. ADHD participants showed lack of a global processing bias. Most important, global processing bias was reinstated by an alerting cue. Implications for the definition of ADHD, which currently emphasizes failure to pay close attention to details, will be discussed. Moreover, the current results have important implications for social functioning of people suffering from ADHD. ","789":"Beyond visual field defects, patients with hemianopia have been suggested to perceive horizontal visual space in a distorted manner. However, the pattern of these distortions remained debatable. The aim of this study was to estimate the geometry of the visual representation of space in hemianopia using an auditory marker. Patients with pure left or right hemianopia (without neglect) were tested in tasks requiring them to bring a visual stimulus into spatial alignment with a target sound (Experiment 1) or vice versa (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, patients adjusted the location of a light such that it was displaced toward the anopic side with reference to the physical sound position. In Experiment 2, patients adjusted the location of a sound such that it was displaced opposite to the anopic side with reference to the actual position of the visual target. Both experiments consistently indicated that hemianopic patients perceived a sound and a light to be in spatial alignment when the physical position of the light deviated by several degrees from the sound toward the side of the anopic hemifield, that is, to the contralesional side. Given that auditory localization in patients with hemianopia has been previously shown to be only slightly biased toward the anopic side, the observed distortion of visual space with reference to auditory space can be explained by assuming that visual positions were, in absolute terms, perceived as shifted toward the intact side. As a result, HA patients may perceive visual space as compressed on their ipsilesional (intact), in comparison with their contralesional (anopic) side. ","790":"Prior studies have not tested individual differences or effects of medication dosage on stimulus-response learning in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In the current study, we investigated the effects of motor variables (including tremor, akinesia, and disease duration) as well as dopaminergic medication dosage on learning in unmedicated PD patients, medicated PD patients, and healthy controls. We tested all subjects on probabilistic and deterministic learning tasks, and also collected awareness measures data using postexperimental questionnaires. Importantly, we tested learning performance in tremor-dominant and akinesia-dominant PD patients, and further correlated learning performance with disease duration and medication dosage. Results show that akinesia-dominant patients were more impaired than tremor-dominant patients at probabilistic reward- but not punishment-based learning, which is in agreement with prior studies of the relationship between akinesia and basal ganglia dysfunction. We also found no difference between medicated and unmedicated PD patients in reward- or punishment-based deterministic learning, but medicated patients were better than unmedicated patients at reward-based probabilistic learning. Our results show that awareness measures explain differences among probabilistic and deterministic learning performance. Moreover, we found that disease duration and motor severity are inversely correlated, and medication dosage is positively correlated, with reward-based probabilistic learning. Our results suggest that stimulus-response learning performance in patients with PD depends on the type of learning (probabilistic vs. deterministic), medication status (on vs. off medication, dopaminergic medication dosage), disease duration as well as motor severity and subtype in PD patients (tremor- vs. akinesia-dominant).

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) provided measures of individual differences in decision making and psychopathy, respectively. The IGT and PCL-R each contributed differentially to specific socially disadvantageous outcomes, with poorer decision-making scores predicting recidivism at 3- to 6-month follow-up, and higher psychopathy linked to a retrospective measure of total lifetime incarceration. In addition, in relation to both nonrecidivist and control groups, recidivists showed a distinct pattern of IGT performance for the last 3 blocks of trials, characterized by a failure to learn from feedback and to modify their preferences to more advantageous decks of cards. In addition, the IGT and PCL-R correlated, with poorer decision making corresponding to higher ratings in psychopathy. The current findings may add to growing evidence of ecological validity of both decision making and psychopathy in relation to real-life outcome measures in high-risk individuals. ","792":"Inconsistent performance is associated with cognitive dysfunction in a number of clinical populations. However, intraindividual cognitive variability in healthy individuals is poorly understood. Inconsistency poses a challenge to clinicians when interpreting change over time. This study examined intraindividual cognitive variability within a sample of college athletes tested at baseline and postconcussion. Athletes (n = 71) and control participants (n = 42) were tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at baseline and postconcussion (athletes) or one month later (controls). A subset of indices with high internal consistency was used to calculate overall performance and performance variability. A k-means cluster analysis of baseline and postconcussion performance variability examined heterogeneity within the sample. In the athlete sample, performance variability was significantly greater than zero, and was negatively correlated with overall performance at both time points (p &lt; .001). Wechsler Test of Adult Reading Full Scale IQ estimate was significantly correlated with overall performance (p &lt; .01), but not with performance variability. Cluster analysis revealed low-variability (n = 46) and high-variability (n = 25) cluster groups. Whereas the low-variability cluster group exhibited a pattern of performance similar to that of control participants, membership in the high-variability cluster group was associated with postconcussion cognitive dysfunction. These findings suggest that normative cognitive performance in college athletes is characterized by significant intraindividual variation across tests. Cross-test intraindividual variability may impart clinically meaningful information, as higher levels of variability were related to poorer overall performance and postconcussion cognitive dysfunction. ","793":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the corpus callosum (CC), which plays a key role in interhemispheric coupling in high-demand conditions. Using 3D callosal measurements and a letter-matching paradigm, this 2-part study investigated the neural substrate of interhemispheric coupling in individuals with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) and age-matched healthy individuals (HC). Thirty-three right-handed participants were MRI scanned to measure the volume of the CC in 5 sections. In Study 1, AD, a-MCI, and HC individuals performed a low-demand perceptual letter shape-matching task (e.g., A-A); in Study 2, a-MCI and HC individuals performed a \"case-sensitive\" letter-matching task (Study 2A) and a \"load-sensitive\" letter-matching task (Study 2B). The results showed a positive correlation between Response Times and the midbody of the CC at the lowest cognitive demand level (Study 1) in participants with AD, and the total CC, midbody, caudal body, and isthmus of the CC at high cognitive demand levels (Study 2A) in normal aging. The volume of the anterior part of the CC was significantly negatively correlated with the interhemispheric behavioral indices for the a-MCI group (Study 1 and Study 2B). This study provides evidence that interhemispheric coupling may constitute a flexible mechanism that can improve the brain's ability to meet processing demands for low cognitive demand in AD and for high cognitive demand in normal aging.

Changes in encoding orientation served as the extrinsic manipulation in Experiment 3. Across all experiments we found that young adults, nondemented older adults, and individuals in the early stages of DAT effectively used intrinsic and extrinsic factors to guide JOL predictions. We conclude that while certain aspects of metacognition may be impaired in both the normal and demented older populations, these groups remain able to use theory-based processing, or general knowledge about how memory works, to make metamemory monitoring predictions. ","795":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a method to identify and quantify abnormalities resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI). MRI abnormalities in children with TBI have not been fully characterized according to the frequency, location, and quantitative measurement of a range of pathologies critical for studies of neuropsychological outcome. Here, we report MRI findings from a large, multicenter study of childhood TBI, the Social Outcomes of Brain Injury in Kids (SOBIK) study, which compared qualitative and quantitative neuroimaging findings in 72 children with complicated mild-to-severe TBI to 52 children with orthopedic injury (OI). Qualitative analyses of MRI scans coded white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), hemosiderin deposits reflecting prior hemorrhagic lesions, regions of encephalomalacia and\/or atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy and traumatic shear lesions. Two automated quantitative analyses were conducted: (a) FreeSurfer methods computed volumes for total brain, white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), corpus callosum, ventricles, amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and thalamus along with a ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR); and (b) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify WM, GM, and cerebrospinal fluid. We also examined performance on the Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, in relation to the above-mentioned neuroimaging variables. WMHs, hemosiderin deposits, and focal areas of encephalomalacia or atrophy were common in children with TBI, were related to injury severity, and were mostly observed within a frontotemporal distribution. Quantitative analyses showed volumetric changes related to injury severity, especially ventricular enlargement and reduced corpus callosum volume. VBM demonstrated similar findings, but, in addition, GM reductions in the inferior frontal, basal forebrain region, especially in the severe TBI group. The complicated mild TBI group showed few differences from the OI group. PSI was significantly associated with global atrophy, as measured by VBR. MRI findings after childhood TBI are diverse and particularly influenced by injury severity, and they involve common features, group heterogeneity, and individual variability.

In this study, we investigated (1) whether patients with right hemisphere strokes (RHS) and left hemisphere strokes (LHS) differ in the frequency of delayed action initiation (hypokinesia) and motor impersistence; (2) whether there is a directional or hemispatial component of hypokinesia or motor impersistence; (3) whether there is an association between the presence of hemispatial neglect and tests for MID; and (4) the location of injury associated with MID. Thirty-two patients with acute unilateral stroke (21 with RHS and 11 with LHS) and 12 age-matched healthy controls participated in the study. To determine the presence and severity of directional and spatial hypokinesia and impersistence we used a new apparatus, the Directional Movement Tester (DMT). While being tested with the DMT, the participants held a static bar located either in the right or left hemispace using either their right or left hand and upon stimulus onset pushed the bar either leftward or rightward and maintained a given force for 10 sec. The frequency of hypokinesia and impersistence was higher in the RHS group than in the LHS group, but there were no hypokinetic directional or spatial asymmetries. The RHS group did demonstrate left contralesional directional impersistence, but there were no spatial asymmetries of impersistence. Signs of hemispatial neglect were not associated with these measures of MID. Participants with frontal or subcortical lesions were significantly more likely to demonstrate hypokinesia and impersistence than those with posterior lesions.

However, few prospective studies have assessed the long-term effects of abuse and neglect on executive functioning. This study examined whether childhood abuse and neglect predicts components of executive functioning and nonverbal reasoning ability in middle adulthood and whether PTSD moderates this relationship. Using a prospective cohort design, a large sample (N = 792) of court-substantiated cases of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect (ages 0-11 years) and matched controls were followed into adulthood (mean age = 41 years). Executive functioning was assessed with the Trail Making Test-Part B and nonverbal reasoning was assessed with the Matrix Reasoning test. PTSD (DSM-III-R lifetime diagnosis) was assessed at age 29 years. Data were analyzed using ordinary least squares regressions, controlling for age, sex, and race, and possible confounds of IQ, depression, and excessive alcohol use. In multivariate analyses, childhood maltreatment overall and childhood neglect predicted poorer executive functioning and nonverbal reasoning at age 41 years, whereas physical and sexual abuse did not. A past history of PTSD did not mediate or moderate these relations. Childhood maltreatment and neglect specifically have a significant long-term impact on important aspects of adult neuropsychological functioning. These findings suggest the need for targeted efforts dedicated to interventions for neglected children. ","798":"Episodic memory processes can be investigated using different functional MRI (fMRI) paradigms. The purpose of the present study was to examine correlations between neuropsychological memory test scores and BOLD signal changes during fMRI scanning using three different memory tasks. Twenty-eight right-handed healthy subjects underwent three paradigms, (a) a word pair, (b) a space-labyrinth, and (c) a face-name association paradigm. These paradigms were compared for their value in memory quantification and lateralization by calculating correlations between the BOLD signals in the mesial temporal lobe and behavioral data derived from a neuropsychological test battery. As expected, group analysis showed left-sided activation for the verbal, a tendency to right-sided activation for the spatial, and bilateral activation for the face-name paradigm. No linear correlations were observed between neuropsychological data and activation in the temporo-mesial region. However, we found significant u-shaped correlations between behavioral memory performance and activation in both the verbal and the face-name paradigms, that is, BOLD signal changes were greater not only among participants who performed best on the neuropsychological tests, but also among the poorest performers. The figural learning task did not correlate with the activations in the space-labyrinth paradigm at all. We interpreted the u-shaped correlations to be due to compensatory hippocampal activations associated with low performance when people try unsuccessfully to remember presented items. Because activation levels did not linearly increase with memory performance, the latter cannot be quantified by fMRI alone, but only be used in conjunction with neuropsychological testing.

In line with previous studies (e.g., Bonnin, Houeto, Gil, &amp; Bouquet, 2010), patients displayed no conflict adaptation when tested on medication. However, the same patients tested off of their medication did display a conflict adaptation effect in that the size of the interference effect was reduced after incongruent trials compared with after congruent trials. This difference is discussed in terms of an inverted U-shaped relation between dopamine and performance, according to which dopaminergic medication has detrimental effects on PD patients' performance by overdosing brain regions that are relatively spared in the initial stage of the disease, including the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. ","801":"The present study investigated the role of executive control in accounting for the cognitive and electrophysiological alterations occurring in healthy aging. Younger and older adults performed the inhibitory control task (ICT), a task composed of 3 types of trials that vary in the degree and kind of executive control subprocesses required. We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by these ICT trials and focused on the ERP components related to executive control subprocesses: P3b (updating), no-go P3 (inhibition), and reorienting negativity (RON; shifting). Compared with younger adults, older adults exhibited worse performance on the ICT and a delay in the latency of all the ERPs investigated. These age-related differences occurred regardless of the amount of executive control required because they were not influenced by the type of trial. The RON amplitude, an index of shifting, was found markedly attenuated in older adults relative to younger adults. Executive control, as a unitary function, cannot explain the age-related differences observed, which are more likely to reflect a general slowing of processes with aging. However, when we take into account the specific subprocesses of executive control, the one that seems to be particularly affected by aging is shifting, as revealed by the age-related alterations in the RON parameters. ","802":"This study examined the relation of cerebral tissue reductions associated with VLBW to patterns of growth in core academic domains. Children born &lt;750 g, 750 to 1,499 g, or &gt;2,500 g completed measures of calculation, mathematical problem solving, and word decoding at time points spanning middle childhood and adolescence. K. A. Espy, H. Fang, D. Charak, N. M. Minich, and H. G. Taylor (2009, Growth mixture modeling of academic achievement in children of varying birth weight risk, Neuropsychology, Vol. 23, pp. 460-474) used growth mixture modeling to identify two growth trajectories (clusters) for each academic domain: an average achievement trajectory and a persistently low trajectory. In this study, 97 of the same participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in late adolescence, and cerebral tissue volumes were used to predict the probability of low growth cluster membership for each domain. Adjusting for whole brain volume (wbv), each 1-cm(3) reduction in caudate volume was associated with a 1.7- to 2.1-fold increase in the odds of low cluster membership for each domain. Each 1-mm(2) decrease in corpus callosum surface area increased these odds approximately 1.02-fold. Reduced cerebellar white matter volume was associated specifically with low calculation and decoding growth, and reduced cerebral white matter volume was associated with low calculation growth. Findings were similar when analyses were confined to the VLBW groups. Reduced volume of structures involved in connectivity, executive attention, and motor control may contribute to heterogeneous academic trajectories among children with VLBW. ","803":null,"804":"To investigate which neuropsychological tests predict eventual progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals. Although our approach was exploratory, we predicted that tests that underestimate cognitive ability in healthy aging Hispanics might not be sensitive to future cognitive decline in this cultural group. We compared first-year data of 22 older adults (11 Hispanic) who were diagnosed as cognitively normal but eventually developed AD (decliners), to 60 age- and education-matched controls (27 Hispanic) who remained cognitively normal. To identify tests that may be culturally biased in our sample, we compared Hispanic with non-Hispanic controls on all tests and asked which tests were sensitive to future decline in each cultural group. Compared to age-, education-, and gender-matched non-Hispanic controls, Hispanic controls obtained lower scores on tests of language, executive function, and some measures of global cognition. Consistent with our predictions, some tests identified non-Hispanic, but not Hispanic, decliners (vocabulary, semantic fluency). Contrary to our predictions, a number of tests on which Hispanics obtained lower scores than non-Hispanics nevertheless predicted eventual progression to AD in both cultural groups (e.g., Boston Naming Test [BNT], Trails A and B). Cross-cultural variation in test sensitivity to decline may reflect greater resistance of medium difficulty items to decline and bilingual advantages that initially protect Hispanics against some aspects of cognitive decline commonly observed in non-Hispanics with preclinical AD. These findings highlight a need for further consideration of cross-cultural differences in neuropsychological test performance and development of culturally unbiased measures. ","805":null,"806":null,"807":"Implicit skill learning is hypothesized to depend on nondeclarative memory that operates independent of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system and instead depends on cortico striatal circuits between the basal ganglia and cortical areas supporting motor function and planning. Research with the Serial Reaction Time (SRT) task suggests that patients with memory disorders due to MTL damage exhibit normal implicit sequence learning. However, reports of intact learning rely on observations of no group differences, leading to speculation as to whether implicit sequence learning is fully intact in these patients. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often exhibit impaired sequence learning, but this impairment is not universally observed. Implicit perceptual-motor sequence learning was examined using the Serial Interception Sequence Learning (SISL) task in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n = 11) and patients with PD (n = 15). Sequence learning in SISL is resistant to explicit learning and individually adapted task difficulty controls for baseline performance differences. Patients with MCI exhibited robust sequence learning, equivalent to healthy older adults (n = 20), supporting the hypothesis that the MTL does not contribute to learning in this task. In contrast, the majority of patients with PD exhibited no sequence-specific learning in spite of matched overall task performance. Two patients with PD exhibited performance indicative of an explicit compensatory strategy suggesting that impaired implicit learning may lead to greater reliance on explicit memory in some individuals. The differences in learning between patient groups provides strong evidence in favor of implicit sequence learning depending solely on intact basal ganglia function with no contribution from the MTL memory system. ","808":"Previous research has examined the neurocognitive effects of depression in Parkinson's disease (PD), finding worse performance on tests of cognitive functioning in PD patients with depression as compared to those without depression. However, this research has not considered the effect of side of onset of motor symptoms. Hence, we sought to investigate the interaction between depression and side of onset on working memory in patients with PD. A total of 66 patients with PD completed the Digit Span Backward subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III as well as two other tests of executive functioning. Groups of left hemibody onset (LHO) with and without depression and right hemibody onset (RHO) with and without depression were created. The results indicated significantly lower performance on the measure of working memory for the LHO with depression group, relative to both the LHO without depression and the RHO with depression groups. These findings indicate that working memory is worse in patients with LHO of motor symptoms who are also depressed, and they suggest that this group of patients might experience greater disability and lower quality of life. ","809":"Within the last decade, working memory (WM) has garnered increased interest as a potential core deficit or endophenotype of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current study is the first meta-analytic review to examine several subject and task moderator variables' (e.g., percent female, diagnostic selection procedure, trials per set size, response demands, type of dependent variable, and central executive [CE] demands) effect on between-group phonological (PH) and visuospatial (VS) WM in adults with ADHD, relative to healthy controls. Literature searches were conducted using the PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases, and yielded 38 studies of WM in adults with ADHD. Results revealed moderate-magnitude between-group effect sizes (ESs) across both WM domains. In addition, several task-moderating variables explained significant ES variability among PH and VS studies. Collectively, these findings indicate that WM deficits persist into adulthood and suggest that methodological variability may explicate why WM deficits have not been uniformly detected in previous experimental studies. ","810":"Recent work in cognitive psychology suggests that testing can increase memory for both previously and subsequently studied information. Here we examined whether these beneficial (backward and forward) effects of testing generalize to individuals with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Twenty-four persons with severe TBI, 12.7 years postinjury, and 12 healthy controls participated in the study. Participants studied three lists of items in anticipation of a final cumulative recall test. They were tested immediately between the study of lists or not. Immediate testing of Lists 1 and 2 enhanced recall of both the previously studied information (Lists 1 and 2) and the subsequently studied information (List 3). The enhancement for the three lists arose for individuals with severe TBI and healthy controls, and did not differ in size between subject groups. The findings indicate that TBI persons show a very general benefit from testing, including both backward and forward effects of retrieval practice. Testing thus might be a powerful technique to improve learning and memory in persons with severe TBI. ","811":"Patients with visual extinction have difficulty detecting a single contralesional stimulus when a second stimulus is simultaneously presented on the ipsilesional side. The rarely reported phenomenon of visual anti-extinction describes the opposite behavior, in which patients show greater difficulty in reporting a stimulus presented in isolation than they do in reporting 2 simultaneously presented stimuli. S. J. Goodrich and R. Ward (1997, Anti-extinction following unilateral parietal damage, Cognitive Neuropsychology, Vol. 14, pp. 595-612) suggested that visual anti-extinction is the result of a task-specific mechanism in which processing of the ipsilesional stimulus facilitates responses to the contralesional stimulus; in contrast, G. W. Humphreys, M. J. Riddoch, G. Nys, and D. Heinke (2002, Transient binding by time: Neuropsychological evidence from anti-extinction, Cognitive Neuropsychology, Vol. 19, pp. 361-380) suggested that temporal binding groups contralesional and ipsilesional stimuli together at brief exposure durations. We investigated extinction and anti-extinction phenomena in 3 brain-damaged patients using an extinction paradigm in which the stimulus exposure duration was systematically manipulated. Two patients showed both extinction and anti-extinction depending on the exposure duration of stimuli. Data confirmed the crucial role of duration in modulating the effect of extinction and anti-extinction. However, contrary to Humphreys and colleagues' (2002) single case, our patients showed extinction for short and anti-extinction for long exposure durations, suggesting that different mechanisms might underlie our patients' pattern of data. We discuss a novel \"attentional waiting\" hypothesis, which proposes that anti-extinction may be observed in patients showing extinction if the exposure duration of stimuli is increased. ","812":null,"813":null,"814":"A fundamental dissociation for most working memory (WM) theories involves the separation of sensory-perceptual encoding of stimulus information from the maintenance of this information. The present paper reports tests of this separability hypothesis for visually presented pseudowords at both mathematical and neuroimaging levels of analysis. Levels of analysis were linked by two experimental manipulations-visual degradation and pseudoword length variation-that coupled findings from a mathematical modeling study of WM performed in a separate sample to findings from an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) study reported in the present paper. Results from the mathematical modeling study generated parametric signatures of stimulus encoding and WM rehearsal and displacement. These signatures led to specific predictions about neurophysiological responses to study manipulations in a priori regions of interest (ROI). Results demonstrated predicted dissociations of activation signatures in several ROIs. Significant patterns of brain response mirroring the encode signature were observed only during the task encode interval and only in the visual cortex and posterior fusiform gyrus. In contrast, significant brain response mirroring the rehearsal\/displacement signature was observed only in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. Present findings support the separability hypothesis insofar as brain regions that underlie sensory-perceptual processes demonstrated encode signatures whereas brain regions that support WM maintenance demonstrated the rehearsal\/displacement signature. These results also provide evidence for the utility of combining mathematical modeling with fMRI to integrate information across cognitive and neural levels of analysis. ","815":"To examine cognitive deficits in people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and their relationship to psychological status, CFS symptoms, and everyday functioning. The current study compared the cognitive performance (reaction time, attention, memory, motor functioning, verbal abilities, and visuospatial abilities) of a sample with CFS (n = 50) with that of a sample of healthy controls (n = 50), all of whom had demonstrated high levels of effort and an intention to perform well, and examined the extent to which psychological status, CFS symptoms, and everyday functioning were related to cognitive performance. The CFS group showed impaired information processing speed (reaction time), relative to the controls, but comparable performance on tests of attention, memory, motor functioning, verbal ability, and visuospatial ability. Moreover, information processing speed was not related to psychiatric status, depression, anxiety, the number or severity of CFS symptoms, fatigue, sleep quality, or everyday functioning. A slowing in information processing speed appears to be the main cognitive deficit seen in persons with CFS whose performance on effort tests is not compromised. Importantly, this slowing does not appear to be the consequence of other CFS-related variables, such as depression and fatigue, or motor speed. ","816":"Working memory (WM) capacity, typically measured with cognitively complex span tasks, is correlated with higher order cognitive abilities in healthy adults. The goals of this study were to determine whether a more focused measure of visual WM storage capacity would show similar higher order ability correlations in healthy adults and in people with schizophrenia (PSZ), thereby demonstrating the importance of simple storage capacity; determine whether the illness alters the pattern of correlations across cognitive domains; and evaluate whether between-groups differences in WM capacity could account for the generalized cognitive impairment in PSZ. Ninety-nine PSZ and 77 healthy controls (HCs) completed a visual WM change-localization task, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). PSZ performed more poorly than HCs on all cognitive measures. The between-groups effect size for WM capacity was large (d = 1.11). WM robustly correlated with WASI and MCCB performance, with no significant differences in the magnitude or pattern of correlations across groups. When the groups were pooled, WM capacity correlated at r = .68 with MCCB composite score and at r = .56 with WASI estimated Full Scale IQ. WM capacity accounted for approximately 40% of the between-groups variance across the WASI and MCCB. A simple measure of WM storage capacity is robustly associated with the higher order cognitive abilities assessed by the WASI and MCCB in HCs and PSZ. WM capacity reduction may be a critical determinant of the general cognitive impairment in PSZ. ","817":"Cognitive impairment is a core symptom of pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS), although relatively little is known regarding the rate of cognitive decline. This study examined the extent, pattern, and correlates of change in cognitive functioning in youth with MS. Changes in cognitive performance in 28 patients with pediatric-onset MS and 26 age-matched controls were ascertained through repeat comprehensive neuropsychological assessment conducted over a 1-year period. Change was evaluated by using a mixed factorial design with repeated measures to determine the interaction between group and time and using the Reliable Change Index (RCI) to determine individual differences on test scores over time. Participants were classified as showing \"decline\" or \"improvement\" if change scores exceeded the RCI on three or more tests. The pattern of change over time differed by group. At the group level, healthy controls were more likely to show improvement across multiple domains of function relative to the MS group. Using the RCI, 7 of 28 patients (25%) showed cognitive deterioration compared with only 1 of 26 controls (3.8%; p &lt; .05). Performance on measures of attention and processing speed, visuomotor integration, verbal fluency, visual memory, and calculation and spelling ability were most responsive to deterioration in functioning over time. Longer disease duration was associated with greater deterioration in visuomotor integration. Increased lesion volume was associated with slower psychomotor speed over time. Lower rates of improvement in the pediatric MS group may be suggestive of a lack of age-appropriate cognitive development and warrant further evaluation over time. ","818":"Reaction time (RT) variability is often purported to indicate behavioral attention. This study seeks to examine whether RT variability in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with observed behavioral indicators of attention. One-hundred 47 participants with and without ADHD completed five computerized neuropsychological tasks and an analog math task. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the relationship between observations of behavioral inattention during the analog task and measures of RT variability from the neuropsychological tasks. Significant associations were observed between RT variability and mean duration of on-task behavior on the analog math task. Secondary analyses indicated that on-task behavior during the math task was also related to accuracy on the neuropsychological tasks. RT variability, especially the portion of RT variability characterized by long RTs, appears to measure a cognitive phenomenon that relates to successful on-task academic behavior across children with and without ADHD. The relationship between RT variability and on-task behavior is present across multiple neuropsychological tasks and does not appear to be moderated by age, sex, or the presence of anxiety or depression. ","819":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with performance deficits across a broad range of tasks. Although individual tasks are designed to tap specific cognitive functions (e.g., memory, inhibition, planning, etc.), these deficits could also reflect general effects related to either inefficient or impulsive information processing or both. These two components cannot be isolated from each other on the basis of classical analysis in which mean reaction time (RT) and mean accuracy are handled separately. Seventy children with a diagnosis of combined type ADHD and 50 healthy controls (between 6 and 17 years) performed two tasks: a simple two-choice RT (2-CRT) task and a conflict control task (CCT) that required higher levels of executive control. RT and errors were analyzed using the Ratcliff diffusion model, which divides decisional time into separate estimates of information processing efficiency (called \"drift rate\") and speed-accuracy tradeoff (SATO, called \"boundary\"). The model also provides an estimate of general nondecisional time. Results were the same for both tasks independent of executive load. ADHD was associated with lower drift rate and less nondecisional time. The groups did not differ in terms of boundary parameter estimates. RT and accuracy performance in ADHD appears to reflect inefficient rather than impulsive information processing, an effect independent of executive function load. The results are consistent with models in which basic information processing deficits make an important contribution to the ADHD cognitive phenotype. ","820":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with behavioral disorders that can affect social functioning but are poorly understood. Since emotional and cognitive social processes are known to be crucial in social relationships, impairment of these processes may account for the emergence of behavioral disorders. We used a systematic battery of tests to assess emotional processes and social cognition in PD patients and relate our findings to conventional neuropsychological data (especially behavioral disorders). Twenty-three PD patients and 46 controls (matched for age and educational level) were included in the study and underwent neuropsychological testing, including an assessment of the behavioral and cognitive components of executive function. Emotional and cognitive social processes were assessed with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index caregiver-administered questionnaire (as a measure of empathy), a facial emotion recognition task and two theory of mind (ToM) tasks. When compared with controls, PD patients showed low levels of empathy (p = .006), impaired facial emotion recognition (which persisted after correction for perceptual abilities) (p = .001), poor performance in a second-order ToM task (p = .008) that assessed both cognitive (p = .004) and affective (p = .03) inferences and, lastly, frequent dysexecutive behavioral disorders (in over 40% of the patients). Overall, impaired emotional and cognitive social functioning was observed in 17% of patients and was related to certain cognitive dysexecutive disorders. In terms of behavioral dysexecutive disorders, social behavior disorders were related to impaired emotional and cognitive social functioning (p = .04) but were independent of cognitive impairments. Emotional and cognitive social processes were found to be impaired in Parkinson's disease. This impairment may account for the emergence of social behavioral disorders. ","821":"This study investigated the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on event-based prospective memory tasks with varying demand on (1) the amount of strategic attentional monitoring required for intention retrieval (prospective component), and (2) the retrospective memory processes required to remember the contents of the intention or the entire constellation of prospective memory tasks. Twenty-four older adults with PD and 28 healthy older adults performed the computerized Virtual Week task, a multi-intention prospective memory paradigm that simulates everyday prospective memory tasks. The Virtual Week included regular (low retrospective memory demand) and irregular (high retrospective memory demand) prospective memory tasks with cues that were focal (low strategic monitoring demand) or less focal (high strategic monitoring demand) to the ongoing activity. For the regular prospective memory tasks, PD participants were impaired when the prospective memory cues were less focal. For the irregular prospective memory tasks, PD participants were impaired regardless of prospective memory cue type. PD participants also had impaired retrospective memory for irregular tasks, which was associated with worse prospective memory for these tasks during the Virtual Week. When retrospective memory demands are minimized, prospective memory in PD can be supported by cues that reduce the executive control demands of intention retrieval. However, PD-related deficits in self-initiated encoding or planning processes have strong negative effects on the performance of prospective memory tasks, with increased retrospective memory demand. ","822":"Attention is a complex construct that taps into multiple mechanisms. One type of attention that is underinvestigated in autism is incidentally or implicitly guided attention. The purpose of this study is to characterize how children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) direct spatial attention based on incidental learning. Children with high-functioning ASD and typically developing children engaged in a visual search task. For the first half of the study, over multiple trials, the target was more often found in some locations than other locations. For the second half, the target was equally likely to appear in all locations. We measured search performance for targets located in the high-probability and low-probability locations. Children with ASD were able to direct spatial attention using incidentally learned information about the target's location probability. Although unaware of the experimental manipulation, children with ASD were faster and more efficient in finding a target in the high-probability locations than low-probability locations, and this bias dissipated after the target's location probability was even. The pace and magnitude of learning, as well as later adjustment to new statistics, were comparable between children with ASD and typically developing children. Incidentally learned attention is preserved in children with ASD. ","823":"Restricted and repetitive behaviors, and a pronounced preference for behavioral and environmental consistency, are distinctive characteristics of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Whether these clinical features of ASD are related to fundamental neuropsychological impairments in behavioral flexibility remains to be clarified. Forty-one individuals with ASD and 37 matched controls performed a probabilistic reversal learning task to assess behavioral flexibility. Participants learned to choose the correct stimulus location from a pair of locations to win points (acquisition). After making the correct choice over multiple trials, the rewarded stimulus location changed without warning (reversal). Feedback was provided on an 80:20 probabilistic schedule, with 80% of correct choices and 20% of incorrect choices randomly reinforced. ASD and control participants performed comparably during acquisition. At reversal, ASD participants initially chose the new correct location as quickly as controls, but then more frequently reverted back to the previously preferred response. The ASD group also more frequently shifted back to the previous response choice immediately following intermittent non-reinforcement of the new correct response. The number of regressive errors was positively correlated with independently ascertained clinical ratings of restricted and repetitive behaviors, but not other core features of ASD. Restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD are associated with neurocognitive deficits in flexible choice behavior. Preclinical research has established that frontostriatal circuitry supports flexibility on reversal learning tasks. Thus, alterations in this circuitry may contribute to behavioral rigidity in ASD and represent a target for therapeutic intervention. ","824":null,"825":"Inhibition has been widely investigated in Tourette's syndrome (TS), but some inhibitory processes have received more attention than others. This study examined the relatively underresearched construct of cognitive inhibition in adults with TS and no comorbidities (TS-alone), using tasks thought to tap automatic (without conscious intent) and effortful (with deliberate intent) inhibitory processes. Adult participants with TS-alone (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 21) were compared on a retrieval-induced forgetting task thought to tap automatic cognitive inhibition and a directed forgetting task thought to tap effortful cognitive inhibition. Both tasks involved effortful memory as well as the key inhibitory effects. Both the TS-alone and control groups showed typical inhibitory effects on both tasks, but the TS-alone group showed generally poorer effortful memory on both tasks. The findings appear to indicate intact cognitive inhibition in adults with TS-alone, with some evidence of impairment in effortful processing. This highlights the importance of using tasks related to different inhibitory processes to explore cognitive performance in TS-alone, and suggests that any inhibitory impairment associated with TS-alone is mild and relatively circumscribed. ","826":null,"827":null,"828":"The aim of the present study was to quantify the semantic content of connected speech produced by patients at a uniformly early stage of pathologically proven Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secondary aim was to establish whether semantic units were reduced globally, or whether there was a disproportionate reduction of specific classes of information. Discourse samples were obtained from 18 AD patients and 18 matched controls, all pathologically confirmed. Semantic unit identification was scored overall and for four subclasses: subjects, locations, objects, and actions. Idea density and efficiency were calculated. AD transcripts showed significantly reduced units overall, particularly actions and subjects, as well as reduced efficiency. Total semantic units and a combination of subject-, location-, and object-related units (\"noun\" units) correlated with the Expression subscore on the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG). Subject related units correlated with the CAMCOG Abstract Thinking scale. Logistic regression analyses confirmed that all measures that were lower in AD than controls were predictive of group membership. An exploratory comparison between units expressed mainly using nouns and those mainly using verbs showed that the latter was the stronger of these two predictors. The present study adds a lexico-semantic dimension to the linguistic profile based on discourse analysis in typical AD, recently described by the same authors. 2012, 83(11): 1056-1062). The suggestion of differential importance of verb and noun use in the present study may be related to the reduction in syntactic complexity that was reported, using the same set of discourse samples, in the earlier study. ","829":"Smooth pursuit eye movements are compromised in patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives. Although research has demonstrated that the motor components of smooth pursuit eye movements are intact, motion perception has been shown to be impaired. In particular, studies have consistently revealed deficits in performance on tasks specific to the high-order motion area V5 (middle temporal area, MT) in patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, data from low-level motion detectors in the primary visual cortex (V1) have been inconsistent. To differentiate between low-level and high-level visual motion processing, we applied a temporal-order judgment task for motion events and a motion-defined figure-ground segregation task using patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Successful judgments in both tasks rely on the same low-level motion detectors in the V1; however, the first task is further processed in the higher-order motion area MT in the magnocellular (dorsal) pathway, whereas the second task requires subsequent computations in the parvocellular (ventral) pathway in visual area V4 and the inferotemporal cortex (IT). These latter structures are supposed to be intact in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia revealed a significantly impaired temporal resolution on the motion-based temporal-order judgment task but only mild impairment in the motion-based segregation task. These results imply that low-level motion detection in V1 is not, or is only slightly, compromised; furthermore, our data restrain the locus of the well-known deficit in motion detection to areas beyond the primary visual cortex. ","830":"Decline in visuospatial abilities with advancing age has been attributed to a demise of bottom-up and top-down functions involving sensory processing, selective attention, and executive control. These functions may be differentially affected by age-related volume shrinkage of subcortical and cortical nodes subserving the dorsal and ventral processing streams and the corpus callosum mediating interhemispheric information exchange. Fifty-five healthy adults (25-84 years) underwent structural MRI and performed a visual search task to test perceptual and attentional demands by combining feature-conjunction searches with \"gestalt\" grouping and attentional cueing paradigms. Poorer conjunction, but not feature, search performance was related to older age and volume shrinkage of nodes in the dorsolateral processing stream. When displays allowed perceptual grouping through distractor homogeneity, poorer conjunction-search performance correlated with smaller ventrolateral prefrontal cortical and callosal volumes. An alerting cue attenuated age effects on conjunction search, and the alertness benefit was associated with thalamic, callosal, and temporal cortex volumes. Our results indicate that older adults can capitalize on early parallel stages of visual information processing, whereas age-related limitations arise at later serial processing stages requiring self-guided selective attention and executive control. These limitations are explained in part by age-related brain volume shrinkage and can be mitigated by external cues. ","831":"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can perform poorly on tasks involving theory of mind (ToM): the ability to reason about mental states. We investigated whether patients' ToM deficits were independent of executive dysfunction. Experiment 1 aimed to establish that ToM deficits were present, and 2 following experiments manipulated the working memory (WM) demands of the ToM task. In Experiment 1, 15 patients with PD performed significantly more poorly than controls on a false belief vignette task but not on a faux pas task. Errors were related to poor verbal fluency. In Experiment 2, 24 patients with PD made fewer errors on shorter false belief vignettes than the original FBT, and errors on the latter were related to WM impairment. In Experiment 3, the FBT was presented as a comic strip visible throughout questioning, reducing WM demands. Patients (n = 24) made memory errors but no false belief errors on the comic strip. They exhibited no verbal fluency or WM impairments, but did exhibit deficits on a black-and-white Stroop task. False belief errors were not correlated with executive performance. PD patients made very few ToM errors that were independent of errors on memory questions, so in this sample, ToM deficits per se appear unlikely. However, patients still made errors on ToM tasks when associated incidental WM demands were considerably reduced, highlighting the need for future investigations of ToM in PD to account for the role of more general cognitive restrictions exhibited by even some medicated, early stage patients. ","832":"Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) may involve specific impairments in acquiring automaticity under working memory load. This study examined whether implicit sequence learning, with or without a secondary task, is impaired in patients with FOG. Fourteen freezers (FRs), 14 nonfreezers (nFRs), and 14 matched healthy controls (HCs) performed a serial reaction time (SRT) task with a deterministic stimulus sequence under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. The increase in reaction times (RTs) for random compared with sequenced blocks was used as a measure of implicit sequence learning. Neuropsychological tests assessing global cognitive functioning and executive dysfunction were administered in order to investigate their relation to sequence learning. nFRs and HCs showed significant implicit sequence learning effects (p &lt; 0.001). FRs demonstrated a tendency to learn sequence-specific information in the SRT-ST task (p = 0.07) but not in the SRT-DT task (p = 0.69). Severity of FOG, however, correlated positively with SRT-DT task performance (r = -0.56; p &lt; 0.05). The present results suggest that PD patients suffering from FOG pathology exhibit a specific impairment in the acquisition of automaticity. When working memory capacity is supplementarily loaded by adding a DT, sequence learning in FRs becomes increasingly impaired. These findings indicate that therapies should focus on extensive training in acquiring novel motor activities and reducing working memory load to improve learning in FOG. ","833":"Although several studies have investigated developmental trajectories of executive functioning (EF) in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) using lab-based tasks, no study to date has directly measured how EF skills in everyday settings vary at different ages. The current study seeks to extend prior work by evaluating age-related differences in parent-reported EF problems during childhood and adolescence in a large cross-sectional cohort of children with ASD. Children (N = 185) with an ASD without intellectual disability participated in the study. Participants were divided into four groups based on age (5-7, 8-10, 11-13, and 14-18-year-olds). The four age groups did not differ in IQ, sex ratio, or autism symptoms. There were significant age effects (i.e., worsening scores with increasing age) in three of G. A. Gioia, P. K. Isquith, S. Guy, and L. Kenworthy's (2000) BRIEF: Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Odessa, FL, Psychological Assessment Resources scale scores: Initiate (p = .007), working memory (p = .003), and organization of materials (p = .023). In addition, analysis of the BRIEF scale profile revealed that, although multiple scales were elevated, the shift scale showed the greatest problems in both the youngest and oldest age cohorts. Older children with ASD show greater EF problems compared with the normative sample than younger children with ASD. Specifically, there is a widening divergence from the normative sample in metacognitive executive abilities in children with ASD as they age. This, in combination with significant, albeit more stable, impairments in flexibility, has implications for the challenges faced by high-functioning individuals with ASD as they attempt to enter mainstream work and social environments. ","834":"To examine the relative contributions of injury characteristics and noninjury child and family factors as predictors of postconcussive symptoms (PCS) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children. Participants were 8- to 15-year-old children, 186 with mild TBI and 99 with mild orthopedic injuries (OI). Parents and children rated PCS shortly after injury and at 1, 3, and 12 months postinjury. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to predict PCS from (1) demographic variables; (2) premorbid child factors (WASI IQ; WRAT-3 Reading; Child Behavior Checklist; ratings of preinjury PCS); (3) family factors (Family Assessment Device General Functioning Scale; Brief Symptom Inventory; and Life Stressors and Social Resources Inventory); and (4) injury group (OI, mild TBI with loss of consciousness [LOC] and associated injuries [AI], mild TBI with LOC but without AI, mild TBI without LOC but with AI, and mild TBI without LOC or AI). Injury group predicted parent and child ratings of PCS but showed a decreasing contribution over time. Demographic variables consistently predicted symptom ratings across time. Premorbid child factors, especially retrospective ratings of premorbid symptoms, accounted for the most variance in symptom ratings. Family factors, particularly parent adjustment, consistently predicted parent, but not child, ratings of PCS. Injury characteristics predict PCS in the first months following mild TBI but show a decreasing contribution over time. In contrast, noninjury factors are more consistently related to persistent PCS. ","835":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting social function and communication. Recently, there has been an interest in whether people with ASD also show memory deficits. Studies in ASD have revealed subtle impairments on tasks requiring participants to learn new information (episodic memory), but intact performance on general knowledge tasks (semantic memory). The novelty of this study was to explore metamemory (i.e., awareness of memory performance) and to examine whether children with ASD suffer from a generalized metamemory deficit common to all forms of memory, or would only present deficits on episodic metamemory tasks. To assess metamemory functioning we administered 2 feeling-of-knowing (FOK) tasks, 1 for episodic and 1 for semantic materials. In these tasks, participants are asked to predict the likelihood of subsequently recognizing currently unrecalled information. It was found that children with autism made inaccurate FOK predictions, but only for episodic materials. A specific deficit in meta-cognition emerges for only one set of materials. We argue that this deficit can be conceived of as reflecting a deficit in recollection, stemming from an inability to cast the self in the past and retrieve information about the study episode. ","836":"Characterization of clinical heterogeneity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains controversial. Neuropsychological and cognitive studies provide one type of validation data, but too often have considered only a narrow range of functional domains. The current study examined ADHD subtype and presentation differences across a broad range of neurocognitive domains in a large clinically characterized, community-recruited sample of 498 youth (213 control, 107 ADHD-primarily inattentive [ADHD-PI], 137 ADHD-combined [ADHD-C]), ages 6-17 years. Domains assessed included inhibition, working memory, arousal, processing speed, response variability, and temporal information processing. Youth with ADHD-C performed worse than youth with ADHD-PI in all domains, consistent with a severity model. Performance among a subgroup with a \"restrictive inattentive\" presentation indicated potential deficits in processing speed relative to other ADHD-PI youth, but no other effects. When all measures were included in the same model, cognitive control (executive functions, working memory, and memory span), arousal, and response variability each provided uniquely incremental statistical prediction of specific symptom dimensions and of subtype\/presentation, but temporal information processing and processing speed did not. Results suggest the potential to consolidate multiple neurocognitive theories of ADHD, and that such consolidation will apply across putative clinical subtypes or presentations. ","837":"Autobiographical memory (AM) comprises autobiographical episodes (AE) and personal semantics (PS). Self-defining memories (SDMs) represent peculiar memories highly relevant to personality processes and constitute crucial source for the self. To date, no research has compared normal and pathological age-related changes in the AE and PS aspects of AM (including SDMs) and their link with the self. Young adults, older adults, and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were asked to retrieve 10 AEs, 10 PSs, and 10 SDMs based on identical cue-words and to complete a subjective self-concept scale measuring the degree of certainty and the valence of the self. Memory performance was evaluated for specificity and for emotional valence using quantitative scoring based on standard neuropsychological assessments. Compared with young adults, older adults and AD patients demonstrated a deficit in AE; nevertheless, the three groups performed equally for PS. Remarkably, older adults did not differ from young adults for SDMs characterized by high episodicity (SDMe), unlike AD patients. Concerning the self-concept scale, the valence of the self was more positive in healthy subjects than in AD patients, the latter showing higher scores for the degree of certainty. Self-concept measures were correlated with AM scores, especially SDMe, in young and older subjects but not in AD patients. The implication of these findings is discussed to portray the differences between normal aging and AD concerning the link between AM and the self. ","838":"Bimanual movements are a fundamental motor skill. Whereas substantial research is available from right-handers, much less is known from left-handers. Accordingly, in the present electroencephalography (EEG) study we evaluated bimanual behavior in left- versus right-handers. Thirteen left-handers and 13 right-handers took part in the experiment. Cortical dynamics were evaluated by means of EEG coherence in the beta frequency band (14-28 Hz), and behavioral performance was measured using motor error. The EEG data revealed that right-handers showed a left-sided lateralization pattern whereas left-handers demonstrated a bilateral organization pattern during symmetrical actions. Asymmetry of the bimanual task demands modified the hemispheric profile for both groups and resulted in an additional involvement of the motor-nondominant hemisphere. Brain-behavioral correlations underlined that response planning strongly relied on the left hemisphere irrespective of handedness whereas the motor-dominant hemisphere drove response execution. The findings suggest that skilled motor planning may develop preferentially in the left hemisphere. ","839":"Previous research demonstrated that individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD) may suffer from a deficit in the acquisition stage of a new skill, whereas consolidation processes seem to be preserved. The present study was designed to examine whether this impaired acquisition was attributable to a lack of automatization, and whether the reported preserved consolidation was attributable to the use of DDs' conscious compensation strategies. These aims were implemented by testing a skill-learning task in dyslexics and normal readers using a dual task paradigm. The impact of dual task costs on participants' performance was used as an indication for automaticity. DD and control groups completed a sequence-learning task over a first session (acquisition) and a second session 24 hours later (consolidation). The task was performed by half of the participants under a full attention condition and by the other half under a divided attention condition. Consistent with previous reports in the literature, divided attention impaired sequence learning in both groups. Nevertheless, divided attention resulted in delayed acquisition of the motor skill in the DD group compared with normal readers. Finally, divided attention enhanced motor procedural consolidation only in the control group. The differential effect of divided attention on acquisition and consolidation of procedural skill in DD and normal readers supports the cerebellum deficit hypothesis in DD. In addition, the enhanced skill consolidation in normal readers under divided attention suggests that attentional requirements are not necessary for all types of human learning. ","840":"To examine differences in patterns of brain activation associated with a race-related social evaluative task for a sample of African American and White American adults. Participants were exposed to images of White American and African American targets embedded in various contexts across three emotional valences: angry\/hostile, happy\/joyful, and neutral\/ambiguous. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure brain activity. Between-group comparisons revealed that African Americans, as compared to White Americans, exhibited activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus to images of happy (vs. neutral) same-race targets. White Americans, compared, to African Americans displayed activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex to images of happy (vs. neutral) same-race targets. Activation in limbic areas was observed for African Americans to neutral (vs. happy) images of White American targets, while no significant pattern of activation was found for White Americans to images of neutral\/ambiguous African American targets. A significant correlation was found between scores for previous exposure to race-related incidents and amygdala activation for African Americans to White American targets. White Americans generally exhibited more activation in regions associated with conflict resolution and cognitive control, while African Americans exhibited activation mostly in areas associated with emotion and memory. Our findings further imply that previous exposure to race-related incidents for African Americans may alter neural responses to White American targets in imaging studies. Implications of the findings are discussed. ","841":"Researchers in the cognitive sciences have demonstrated the existence of processing capacity bottlenecks in the human brain. These capacity bottlenecks restrict our ability to process and act on environmental information. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show reduced capacity of working memory and response selection mechanisms. Thirty-eight young adults with ADHD and 33 comparison adults were assessed using two measures of processing capacity. A dual choice-response task (psychological refractory period [PRP] task) measured response selection capacity, and an n-back task measured working memory capacity. These tasks measured capacity by assessing the degree to which increasing processing load disrupted performance. Results confirmed that performance declined as cognitive load was increased, and this was true for both groups on each task. On the PRP task, the performance decline resulting from increased cognitive load was more pronounced in the ADHD group than in the control group, indicative of reduced response selection capacity in the ADHD group. On the n-back task, however, there was no group difference in the degree to which increasing processing load disrupted performance. Results indicate that adults with ADHD show a specific capacity reduction of response selection. This evidence suggests a dissociation between working memory and response selection capacities, and it may have implications for understanding cognitive dysfunction in adults with ADHD. ","842":"Slow and variable reaction times (RTs) on fast tasks are such a prominent feature of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that any theory must account for them. However, this has proven difficult because the cognitive mechanisms responsible for this effect remain unexplained. Although speed and variability are typically correlated, it is unclear whether single or multiple mechanisms are responsible for group differences in each. RTs are a result of several semi-independent processes, including stimulus encoding, rate of information processing, speed-accuracy trade-offs, and motor response, which have not been previously well characterized. A diffusion model was applied to RTs from a forced-choice RT paradigm in two large, independent case-control samples (NCohort 1 = 214 and NCohort 2 = 172). The decomposition measured three validated parameters that account for the full RT distribution and assessed reproducibility of ADHD effects. In both samples, group differences in traditional RT variables were explained by slow information processing speed, and unrelated to speed-accuracy trade-offs or nondecisional processes (e.g., encoding, motor response). RT speed and variability in ADHD may be explained by a single information processing parameter, potentially simplifying explanations that assume different mechanisms are required to account for group differences in the mean and variability of RTs.

Participants included 85 HIV+ individuals (83 males, 2 females) and 25 age-comparable HIV- individuals (22 males, 3 females). Participants underwent The University of Pennsylvania computerized neuropsychological facial emotion test battery, standardized neuropsychological testing, neurobehavioral questionnaires, a semistructured psychiatric interview, and an assessment of independence in activities of daily living. Relative to HIV- controls, HIV+ individuals showed a mild difference for recognition of sadness (p = .02, d = 0.43), discrimination of happiness (p = .02, d = 0.52), and speed of recognition for fear (p = .04, d = 0.37). HIV+ individuals with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND; 20%) had abnormal emotional facial recognition (p = .04; d = .59), and slower recognition of negative facial expressions (p &lt; .01; d = .63-.83), as well as poorer discrimination of happy facial expressions (p &lt; .003, d = .83). Apathy, depression, reduced independence in activities of daily living, and HIV biomarkers were not associated with reduced facial emotion recognition in the HIV+ group. Clinically stable HIV+ individuals show a mild level of emotional processing reduction that is dissociated from neuropsychiatric complaints. Individuals with HAND showed moderate to large emotional processing abnormalities, particularly for the timely recognition of negative expressions (fear, sadness, and anger). These findings warrant a more comprehensive and dynamic evaluation of emotional processing in HIV infection and an investigation of the integrity of the fronto-basal-amygdala circuits. ","846":"Age differences in episodic memory (memory) have been attributed to a general reduction in processing speed (the \"speed mediation hypothesis\"), but also to declines in the efficiency of executive functions operations (\"executive decline hypothesis\"). To test predictions from these competing models, we examined the mediating effects of processing speed (speed) and executive functions (executive) on age and episodic memory in three older adult cohorts. The first sample comprised 842 individuals from the Sydney Memory and Aging Study (MAS). The second and third samples included 476 individuals from the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS), with each twin from a pair randomly assigned to form two samples. A series of regression analyses was performed on each of the three samples independently, so as to obtain the sizes and statistical significances of the indirect effects of age on each of the memory variables, mediated by each of the Executive and Speed composites. Sex was a control variable for all analyses. Analyses were repeated with current depression as an additional control variable. Data from the MAS sample suggested that both Speed and Executive composites were significant mediators, with the former having a stronger mediation effect. A similar pattern was found in the two OATS samples. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies in which speed had a stronger mediating effect than executive on age-related variation in memory. They provide further support for the speed mediation hypothesis, although not negating the executive decline hypothesis. ","847":"In cortical deafness, no auditory signals can be perceived by the cortex despite normal peripheral hearing. Cortical deafness rarely persists, but generally evolves into other cortical auditory syndromes. In this report, we describe a patient showing a stable and persisting pattern of cortical deafness 16 months after two major ischemic strokes. Voxel based morphometric evidence from high resolution three-dimensional MRI and data from tractography are reported for the first time, to our knowledge, in this syndrome in addition to behavioral and electrophysiological findings. The most remarkable findings came from the tractography data, where an asymmetric pattern was found showing severe damage of connections within the anterior right hemisphere, in regions subserving self-awareness. Frontal asymmetry, although detectable by the morphometric analysis, was less informative than that detected in the tractography data. The evidence from this case study suggests that damage to the neural systems involved in awareness may play an important role in the emergence of cortical deafness and its persistence. ","848":"Impairment in cognitive function is a core feature of schizophrenia and other psychoses. Substance misuse is associated with impairment in cognitive function in the healthy population. Due to the high prevalence of substance misuse in those with a psychotic disorder, there is concern that a \"double deficit\" may result in this population. The aim of the current systematic review was to give an overview of the literature, to date, that has investigated the effect of illegal substance abuse or dependence on cognitive function in those with a psychotic disorder and to evaluate the differences and limitations in the methodologies used. A systematic review and evaluation of the current literature comparing those with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder with and without a history of substance abuse or dependence was conducted. A meta-analysis was also conducted to quantitatively assess the association between substance use and cognitive function in those with a psychotic disorder. The current literature investigating the impact of substance misuse on cognitive function in those with a psychotic disorder suffers from many methodological limitations. The results of the meta-analysis show that substance users performed significantly better than nonusers in the cognitive domains of attention and psychomotor speed and verbal memory, with no \"double deficit\" apparent. The results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution, in light of the methodological difficulties reviewed. ","849":"Many investigations have found deficits in visuospatial perception in children born preterm, however, it is not clear whether the deficits are specific to visuospatial perception or the consequences of deficits in other functional areas, which often accompany preterm birth. This study investigated whether children born preterm show a specific deficit in visuospatial perception. Fifty-six 7- to 11-year-old preterm born children (gestational age &lt;34 weeks) without cerebral palsy and 51 age-matched, full-term children completed four computerized tasks tapping different levels and types of visuospatial perception. Accuracy and speed of responses were recorded. Task formats were designed to reduce demands on attentional deployment. Measures of intelligence and parental education were included in the analysis. Children born preterm performed less accurately and\/or less rapidly on all tasks. Their poorer performance did not reflect differences in speed-accuracy trade-off. Parental education and IQ, both significantly lower in the preterm children, contributed positively to performance on all tasks. IQ mediated the association between preterm birth and visuospatial performance on the most cognitively demanding task. Children born preterm performed more poorly than full-term controls on four visuospatial perceptual tasks. Although intelligence and parental education were also associated with performance, preterm birth contributed independently of these factors on three of four tasks. Many children born preterm are thus multiply disadvantaged on visuospatial tasks: the lower IQ scores and parental educational levels frequently found in this group increase the deficit associated with preterm birth. ","850":"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a hereditary metabolic disorder that often results in neuropsychological impairment, even in individuals treated early and continuously. This study was conducted to examine processing speed, variability in processing speed, and the relationship between processing speed variables and executive abilities in children with early and continuously treated PKU. Participants were 42 children with PKU and 81 typically developing children from 7 to 18 years of age. Children completed 3 computerized reaction time (RT) tasks (simple RT, go\/no-go, stimulus-response compatibility) and 7 tasks assessing executive abilities (working memory, inhibitory control, strategic processing). Performance of children with PKU was significantly slower and more variable than that of controls across the 3 tasks administered. When age was considered, it was shown that processing speed improved with age to a comparable degree for both groups. Variability in processing speed, however, decreased more with age for the PKU than control group, reflecting the fact that variability in younger, but not older, children with PKU was greater than that of controls. With regard to executive abilities, processing speed and variability contributed to performance on most, but not all, executive tasks; and after controlling for processing speed and variability, executive impairments were still identified in working memory and inhibitory control (not strategic processing). These findings indicate that information processing is slower and less efficient in children with PKU. In addition, processing speed and variability contribute to some, but not all, of the impairments in executive abilities observed in children with PKU. ","851":"The day-out task (DOT), a naturalistic task that requires multitasking in a real-world setting, was used to examine everyday functioning in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirty-eight participants with MCI and 38 cognitively healthy older adult controls prioritized, organized, initiated, and completed a number of subtasks in a campus apartment to prepare for a day out (e.g., determine and gather change for bus, bring a magazine). Participants also completed tests assessing cognitive constructs important in multitasking (i.e., retrospective memory, prospective memory, planning). As compared with controls, the MCI group required more time to complete the DOT and demonstrated poorer task accuracy, performing more subtasks incompletely and inaccurately. Despite poorer DOT task accuracy, the MCI and control groups approached completion of the DOT in a similar manner. For the MCI group, retrospective memory was a unique predictor of the number of subtasks left incomplete and inaccurate, while prospective memory was a unique predictor of DOT sequencing. The DOT measures, but not the cognitive tests, were predictive of knowledgeable informant report of everyday functioning. THESE findings suggest that difficulty remembering and keeping track of multiple goals and subgoals may contribute to the poorer performance of individuals with MCI in complex everyday situations.

This study examined the relationship between depressive symptom severity and measures of executive functioning, learning\/memory, and attention in prodromal HD. Participants (814 prodromal HD, 230 gene-negative) completed a neuropsychological test battery and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Based on the BDI-II, there were 637 participants with minimal depression, 89 with mild depression, 61 with moderate depression, and 27 with severe depression in the prodromal HD group. ANCOVA (controlling for age, sex, and education) revealed that performance on SDMT, Trails B, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test--Revised (HVLT-R) Immediate Recall, and Stroop interference was significantly different between the BDI-II severity groups, with the moderate and severe groups performing worse than the minimal and mild groups. There were no significant differences between the BDI-II severity groups for Trails A or HVLT-R Delayed Recall. Linear regression revealed that both gene status and depression severity were significant predictors of performance on all cognitive tests examined, with contributions of BDI-II and gene status comparable for Trails A, SDMT, and Stroop interference. Gene status had a higher contribution for HVLT-R Immediate and Delayed Recall and Trails B. Our results suggest that depressive symptom severity is related to poorer cognitive performance in individuals with prodromal HD. Though there are currently no approved therapies for cognitive impairment in HD, our findings suggest that depression may be a treatable contributor to cognitive impairment in this population. ","854":"Patients with unipolar depressive disorder may present with cognitive deficits in the remitted state, and the aim of the present study was to investigate whether cognitive deficits within specific cognitive domains are present. Via the Danish registers (Civil Person Register, Danish Psychiatric Register) we identified individuals between 40 and 80 years of age with a diagnosis of unipolar disorder at their first discharge from a psychiatric hospital, and a gender- and age-matched control group. Particular emphasis was placed on assuring that patients were in a remitted state. Cognitive function was assessed with a broad range of neuropsychological tests. A total of 88 patients and 50 controls were included in the study. In multiple linear regression analyses with simultaneous adjustment for age, gender, education level, premorbid IQ, and residual depressive symptoms, a diagnosis of unipolar disorder predicted lower performance on the Trail Making Test, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and on the Stroop test. Cognitive deficits are present in patients with unipolar disorder in the remitted state. The deficits seem to reside more within the cognitive domain of attention than within other domains, and may be characterized by impairment of processing speed and cognitive flexibility. ","855":"It has traditionally been thought that covert face recognition cannot be observed in developmental cases of prosopagnosia, because the phenomenon is thought to rely on the activation of face representations created during a period of normal processing. Yet, recent studies have provided evidence of covert recognition in some developmental cases, and critically the findings of one study suggest that these individuals might be processing faces on an affective dimension rather than a familiarity dimension. The current study aimed to examine this possibility using a physiological measure of covert recognition, the skin conductance response (SCR). One 61-year-old male with developmental prosopagnosia and 10 age-matched (M = 59.80 years, SD = 4.02) controls (5 men) took part in this study. Participants viewed a set of 15 famous faces intermixed with 30 novel faces, and the SCR was recorded throughout. Although control participants demonstrated an increased SCR for famous faces in comparison with novel faces, t(9) = 2.112, p = .032, d = .382, the same finding was not observed in Patient WS. However, when WS' increase in SCR was correlated with his affective ratings of the celebrities from name cues, a strong negative correlation was observed (r = -.614, n = 34, p = .020). This pattern of findings was interpreted as evidence that WS is covertly processing faces on an affective dimension rather than a familiarity dimension, and fits well with recent neurophysiological findings that support hypotheses for independent processing of cognitive and affective information. ","856":"Word comprehension deficits in neurodegenerative conditions are most striking in the syndrome of semantic dementia. Tests of word comprehension typically examine concrete and abstract nonemotion words. Whether or not understanding of words describing emotion concepts (e.g., insulted, fascinated) is also impaired in the dementias has not been systematically investigated. Patients with semantic dementia (SD; n = 8), behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n = 8), Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 12), as well as healthy controls (n = 15) completed newly designed emotion word comprehension tasks. Participants also undertook the Graded Synonyms Test, an abstract and concrete nonemotion word comprehension measure. Degradation of knowledge about negative and positive emotion words was most impaired in SD. Correlation analyses in the SD group also showed that knowledge of emotion words correlated with the understanding of abstract nonemotion words. The bvFTD group was impaired only when making associations for emotion words. The AD cohort did not differ from controls on any measures of word comprehension. Impairment in word knowledge is greatest in the syndrome of SD, compared with bvFTD and AD, and includes concrete words, abstract words as well as emotion words. Importantly, word comprehension deficits affect positive and negative emotions. ","857":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the qualitative characteristics of semantic impairment in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, we wanted to verify if subordinate and distinctive concept features are affected earlier than superordinate or shared ones and whether sensory features are more vulnerable than nonsensory ones. Also, we investigated if feature correlation and level of feature occurrence in concept description (dominance) influence the resilience of concept features to degenerative damage. We administered a feature-listing task to nine mild and 10 moderate AD patients and 19 matched healthy controls. The concepts utilized were taken from a normative database, which allowed quantifying semantic indexes of the concepts representation, that is, feature type, distinctiveness, correlation, and dominance. Data confirmed that although semantic knowledge of concepts is overall impoverished in AD patients, (a) superordinate knowledge is better preserved than other types of knowledge, (b) nonsensory information is more preserved than sensory information, and (c) highly shared features are less affected than distinctive ones. Furthermore, patients' feature production was influenced by dominance and by age of acquisition. These data are in line with theories postulating that among the dimensions along which feature-based semantic representations may vary, those relative to type and distinctiveness are most sensitive to the differential effect of AD. Results also showed a preserved implicit knowledge about how informative a given feature is in these patients and highlighted the importance of early acquisition of concept knowledge for resilience to degenerative damage. ","858":"Individuals' cognitive abilities predict functional outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is not known to what extent concurrent cognitive abilities affect the magnitude or the rate of functional recovery. The current study modeled the progression of functional outcome as it related to background, injury severity, and cognitive variables over the first year postinjury. This study comprised 111 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI assessed on average at 3, 6, and 13 months postinjury. In addition, 79 healthy controls were assessed at a single time point. Each assessment consisted of an administration of a neuropsychological battery--comprising measures of memory, information processing speed, and executive functions--as well as an administration of the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory to examine functional outcomes. Older age, lower levels of education, and greater days of posttraumatic amnesia were associated with poorer functional outcomes. The addition of cognitive variables resulted in better models than simply considering background and injury severity variables. However, the results showed that the model comprising executive functions best characterized the progression of functional outcomes. The findings indicate that consideration of cognitive ability, rather than reliance on demographic and injury severity variables, provide a more accurate representation of functional outcome over the first year postinjury. In addition, the results suggest that specific cognitive domains, particularly executive functions, are likely to have the strongest effect on functional outcomes. ","859":"Right-brain-damaged patients with left spatial neglect make perseveration errors in target cancellation tasks. A recent study (Ronchi, Posteraro, Fortis, Bricolo, &amp; Vallar, 2009) showed that perseveration occurred more frequently in star than in letter cancellation, possibly due to different stimulus disposition. In this study we investigated the role of the spatial organization of targets (scattered vs. arranged) of the star and letter cancellation tasks in eliciting omission and perseveration errors; the role of impairments of divided attentional resources; and the lesion correlates of perseveration. Thirty-three right-brain-damaged patients (27 with neglect, and six without neglect; 17 showing perseveration, 16 of them with spatial neglect) were given two versions of the star and letter cancellation tasks (with stimuli scattered or in rows), and a dual task. A scattered target disposition increased omission and perseveration errors. Target type modulated differently omission and perseveration, with the former being more elicited by verbal targets, and the latter occurring more frequently in the star cancellation task, with scattered stimuli. Perseveration behavior was unrelated to deficits of divided attention, as assessed by the dual task. Lesion analysis indicated damage to the right insula as a neural correlate of perseveration. A display including nonverbal (star) and scattered targets brings about more perseveration errors. Target type and organization modulate in a different fashion omission and perseveration, suggesting the involvement of independent pathological mechanisms, which, however, do not implicate deficits of divided attention. The role of insular damage in motor perseveration in spatial neglect is discussed. ","860":"This study examines the association between neurocognitive functioning and tobacco smoking in adolescence. Data from three measurements of the longitudinal Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a large regional population-based cohort study of Dutch adolescents, were used. The first measurement took place in 2001-2002 (T1) when participants were age 11, with two follow-up measurements (2003-2004 and 2005-2007; T2 and T3, respectively). A total of 1,797 adolescents participated in all three waves. At T1, they performed a selection of tasks from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks program (De Sonneville, 1999), which enabled the assessment of the main aspects of neurocognitive functioning. Smoking was assessed with a self-report questionnaire at T1, T2, and T3. In the multivariate analyses we controlled for gender, age, socioeconomic status (SES) and baseline speed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that poor sustained attention increased the likelihood that the adolescent would initiate smoking between T1 and T2. Low inhibition of prepotent responses increased the likelihood of smoking initiation between T1 and T3. An increased ability to inhibit biased response tendencies reduced the likelihood of being a daily smoker at T2. Poor sustained attention increased the likelihood of being a daily smoker at T3. Poor sustained attention and low inhibition predicted adolescent smoking. However, the proportion of the variance in smoking risk accounted for by these neurocognitive predictors proved to be small. Thus, although neurocognitive functioning is related to adolescent smoking, it seems to explain only a small part of why adolescents initiate and continue smoking. ","861":"The current study examined whether year-to-year variability in cognitive performance differ between individuals cognitively unimpaired and individuals who subsequently develop dementia. Analyses included a case-control sample of Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; mean [M] age = 69.90, standard deviation [SD] = 8.92) participants. One hundred and 35 clinically diagnosed demented participants were matched with 135 nondemented participants based on age at initial testing and sex. Cognitive performance was examined using measures of memory, executive function, attention, language, and global mental status performance. Cognitive performance was examined from baseline to 5 years before cognitive impairment (M, assessments = 3.03, SD = 2.80). As compared with unimpaired individuals, individuals diagnosed with dementia had greater variability on measures of attention, executive function, language, and semantic memory at least 5 years before the estimated onset of cognitive impairment, which may be indicative of maladaptive cognitive functioning. The dementia cases, however, had less variability on visual memory than the unimpaired group, which may suggest that these cases had more difficulty learning. These results demonstrate that performance variability indexed over annual or biennial visits may be useful in identifying early signs of subsequent cognitive impairment.

The aim of this investigation was to assess the extent to which failures in sustained attention may underlie deficits in cognition associated with poorer aerobic fitness. A sample of 62 preadolescent children between the ages of 9 and 10 years were separated into higher- and lower-fit groups according to their cardiorespiratory fitness. Findings indicated that lower-fit children exhibited poorer overall response accuracy during a task requiring aspects of cognitive control relative to their higher-fit counterparts, with a disproportionately greater number of errors of omission, and longer, more frequent sequential errors of omission. These findings suggest that poorer vigilance may contribute to deficits in cognitive control associated with poorer aerobic fitness. ","865":"There is a persistent theory that birth stress and subsequent brain pathology play an important role in the manifestation of left-handedness. Evidence for this theory, however, is mixed and studies are often beset with problems related to small sample sizes and unreliable health reports. TO avoid these issues, this study used a sample of approximately 10,000 children from the British Cohort Study. The study contains objective birth-health reports and comprehensive measures of socioeconomic status, handedness, cognitive ability, and behavioral\/health issues. Regression analyses showed that variables associated with birth stress affected cognitive\/behavioral\/health outcomes of the child. Despite this, these same factors did not affect the direction or degree of hand preference. We have therefore demonstrated a dissociation whereby adverse birth factors affect the brain's cognitive ability, but not handedness, and by implication, cerebral lateralization. The study also demonstrated a link between left-handedness and reduced levels of cognitive ability. This link cannot be due a generalized birth-stress mechanism and may be caused by specific mechanisms related to changes in cerebral dominance. ","866":"Chimeric free-viewing laterality tasks have been used extensively as measures of right-hemisphere functioning, with many variations in stimuli and samples typically showing an LVF bias. However, the questions remain concerning whether the LVF bias is significantly different from zero, and what factors might moderate this bias. The present meta-analysis answered these questions by retrieving a presumably exhaustive sample of studies published in English that involved free viewing of stimuli. The final analysis was based on 329 effect sizes drawn from 112 published studies. A hierarchical linear model (or multilevel) approach to meta-analysis was used to deal with the violation of the independence of effect-sizes assumption and to reflect better the hierarchical structure of the data. A large and significant left visual-field (LVF) bias (estimated mean d = 1.024) was demonstrated across the entire set of retrieved effect sizes. It was also demonstrated that such tasks are a useful tool for discriminating between various clinical populations. Finally, the moderator analysis identified that emotion faces (estimated mean d = 1.052) and timed conditions (estimated mean d = 1.319) appear to promote large effects. The present meta-analysis validated free-viewing laterality tasks as tools for neuropsychological assessment and for empirical research. ","867":"Contrary to traditional models of verbal short-term memory (STM), psycholinguistic accounts assume that temporary retention of verbal materials is an intrinsic property of word processing. Therefore, memory performance will depend on the nature of the STM tasks, which vary according to the linguistic representations they engage. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of response modality on verbal STM performance in individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT), and its relationship with the patients' word-processing deficits. Twenty individuals with mild DAT and 20 controls were tested on an immediate serial recall (ISR) task using the same items across two response modalities (oral and picture pointing) and completed a detailed language assessment. When scoring of ISR performance was based on item memory regardless of item order, a response modality effect was found for all participants, indicating that they recalled more items with picture pointing than with oral response. However, this effect was less marked in patients than in controls, resulting in an interaction. Interestingly, when recall of both item and order was considered, results indicated similar performance between response modalities in controls, whereas performance was worse for pointing than for oral response in patients. Picture-naming performance was also reduced in patients relative to controls. However, in the word-to-picture matching task, a similar pattern of responses was found between groups for incorrectly named pictures of the same items. The finding of a response modality effect in item memory for all participants is compatible with the assumption that semantic influences are greater in picture pointing than in oral response, as predicted by psycholinguistic models. Furthermore, patients' performance was modulated by their word-processing deficits, showing a reduced advantage relative to controls. Overall, the response modality effect observed in this study for item memory suggests that verbal STM performance is intrinsically linked with word processing capacities in both healthy controls and individuals with mild DAT, supporting psycholinguistic models of STM. ","868":"The objective was to investigate the electrophysiological (ERP) correlates of mismatched expression on face recognition in schizophrenia. Expression-change effects and associated ERPs were explored in patients with schizophrenia (n = 20) and paired comparison participants (n = 20) on a long-term face-recognition task. A facial-expression change decreased discriminability for patients with schizophrenia than for healthy participants. The patients' recognition deficit was accompanied by the absence of the midfrontal FN400 and late parietal ERP old\/new effects in the mismatched-expression condition. By contrast, preserved midfrontal FN400 and late parietal ERP old\/new effects were found in both groups in the unchanged-expression condition. Thus, the preserved parietal old\/new effect previously observed in schizophrenia was no longer found here in the situation in which expression changes took place between the study and recognition phases. These findings suggest that, when they are not supposed to take the change of expression into account, the recognition deficit observed here in patients with schizophrenia resulted from an impairment in the mechanisms underlying the emergence, assessment, or utilization of familiarity--as indexed by the ERP old\/new effects. In these natural conditions, the impact of the expression change on the implementation of retrieval processes offers new insight into schizophrenia-linked deficits in face recognition, with substantial phenomenological differences with respect to the emergence of familiarity. ","869":null,"870":"Many tests of hemispatial neglect are insensitive to subtle (but clinically relevant) forms of the disorder. This study provides additional reliability and validity data on the Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test (VRLAT), an easy-to-administer computerized measure of hemispatial neglect that mimics the attentional demands of real-world tasks, and has previously shown strong validity and sensitivity (Dawson, Buxbaum, &amp; Rizzo, 2008). The present study assessed a large sample of patients with the aim of developing a clinically useful version of the test, and established the concurrent criterion validity of the VRLAT as measured by its association with performance in a real-world task. Seventy consecutively recruited right-hemisphere stroke patients were assessed with the VRLAT, which requires participants to name objects as they navigate (or are navigated) along a winding virtual path. They also performed a real-world navigation task, tests of sensory and motor function, and paper-and-pencil neglect tests. The VRLAT demonstrated strong sensitivity and specificity, minimal practice effects, and strong validity, and outperformed traditional paper-and-pencil tests in the prediction of real-world collisions. The VRLAT is a sensitive, valid, and reliable measure of hemispatial neglect that requires no specialized equipment, is easy to administer, and is useful for both clinical and research purposes. Moreover, a shortened version with a 5-min administration time has many of the desirable psychometric properties of the original full-length task. ","871":null,"872":"Patients with schizophrenia have widespread cognitive impairments, with selective deficits in relational memory. We previously reported a differential relational memory deficit in schizophrenia using the Associative Inference Paradigm (AIP), a task suggested by the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative to examine relational memory. However, the AIP had limited feasibility for testing in schizophrenia because of high attrition of schizophrenia patients during training. Here we developed and tested a revised version of the AIP to improve feasibility. 30 healthy control and 37 schizophrenia subjects received 3 study-test sessions on 3 sets of paired associates: H-F1 (house paired with face), H-F2 (same house paired with new face), and F3-F4 (two novel faces). After training, subjects were tested on the trained, noninferential Face-Face pairs (F3-F4) and novel, inferential Face-Face pairs (F1-F2), constructed from the faces of the trained House-Face pairs. Schizophrenia patients were significantly more impaired on the inferential F1-F2 pairs than the noninferential F3-F4 pairs, providing evidence for a differential relational memory deficit. Only 8% of schizophrenia patients were excluded from testing because of poor training performance. The revised AIP confirmed the previous finding of a relational memory deficit in a larger and more representative sample of schizophrenia patients. ","873":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is associated with impaired executive control. The aim of the current research was to test the hypothesis that concept formation deficits associated with an extramotor neurocognitive network involving executive and semantic resources can be found in some ALS patients. Forty-one patients with clinically definite ALS were assessed with Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (D-KEFS), a measure of concept formation requiring patients to manipulate verbal and visual semantic information and neuropsychological tests measuring naming, semantic memory, and executive control. Using D-KEFS scale scores, a k-mean cluster analysis specifying a 3-group solution was able to classify ALS patients into groups presenting with mildly impaired, average, and above average sorting test performance. High-resolution T1 structural MRI was used to examine cortical thickness in a subset of 16 ALS patients. Stepwise regression analyses related free and recognition sorting test performance to measures of action naming, single word semantic knowledge, and mental search\/working memory. MRI studies found widespread cortical thinning involving bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. Regression analyses related recognition sorting performance to reduced MRI cortical thickness involving the left prefrontal and left parietal cortex. An extramotor cognitive network is associated with impaired concept formation in ALS. ","874":"The psychological processes of doubting and skepticism have recently become topics of neuroscientific investigation. In this context, we developed the False Tagging Theory, a neurobiological model of the belief and doubt process, which proposes that the prefrontal cortex is critical for normative doubt regarding properly comprehended cognitive representations. Here, we put our theory to an empirical test, hypothesizing that patients with prefrontal cortex damage would have a doubt deficit that would manifest as higher authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism. Ten patients with bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), 10 patients with damage to areas outside the vmPFC, and 16 medical comparison patients, who experienced life-threatening (but non-neurological) medical events, completed a series of scales measuring authoritarianism, religious fundamentalism, and specific religious beliefs. vmPFC patients reported significantly higher authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism than the other groups. The degrees of authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism in the vmPFC group were significantly higher than normative values, as well; by contrast, the comparison groups did not differ from normative values. Moreover, vmPFC patients reported increased specific religious beliefs after brain injury. The findings support the False Tagging Theory and suggest that the vmPFC is critical for psychological doubt and resistance to authoritarian persuasion.

However, previous studies of the trajectory of MCI identify great heterogeneity of outcomes, with a significant proportion of individuals with MCI remaining stable over time, changing MCI subtype classification, or reverting to a normal cognitive state at long-term follow-up. The present study examined individual outcomes at 20 months in a group of older adults classified according to MCI subtypes. A total of 106 participants, 81 with different subtypes of MCI and 25 healthy controls, undertook longitudinal neuropsychological assessment of visual and verbal memory, attentional processing, executive functions, working memory capacity, and semantic memory. At 20 months 12.3% of the MCI group progressed to dementia, 62.9% continued to meet MCI criteria, and 24.7% reverted to unimpaired levels of function. A discriminant function analysis predicted outcome at 20 months on the basis of baseline neuropsychological test performance with 86.3% accuracy. The analysis indicated that a pattern of impairments on visual episodic memory, verbal episodic memory, short-term memory, working memory, and attentional processing differentiated between participants who developed dementia, recovered from MCI, or remained in stable MCI. The results of the present study raise questions regarding the specificity of existing criteria for the subtypes of MCI, with these results indicating a high degree of instability in classification over time. In addition, the results suggest that multidomain MCI is the most reliable precursor stage to the development of AD. ","878":"Many disorders are characterized by impoverished ideational fluency. Tests of letter word, category word, and design fluency likely invoke different cognitive processes, but they might depend on overlapping cortical circuits. Despite differences in the tasks used to assess it, we hypothesized that ideational fluency represents a dissociable dimension of human cognition. Altogether, 317 healthy adults and 280 adults with medical or psychiatric illnesses completed a cognitive test battery that included three measures of ideational fluency. Principal component analyses assessed the factor loadings of these fluency measures along with 10 other cognitive test scores. A series of hierarchical multiple regressions determined the relative contribution of the other fluency measures to the fluency variable of interest after accounting for demographic factors and other cognitive abilities. In both participant groups all three measures of word and design fluency loaded on a single factor. An ideational fluency composite score was also normally distributed among healthy adults. After accounting for demographic characteristics, intelligence, processing speed, memory, and executive functioning, adding terms for letter- and category-cued word fluency improved multiple regression models predicting design fluency and vice versa. Despite differences among them, the three fluency measures emerged as clearly distinct from other cognitive abilities. Alternate fluency measures also accounted for significant incremental variability in both word and design fluency, even after accounting for other cognitive abilities. Thus, word and design fluency appear to involve a distinct and dissociable, material-independent dimension of cognitive processing, namely ideational fluency. ","879":"The principal cognitive domain impacted by multiple sclerosis (MS) appears to be information processing speed. Studies have documented mean differences between MS patients and healthy controls on numerous measures of information processing speed, but the present study is one of the first to examine individual variability (i.e., inconsistency) in processing speed. Thirty-nine patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS and 32 healthy controls completed a series of reaction time (RT) tests, the Stroop Test, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. In addition to mean differences, appropriate measures of individual variability (i.e., coefficients of variability) were obtained for the tests yielding response times. MS patients performed more poorly on all response time measures, responding more slowly and with greater inconsistency than controls. Logistic regression analyses showed that inconsistency measures contributed independently to the discrimination between groups beyond that resulting from measures of mean processing speed. The so-called \"complexity effect\" was also demonstrated; greater between-groups differences on both mean RTs and inconsistency generally occurred on tasks placing greater demand on central executive resources. Processing speed in MS patients is characterized by greater individual variability as well as overall declines. This variability should be examined further in relation to neuroimaging indices of MS. ","880":"Inhibitory control is associated with temperament and intelligence, which together form an essential component of the ability to adaptively regulate behavior. Impairments in inhibitory control have been linked with a host of common and debilitating conditions, often in a sex-dependent manner. However, sex differences in inhibitory control are often not expressed experimentally during task performance. Here, we sought to examine how sex, temperament, and intelligence are related to different aspects of inhibitory control. We recruited a large sample of early adolescents (n = 153; mean age 12.6 years) to comprehensively investigate the relationship between sex, self-reported and parent-reported temperamental effortful control, and intelligence with different aspects of inhibitory control--namely, strategic (or proactive) control and evaluative (or reactive) control, assessed using a modified Stroop task. Compared with males, females were more efficient in their use of strategic control to reduce the magnitude of response conflict. There was no sex difference in evaluative control. Further, whereas high intelligence was associated with fewer errors for both males and females, effortful control was associated with performance accuracy only in females. These findings highlight sex differences in the relationship of inhibitory control to individual differences in temperamental effortful control in early adolescents and reinforce the generalized positive effects of intelligence. ","881":"The right visual field superiority (RVFS) for words may be explained by the cerebral lateralization for language, the scanning habits in relation to script direction, and spatial attention. The present study explored the influence of spatial attention on the RVFS in relation to scanning habits in school-age children. French second- and fourth-graders identified briefly presented French parafoveal words. Tunisian second- and fourth-graders identified Arabic words, and Tunisian fourth-graders identified French words. The distribution of spatial attention was evaluated by using a distracter in the visual field opposite the word. The results of the correct identification score showed that reading direction had only a partial effect on the identification of parafoveal words and the distribution of attention, with a clear RVFS and a larger effect of the distracter in the left visual field in French children reading French words, and an absence of asymmetry when Tunisian children read Arabic words. Fourth-grade Tunisian children also showed an RVFS when reading French words without an asymmetric distribution of attention, suggesting that their native language may have partially influenced reading strategies in the newly learned language. However, the mode of letter processing, evaluated by a qualitative error score, was only influenced by reading direction, with more sequential processing in the visual field where reading \"begins.\" The distribution of attention when reading parafoveal words is better explained by the interaction between left hemisphere activation and strategies related to reading direction. We discuss these results in light of an attentional theory that dissociates selection and preparation.

Participants included 3- to 6-year-old children, 63 with TBI (46 with moderate TBI and 17 with severe TBI) and a comparison group of 80 children with OI. Academic achievement was assessed approximately 1 and 12 months postinjury using three subtests from the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement-Third Edition and the School Readiness Composite from the Bracken Basic Concepts Scale-Revised. General intellectual functioning, memory, and executive functions were measured at the initial assessment using standardized tests. Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict academic achievement at the initial and 1-year follow-up assessments. Memory and executive functions were significant predictors of academic achievement at both assessments after controlling for group membership and demographic variables. Executive function remained a significant predictor of some outcomes after taking general intellectual functioning into account. Predictive relationships did not vary across the TBI and OI groups. Similar results were obtained when regression analyses were completed with only TBI participants using the Glasgow Coma Scale score as a predictor, although memory and executive functioning were somewhat less robust in predicting academic achievement than before. Memory and executive function predict academic achievement after TBI in preschool children, although some of the associations may be accounted for by general intellectual functioning. ","883":"The search for predictors of schizophrenia has accelerated with a growing focus on early intervention and prevention of psychotic illness. Studying nonpsychotic relatives of individuals with schizophrenia enables identification of markers of vulnerability for the illness independent of confounds associated with psychosis. The goal of these studies was to develop new auditory continuous performance tests (ACPTs) and evaluate their effects in individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives. We carried out two studies of auditory vigilance with tasks involving working memory (WM) and interference control with increasing levels of cognitive load to discern the information-processing vulnerabilities in a sample of schizophrenia patients, and two samples of nonpsychotic relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and controls. Study 1 assessed adults (mean age = 41), and Study 2 assessed teenagers and young adults age 13-25 (M = 19). Patients with schizophrenia were impaired on all five versions of the ACPTs, whereas relatives were impaired only on WM tasks, particularly the two interference tasks that maximize cognitive load. Across all groups, the interference tasks were more difficult to perform than the other tasks. Schizophrenia patients performed worse than relatives, who performed worse than controls. For patients, the effect sizes were large (Cohen's d = 1.5), whereas for relatives they were moderate (d = ~0.40-0.50). There was no age by group interaction in the relatives-control comparison except for participants &lt;31 years of age. Novel WM tasks that manipulate cognitive load and interference control index an important component of the vulnerability to schizophrenia. ","884":"Previous studies have demonstrated the benefit of the differential outcomes procedure (DOP) in human learning. In the present study we aimed to explore whether the DOP might also help to overcome the face recognition memory deficit commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A delayed matching-to-sample task was used. Participants were instructed to choose which of the 4 alternative faces (comparison stimuli) matched the previously seen face (sample stimulus). Either short (5 seconds) or long (25 seconds) delays were interposed between the sample and the comparison stimuli. In the differential outcomes condition each sample face was paired with its own outcome. In contrast, in the nondifferential condition, outcomes were randomly arranged. The differential outcomes effect (DOE) was evident in the AD patients with both accuracy and latency data. That is, they showed a significantly better and faster delayed face recognition when differential outcomes were arranged. The analyses also revealed a significant main effect of delay; participants were slower in the 25 seconds condition than in the 5 seconds condition, but the difference was higher in the patients than in the controls. These findings demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that face recognition memory in patients with Alzheimer is improved when differential outcomes are used and draw attention to the potential of this procedure as a therapeutic technique. ","885":"There is continuing controversy regarding predictors of poor outcome following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). This study aimed to prospectively examine the influence of preinjury factors, injury-related factors, and postinjury factors on outcome following mTBI. Participants were 123 patients with mTBI and 100 trauma patient controls recruited and assessed in the emergency department and followed up 1 week and 3 months postinjury. Outcome was measured in terms of reported postconcussional symptoms. Measures included the ImPACT Post-Concussional Symptom Scale and cognitive concussion battery, including Attention, Verbal and Visual memory, Processing Speed and Reaction Time modules, pre- and postinjury SF-36 and MINI Psychiatric status ratings, VAS Pain Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, PTSD Checklist-Specific, and Revised Social Readjustment Scale. Presence of mTBI predicted postconcussional symptoms 1 week postinjury, along with being female and premorbid psychiatric history, with elevated HADS anxiety a concurrent indicator. However, at 3 months, preinjury physical or psychiatric problems but not mTBI most strongly predicted continuing symptoms, with concurrent indicators including HADS anxiety, PTSD symptoms, other life stressors and pain. HADS anxiety and age predicted 3-month PCS in the mTBI group, whereas PTSD symptoms and other life stressors were most significant for the controls. Cognitive measures were not predictive of PCS at 1 week or 3 months. Given the evident influence of both premorbid and concurrent psychiatric problems, especially anxiety, on postinjury symptoms, managing the anxiety response in vulnerable individuals with mTBI may be important to minimize ongoing sequelae.

We hypothesized that neuropsychological deficits would persist through young adulthood for those with ADHD, and that those with continuing ADHD symptomatology in young adulthood would show the largest impairments. Neuropsychological measures at follow-up emphasized executive functions (EF) including planning, organization, inhibitory control, sustained attention, working memory, and set shifting. Parallel to findings from childhood and adolescence, the girls with childhood-diagnosed ADHD displayed medium to large deficits in EF relative to comparisons at follow-up, even with statistical control of baseline demographic and comorbidity variables. The addition of IQ as a covariate attenuated differences but several remained significant. Comparisons between the inattentive and combined subtypes of ADHD yielded nonsignificant results with small effect sizes. EF impairments were evident in both participants whose ADHD diagnoses persisted and in those whose ADHD symptoms had remitted to a nondiagnosable level; both subgroups had more EF deficits than those who did not meet criteria for ADHD in either childhood or young adulthood. Those in both the persistent and remitted ADHD groups showed impairments in EF relative to comparisons and generally did not differ from each other. Overall, childhood ADHD in girls portends neuropsychological\/EF deficits that persist for at least 10 years. ","887":"Tactile localization on the skin involves both a somatotopic and a postural schema (body-schema) representation. The present study determines the extent to which body posture influences tactile perception in right-brain-damaged patients. In a first set of experiments, patients were asked to detect single tactile stimulation delivered to their left or right hands or to both hands simultaneously (double stimulation) in different arm postures. Only patients who had no difficulty localizing single and double tactile stimulations when their hands were placed in anatomic position were tested. Participant's hands were crossed, one over the other, and the tactile stimuli were delivered either to the hand (beyond the crossing point, Experiment 1) or to the forearm (before the crossing point, Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, the left hand was placed in the right hemispace and the right hand in the left hemispace without crossing over (opposite condition). In a second set of experiments, patients were asked to detect stimulation delivered to the forefinger. The fingers were crossed, one over the other at the level of the middle phalanx, and stimuli were delivered either beyond or before the crossing point. In all experimental conditions, control participants performed at ceiling. We observed a left-hand tactile extinction on double stimulation in the crossed condition. These results suggest that tactile stimuli can be encoded based on multiple specific body-part representations rather than on an integrated body-schema representation. ","888":"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to have clinically beneficial effects in altering the perception of auditory hallucinations (AH) in patients with schizophrenia. However, the mode of action is not clear. Recent neuroimaging findings indicate that rTMS has the potential to induce not only local effects but also changes in remote, functionally connected brain regions. Frontotemporal dysconnectivity has been proposed as a mechanism leading to psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The current study examines functional connectivity between temporal and frontal brain regions after rTMS and the implications for AH in schizophrenia. A connectivity analysis was conducted on the fMRI data of 11 healthy controls receiving rTMS, compared with 11 matched subjects receiving sham TMS, to the temporoparietal junction, before engaging in a task associated with robust frontotemporal activation. Compared to the control group, the rTMS group showed an altered frontotemporal connectivity with stronger connectivity between the right temporoparietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the angular gyrus. This finding provides preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that normalizing the functional connectivity between the temporoparietal and frontal brain regions may underlie the therapeutic effect of rTMS on AH in schizophrenia. ","889":"Along with impaired discrimination, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often show an abnormally liberal response bias (greater tendency to respond \"old\"). Previously we matched discrimination by varying study-test list length and found that participants' usual bias is maintained, such that patients with AD were more liberal than healthy controls. However, this pattern could be a result of the way in which discrimination was matched. In this experiment, we examined whether matching discrimination with the use of a delay would lead to a liberal response bias in healthy younger and older adults as it might lead to the use of more similar memorial processing to the patients with AD. Younger adults, older adults, and patients with AD were run in 2 study-test sessions, with study and recognition test separated by either a 1-min or 1-day delay. With the 1-min delay, both younger adults and healthy older adults showed a conservative response bias, while patients with AD showed a liberal response bias. When discrimination was matched between patients with AD and controls by the use of a delay, response bias was also matched, with all participants showing a more liberal response bias. The current study suggests that how discrimination is matched between patients with AD and controls matters greatly. Potentially, this liberal bias is a result of healthy younger and older adults relying primarily on familiarity at the longer delay, thus using more similar memorial processes to patients with AD who are dependent on familiarity at any delay.

The present research examines the hypothesis that these impairments are due to a material-neutral deficit in organizational executive resources rather than to impairments of language per se. We predicted that comprehension and expression of narrative would be similarly affected and that deficits in both expression and comprehension of narrative would be related to the same anatomic distribution of prefrontal disease. We examined 29 LBSD patients and 26 healthy seniors on their comprehension and expression of narrative discourse. For comprehension, we measured accuracy and latency in judging events with high and low associativity from familiar scripts such as \"going fishing.\" The expression task involved maintaining the connectedness of events while narrating a story from a wordless picture book. LBSD patients were impaired on measures of narrative organization during both comprehension and expression relative to healthy seniors. Measures of organization during narrative expression and comprehension were significantly correlated with each other. These measures both correlated with executive measures but not with neuropsychological measures of lexical semantics or grammar. Voxel-based morphometry revealed overlapping regressions relating frontal atrophy to narrative comprehension, narrative expression, and measures of executive control. Difficulty with narrative discourse in LBSD stems in part from a deficit of organization common to comprehension and expression. This deficit is related to prefrontal cortical atrophy in LBSD. ","893":"Chronic stress has well-documented negative effects on hippocampal structure and function, and has been suggested to contribute to age-related declines. In contrast, there is evidence that exercise has beneficial effects in older adults. The current investigation examined effects of lifetime stress on hippocampal volume and memory, the moderating role of stress on age effects, and the moderating role of exercise on stress-related effects. Measures of lifetime stress, exercise engagement, magnetic-resonance-imaging-based volumes, and cognitive performance were obtained in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults. There was a significant negative influence of stress on hippocampal volume. In addition, exercise engagement moderated effects of lifetime stress on both hippocampal volume and memory. Specifically, lower exercise engagement individuals evidenced greater stress-related declines compared with high exercise engagement individuals. These novel findings suggest that benefits of exercise in later adulthood may extend to minimizing detrimental effects of stress on the hippocampus and memory. ","894":"To explore the specificity of impaired praxis and postural knowledge to autism by examining three samples of children, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing (TD) children. Twenty-four children with ASD, 24 children with ADHD, and 24 TD children, ages 8-13, completed measures assessing basic motor control (the Physical and Neurological Exam for Subtle Signs; PANESS), praxis (performance of skilled gestures to command, with imitation, and tool use) and the ability to recognize correct hand postures necessary to perform skilled gestures (the Postural Knowledge Test; PKT). Children with ASD performed significantly worse than TD children on all three assessments. In contrast, children with ADHD performed significantly worse than TD controls on PANESS but not on the praxis examination or PKT. Furthermore, children with ASD performed significantly worse than children with ADHD on both the praxis examination and PKT, but not on the PANESS. Whereas both children with ADHD and children with ASD show impairments in basic motor control, impairments in performance and recognition of skilled motor gestures, consistent with dyspraxia, appear to be specific to autism. The findings suggest that impaired formation of perceptual-motor action models necessary to development of skilled gestures and other goal directed behavior is specific to autism; whereas, impaired basic motor control may be a more generalized finding. ","895":"We examined functional performance on multiple indicators for two cognitive status groups: (a) not impaired controls (NIC) and (b) mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We identified functional markers associated with differences, changes, and stability in cognitive status. In the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS) we examined cognitive status group effects in (a) cross-sectional functional performance, (b) longitudinal stability, (c) longitudinal functional performance change, and (d) functional marker prediction of later cognitive status. We assembled markers from five continuous clusters of MCI-related functional factors: biological vitality, activity lifestyle, psychosocial affect, subjective health, and global cognition. We used a cross-sectional sample and a two-wave longitudinal sample, stratified by age (mid-old, old-old) and cognitive status (MCI, NIC). First, cross-sectional results showed that eight markers differentiated MCI and NIC adults, with the latter performing uniformly better. The groups differed on diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, positive and negative affect, MMSE, and the lifestyle indicators of self-maintenance, travel, and novel cognitive activities. Second, Wave 1 to Wave 2 stabilities in cognitive status classification were high. Third, several markers differentiated the stable (NIC-to-NIC, MCI-to-MCI) from the unstable (NIC-to-MCI, MCI-to-NIC) cognitive status groups. Fourth, five relevant markers for identifying older adults at risk for cognitive status changes were: diastolic blood pressure, self-maintenance activities, novel cognitive activities, positive affect, and global cognitive status. Selected risk and protective factors differentiate persons classified with MCI from those not currently cognitively impaired, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

The sample included 40 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured ACoA with a favorable neurological outcome and a control group of 31 subjects matched by age, sex, and years of education. Twenty patients had surgical interventions (clipping) and 20 had received endovascular treatment. Decision-making was assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). We used the Expectancy Valence model to examine the different components associated with the IGT. ACoA patients performed significantly worse on the IGT than controls, we observed poorly performance on IGT in 70% of the patients. Comparing the groups according to type of intervention, we found that clipped patients performed significantly worse than controls on the IGT, whereas coiled patients did not differ significantly from controls or clipped patients; however, coiled patients performed worse than controls on the last block of the task. Patients with frontal lesions selected significantly more cards from the disadvantageous deck. IGT performance correlated with other tests of executive functions such as the perseverative errors and non perseverative errors of Wisconsin Card Sorting Tests, and verbal fluency test, but not with working memory tests. According to the Expectancy Valence model, patients with frontal lesions showed a greater tendency to focus on recent outcomes and ignore or rapidly discount past outcomes, and tended to have a more erratic response pattern. Our results suggest that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured ACoA have deficits in decision-making under ambiguity. The main cause of this deficit is the presence of frontal lesions. Moreover, clipped patients, but not coiled patients, showed deficits in taking decisions in comparison with controls. Our results suggest that the IGT may help to identify neuropsychological sequelae in these patients.

We have initiated a multicenter collaboration that includes 3 independent cohorts, totaling 100 carriers of the premutation and 216 noncarriers. The initial focus of this collaboration has been on executive function. Four executive function scores are shared among the 3 cohorts (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Stroop Color-Word Test, and Wechsler backward digit span and letter-number sequencing) whereas additional executive function scores are available for specific cohorts (Behavior Dyscontrol Scale, Hayling Sentence Completion Test Part B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Raw scores were analyzed by using statistical models that adjust for cohort-specific effects as well as age and education. Carriers scored significantly lower compared to noncarriers on the Stroop Color-Word Test (p = .01), Hayling Sentence Completion Test Part B (p &lt; .01), and Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (p = .03), with the Hayling displaying a significant age-related decline (p = .01), as assessed by an age and repeat length-group interaction. Follow-up analysis of the collective data did not identify any specific age groups or repeat length ranges (i.e., low premutation = 55-70 repeats, midpremutation = 71-100 repeats, high premutation = 101-199 repeats) that were associated with an increased risk of executive function deficits. Preliminary analyses do not indicate global executive function impairment among male carriers without FXTAS compared to noncarriers. However, impairment in inhibitory capacity may be present among a subset of carriers, though the risk factors for this group do not appear to be related to age or repeat length. ","898":null,"899":"The picture superiority effect, better memory for pictures compared to words, has been found in young adults, healthy older adults, and, most recently, in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Although the picture superiority effect is widely found, there is still debate over what drives this effect. One main question is whether it is enhanced perceptual or conceptual information that leads to the advantage for pictures over words. In this experiment, we examined the picture superiority effect in healthy older adults and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to better understand the role of gist-based conceptual processing. We had participants study three exemplars of categories as either words or pictures. In the test phase, participants were again shown pictures or words and were asked to determine whether the item was in the same category as something they had studied earlier or whether it was from a new category. We found that all participants demonstrated a robust picture superiority effect, better performance for pictures than for words. These results suggest that the gist-based conceptual processing of pictures is preserved in patients with MCI. While in healthy older adults preserved recollection for pictures could lead to the picture superiority effect, in patients with MCI it is most likely that the picture superiority effect is a result of spared conceptually based familiarity for pictures, perhaps combined with their intact ability to extract and use gist information. ","900":"This study investigated the effects of familiarity on the performance of routine (familiar) naturalistic actions (NAs) that had been performed several times prior to the experiment (e.g., making coffee) and novel (unfamiliar) naturalistic actions (NNAs) that had not been performed prior to instruction (e.g., making a mock volcano). We hypothesized that similar psychological processes were associated with both types of action, but that memory and executive functions would be more important for NNAs. In Experiment 1, 18 undergraduates verbally described NAs and NNAs as they observed the tasks being performed. In Experiment 2, stroke patients, impaired (n = 4) or unimpaired (n = 4) on a test of general cognitive function, and 12 controls, physically enacted and arranged in correct order photos of NAs and NNAs. In Experiment 1, the central (crux), but not the noncentral (noncrux) actions, associated with NAs and NNAs were verbally described. In Experiment 2, NA and NNA enactment and photo arrangement performance was lower in the impaired group compared with controls. The impaired group had higher omission (omitting an action) than commission (performing an action incorrectly) crux action error rates for NAs, but the reverse pattern for NNAs. NA performance was more strongly associated with general cognitive function, whereas NNA performance correlated more strongly with executive functioning and memory measures. Both types of task involve overlapping cognitive processes. Memory and executive function may be more important for NNAs because these tasks are encoded into memory at study. ","901":"It has been suggested that neurocognitive impairment is a core deficit in schizophrenia. However, it appears that some patients with schizophrenia have intelligence quotients (IQs) in the superior range. In this study, we sought out schizophrenia patients with an estimated premorbid Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of at least 115 and studied their neuropsychological profile. Thirty-four patients meeting diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV), with mean estimated premorbid IQ of 120, were recruited and divided into two subgroups, according to whether or not their IQ had declined by at least 10 points from their premorbid estimate. Their performance on an extensive neuropsychological battery was compared with that of 19 IQ-matched healthy controls and a group of 16 \"typical\" schizophrenia patients with estimated premorbid IQ &lt;110, using one way ANOVAs and profile analysis using MANOVAs. Schizophrenia patients whose estimated premorbid and current IQ both lay in the superior range were statistically indistinguishable from IQ-matched healthy controls on all neurocognitive tests. However, their profile of relative performance in subtests was similar to that of typical schizophrenia patients. Patients with superior premorbid IQ and evidence of intellectual deterioration had intermediate scores. Our results confirm the existence of patients meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia who have markedly superior premorbid intellectual level and appear to be free of gross neuropsychological deficits. We discuss the implications of these findings for the primacy of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. ","902":"Recent research has identified specific cognitive deficits in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), including impairment in executive functioning and attention. Another such cognitive process, implicit category learning has been less studied in AN. This study examined whether implicit category learning is impaired in AN. Twenty-one women diagnosed with AN and 19 control women (CW) were administered an implicit category learning task in which they were asked to categorize simple perceptual stimuli (Gabor patches) into one of two categories. Category membership was based on a linear integration (i.e., an implicit task) of two stimulus dimensions (orientation and spatial frequency of the stimulus). AN individuals were less accurate on implicit category learning relative to age-matched CW. Model-based analyses indicated that, even when AN individuals used the appropriate (i.e., implicit) strategy they were still impaired relative to CW who also used the same strategy. In addition, task performance in AN patients was worse the higher they were in self-reported novelty seeking and the lower they were in sensitivity to punishment. These results indicate that AN patients have implicit category learning deficits, and given this type of learning is thought to be mediated by striatal dopamine pathways, AN patients may have deficits in these neural systems. The finding of significant correlations with novelty seeking and sensitivity to punishment suggests that feedback sensitivity is related to implicit learning in AN. ","903":"To examine how genes and environments contribute to relationships among Trail Making Test (TMT) conditions and the extent to which these conditions have unique genetic and environmental influences. Participants included 1,237 middle-aged male twins from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System TMT included visual searching, number and letter sequencing, and set-shifting components. Phenotypic correlations among TMT conditions ranged from 0.29 to 0.60, and genes accounted for the majority (58-84%) of each correlation. Overall heritability ranged from 0.34 to 0.62 across conditions. Phenotypic factor analysis suggested a single factor. In contrast, genetic models revealed a single common genetic factor but also unique genetic influences separate from the common factor. Genetic variance (i.e., heritability) of number and letter sequencing was completely explained by the common genetic factor while unique genetic influences separate from the common factor accounted for 57% and 21% of the heritabilities of visual search and set shifting, respectively. After accounting for general cognitive ability, unique genetic influences accounted for 64% and 31% of those heritabilities. A common genetic factor, most likely representing a combination of speed and sequencing, accounted for most of the correlation among TMT 1-4. Distinct genetic factors, however, accounted for a portion of variance in visual scanning and set shifting. Thus, although traditional phenotypic shared variance analysis techniques suggest only one general factor underlying different neuropsychological functions in nonpatient populations, examining the genetic underpinnings of cognitive processes with twin analysis can uncover more complex etiological processes. ","904":"Do lifestyle activities buffer normal aging-related declines in cognitive performance? The emerging literature will benefit from theoretically broader measurement of both lifestyle activities and cognitive performance, and longer-term longitudinal designs complemented with dynamic statistical analyses. We examine the temporal ordering of changes in lifestyle activities and changes in cognitive neuropsychological performance in older adults. We assembled data (n = 952) across a 12-year (5-wave) period from the Victoria Longitudinal Study. Latent change score models were applied to examine whether (and in which temporal order) changes in physical, social, or cognitive lifestyle activities were related to changes in three domains of cognitive performance. Two main results reflect the dynamic coupling among changes in lifestyle activities and cognition. First, reductions in cognitive lifestyle activities were associated with subsequent declines in measures of verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory. Second, poorer cognitive functioning was related to subsequent decrements in lifestyle engagement, especially in social activities. The results support the dual contention that (a) lifestyle engagement may buffer some of the cognitive changes observed in late life, and (b) persons who are exhibiting poorer cognitive performance may also relinquish some lifestyle activities. ","905":"Apathy is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that can manifest independently of depression, but little is known about its natural progression in medically managed patients. The present study sought to characterize and compare trajectories of apathy, depression, and motor symptoms in PD over 18 months. Data from a sample of 186 PD patients (mean disease duration of 8.2 years) followed by the University of Florida Movement Disorders Center were obtained from a clinical research database. Scores on the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (motor portion), Apathy Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory at three time-points (baseline, 6 months, 18 months) were analyzed in a structural equation modeling framework. A multivariate growth model controlling for age, sex, education, and disease duration identified linear worsening of both apathy (slope estimate = 0.73; p &lt; .001) and motor symptoms (slope estimate = 1.51; p &lt; .001), and quadratic changes in depression (slope estimate = 1.18; p = .07). All symptoms were positively correlated. Higher education was associated with lower apathy, depression, and motor severity. Advanced age was associated with greater motor and apathy severity. Female sex and longer disease duration were associated with attenuated motor worsening. Antidepressant use was associated only with depression scores. These longitudinal results support the differentiation of apathy and depression in PD. Like motor progression, apathy progression may be linked at least partially to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Empirically supported treatments for apathy in PD are needed. ","906":"To characterize the numerical profile of patients with acquired brain disorders. We investigated numeracy skills in 76 participants--40 healthy controls and 36 patients with neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer dementia, frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, progressive aphasia) and with focal brain lesions affecting parietal, frontal, and temporal areas as in herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). All patients were tested with the same comprehensive battery of paper-and-pencil and computerized tasks assessing numerical abilities and calculation. Degenerative and HSE patients also performed nonnumerical semantic tasks. Our results, based on nonparametric group statistics as well as on the analysis of individual patients, and all highly significant, show that: (a) all patients, including those with parietal lesions--a key brain area for numeracy processing--had intact processing of number quantity; (b) patients with impaired semantic knowledge had much better preserved numerical knowledge; and (c) most patients showed impaired calculation skills, with the exception of most semantic dementia and HSE patients. Our results allow us, for the first time, to characterize the numeracy skills in patients with a variety of neurological conditions and to suggest that the pattern of numerical performance can vary considerably across different neurological populations. Moreover, the selective sparing of calculation skills in most semantic dementia and HSE suggest that numerical abilities are an independent component of the semantic system. Finally, our data suggest that, besides the parietal areas, other brain regions might be critical to the understanding and processing of numerical concepts. ","907":"Recently, a deficit in attention was found in those with pure developmental dyscalculia (DD). Accordingly, the present study aimed to examine the influence of attentional training on attention abilities, basic numerical abilities, and arithmetic in participants who were diagnosed as having DD. Nine university students diagnosed as having DD (IQ and reading abilities in the normal range and no indication of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and nine matched controls participated in attentional training (i.e., video game training). First, training modulated the orienting system; after training, the size of the validity effect (i.e., effect of valid vs. invalid) decreased. This effect was comparable in the two groups. Training modulated abnormalities in the attention systems of those with DD, that is, it reduced their enlarged congruity effect (i.e., faster responding when flanking arrows pointed to the same location as a center arrow). Second, in relation to the enumeration task, training reduced the reaction time of the DD group in the subitizing range but did not change their smaller-than-normal subitizing range. Finally, training improved performance in addition problems in both the DD and control groups. These results imply that attentional training does improve most of the attentional deficits of those with DD. In contrast, training did not improve the abnormalities of the DD group in arithmetic or basic numerical processing. Thus, in contrast to the domain-general hypothesis, the deficits in attention among those with DD and the deficits in numerical processing appear to originate from different sources. ","908":"To investigate whether spatial working memory (WM) is impaired in multiple sclerosis (MS), and, if it is, to localize impairment to specific cognitive subprocess(es). In Experiment 1, MS and control participants performed computerized memory-span and visuomotor tasks. WM subprocesses were taxed by manipulating (1) the requirement to remember serial order, (2) delay duration, and (3) the presence of irrelevant stimuli during target presentation. In Experiment 2, recall and recognition tests varied the difficulty of WM retrieval. In Experiment 3, an attention-cueing task tested the ability to voluntarily and rapidly reorient attention. Performance was worse for MS than for control participants in both spatial recall (Exp. 1 span: 95% CIMS = [5.11, 5.57], 95% CIControls = [5.58, 6.03], p = .003, 1-tailed; Exp. 2 span: 95% CIMS = [4.44, 5.54], 95% CIControls = [5.47, 6.57], p = .006, 1-tailed) and recognition (accuracy: 95% CIMS = [0.71, 0.81], 95% CIControls = [0.79, 0.88], p = .01, 1-tailed) tests. However, there was no evidence for deficits in spatiotemporal binding, maintenance, retrieval, distractor suppression, or visuomotor processing. In contrast, MS participants were abnormally slow to reorient attention (cueing effect (ms): 95% CIMS: [90, 169], 95% CIControls: [29, 107], p = .015, 1-tailed). Results suggest that, whereas spatial WM is impaired in MS, once spatial information has been adequately encoded into WM, individuals with MS are, on average, able to maintain and retrieve this information. Impoverished encoding of spatial information, however, may be due to inefficient voluntary orienting of attention. ","909":"Previous studies with patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) revealed deficits in working memory and executive functions. In the present study we investigated whether patients with MDD have the ability to allocate cognitive resources in dual task performance of a highly challenging cognitive task (working memory) and a task that is seemingly automatic in nature (postural control). Fifteen young (18-35 years old) patients with MDD and 24 healthy age-matched controls performed a working memory task and two postural control tasks (standing on a stable or on a moving platform) both separately (single task) and concurrently (dual task). Postural stability under single task conditions was similar in the two groups, and in line with earlier studies, MDD patients recalled fewer working memory items than controls. To equate working memory challenges for patients and controls, task difficulty (number of items presented) in dual task was individually adjusted such that accuracy of working memory performance was similar for the two groups under single task conditions. Patients showed greater postural instability in dual task performance on the stable platform, and more importantly when posture task difficulty increased (moving platform) they showed deficits in both working memory accuracy and postural stability compared with healthy controls. We interpret our results as evidence for executive control deficits in MDD patients that affect their task coordination. In multitasking, these deficits affect not only cognitive but also sensorimotor task performance. ","910":"Newman and Baskin-Sommers (in press) have proposed that psychopathy reflects an attention bottleneck that interferes with processing contextual information, including the timely processing of affective and inhibitory cues that initiate self-regulation. Despite a wealth of evidence that attention moderates the affective, inhibitory, and self-regulation deficits of psychopathic offenders, to date there is little or no evidence that psychopathic offenders perform abnormally on a canonical measure of selective attention. In this study, we address this gap in the literature and clarify the attention-related abnormality in psychopathy. We administered the attentional blink (AB) task to 37 male prisoners assessed with Hare's (2003) Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. In the AB paradigm, participants identify targets in a rapid serial visual presentation. Distracters' temporal proximity to the first target elicits a conflict between attending to the target and attending to the distracters. Greater conflict results in a larger AB (i.e., reduced accuracy for the second target). As predicted, psychopathic offenders displayed a significantly smaller AB (i.e., better accuracy throughout the blink interval) than nonpsychopathic offenders. Consistent with the attentional bottleneck hypothesis, psychopathic participants were less susceptible to distracter effects following presentation of an initial target. The results clarify the nature of the attention bottleneck in psychopathy, the circumstances in which it enhances versus interferes with performance, and its implications for more ecologically valid conditions involving the sequential presentation of goal-relevant and goal-incongruent information. ","911":"Prospective memory (PM), which can be understood as the processes involved in realizing a delayed intention, is consistently found to be impaired after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although PM can be empirically dissociated from retrospective memory, it inherently involves both a prospective component (i.e., remembering that an action needs to be carried out) and retrospective components (i.e., remembering what action needs to be executed and when). This study utilized a multinomial processing tree model to disentangle the prospective (that) and retrospective recognition (when) components underlying PM after moderate-to-severe TBI. Seventeen participants with moderate to severe TBI and 17 age- and education-matched control participants completed an event-based PM task that was embedded within an ongoing computer-based color-matching task. The multinomial processing tree modeling approach revealed a significant group difference in the prospective component, indicating that the control participants allocated greater preparatory attentional resources to the PM task compared to the TBI participants. Participants in the TBI group were also found to be significantly more impaired than controls in the when aspect of the retrospective component. These findings indicated that the TBI participants had greater difficulty allocating the necessary preparatory attentional resources to the PM task and greater difficulty discriminating between PM targets and nontargets during task execution, despite demonstrating intact posttest recall and\/or recognition of the PM tasks and targets. ","912":"Spatial neglect results in an ipsilesional misorientation of attention in visual-spatial tasks. Hemianopia impairs visual perception but its influence on visual-spatial tasks is subject to debate. Here, we investigated the influence of the time since stroke on the respective impacts of hemianopia and spatial neglect. A total of 29 patients with a right hemisphere stroke were included in the study. Nine had severe neglect and hemianopia, six had severe neglect only, four showed hemianopia with little or no neglect after infarction of the posterior cerebral artery, and 10 had neither neglect nor hemianopia. We investigated the spatial bias in the subjective straight ahead (SSA) test and in clinical tests (bell cancellation, line bisection, and scene copy). Each task was administered twice (at S1 and S2: 41.4 and 67.2 days [on average] after the stroke, respectively). At S1, spatial neglect and hemianopia had an additive influence on SSA test performance (rightward translation). Similar rightward biases were observed in the clinical tests. At S2, the influence of hemianopia had disappeared, whereas that of neglect was still present. Furthermore, loss of bias in the SSA test correlated with the improvements seen in most of the clinical tests. In patients with recent stroke, hemianopia aggravates the visual-spatial bias when neglect is present or may lead to visual-neglect-like behavior when classically defined neglect is absent. However, the influence of hemianopia disappears relatively quickly over time, due to compensation. ","913":null,"914":null,"915":"Metamemory is integral for strategizing about memory intentions. This study investigated the prospective memory (PM) deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD) from a metamemory viewpoint, with the aim of examining whether metamemory deficits might contribute to PM deficits in PD. Sixteen patients with PD and 16 healthy older adult controls completed a time-based PM task (initiating a key press at two specified times during an ongoing task), and an event-based PM task (initiating a key press in response to animal words during an ongoing task). To measure metamemory participants were asked to predict and postdict their memory performance before and after completing the tasks, as well as complete a self-report questionnaire regarding their everyday memory function. The PD group had no impairment, relative to controls, on the event-based task, but had prospective (initiating the key press) and retrospective (recalling the instructions) impairments on the time-based task. The PD group also had metamemory impairments on the time-based task; they were inaccurate at predicting their performance before doing the task but, became accurate when making postdictions. This suggests impaired metamemory knowledge but preserved metamemory monitoring. There were no group differences regarding PD patients' self-reported PM performance on the questionnaire. These results reinforce previous findings that PM impairments in PD are dependent on task type. Several accounts of PM failures in time-based tasks are presented, in particular, ways in which mnemonic and metacognitive deficits may contribute to the difficulties observed on the time-based task. ","916":"Attentional orienting and awareness for contralesional hemispace were studied longitudinally in a woman (GB) who suffered a right hemispheric stroke without any motor impairment and who presented normal performance on standard paper-and-pencil tests for neglect but manifested difficulties in everyday life. We aimed to test whether computer-based, dual-task paradigms were sufficiently sensitive to detect the presence of subclinical neglect in GB. We assessed the spatial awareness of GB by means of cued-detection tasks, paper-and-pencil tests, attentionally demanding dual tasks, and in several ecological settings after her discharge from the hospital. A group of right brain-damaged patients and an age-matched healthy participant were also tested with the dual tasks. Dramatic awareness deficits for the left contralesional hemispace emerged in GB only under dual-task conditions, both in computer-based and in ecological settings, as if her degree of contralesional space awareness impairment was closely dependent on the quantity of available attentional resources. Our dual-task paradigm was also effective in quantifying awareness improvements over time. The absence of motor impairments, uncommon for a postacute patient with severe albeit hidden neglect, allowed us to ascribe her everyday life impairments for contralesional hemispace to awareness deficits. The performance of the group of patients confirmed the detrimental effects of the dual tasks, whereas the performance of the healthy control we tested was not affected by dual-task manipulation. Our results confirm the well-known lack of sensitivity of standard neuropsychological tests to detect subclinical forms of neglect, which, nonetheless, may result in negative consequences in everyday life. Computer-based, resource-demanding paradigms seem to be a promising solution to uncover subtle awareness deficits that can affect the everyday life of stroke patients. ","917":"The frontal variant of frontotemporal degeneration (fvFTD) is characterized by a predominant behavioral syndrome, which is mostly attributable to an orbital-medial prefrontal dysfunction. The orbital and ventral medial prefrontal functions in humans are difficult to assess in clinical practice. Here, we propose a new tool, the SEA (Social cognition and Emotional Assessment), for use in evaluating the functions of the orbital and ventral-medial portions of the prefrontal cortex. The SEA is composed of five subtests, each assessing a specific orbitofrontal-related function: a test of identification of facial emotions, a reversal\/extinction task, a behavioral control task, a theory of mind test, and an apathy scale. The maximum score is 55. Three groups have been tested: 22 fvFTD patients, 22 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 30 healthy control subjects, all matched for age and educational level. FvFTD patients showed significantly lower performances in all subtests of the SEA. A cut-off score of 39.4\/55 was proposed to separate normal controls from fvFTD patients, with a maximum sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A very high specificity (88.5%) was obtained using the same cut-off with AD\/aMCI patients and normal controls versus fvFTD patients. FvFTD patients' performance in the SEA did not correlate with any other neuropsychological scores, particularly the classical cognitive executive tests. The SEA is a new and useful tool for diagnosing fvFTD and, more generally, all of the diseases affecting the orbital and medial prefrontal functions. ","918":"Memory functioning in children and adolescents ages 5-19 with autism (n = 50) and typically developing controls (n = 36) was assessed using a clinical assessment battery, the Test of Memory and Learning (TOMAL). Participant groups were statistically comparable in age, nonverbal IQ, handedness, and head circumference, and were administered the TOMAL. Test performance on the TOMAL demonstrated broad differences in memory functioning in the autism group, across multiple task formats, including verbal and nonverbal, immediate and delayed, attention and concentration, sequential recall, free recall, associative recall, and multiple-trial learning memory. All index and nearly all subtest differences remained significant even after comparing a subset of the autism group (n = 36) and controls that were matched for verbal IQ (p &gt; .05). However, retention of previously remembered information after a delay was similar in autism and controls. These findings indicate that performance on measures of episodic memory is broadly reduced in autism, and support the conclusion that information encoding and organization, possibly due to inefficient cognitive processing strategies, rather than storage and retrieval, are the primary factors that limit memory performance in autism. ","919":null,"920":"The social and communicative challenges faced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often compounded by additional difficulties with executive function. It remains unclear, however, to what the extent individuals with ASD experienced impairment in inhibitory control. The objective of the present study was to assess the three main subtypes of executive inhibitory control within a single ASD sample thus providing new insight into the unique ASD-related pattern of sparing and impairment observed across different aspects of inhibitory control. A sample of 28 children with ASD (mean age = 13.1 years) and a comparison group of 49 neurologically uncompromised children (mean age = 13.3 years) participated. A prepotent response inhibition task, a flanker visual filtering task, and a proactive interference memory task were used to evaluate prepotent response inhibition, resistance to distracter interference, and resistance to proactive interference, respectively. After accounting for individual differences in noninhibition abilities (e.g., processing speed) and overall level of functioning, there was no evidence of group-related differences in inhibitory performance on the prepotent response inhibition test or proactive interference test. ASD-related impairments in inhibitory control were evident, however, on the flanker visual filtering task. Taken together, the present findings indicate that ASD is associated with impairments in some, but not all, aspects of inhibitory control. Individuals with ASD appear to have difficulty ignoring distracting visual information, but prepotent response inhibition and resistance to proactive interference are relatively intact. The current findings also provide support for a multitype model of inhibitory control. ","921":"Visual spatial learning is impaired in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) although the nature of this impairment is not clear. This study investigated the nature and magnitude of errors made by adults with amnestic MCI (aMCI) when learning pattern-location paired associations in a continuous manner. Visual associate learning was measured using the Continuous Paired Associate Learning (CPAL) task in which 30 adults who met clinical criteria for aMCI and 30 matched controls were required to learn a set of associations between patterns and locations across increasing memory loads (two, four, six, and eight). As hypothesized, the aMCI group made more total errors than controls for all memory loads above two. However, the rate of increase in errors with memory load in the aMCI group was approximately twice that for controls. In controls, errors on the CPAL task reflected almost exclusively difficulty in memory. In the aMCI group, errors on the CPAL reflected limitations in associative learning but also in short-term memory and response monitoring. These results suggest that impairments in specific aspects of executive function and working memory might contribute to poor performance on visual paired associate learning in aMCI. ","922":"The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Huntington's disease (HD) on cognitive and affective Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities. The relation of ToM performance and executive functions was also examined. Eighteen HD patients, early in the course of the disease, and 18 healthy volunteers matched for age and educational levels, were given two tasks: a nonverbal cognitive ToM task assessing attribution of intentions to others and a revised version of the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test, which is an affective ToM task assessing the understanding of other people's mental states from their eyes. Participants were also given various executive tests. The two ToM tasks revealed a significant impairment of ToM abilities in HD patients. Executive functioning was impaired in the HD group and ToM performance on the attribution of intentions task was dependent on several executive processes. Our results are consistent with the idea that both cognitive and affective aspects of ToM could be impaired in HD patients, indicating that cortico-subcortical circuits are underlying higher social functions such as ToM. The results are also consistent with the idea that only a few executive mechanisms regulate the ToM abilities we tested in this work. They also provide a basis for the understanding of the disorganized behavior and the breakdown of interpersonal relationships in daily life after HD. ","923":"Existing studies on memory interference in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have provided mixed results and it is unknown whether PD patients have problems in overcoming interference from retrieval cues. We investigated this issue by using a part-list cuing paradigm. In this paradigm, after the study of a list of items, the presentation of some of these items as retrieval cues hinders the recall of the remaining ones. We tested PD patients' (n = 19) and control participants' (n = 16) episodic memory in the presence and absence of part-list cues, using initial-letter probes, and following either weak or strong serial associative encoding of list items. Both PD patients and control participants showed a comparable and significant part-list cuing effect after weak associative encoding (13% vs. 12% decrease in retrieval in part-list cuing vs. no part-list cuing -control- conditions in PD patients and control participants, respectively), denoting a similar effect of cue-driven interference in the two populations when a serial retrieval strategy is hard to develop. However, only PD patients showed a significant part-list cuing effect after strong associative encoding (20% vs. 5% decrease in retrieval in patients and controls, respectively). When encoding promotes the development of an effective serial retrieval strategy, the presentation of part-list cues has a specifically disruptive effect in PD patients. This indicates problems in strategic retrieval, probably related to PD patients' increased tendency to rely on external cues. Findings in control conditions suggest that less effective encoding may have contributed to PD patients' memory performance.

Signal processing analyses have shown that time series RT data of children with ADHD have a distinctive low frequency periodic structure suggestive of a pattern of occasional spontaneous performance lapses. Here we use a fine-grained analysis of spectral power across a broader frequency range to differentiate the periodic qualities of ADHD time series RT data from (a) 1\/frequency noise, and (b) control performance. We also assess the familiality of these frequencies by using a proband-sibling design. Seventy-one children with ADHD, one of their siblings, and 50 control participants completed a simple RT task. Power across the RT frequency spectrum was calculated. The frequencies significantly differentiating the two groups were identified. Familiality was assessed in two ways: first, by comparing probands with their unaffected siblings and controls, and, second, by investigating the siblings of neuropsychologically impaired and unimpaired children with ADHD. Analyses converged to highlight the potential importance of the .20-.26 Hz band in differentiating the periodic structure of ADHD RT time series data from both 1\/frequency noise and control performance. This frequency band also showed the strongest evidence of familiality. RT performance of children with ADHD had a distinctive periodic structure. The band identified as most differentiating and familial was at a higher frequency than in most previous reports. This highlights the importance of employing tasks with faster interstimulus intervals that will allow a larger portion of the frequency spectrum to be examined. ","928":"In an attempt to interpret neglect as a disconnection syndrome, it is currently proposed that the disorder results from disorganization of large-scale networks involved in attentional spatial processes rather than of individual brain areas. We hypothesize that as degenerative brain diseases are \"system pathologies,\" degeneration could be restricted to some of the neural subsystems implicated in the functional organization of spatial attention and different neglect syndromes could emerge depending on the patterns of the subsystems involved. We studied five neglect patients: one with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), three with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) and one with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The patient with CBD and left parietoccipital atrophy showed right allocentric neglect; the three patients with PCA mostly distributed in the right posterior regions showed left egocentric extrapersonal neglect; the patient with FTD, who displayed more severe frontotemporal atrophy on the right, had left motor-executive neglect for both personal and extrapersonal space. All patients also presented a deep breakdown of spatial working memory. Our data would confirm that left neglect is more frequent than right neglect also in degenerative pathology and that damage to different neural substrates can produce different types of neglect. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that both lateralized and nonlateralized attention disorders contribute to generate the syndrome.

The aims of the study are to evaluate a novel, task-training action intervention (TT-NAT) designed to increase error monitoring in dementia patients and to pinpoint the relation between error monitoring and neuropsychological processes. Participants (n = 45) with dementia were administered the Standard NAT, a performance-based test requiring completion of three everyday tasks. A second group (n = 42) was administered the TT-NAT, which includes a brief training session prior to the commencement of each task. All participants were compared on the following variables: total errors, proportion of errors detected, and proportion of errors corrected. Correlations between error-monitoring variables and neuropsychological tests of executive functioning and language were performed. TT-NAT participants produced fewer total errors and detected significantly more errors than Standard NAT participants (z = 3.0; t = 3.36; p &lt; .05). Error detection was strongly related to only the language composite index (r = .57, p = .00) in the TT-NAT, whereas it was moderately related to both the language (r = .31, p = .04) and executive composite (r = .36, p = .02) indices in the Standard NAT condition. Review of task steps and objects before task performance may be a promising intervention for error-monitoring deficits in dementia patients; this finding has implications for neuropsychological rehabilitation of functional deficits in this population. ","931":"To investigate whether postconcussion syndrome (PCS) represents long-term sequelae associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Prospective consecutive admissions to a Level 1 trauma hospital were assessed a mean 4.9 days and again 106.2 days post-injury. The final sample comprised 62 mTBI and 58 nonbrain injured trauma controls (TC). Change or lack of change in individual PCS-like symptoms and PCS was examined. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze whether mTBI predicts 3-month PCS (Time 2; T2); whether predictors of PCS (within 14 days of injury, Time 1; T1) predict 3-month PCS, and how change in these predictors from T1 to T2 were associated with change in PCS status. Variables included demographic, injury-related, financial incentives, neuropsychological, and psychiatric disorder. MTBI did not predict PCS. PCS was comparable (T1: mTBI: 40.3%, TC: 50.0%; T2: mTBI: 46.8%, TC: 48.3%). At T2, 38.6% were new cases of PCS; between 30.8% and 86.2% reported either a new or more frequent symptom. A pre-injury depressive or anxiety disorder (OR = 2.99, 95% CI [1.38, 6.45]), and acute posttraumatic stress (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [1.00, 1.00]) were early markers of PCS, regardless of mTBI. An interaction between time and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggested the relationship between the severity of PTSD symptoms and PCS strengthened over time (OR = 2.66, 95% CI [1.08, 6.55]). Pain was related to PCS. Females were more likely than males to have PCS. The data suggest the phenomenon of PCS in trauma patients does not show an association with mTBI.

Study 1 presents data from 25 participants with chronic brain lesions who completed the Apples Test and another standard measure of neglect (Star Cancellation). The patients' performance relative to 86 controls was assessed and their relative performance across the two tests compared. Study 2 recruited 115 acute hospital stroke patients who completed the Apples Test as part of the Birmingham University Cognitive Screen procedure. We assessed the relations between the different forms of neglect. Study 3 examined neglect type (as measured by the Apples Test) among the acute stroke group in relation to their activities of daily living abilities and affect. In Study 1 Apples Test scores correlated with Star Cancellation performance, while also differentiating between neglect across the page and neglect of parts of objects. Study 2 confirmed the dissociation from Study 1. \"Pure\" forms of each type of neglect were equally prevalent after right and left hemisphere lesions, while the presence of both deficits was associated with right hemisphere damage. Study 3 showed that each form of neglect also correlated with other measures of cognition. When compared with pure page-based neglect, object-centered neglect was associated with a lower Barthel score (p &lt; .001), while patients with both forms of neglect had higher level of depression (p &lt; .001) than those with the pure forms. We conclude that the Apples test provides a clinically applicable measure of different forms of neglect. In addition it is a useful predictor of functional outcome. We discuss the nature of the two forms of neglect diagnosed by the test and the functional implications. ","933":"This study explored verbal semantic and episodic memory in children with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether they had impairments in both or only 1 aspect of memory, and to examine relations between performance in the 2 domains. Sixty-six children and adolescents (37 with seizures of left temporal lobe onset, 29 with right-sided onset) were given 4 tasks assessing different aspects of semantic memory (picture naming, fluency, knowledge of facts, knowledge of word meanings) and 2 episodic memory tasks (story recall, word list recall). High rates of impairments were observed across tasks, and no differences were found related to the laterality of the seizures. Individual patient analyses showed that there was a double dissociation between the 2 aspects of memory in that some children were impaired on episodic but not semantic memory, whereas others showed intact episodic but impaired semantic memory. This double dissociation suggests that these 2 memory systems may develop independently in the context of temporal lobe pathology, perhaps related to differential effects of dysfunction in the lateral and mesial temporal lobe structures.

Regional brain activity was assessed during performance of a pseudoword reading task and a less demanding, letter-sound naming task by three groups of students: children who experienced reading difficulties without attention problems (N = 50, RD) and nonreading impaired (NI) readers either with (N = 20) or without attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N = 50). Recordings were obtained with a whole-head neuromagnetometer, and activation profiles were computed through a minimum norm algorithm. Children with RD showed decreased amplitude of neurophysiological activity in the superior temporal gyrus, bilaterally, and in the left supramarginal and angular gyri during late stages of decoding, compared to typical readers. These effects were restricted to the more demanding pseudoword reading task. No differences were found in degree of activity between NI and ADHD students. Regression analyses provided further support for the crucial role of left hemisphere temporoparietal cortices and the fusiform gyrus for basic reading skills. Results were in agreement with fMRI findings and replicate previous MEG findings with a larger sample, a higher density neuromagnetometer, an overt pseudoword reading task, and a distributed current source-modeling method.

The present study explored features of brain organization in children with spina bifida meningomyelocele (SBM) and shunted hydrocephalus, who commonly present with precocious development of word reading skills and preservation of vocabulary and grammar skills. Eight children with SBM were compared with 15 IQ and reading-level matched, typically developing controls on MRI-based morphometric and Magnetic Source Imaging-derived neurophysiological profiles. Children with SBM showed reduced magnetic activity in left inferior parietal regions during spoken word recognition and pseudoword reading tasks. We also noted reduced surface area\/volume in inferior parietal and posterior temporal regions in SBM and increased gray matter volumes in left middle frontal regions and gyral complexity in left posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions. A complex pattern of changes in cortical morphology and activation may serve as evidence for structural and functional brain reorganization ensuring preservation of language and decoding abilities in children with SBM.

Older adults are at increased risk of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, which have historically been characterized as an inconsistent or \"spotty\" pattern of deficits. Dispersion is a form of intraindividual variability (IIV) that is defined as within-person variability in performance across domains and has been associated with poorer neurocognitive functioning and incipient decline among healthy older adults. To our knowledge, no studies have yet examined dispersion in an aging HIV-infected sample. For the current study we examined the hypothesis that age and HIV infection have synergistic effects on dispersion across a battery of clinical and experimental cognitive tasks. Our well-characterized sample comprised 126 HIV-seropositive individuals (HIV+) and 40 HIV-seronegative comparison individuals (HIV-), all of whom were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Consistent with our hypothesis, an age by HIV serostatus interaction was observed, with the older HIV+ group demonstrating a higher level of dispersion relative to older HIV- and younger HIV+ individuals, even when potentially confounding demographic and medical factors were controlled. Our results demonstrate that older HIV+ adults produce greater dispersion, or intraindividual variability in performance across a range of tests, which may be reflective of cognitive dyscontrol to which this population is vulnerable, perhaps driven by the combined effects of aging and HIV infection on prefrontostriatal systems. ","939":null,"940":"Deficits in visual perception and working memory are commonly observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and have been investigated using functional MRI (fMRI). However, interpretation of differences in brain activation may be confounded with differences in task performance between groups. Differences in task difficulty across conditions may also pose interpretative issues in studies of visual processing in healthy subjects. To address these concerns, the present study characterized brain activation in tasks that were psychometrically matched for difficulty; fMRI was used to assess brain activation in 10 healthy subjects during discrimination and working memory judgments for static and moving stimuli. For all task conditions, performance accuracy was matched at 70.7%. Areas associated with V2 and V5 in the dorsal stream were activated during motion processing tasks and V4 in the ventral stream were activated during form processing tasks. Frontoparietal areas associated with working memory were also statistically significant during the working memory tasks. Application of psychophysical methods to equate task demands provides a practical method to equate performance levels across conditions in fMRI studies and to compare healthy and cognitively impaired groups at comparable levels of effort. These psychometrically matched tasks can be applied to patients with a variety of cognitive disorders to investigate dysfunction of multiple a priori defined brain regions. Measuring the changes in typical activation patterns in patients with these diseases can be useful for monitoring disease progression, evaluating new drug treatments, and possibly for developing methods for early diagnosis.

We hypothesized that age, sex, education, body composition, and physical activity were direct determinants of fitness, which, in turn, influenced frequency of forgetting indirectly through hippocampal volume and spatial working memory. We conducted assessments of demographic characteristics, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal volume, spatial working memory, and frequency of forgetting in 158 older adults (M age = 66.49). Path analyses within a covariance modeling framework were used to examine relationships among these constructs. Sex, age, BMI, and education were all significant determinants of cardiorespiratory fitness. The hypothesized path models for testing the effects of fitness on frequency of forgetting through hippocampal volume and accuracy and speed of spatial working memory all fit the data well. Our findings suggest that older adults with higher levels of fitness show greater preservation of hippocampal volume, which, in turn, is associated with more accurate and faster spatial memory and fewer episodes of forgetting. Given the proportion of older adults reporting memory problems, it is necessary to determine whether improvements in fitness brought about by physical activity interventions can result in subsequent attenuation of memory problems or potentially in improvements in memory.

The shift from endogenous to exogenous control may be observed not only when the external cue is meaningful to the task, but also when it holds no information about the task or performance. The purpose of this study was to examine how the shift to exogenous engagement is reflected in changes to the well-documented, right-lateralized, frontal-parietal-thalamic vigilant attention network. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging , healthy participants were scanned as they performed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) in 60-s blocks, some of which were presented with brief, random, auditory tones. The SART requires participants to overcome the tendency to respond in an automatic, task-driven manner in response to infrequent no-go stimuli. Despite no overall effect on performance, and only a transient increase in response times immediately following the tones, the SART with alerting tones was associated with a diminished pattern of activation in key nodes of the network. The pattern of right-lateralized activity observed with the SART was attenuated with the tones, and activity in the right middle frontal gyrus was significantly diminished, as revealed by region-of-interest analyses. Alerting tones provided the stimulation to cue the maintenance of the goal-state, reducing reliance on prefrontal control mechanisms and demonstrating the shift from endogenous top-down control to exogenous control. These findings suggest a neural mechanism for the facilitatory effects of exogenous engagement for patients with damaged top-down attentional brain systems. ","945":"Although episodic memory is often conceptualized as consisting of multiple component processes, there is a lack of understanding as to whether these processes are influenced by the same or different genetic determinants. The aim of the present study was to utilize multivariate twin analyses to elucidate the degree to which learning and delayed recall, two critical measures of episodic memory performance, have common or different genetic and environmental influences. Participants from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (314 monozygotic twin pairs, 259 dizygotic twin pairs, and 47 unpaired twins) were assessed using the second edition of the California Verbal Learning Test. Mean age at the time of the evaluation was 55.4 years (SD = 2.5). Model fitting revealed the presence of a higher-order latent factor influencing learning, short- and long-delay free recall, with a heritability of .36. The best-fitting model also indicated specific genetic influences on learning, which accounted for 10% of the overall variance. Given that learning involves the acquisition and retrieval of information, whereas delayed recall involves only retrieval, we conclude that these specific effects are likely to reflect genes that are specific to acquisition processes. These results demonstrate that even in nonclinical populations, it is possible to differentiate component processes in episodic memory. These different genetic influences may have implications for gene association studies, as well as other genetic studies of cognitive aging and disorders of episodic memory such as Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

These difficulties are likely to be partially attributable to problems with emotion perception. Mounting evidence shows facial affect recognition to be particularly difficult after TBI. However, no attempt has been made to systematically estimate the magnitude of this problem or the frequency with which it occurs. A meta-analysis is presented examining the magnitude of facial affect recognition difficulties after TBI. From this, the frequency of these impairments in the TBI population is estimated. Effect sizes were calculated from 13 studies that compared adults with moderate to severe TBI to matched healthy controls on static measures of facial affect recognition. The studies collectively presented data from 296 adults with TBI and 296 matched controls. The overall weighted mean effect size for the 13 studies was -1.11, indicating people with TBI on average perform about 1.1 SD below healthy peers on measures of facial affect recognition. Based on estimation of the TBI population standard deviation and modeling of likely distribution shape, it is estimated that between 13% and 39% of people with moderate to severe TBI may have significant difficulties with facial affect recognition, depending on the cut-off criterion used.

Children with ADHD-combined type (n = 51), ADHD-predominantly inattentive type (n = 53), and 47 controls completed five neuropsychological tasks (Choice Discrimination Task, Child Attentional Network Task, Go\/No-Go task, Stop Signal Task, and N-back task), each allowing trial-by-trial assessment of RTs. Multiple indicators of RT variability including RT standard deviation, coefficient of variation and ex-Gaussian tau were used. Children with ADHD demonstrated greater RT variability than controls across all five tasks as measured by the ex-Gaussian indicator tau. There were minimal differences in RT variability across the ADHD subtypes. Children with ADHD also had poorer task accuracy than controls across all tasks except the Choice Discrimination task. Although ER and reward manipulations did affect children's RT variability and task accuracy, these manipulations largely did not differentially affect children with ADHD compared to controls. RT variability and task accuracy were highly correlated across tasks. Removing variance attributable to RT variability from task accuracy did not appreciably affect between-groups differences in task accuracy. High RT variability is a ubiquitous and robust phenomenon in children with ADHD. ","950":"Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) affects neurotransmitter systems regulating emotions and cognitive functions. This study aimed to assess executive functions, information sampling, reward processing, and decision making in NC. Twenty-one NC patients and 58 healthy participants performed an extensive neuropsychological test battery. NC patients scored as controls in executive function tasks assessing set shifting, reversal learning, working memory, and planning. Group differences appeared in a task measuring information sampling and reward sensitivity. NC patients gathered less information, tolerated a higher level of uncertainty, and were less influenced by reward contingencies than controls. NC patients also showed reduced learning in decision making and had significantly lower scores than controls in the fifth block of the IOWA gambling task. No correlations were found with measures of sleepiness. NC patients may achieve high performance in several neuropsychological domains, including executive functions. Specific differences between NC patients and controls highlight the importance of the hypocretin system in reward processing and decision making and are in line with previous neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies.

Eleven PD patients with bilateral DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and 13 matched controls completed 200 trials of the WPT on 2 separate occasions, with the patients tested with DBS of the STN on or off. DBS of the STN had no effect on overall WPT learning. However, STN DBS selectively improved implicit learning of cue combinations that were weakly (implicitly), rather than strongly (explicitly), associated with the WPT outcome. Results suggest that the STN plays a role in implicit probabilistic classification learning by altering basal ganglia output to the frontal cortex.

Previous reports have shown global deficits in neuropsychological measures among males with FXTAS, particularly those related to executive functioning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuropsychological profile among older males with the premutation who are at risk for FXTAS. Premutation carriers, 66 with motor symptoms and 23 without, and 18 noncarrier siblings were recruited from pedigrees diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, all over age 50. Subjects were examined with a neurological test battery to identify symptoms of FXTAS and a neuropsychological test battery to investigate cognitive and behavioral profiles. Linear regression and ANCOVA were used to determine the effect of the premutation on outcome measures adjusting for age and education. We identified a significant decrease in scores of general intelligence and a marginally significant decrease in scores of logical memory among premutation carrier males with motor symptoms compared to the noncarrier male siblings. We did not identify deficits in executive functioning in our sample of premutation carrier males with motor symptoms. Similar to other reports, we found that the FMR1 premutation is associated with deficits in general intelligence and memory among older males with symptoms of FXTAS.

A total of 120 children aged between 7 and 12 years (10 girls and 10 boys in each age band) were recruited. Tests of working memory, inhibition, and IQ were also administered. The age effect on PM accuracy was significant, with improvements identified between ages 7 to 8 and 10 to 11 years. For both tasks, performance on the time-based PM task was significantly poorer than that on the event-based PM task, which in turn was significantly poorer than that on the activity-based PM task. In terms of errors, results indicated that while errors associated with the PM component of the tasks decreased with age, errors associated with the RM component showed an inverted-U shape. The different patterns of errors suggest qualitative as well as quantitative differences in PM development in children. Finally, IQ, working memory, and inhibition were found to relate to PM when age was partialed out. Results of the study highlight the importance of contextual cues, such as activities and events, for prospective remembering in children. In addition, they have provided a general picture of PM development in school-age children and have implications for educators and parents.

Abnormalities in self-referential processing and its neural underpinnings have been reported in schizophrenia and at-risk populations, suggesting they might be markers of psychotic vulnerability. Psychometric measures of schizotypal traits may be used to index psychosis proneness (PP) in nonclinical samples. It remains an unresolved question whether differences in self-reflective processing are associated with PP. Six hundred students completed the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences Questionnaire, positive subscale. Two groups were formed from the extremes of the distribution (total N = 36). fMRI was used to examine CMS\/insula function during a self-reflection task. Participants judged personality trait sentences about self and about an acquaintance. High PP subjects attributed less positive traits to others (i.e., acquaintances) than subjects with low PP. Across groups, the contrasts self &gt; semantic and self &gt; other induced activation in CMS and insula, whereas other &gt; semantic did not produce insula activation. Other &gt; self induced posterior cingulate cortex activation in low PP but not in high PP. In addition, high PP subjects showed stronger activation than low PP in left insula during self &gt; semantic. Examining valence effects revealed that high PP individuals showed increased activation in left insula, right dMPFC, and left vMPFC for positive self-related traits, and in bilateral insula, ACC, and right dMPFC for negative self-related traits. The findings suggest that aspects of self-referential processing and underlying brain mechanisms are similar in clinical and subclinical (high PP) forms of psychosis, suggesting that these may be associated with vulnerability to psychosis.

Forty-eight preadolescent children (25 males, 23 females, mean age = 10.1 years) were grouped into higher- and lower-fit groups according to their performance on a test of aerobic capacity (VO2max). Cognitive function was measured via behavioral responses to a modified flanker task. The distribution in reaction time was calculated within each participant to assess intraindividual variability of performance. Specifically, the standard deviation and coefficient variation of reaction time were used to represent cognitive variability. Preadolescent children, regardless of fitness, exhibited longer reaction time, increased response variability, and decreased response accuracy to incongruent compared to congruent trials. Further, higher-fit children were less variable in their response time and more accurate in their responses across conditions of the flanker task, while no group differences were observed for response speed. These findings suggest that fitness is associated with better cognitive performance during a task that varies cognitive control demands, and extends this area of research to suggest that intraindividual variability may be a useful measure to examine the relationship between fitness and cognition during preadolescence. ","958":"Many neurologically constrained models of semantic memory have been informed by two primary temporal lobe pathologies: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Semantic Dementia (SD). However, controversy persists regarding the nature of the semantic impairment associated with these patient populations. Some argue that AD presents as a disconnection syndrome in which linguistic impairment reflects difficulties in lexical or perceptual means of semantic access. In contrast, there is a wider consensus that SD reflects loss of core knowledge that underlies word and object meaning. Object naming provides a window into the integrity of semantic knowledge in these two populations. We examined naming accuracy, errors and the correlation of naming ability with neuropsychological measures (semantic ability, executive functioning, and working memory) in a large sample of patients with AD (n = 36) and SD (n = 21). Naming ability and naming errors differed between groups, as did neuropsychological predictors of naming ability. Despite a similar extent of baseline cognitive impairment, SD patients were more anomic than AD patients. These results add to a growing body of literature supporting a dual impairment to semantic content and active semantic processing in AD, and confirm the fundamental deficit in semantic content in SD. We interpret these findings as supporting of a model of semantic memory premised upon dynamic interactivity between the process and content of conceptual knowledge.

This study investigated attentional control in NA and AD compared to healthy young adults in several tasks such as setting, suppressing, switching, and preparing attention. Fifty-two participants (17 AD, 17 NA, and 18 young participants) underwent the Tower of London, the Zoo map test, the Stroop test, letter verbal fluency, a computerized version of the Rule shift cards tests, the Trail making test, the Plus-minus test, and a reaction time task with variable preparatory intervals. Analyses of variance showed that NA as compared to young participants were impaired in the Tower of London, the Stroop test, and the Rule shift cards tests. AD as compared to NA participants were impaired in all tests except the Stroop test. Principal component analysis in young adults confirmed the modularity of attentional tasks, which was reduced in NA and AD participants. Principal component analysis in all populations showed a decline of attentional control with NA and AD regardless of the tasks, with an increase in between-participants variability only between young and NA participants. Attentional control dysfunction is different in NA and AD: NA affects suppressing attention, switching attention for unpredictable but not predictable events, and preparing attention for unpredictable events, whereas AD affects setting, suppressing, switching, and preparing attention with less specificity.

This hypothesis was examined by applying longitudinal growth models to data from a community-based sample of 698 adults (ages 65 to 94 years and living independently at baseline) who were repeatedly measured over five years on neurocognitive tests of executive reasoning, episodic memory, and perceptual speed, and on a number of tasks that adults should be reasonably expected to be able to perform in their day-to-day lives. Individual differences in changes in neurocognitive performance were strongly correlated with individual differences in changes in performance on the everyday tasks. Alternatively, changes in self-reports of everyday functions were only weakly correlated with changes in performance on the neurocognitive tests and the everyday tasks. These results together suggest that normative neurocognitive aging has substantial consequences for the daily lives of older adults and that both researchers and clinicians should be cautious when interpreting self-reports of everyday functioning.

Outcome measures were Logical Memory II, Letter-Number Sequencing, and Spatial Span from the Wechsler Memory Scale. Participants were 319 healthy women aged 40-79 years at baseline (2001). Significant correlations were found between the number of errors on the NART and memory measures in 2001, 2005, and 2008; Logical Memory II (r = -.41, -.38, -.39, respectively), Letter-Number Sequencing (r = -.38, -.35, -.36, respectively) and Spatial Span (r = -.23, -.22, -.19, respectively; all p values &lt; .001). NART significantly added to predictions of all three measures of memory, after controlling for age, level of education and socioeconomic status. NART also significantly added to predictions of change in Logical Memory II and Letter-Number Sequencing over a 7-year period. The results indicate that the NART is correlated with episodic and working memory, and that the NART added to predictions of change in verbal episodic and working memory. Although the relationships are only moderate at best, the NART may be used in conjunction with demographic information and clinical reasoning to estimate premorbid memory functioning.

All participants completed a uniform study visit that included a neurological evaluation, neuropsychological battery, molecular testing, and functional MRI during an AS task. The blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response was obtained during saccade preparation and saccade execution for both correct and incorrect responses using regression analysis. Significant group differences in BOLD response were observed when comparing incorrect AS to correct AS execution. Specifically, as the percentage of incorrect AS increased, BOLD responses in the CAG- group decreased progressively in a well-documented reward detection network that includes the presupplementary motor area and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, AS errors in the preHD and early HD groups lacked this relationship with BOLD signal in the error detection network, and BOLD responses to AS errors were smaller in the two CAG+ groups as compared with the CAG- group. These results are the first to suggest that abnormalities in an error-related response network may underlie early changes in AS eye movements in premanifest and early manifest HD.

While performance-based tests of everyday functioning are reasonably sensitive to HIV-associated IADL declines, questions remain regarding the extent to which these tests' highly structured nature fully captures the inherent complexities of daily life. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive and ecological validity of a novel multitasking measure in HIV infection. Participants included 60 individuals with HIV infection (HIV+) and 25 demographically comparable seronegative adults (HIV-). Participants were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, questionnaires assessing mood and everyday functioning, and a novel standardized test of multitasking, which involved balancing the demands of four interconnected performance-based functional tasks (i.e., financial management, cooking, medication management, and telephone communication). HIV+ individuals demonstrated significantly worse overall performance, fewer simultaneous task attempts, and increased errors on the multitasking test as compared to the HIV- group. Within the HIV+ sample, multitasking impairments were modestly associated with deficits on standard neuropsychological measures of executive functions, episodic memory, attention\/working memory, and information processing speed, providing preliminary evidence for convergent validity. More importantly, multivariate prediction models revealed that multitasking deficits were uniquely predictive of IADL dependence beyond the effects of depression and global neurocognitive impairment, with excellent sensitivity (86%), but modest specificity (57%). Taken together, these data indicate that multitasking ability may play an important role in successful everyday functioning in HIV+ individuals. ","964":"Bodily self-recognition is one aspect of our ability to distinguish between self and others and is central to effective socialization. Here we explored the influence of emotional body postures on bodily self-processing in typically developing (TD) as well as in high-functioning ASD children. Subjects' bodies were photographed while expressing endogenously- (self-generated, Experiment 1) or exogenously-driven body emotions (imitated upon request, Experiment 2). Postures conveying positive (happiness), negative (fearful) and neutral valences were used. These pictures served as stimuli in a visual matching-to-sample task with self and others' body-images. A similar self-versus-others advantage was found in TD and in ASD children, since participants were faster with stimuli representing their own than others' body. This \"self-advantage\" was modulated by self-expressed emotional body postures being present with pictures of happy and neutral, but not fearful body images. This modulation was stronger when emotional postures were endogenously rather than exogenously driven. Moreover, faster responses were observed for others' fearful rather than happy or neutral body images in both groups. The bodily self-advantage is a low-level function present in typically developing (TD) and in high-functioning ASD children. Body postures, especially when they are endogenously generated, modulate the self and others' body processing. The advantage for processing others' fearful, comparing to others' happy and neutral, body postures may have played a crucial evolutionary role for species survival. ","965":"Comparability of meaning of neuropsychological test results across ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups is important for clinicians challenged with assessing increasing numbers of older ethnic minorities. We examined the dimensional structure of a neuropsychological test battery in linguistically and demographically diverse older adults. The Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS), developed to provide psychometrically sound measures of cognition for multiethnic and multilingual applications, was administered to a community dwelling sample of 760 Whites, 443 African Americans, 451 English-speaking Hispanics, and 882 Spanish-speaking Hispanics. Cognitive function spanned a broad range from normal to mildly impaired to demented. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine equivalence of the dimensional structure for the SENAS across the groups defined by language and ethnicity. Covariance among 16 SENAS tests was best explained by five cognitive dimensions corresponding to episodic memory, semantic memory\/language, spatial ability, attention\/working memory, and verbal fluency. Multiple Group confirmatory factor analysis supported a common dimensional structure in the diverse groups. Measures of episodic memory showed the most compelling evidence of measurement equivalence across groups. Measurement equivalence was observed for most but not all measures of semantic memory\/language and spatial ability. Measures of attention\/working memory defined a common dimension in the different groups, but results suggest that scores are not strictly comparable across groups. These results support the applicability of the SENAS for use with multiethnic and bilingual older adults, and more broadly, provide evidence of similar dimensions of cognition in the groups represented in the study. ","966":"To determine whether socioemotional disinhibition and executive dysfunction are related to dissociable patterns of brain atrophy in neurodegenerative disease. Previous studies have indicated that behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease are linked to atrophy in different parts of the frontal lobes, but these prior studies did not establish that these relationships were specific, which would best be demonstrated by a double dissociation. Subjects included 157 patients with neurodegenerative disease. A semiautomated parcellation program (Freesurfer) was used to generate regional cortical volumes from structural MRI scans. Regions of interest (ROIs) included anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Socioemotional disinhibition was measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Principal component analysis including 3 tasks of executive function (EF; verbal fluency, Stroop Interference, modified Trails) was used to generate a single-factor score to represent EF. Partial correlations between ROIs, disinhibition, and EF were computed after controlling for total intracranial volume, Mini-Mental State Examination, diagnosis, age, and education. Brain regions significantly correlated with disinhibition (ACC, OFC, IFG, and temporal lobes) and EF (MFG) were entered into separate hierarchical regressions to determine which brain regions predicted disinhibition and EF. OFC was the only brain region to significantly predict disinhibition, and MFG significantly predicted EF performance. A multivariate general linear model demonstrated a significant interaction between ROIs and cognitive-behavioral functions. These results support a specific association between orbitofrontal areas and behavioral management as compared with dorsolateral areas and EF. ","967":null,"968":"Verbal fluency measures are frequently part of batteries designed to assess executive function (EF), but are also used to assess semantic processing ability or word knowledge. The goal of the present study was to identify the cognitive components underlying fluency performance. Healthy young and older adults, adults with Parkinson's disease, and adults with Alzheimer's disease performed letter, category, and action fluency tests. Performance was assessed in terms of number of items generated, clustering, and the time course of output. A series of neuropsychological assessments were also administered to index verbal ability, working memory, EF, and processing speed as correlates of fluency performance. Findings indicated that regardless of the particular performance measure, young adults performed the best and adults with Alzheimer's disease performed most poorly, with healthy older adults and adults with Parkinson's disease performing at intermediate levels. The exception was the action fluency task, where adults with Parkinson's disease performed most poorly. The time course of fluency performance was characterized in terms of slope and intercept parameters and related to neuropsychological constructs. Speed of processing was found to be the best predictor of performance, rather than the efficiency of EF or semantic knowledge. Together, these findings demonstrate that the pattern of fluency performance looks generally the same regardless of how performance is measured. In addition, the primary role of processing speed in performance suggests that the use of fluency tasks as measures of EF or verbal ability warrants reexamination. ","969":"It has been proposed that time, space, and numbers share the same metrics and cortical network, the right parietal cortex. Several recent investigations have demonstrated that the mental number line representation is distorted in neglect patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between time and spatial configuration in neglect patients. Fourteen right-brain damaged patients (six with neglect and eight without neglect), as well as eight age-matched healthy controls, performed a time discrimination task. A standard tone (short: 700 ms and long: 1,700 ms) had to be confronted in duration to a test tone. Test tone differed of 100, 200, and 300 ms respect to the standard tone duration. Neglect patients performed significantly worse than patients without neglect and healthy controls, irrespective of the duration of the standard tone. These results support the hypothesis that mental representations of space and time both share, to some extent, a common cortical network. Besides, spatial neglect seems to distort the time representation, inducing an overestimation of time durations. ","970":"Inhibiting the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) appears to have deleterious effects on people's semantic conceptualization, and left ATL damage is associated with semantic dementia. However, little research has investigated whether rTMS can inhibit conceptual schemata that have potentially negative consequences. Our aim was to investigate whether rTMS to the ATLs could reduce scores on a standard measure of prejudice (implicit association test, IAT). Forty (17 female; mean age 20.6) neurologically normal, right-handed undergraduates participated. Participants were randomly allocated into one of four rTMS stimulation conditions-left ATL, right ATL, control site (motor cortex, Cz), and sham stimulation. All participants completed a modified IAT, where \"good\" and \"bad\" words were replaced with \"terrorist\" and \"law-abider\" words, and, \"Black\" and \"White\" were replaced with \"Arab\" and \"Non-Arab\" words. Participants were then given 15 min of rTMS stimulation. Afterward, participants completed a parallel form of the IAT. To investigate the effects of rTMS on IAT scores, a one-way ANOVA on the difference between pre- and postscores was carried out revealing that there were significant between group differences (F3,36 = 3.57; p = .02). Planned contrasts revealed that both left and right ATL stimulation significantly reduced IAT scores poststimulation, indicating lower prejudice. We show that prejudice scores can be significantly reduced by inhibitory rTMS delivered to the bilateral ATLs. This may implicate this area in conceptual associations that lead to overgeneralization and stereotyping of social groups. ","971":null,"972":"Patients with Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) have atrophy in posterior parietal cortex. This region of atrophy has been previously linked with quantifier comprehension difficulty, but previous studies employed visual stimuli, making it difficult to account for potentially confounding visuospatial deficits in CBS patients. The current study evaluated comprehension of generalized quantifiers using strictly verbal materials. Non-aphasic CBS patients, a brain-damaged control group (consisting of patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia), and age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. We assessed familiar temporal, spatial, and monetary domains of verbal knowledge comparatively. Judgment accuracy was only evaluated in statements for which patients demonstrated accurate factual knowledge about the target domain. We found that patients with CBS are significantly impaired in their ability to evaluate quantifiers when compared to healthy seniors and a brain-damaged control group, even in this strictly verbal task. This impairment was seen in the vast majority of individual CBS patients. These findings offer additional evidence of quantifier impairment in CBS patients and emphasize that this impairment cannot be attributed to potential visuo spatial processing impairments in patients with parietal disease. ","973":"The present investigation assessed the severity, course, and cerebral implications of serial reaction time (SRT) procedural learning deficits in schizophrenia. Hemodynamic changes on fMRI were assessed during an SRT task in 17 unmedicated first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and matched healthy controls. The groups demonstrated comparable procedural learning and associated activation of anterior cingulate cortex, subcortical structures, and many left frontal structures. The groups also demonstrated comparable increased activation of right parietal structures on trials with demands for spatial localization without procedural memory. Relative to healthy controls, the schizophrenia sample showed less activation of one region of the left middle frontal cortex and more activation of left superior temporal cortex on procedural trials, but more activation of right medial frontal cortex on localization trials. Intact SRT procedural learning and normal or enhanced hemodynamic response in subcortical and right cortical structures diverges from prior results with medicated samples, suggesting a more focal cerebral dysfunction in the left middle frontal cortex before the onset of treatment. ","974":"The development of \"common ground,\" or mutual knowledge of shared information, is believed to require the ability to update a mental representation of another person's thoughts and knowledge based on verbal information and nonverbal social and emotional signals, to facilitate economical communication. As in other forms of everyday social communication, the development of common ground likely requires the orchestration of multiple cognitive processes supported by various neural systems. Here, we investigate the contribution of the amygdala to these processes. SM, a patient with complete, focal, bilateral amygdala damage, and deficits in social and emotional processing, and five healthy comparison participants, each interacted with a familiar partner. We investigated the participants' ability to develop and use referential labels across 24 dynamic, collaborative interactions. Participants verbally directed their partner how to arrange a set of 12 abstract tangrams while separated by a low barrier, allowing them to see each other but hiding their tangrams. In contrast to comparison participants, SM exhibited an impaired rate of learning across trials and did not show the typical simplification in the labels generated during the interactions. Detailed analyses of SM's interactional discourse and social behavior suggested that she has impaired perspective-taking or what can be interpreted as deficient \"theory of mind,\" manifested in abnormal \"language-in-use.\" These results support the conclusion that the amygdala, a structure critical for social and emotional processing, plays an important role in the acquisition and use of common ground and in social communication more broadly. ","975":"Only a handful of studies have attempted to explore very long-term outcomes from childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). These studies have generally failed to fully consider the impact of injury severity or employ measures sensitive to the survivor's day-to-day function. This study examined outcomes in adulthood, with a focus on functional abilities including education, employment, and quality of life (QOL), and employed predictors including injury severity, age at injury, socioeconomic factors, intelligence, and personality. The study was retrospective and cross-sectional and included 50 adult survivors of child TBI (31 males), aged 19-30 years at evaluation (M = 24.2, SD = 3.6), with injury on average 13.3 years prior to evaluation. Participants were divided according to injury severity-mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 12), and severe (n = 18)-completed an intellectual evaluation and questionnaires regarding educational and employment status, personality, and quality of life. Intellectual and personality measures indicated good outcomes, with mean scores for all groups in the average range and few severity-based findings. In contrast, those with more severe TBI were more likely to have educational and employment problems. QOL was significantly reduced in the context of severe insult, with lower IQ and personality factors most predictive of outcome in this domain. Mild and moderate TBI were generally more benign. Findings suggest that, while TBI is a lifelong problem, its impact is most dramatic in the domain of QOL, where a complex interaction occurs between injury factors, cognition, and personality.

We used neurocomputational modeling to develop plausible mechanistic hypotheses explaining reinforcement learning impairments in individuals with SZ. We tested the model with a novel Go\/NoGo learning task in which subjects had to learn to respond or withhold responses when presented with different stimuli associated with different probabilities of gains or losses in points. We analyzed data from 34 patients and 23 matched controls, characterizing positive- and negative-feedback-driven learning in both a training phase and a test phase. Consistent with simulations from a computational model of aberrant dopamine input to the basal ganglia patients, patients with SZ showed an overall increased rate of responding in the training phase, together with reduced response-time acceleration to frequently rewarded stimuli across training blocks, and a reduced relative preference for frequently rewarded training stimuli in the test phase. Patients did not differ from controls on measures of procedural negative-feedback-driven learning, although patients with SZ exhibited deficits in trial-to-trial adjustments to negative feedback, with these measures correlating with negative symptom severity. These findings support the hypothesis that patients with SZ have a deficit in procedural \"Go\" learning, linked to abnormalities in DA transmission at D1-type receptors, despite a \"Go bias\" (increased response rate), potentially related to excessive tonic dopamine. Deficits in trial-to-trial reinforcement learning were limited to a subset of patients with SZ with severe negative symptoms, putatively stemming from prefrontal cortical dysfunction. ","979":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) often results in demyelination of a network of frontal-subcortical tracts involved in processing emotional information. We investigated the effect of MS on the ability to identify emotional and nonemotional information from static and dynamic stimuli and determined whether difficulties in emotion perception related to quality of life. 32 MS and 33 control participants, matched for age and education, identified emotions and nonemotional information from static images of faces and dynamic videos of people interacting. They also completed cognitive assessment and quality of life ratings. On the static face perception tasks, participants with MS performed more poorly than healthy controls on emotion perception, t(63) = 3.30, p &lt; .01, d = .83, but not identity perception, t(63) = 1.18, d = .30. For the dynamic tasks, the MS group were impaired on emotion perception, t(63) = 3.41, p = .001, d = .86, but not age\/gender perception, t(63) = 0.15, d = .04. Ratings of social and psychological aspects of quality of life in MS were related to emotion perception scores, controlling for disease severity and duration, age, depression, and cognitive function, with r2 ranging from .17 to .24. These results indicate a specific deficit in decoding static and dynamic information about emotion in MS, as compared to nonemotional information. There were specific relationships between emotion perception problems and poor social and psychological quality of life, indicating that emotional skills should be considered when evaluating functioning in MS.

This study examined whether or not PS slowing could account for the WM deficits observed in SLE. A visual n-back task was used to measure simple and complex PS and WM in 40 SLE patients and 36 healthy controls. Simple PS was defined as reaction time (RT) to correct responses under a very low WM load condition (0-back), while complex PS was defined as RT to correct responses under moderate and high WM load conditions (1 and 2-back). The results showed that SLE patients performed as well as the controls at the lower WM load conditions but had fewer correct responses than controls under the highest WM load condition (2-back). SLE patients had slower RTs than controls under all conditions, but they had relatively greater RT slowing than controls under the higher WM load conditions. Further, when RT for simple PS was subtracted from complex PS, SLE patients still showed slower complex PS for the 1- and 2-back compared with controls. Both simple and complex PS slowing were related to poorer accuracy scores on the 2-back condition, only for the SLE group. The n-back task provides a sensitive measure of PS and WM. The results suggest that PS deficits alone could not account for the WM deficits in SLE. Disease duration, disease activity, and depression did not appear to account for the observed PS and WM deficits. ","982":"The aim of the current study was to clarify the nature and extent of impairment in time- versus event-based prospective memory in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prospective memory is thought to involve cognitive processes that are mediated by prefrontal systems and are executive in nature. Given that individuals with PD frequently show executive dysfunction, it is important to determine whether these individuals may have deficits in prospective memory that could impact daily functions, such as taking medications. Although it has been reported that individuals with PD evidence impairment in prospective memory, it is still unclear whether they show a greater deficit for time- versus event-based cues. Fifty-four individuals with PD and 34 demographically similar healthy adults were administered a standardized measure of prospective memory that allows for a direct comparison of time-based and event-based cues. In addition, participants were administered a series of standardized measures of retrospective memory and executive functions. Individuals with PD demonstrated impaired prospective memory performance compared to the healthy adults, with a greater impairment demonstrated for the time-based tasks. Time-based prospective memory performance was moderately correlated with measures of executive functioning, but only the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test emerged as a unique predictor in a linear regression. Findings are interpreted within the context of McDaniel and Einstein's (2000) multiprocess theory to suggest that individuals with PD experience particular difficulty executing a future intention when the cue to execute the prescribed intention requires higher levels of executive control.

An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a sequence of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted on 24 neuropsychological measures selected to provide a comprehensive estimate of cognitive abilities most likely to be affected in preclinical AD. Once the underlying latent model was defined and the structural validity established through model comparisons, a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis model was used to test for factorial invariance across groups. The EFA solution revealed a factor structure consisting of five constructs: verbal ability, visuospatial ability, speed &amp; executive function, working memory, and verbal learning &amp; memory. The CFA models provided support for the hypothesized 5-factor structure. Results indicated factorial invariance of the model across all groups examined. Collectively, the results suggested a relatively strong psychometric basis for using the factor structure in clinical samples that match the characteristics of this cohort. This confirmed an invariant factor structure should prove useful in research aimed to detect the earliest cognitive signature of preclinical AD in similar middle aged cohorts.

This study examined whether cognitive complaints are associated with longitudinal changes in cognition and cross-sectional differences in regional brain function during memory performance in 98 participants with a mean age of 75. The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) assessed cognitive complaints and mixed effects regression models were used to determine whether mean CFQ scores predicted rates of change in cognitive function over a period of 11.5 years. Higher CFQ scores, reflecting increased subjective complaints, were associated with steeper rates of decline in immediate and delayed recall on the California Verbal Learning Test. Voxel-based regression analysis was used to determine the cross-sectional relationship between CFQ scores and regional cerebral blood flow measured by PET during a resting condition and during verbal and figural memory tasks. Higher levels of cognitive complaints were associated with increased activity in insular, lingual and cerebellar areas during memory tasks. These findings offer some support for the validity of subjective cognitive complaints as markers of age related changes in memory and brain activity.

This study investigated the role of episodic memory in the recovery of time estimation abilities following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using a prospective verbal time estimation paradigm, TBI participants were tested in the early phase of recovery from TBI and then again approximately one year later. Verbal time estimations were made for filled intervals both within (i.e., 10 s, 25 s) and beyond (i.e., 45 s 60 s) the time frame of working memory. At baseline, when compared to controls, the TBI group significantly underestimated time durations at the 25 s, 45 s and 60 s intervals, indicating that the TBI group perceived less time as having passed than actually had passed. At follow-up, despite the presence of continued episodic memory impairment and little recovery in episodic memory performance, the TBI group exhibited estimates of time passage that were similar to controls. The pattern of data was interpreted at suggesting that episodic memory performance did not play a noteworthy role in the recovery of temporal perception in TBI participants. ","990":"The spatial location memory of preschool-aged children born preterm has rarely been studied primarily due to an absence of developmentally sensitive measures. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature. We administered a modification of the Hopkins Board to 135 children at age 3 who were born extremely low birth weight (ELBW) (n = 20), late-preterm (LPT) (n = 75), or at term (TERM) (n = 40). Five measures were obtained: naming, trials-to-criterion, errors-to-criterion, delayed item recall, and delayed location recall. ANCOVA indicated that the groups differed in naming (p = .019), errors-to-criterion (p = .002), and delayed item recall (p = .025). For these measures, ELBW performed worse than TERM and LPT, but LPT did not differ from TERM. Corrected age and sociodemographic factors did not eliminate the deficit in spatial location learning for ELBW participants. A MANCOVA found a significant difference in learning, with post hoc tests indicating significant learning across trials in the LPT and TERM groups, but not in the ELBW group. ELBW is a significant risk factor for developmental delay or impairment of spatial location learning. These findings suggest that the modified Hopkins Board identifies at-risk premature children. This modification may be more broadly useful to assess preschoolers' neurodevelopmental maturation. ","991":null,"992":"While attentional functions are usually found to be impaired in schizophrenia, a review of the literature on the orienting of spatial attention in schizophrenia suggested that voluntary attentional orienting in response to a valid cue might be paradoxically enhanced. We tested this hypothesis with orienting tasks involving the cued detection of a laterally presented target stimulus. Subjects were chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) and matched healthy control subjects (HC). In Experiment 1 (15 SZ, 16 HC), cues were endogenous (arrows) and could be valid (100% predictive) or neutral with respect to the subsequent target position. In Experiment 2 (16 SZ, 16 HC), subjects performed a standard orienting task with unpredictive exogenous cues (brightening of the target boxes). In Experiment 1, SZ showed a larger attentional facilitation effect on reaction time than HC. In Experiment 2, no clear sign of enhanced attentional facilitation was found in SZ. The voluntary, facilitatory shifting of spatial attention may be relatively enhanced in individuals with schizophrenia in comparison to healthy individuals. This effect bears resemblance to other relative enhancements of information processing in schizophrenia such as saccade speed and semantic priming.

In Study A, 19 ALS patients and 20 healthy controls undertook a test of affective decision making, modified Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Behavioral measures included the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. In Study B, 14 ALS patients and 20 controls undertook tests of social and emotional cognition (Judgment of Preference based on eye gaze, the Mind in the Eyes, recognition of Facial Expressions of Emotion). In Study A, ALS patients demonstrated a significantly different performance profile from healthy controls on the IGT and did not learn to avoid the disadvantageous stimuli (Block 3, d = 0.60, Block 4 days = 0.68). Behavior ratings showed increased apathy from premorbid levels. In Study B, ALS patients were impaired on attentionally demanding (d = 3.12) and undemanding (d = 7.52) conditions of the Judgment of Preference task, despite many showing intact executive functions. A smaller subset showed impaired emotion recognition. Behavior change was also evident. The findings reveal a Theory of Mind deficit on a simple test that was dissociated from the presence of executive dysfunction and suggests a profile of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction indicative of a subclinical fvFTD syndrome.

Thirty-two normal young subjects (Study 1) and 20 probable Alzheimer's disease patients (pAD) with 20 matched older controls (Study 2) were tested with verbal definitions consisting of 4 features, combining feature type (sensory vs. nonsensory) and semantic relevance (high vs. low). The subjects were asked to provide a name corresponding to the definition and to select which individual features they considered most important in justifying their answer. Feature selection results showed that high-relevance features first (d = 2.13 in Study 1; d = 1.44 in Study 2) and nonsensory features second (d = 0.81 in Study 1; d = 0.36 in Study 2) were the main dimensions driving correct performance. Overall, naming performance was affected by the age of acquisition (AoA) of the concept, and differences between the groups in all measures were mainly quantitative. These findings suggest that semantic relevance and feature type are important feature dimensions in conceptual representation and in conceptual access and retrieval. Moreover, results suggest that the former dimension may be more important than the latter, at least in the case of naming from definition. Finally, these results extend previous findings with other tasks, supporting the importance of AoA for correct performance and suggesting that the poorer performance of pAD patients on semantic tasks may represent an exaggeration of difficulties found also in normal older subjects.

Nonverbal cues are powerful social signals but are often processed implicitly, outside the focus of attention. The aim of this research was to assess implicit processing of social cues in individuals with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and matched controls performed a primary task of word classification with social cues in the background. Participants were asked to classify target words (LEFT\/RIGHT) by pressing a key that corresponded to the word, in the context of facial expressions with eye gaze averted to the left or right. Although facial expression and gaze direction were irrelevant to the task, these facial cues influenced word classification performance. Participants were slower to classify target words (e.g., LEFT) that were incongruent to gaze direction (e.g., eyes averted to the right) compared to target words (e.g., LEFT) that were congruent to gaze direction (e.g., eyes averted to the left), but this only occurred for expressions of fear. This pattern did not differ for patients and controls. The results showed that threat-related signals capture the attention of individuals with schizophrenia. These data suggest that implicit processing of eye gaze and fearful expressions is intact in schizophrenia.

The results showed clear impairment in recall in TLE patients. However, both TLE patients and controls showed an improvement in accuracy in their poststudy predictions compared with their prestudy predictions, showing that both groups were able to upgrade their metamemory predictions. Unexpectedly, prediction accuracy was overall higher in TLE patients than in controls. Moreover, study time was allocated in both groups taking into account the characteristics of the list.

Participants were 6-9 year old children with ADHD (n = 57) and without ADHD (n = 59). Using a selectivity task, participants studied words paired with point values and were asked to maximize their score, which was the overall value of the items they recalled. This task allows for measures of memory capacity and the ability to selectively remember high-value items. Although there were no significant between-groups differences in the number of words recalled (memory capacity), children with ADHD were less selective than children in the control group in terms of the value of the items they recalled (control of memory). All children recalled more high-value items than low-value items and showed some learning with task experience, but children with ADHD Combined type did not efficiently maximize memory performance (as measured by a selectivity index) relative to children with ADHD Inattentive type and healthy controls, who did not differ significantly from one another. Children with ADHD Combined type exhibit impairments in the strategic and efficient encoding and recall of high-value items.

Participants included 68 nondemented, idiopathic PD patients, ages 56-82 years. The Apathy Evaluation Scale-Self-Rating and select items of the Beck Depression Inventory II were used to assess symptoms of apathy and depression, respectively. Cognitive function was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. Correlations and hierarchical regressions were conducted to investigate the relationships between apathy, depression, and cognitive function. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the degree of influence of depression and apathy on cognitive function. Results revealed that symptoms of apathy, but not depression, were significantly and negatively associated with executive functioning. Immediate memory was significantly and negatively associated with both apathy and depression. However, apathy accounted for additional variance in memory performance after controlling for depression at a level approaching significance. Apathy is not only associated with cognitive impairment, but also with impaired daily functioning, caregiver burden and distress, medication noncompliance, and increased mortality. Differentiating apathy and depression, understanding their unique effects, and appropriately identifying apathy symptoms in patients have robust implications for the development of neuropsychological models of these effects in PD as well as practical implications in guiding improvements to patient care and enhancing quality of life in patients and caregivers.

The good performance of blind people, especially adventitiously ones, was interpreted as evidence that sequential haptic inputs were organized spatially. The possible cognitive processes underlying the performance were discussed. ","1005":"Because antiretroviral treatment (ART) fails to improve neurocognitive impairment in children with HIV, we completed a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and cognitive benefit of computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) in Ugandan children with HIV. Sixty Ugandan children with HIV (23 on ART) were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of Captain's Log CCRT (Sandford, 2007) training configured for attention and memory skills or no intervention. Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (2nd ed., KABC-2; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004) performance at baseline indicated pervasive neurocognitive impairment. Cognitive ability was assessed before and after training using the Cogstate computerized neuropsychological test (Darby, Maruff, Collie, &amp; McStephen, 2002). Viral load along with CD4 and CD8 absolute and activation levels also were measured posttest. CCRT was well received with a 95% adherence rate to scheduled training sessions. CCRT intervention children showed greater improvement on a Cogstate card detection task of simple attention (p = .02), and speed of correct moves on a Groton Maze Learning Task (p &lt; .001). These analyses were completed using an analysis of covariance model that adjusted Cogstate performance for the child's age, standardized weight for age, gender, socioeconomic status, school grade level, and baseline KABC-2 performance. ART treatment was not related to Cogstate performance or improvement as a result of CCRT. CD4 and CD8 activation levels were correlated with Cogstate improvement specifically for the CCRT group. CCRT was feasible with our study population and improved maze learning and attention on a detection task. This supports previous findings by our group with cerebral malaria survivors (Bangirana, Giordani, et al., 2009). ","1006":"Our study investigated hemispheric lateralization for musical structure processing using a dichotic listening paradigm with music and speech. Eight chord sequences and 8 spoken syllable sequences were simultaneously presented, each to 1 ear. For the musical sequences, the final chord was expected (i.e., tonic) or less expected (i.e., subdominant). In addition to tonal function, which was task irrelevant, we manipulated the final syllable and the final timbre of the sequences for the experimental task: Participants were asked to identify the final syllable (\/di\/, \/du\/) or the timbre of the final chord (Timbre A or B). Our experiment revealed a left-ear advantage for the tonal function effect on spoken syllable identification. For syllables presented to the right ear, identification was faster when the final chord of the musical sequence was a tonic chord rather than a subdominant chord (i.e., musical sequences presented to the left ear). The present finding extends the effect of musical structure previously observed for sung and visual syllable processing to spoken syllable processing. It further suggests a right-hemispheric specialization for the processing of musical structures in healthy listeners, as previously reported for split-brain patients (Tramo &amp; Bharucha, 1991). ","1007":"Previous research has demonstrated that hypoglycemia causes reaction times to be slower and more variable. Reaction time tests, however, use multiple cognitive and noncognitive processes. This study is the first to use a validated sequential sampling model (diffusion model) applied to results obtained from a simple 2-choice task in adult humans to assess the effects of hypoglycemia on the basic parameters of decision making. Fourteen adult volunteers were tested on a numerosity discrimination task with and without reduced blood glucose concentrations. The results were analyzed with a model that dissects the components of processing that underlie decisions: the quality of the information on which a decision is based (drift rate), the critical amount of evidence that must be accumulated before a decision is made (boundary separation), and the time taken by nondecision processes. Hypoglycemia resulted in a reduction of mean drift rate from 0.290 to 0.211, t(13) = 4.10, p &lt; .05. No effect of experimental state was observed on the amount of evidence required to make a decision or peripheral and motor processes. This study locates the precise processing deficit associated with hypoglycemia and provides further understanding of the precise cognitive effect of hypoglycemia. Further research into the amelioration of these effects is required. ","1008":"The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a tool used to assess the efficiency of the 3 attention networks-alerting, orienting, and executive control. The ANT has become popular in the neuropsychological literature since its first description in 2002, with some form of the task currently appearing in no less than 65 original research papers. Although several general reviews of the ANT exist, none provide an analysis of its psychometric properties. Data from 15 unique studies were collected, resulting in a large sample (N = 1,129) of healthy individuals. Split-half reliability, variance structure, distribution shape, and independence of measurement of the 3 attention network scores were analyzed, considering both reaction time and accuracy as dependent variables. Split-half reliabilities of reaction time based attention network scores were low for alerting (rweighted = .20, CI 95%weighted [.14, .27], Spearman-Brown r = .38) and orienting (rweighted = .32, CI 95%weighted [.26, .38], Spearman-Brown r = .55), and moderate high for executive control (rweighted = .65, CI 95%weighted [.61, .71], Spearman-Brown r = .81). Analysis of the variance structure of the ANT indicated that power to find significant effects was variable across networks and dependent on the statistical analysis being used. Both analysis of variance (significant interaction observed in 100% of 15 studies) and correlational analyses (multiple-significant inter-network correlations observed) suggest that the networks measured by the ANT are not independent. In the collection, analysis and interpretation of any test data, psychometric properties, such as those reported here for the ANT, must be carefully considered. ","1009":"Word list learning tasks such as the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987) are widely used to investigate recall strategies. Participants who recall the most words generally employ semantic techniques, whereas those with poor recall (e.g., patients with schizophrenia) rely on serial techniques. However, these conclusions are based on formulas that assume that categories reflect semantic associations, bind strategy to overall performance, and neglect strategy changes over 5 trials. Therefore, we derived novel measures-independent of recall performance-to compute strategies across trials and identify whether diagnosis predicts recall strategy. Participants were included on the basis of performance on the CVLT (i.e., total words recalled over 5 trials). The 50 highest and 50 lowest performers among healthy volunteers (n = 100) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 100) were selected. Novel measures of recall and transition probability were calculated and analyzed by permutation tests. Recall patterns and strategies of patients resembled those of controls with similar performance levels: Regardless of diagnosis, low performers were more likely to recall the first 2 and last 4 items from the list; high performers increased engagement of semantically based transitions across the 5 trials, whereas low performers did not. Cognitive strategy must be considered independent of overall performance before attributing poor performance to degraded learning processes. Our results demonstrate the importance of departing from global scoring techniques, especially when working with clinical populations such as patients with schizophrenia for whom episodic memory deficits are a hallmark feature. ","1010":"The relationship between aging and practice effects on longitudinal neuropsychological assessments was investigated in middle-aged and older people with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Older people with schizophrenia (n = 107; M age = 56.1) and age-comparable nonpsychiatric controls (n = 107; M age = 57.7) were scheduled to receive annual assessments on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests for an average of 2.5 years (range 11 months to 4 years). Mixed-model analyses were used to separately examine the effects of practice and age on test performance. Number of prior assessments (practice) was associated with significant performance improvement across assessments, whereas older age was associated with significant decline in performance. The groups did not differ significantly in extent of age-related cognitive decline, but a three-way interaction among group, age, and practice was found, such that greater age-related decline in practice effects were found for older people with schizophrenia relative to nonpsychiatric participants. This study did not find any evidence of neurodegenerative age-related decline in neuropsychological abilities in middle-aged and older people with schizophrenia, but older age was associated with diminished ability to benefit from repeated exposure to cognitive tasks in people with schizophrenia. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia may combine with cognitive decline associated with normal aging to reduce practice effects in older patients. These findings have important implications for the design of studies examining the longitudinal trajectory of cognitive functioning across the life span of people with schizophrenia, as well as clinical trials that attempt to demonstrate cognitive enhancement in these individuals. ","1011":"Recent research has revealed that schizophrenia patients are impaired in remembering the past and imagining the future. In this study, we examined patients' ability to engage in scene construction (i.e., the process of mentally generating and maintaining a complex and coherent scene), which is a key part of retrieving past experiences and episodic future thinking. 24 participants with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls were asked to imagine new fictitious experiences and described their mental representations of the scenes in as much detail as possible. Descriptions were scored according to various dimensions (e.g., sensory details, spatial reference), and participants also provided ratings of their subjective experience when imagining the scenes (e.g., their sense of presence, the perceived similarity of imagined events to past experiences). Imagined scenes contained less phenomenological details (d = 1.11) and were more fragmented (d = 2.81) in schizophrenia patients compared to controls. Furthermore, positive symptoms were positively correlated to the sense of presence (r = .43) and the perceived similarity of imagined events to past episodes (r = .47), whereas negative symptoms were negatively related to the overall richness of the imagined scenes (r = -.43). The results suggest that schizophrenic patients' impairments in remembering the past and imagining the future are, at least in part, due to deficits in the process of scene construction. The relationships between the characteristics of imagined scenes and positive and negative symptoms could be related to reality monitoring deficits and difficulties in strategic retrieval processes, respectively. ","1012":"The retrieval deficit hypothesis states that the lack of deficit in recognition often observed in patients with Parkinson's disease is because of the low retrieval requirements of the task, given that these patients have retrieval and not encoding deficits. To test this hypothesis we investigated recognition memory by familiarity in Parkinson's patients and in patients with Lewy Bodies disease and Parkinson with dementia. We analyzed to what extent the experimental groups were able to recognize by familiarity in a typical yes\/no recognition memory task. The experimental groups were patients with early nondemented Parkinson's disease, advanced nondemented Parkinson's disease, demented Parkinson's patients, and patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies. We compared their performance with a group of young and another group of old healthy participants. The estimation of familiarity was made by analyzing recognition of word targets and distractors consisting of combinations of different letters in comparison with a condition in which targets and distractors were composed of similar letters, even though subjects were unaware of the independent variable. The results indicate that familiarity was used at the same level by controls, patients with early Parkinson's disease and patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies. Although late Parkinson patients also used familiarity, its effect was only marginally significant. Patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia were not capable of using familiarity in recognition memory. Our results support the retrieval deficit hypothesis as Parkinson's patients without dementia show no deficit in a situation in which the retrieval requirements are minimal. ","1013":"Recent research has documented increased psychosocial difficulties in individuals who report higher-than-typical autistic traits but without an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Less is known, however, regarding the cognitive profile of individuals with subthreshold autism symptomatology. The objective of the present study was to provide additional insight into this issue and examine whether young adults who report higher degrees of autism traits also report experiencing increased difficulties with executive control. The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function was utilized to evaluate behavioral aspects of executive functioning in 66 and 28 individuals who endorsed high and low subthreshold levels of autism symptomatology, respectively. After accounting for Attention Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptomatology at both the group and individual participant levels, we found that autism traits continued to explain a significant amount of variance in participants' overall level of executive function (Global Executive Composite) as well as within most individual executive domains. Interestingly, the high and low trait groups did not differ on the inhibitory control and organization of materials scales, areas of functioning that appears to be largely spared in individuals with ASD as well. Findings from the present study are consistent with past research linking ASD and executive control impairment. In addition, ASD and ADHD traits were associated with unique contributions to the executive control profile of individuals with subthreshold autism symptomatology. This finding underscores the importance of accounting for ADHD symptomatology in studying ASD. ","1014":"To compare the distribution of error types across subgroups of primary progressive aphasia and poststroke aphasia in different vascular locations. We analyzed naming errors in 49 individuals with acute left hemisphere ischemic stroke and 55 individuals with three variants of primary progressive aphasia. Location of atrophy or ischemic stroke was characterized using MRI. We found that distribution of error types was very similar across all subgroups, irrespective of the site or etiology of the lesion. The only significant difference across groups was the percentage of circumlocutions (F(7, 96) = 3.02, p = .005). Circumlocution errors were highest among logopenic variant PPA (24%) and semantic variant PPA (24%). Semantic coordinate errors were common in all groups, probably because they can arise from disruption of different cognitive processes underlying naming and, therefore, from different locations of brain damage. Semantic errors are common among all types of primary progressive aphasia and poststroke aphasia, and the type of error depends in part on the location of damage. ","1015":"This study explored the influence of depression and fatigue on subjective cognitive complaints and objective neuropsychological impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Data for this study were taken from a randomized controlled trial, comparing 16 weeks of telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy and telephone-administered supportive emotion focused therapy for the treatment of depression. The sample includes 127 patients with MS. The following self-report measures were collected pre- and posttreatment: Perceived Deficits Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale. Measures of objective cognitive functioning and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were administered over the telephone. Our results showed that changes in depression and fatigue significantly predicted changes in subjective cognitive complaints from pre- to posttreatment, with patients perceiving fewer cognitive problems at posttreatment (beta = .36, p &lt; .001 and beta = .61, p &lt; .001, respectively). Changes in depression and fatigue were not significantly related to changes in objective neuropsychological performance. Improvements in depression and fatigue also predicted improved accuracy in perceiving cognitive abilities from pre- to posttreatment (OR = .77, p &lt; .001 and OR = .90, p &lt; .001, respectively). The results of this study suggest that improvements in depression and fatigue through treatment do not influence objective neuropsychological performance in MS patients, but do relate to changes in subjective impairment. Furthermore, these changes improve patients' abilities to accurately perceive their cognitive functioning. ","1016":"Longitudinal comparisons of neurocognitive functioning often reveal stability or age-related increases in performance among adults under about 60 years of age. Because nearly monotonic declines with increasing age are typically evident in cross-sectional comparisons, there is a discrepancy in the inferred age trends based on the two types of comparisons. The current research investigated the role of practice effects in longitudinal comparisons on the discrepancy. Longitudinal data over an average interval of 2.5 years were available on five abilities (i.e., reasoning, spatial visualization, episodic memory, perceptual speed, vocabulary) in a sample of 1,616 adults ranging from 18 to over 80 years of age. Practice effects were estimated from comparisons of the performance of people of the same age tested for either the first or second time, after adjusting for the possibility of selective attrition. Increased age was associated with significantly more negative longitudinal changes with each ability. All of the estimated practice effects were positive, but they varied in magnitude across neurocognitive abilities and as a function of age. After adjusting for practice effects the longitudinal changes were less positive at younger ages and slightly less negative at older ages. It was concluded that some, but not all, of the discrepancy between cross-sectional and longitudinal age trends in neurocognitive functioning is attributable to practice effects positively biasing the longitudinal trends. These results suggest that the neurobiological substrates of neurocognitive functioning may change across different periods in adulthood. ","1017":"The general goal of this study was to advance our understanding of Type 2 diabetes (T2D)-cognition relationships in older adults by linking and testing comprehensive sets of potential moderators, potential mediators, and multiple cognitive outcomes. We identified in the literature 13 health-related (but T2D-distal) potential covariates, representing four informal domains (i.e., biological vitality, personal affect, subjective health, lifestyle activities). Cross-sectional data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (age range = 53-90 years; n = 41 T2D and n = 458 control participants) were used. We first examined whether any of the 13 potential covariates influenced T2D-cognition associations, as measured by a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (15 measures). Next, using standard regression-based moderator and mediator analyses, we systematically tested whether the identified covariates would significantly alter observed T2D-cognition relationships. Six potential covariates were found to be sensitive to T2D associations with performance on seven cognitive measures. Three factors (systolic blood pressure, gait-balance composite, subjective health) were significant mediators. Each mediated multiple cognitive outcomes, especially measures of neurocognitive speed, executive functioning, and episodic memory. Our findings offer a relatively comprehensive perspective of T2D-related cognitive deficits, comorbidities, and modulating influences. The implications for future research reach across several fields of study and application. These include (1) neuropsychological research on neural and biological bases of T2D-related cognitive decline, (2) clinical research on intervention and treatment strategies, and (3) larger-scale longitudinal studies examining the potential multilateral and dynamic relationships among T2D status, related comorbidities, and cognitive outcomes. ","1018":"In Stroop-like tasks, the detection of conflict triggers adjustments of cognitive control to reduce conflict in subsequent trials. The present study tested the hypothesis of an impaired modulation of conflict monitoring in Parkinson's disease (PD). 18 PD patients and 18 healthy control (HC) participants performed a Stroop-like task in 2 conditions differing in terms of incongruent\/congruent stimuli ratio. HC participants demonstrated a sustained modulation of interference effect, the interference effect being decreased when the proportion of incongruent stimuli was high. A trial-by-trial analysis also showed that in the HC group, processing an incongruent stimulus reduced interference in the subsequent trial. Unlike controls, PD patients did not demonstrate any transient or sustained reduction of the interference effect. Within the framework of recent models, these results can be interpreted as an impairment of a proactive mode of cognitive control in patients with PD. ","1019":"Past research has investigated age differences in frontal-based decision making, but few studies have focused on the behavioral effects of striatal-based changes in healthy aging. Feedback learning has been found to vary with dopamine levels; increases in dopamine facilitate learning from positive feedback, whereas decreases facilitate learning from negative feedback. Given previous evidence of striatal dopamine depletion in healthy aging, we investigated behavioral differences between college-aged and healthy older adults using a feedback learning task that is sensitive to both frontal and striatal processes. Seventeen college-aged (M = 18.9 years) and 24 healthy, older adults (M = 70.3 years) completed the Probabilistic Selection task, in which participants are trained on probabilistic stimulus-outcome information and then tested to determine whether they learned more from positive or negative feedback. As a group, the older adults learned equally well from positive and negative feedback, whereas the college-aged group learned more from positive than negative feedback, F(1, 39) = 4.10, p &lt; .05, r(effect) = .3. However, these group differences were not due to older individuals being more balanced learners. Most individuals of both ages were balanced learners, but while all of the remaining young learners had a positive bias, the remaining older learners were split between those with positive and negative learning biases (chi(2)(2) = 6.12, p &lt; .047). These behavioral results are consistent with the dopamine theory of striatal aging, and suggest there might be adult age differences in the kinds of information people use when faced with a current choice. ","1020":null,"1021":"The authors investigated the utility of both traditional and everyday cognitive measures in predicting medication adherence and employment status among kidney transplant recipients. In addition, the role of noncognitive predictors was examined. Cognitive measures of processing speed, memory, everyday problem solving, executive functioning, and questionnaires assessing mood, medication adherence, and employment status were individually administered to 108 kidney transplant recipients. Because the eligibility criteria differed for the two analyses, there were 103 participants in the medication adherence analyses and 94 participants in the employment analyses. Stepwise hierarchical regression and sequential binomial logistic regression analyses were conducted for continuous and dichotomous outcome measures, respectively. Findings indicate that both poorer performance on the everyday problem-solving test and a higher number of depressive symptoms were predictive of poorer self-reported medication adherence (R(2) = .19, p &lt; .01). Furthermore, being on antidepressant medication, having a higher number of depressive symptoms, and poorer performance on traditional neuropsychological measures were predictive of fewer hours worked (Nagelkerke's R(2) = .29, ps &lt;.05). This study highlights the differential associations between neurocognitive and psychosocial status, and medication adherence and employment status following kidney transplantation. The findings suggest that the relative importance of traditional and everyday measures is dependent upon the outcome examined. ","1022":"To estimate the incidence of olfactory dysfunction across traumatic brain injury (TBI) severity and decision-making deficits with regard to intracranial lesions' location and laterality. A 1-year prospective study including 115 participants (16-55 years) with mild, moderate, and severe TBI. The Brief Smell Identification Test was used 3 months postinjury with a follow-up testing of olfactory dysfunction at 1 year. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and 3 tasks of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System were administered 3-months postinjury. MRI was performed 1-year postinjury and TBI severity groups were then divided with respect to frontal, fronto-temporal, diffuse, and no lesions. The incidence of olfactory dysfunction was estimated to be 22.3% at 3 months and 13.5% at 1 year. No significant differences were found on olfactory dysfunction across TBI severity at either check. Anosmia was identified in 10% with severe TBI and 3% with mild TBI. Olfactory dysfunction was associated with verbal fluency tasks. Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed no significant effect over blocks on IGT, and no main group or interaction effects regarding TBI severity, lesions' location, or laterality. IGT performance at 3-months postinjury was deficient in 83% of persons with intracranial lesions and 71% of those without lesions. Olfactory dysfunction is independent of TBI severity, showing improvements in one third of cases from 3- to 12-months postinjury. However, anosmia was related to TBI severity. There is evidence for marked decision-making deficits after TBI, all subgroups performed similarly and failed to develop an advantageous strategy over time. ","1023":"No research has examined whether individuals recovering from a recent mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) are safe to drive, despite cognitive impairment being a common consequence soon after MTBI. This study examined the acute effect of MTBI on drivers' hazard perception, which is defined as drivers' ability to search the road ahead to rapidly identify potentially dangerous traffic situations. Poorer hazard perception has been associated with higher crash rates in a number of studies. Forty-two patients with MTBI and 43 patients with minor orthopedic injuries were recruited from the emergency department of a large metropolitan hospital within 24 hours of injury. Participants completed a computerized hazard perception test, in which they watched videos of genuine traffic scenes filmed from the driver's point of view. They were required to use the computer mouse to click on potential traffic hazards as early as possible. Participants with MTBI were significantly slower to respond to traffic hazards than participants with minor orthopedic injuries (p = .03, d = .48). This study provides the first indication that within the acute stage postinjury, MTBI is associated with impairment in a crash-related component of driving. This suggests that patients with MTBI should be advised to refrain from driving for at least the first 24 hours' postinjury. ","1024":"We assessed the representation of numerosity in corticobasal syndrome (CBS), a neurodegenerative condition affecting the parietal lobe. Patients judged whether a target numerosity (e.g., \"3\") falls between two bounding numerosities (e.g., \"1\" and \"5\"). We manipulated the format for representing numerosity (Arabic numerals or dot arrays), the size of the gap between the two bounding numerosities, the absolute magnitude of the numerosities, and the order for presenting the bounding numerosities. In a subset of patients with available imaging, we related performance to cortical atrophy using voxel-based morphometry. CBS patients were significantly impaired overall (65.7% +\/- 16.2 correct) compared to healthy seniors (96.6% +\/- 2.4 correct), and required three times longer than controls to judge correct stimuli. This deficit was equally evident for Arabic numeral and dot array formats. Controls were significantly slower with smaller gaps than larger gaps, consistent with the greater challenge distinguishing between numerosities that are more similar to each other than very different numerosities. However, CBS patients were equally slow and inaccurate for all gap sizes. Controls also were significantly slower with larger numerosities than smaller numerosities, but CBS patients were equally slow and inaccurate with all numerosity magnitudes. Voxel-based morphometry revealed significant cortical atrophy in parietal and frontal regions in CBS compared to controls, including the intraparietal sulcus. These observations are consistent with the claim that the representation of numerosity is degraded in CBS. ","1025":"There is mounting evidence that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays an important role in episodic memory. We previously found that patients with PPC damage exhibit retrieval-related episodic memory deficits. Here we assess whether parietal lobe damage affects episodic memory on a different task: the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) false-memory paradigm. Two patients with bilateral PPC damage and a group of matched controls were tested. In Experiment 1, the task was to remember words; in Experiment 2 the task was to remember pictures of common objects. Prior studies have shown that normal participants have high levels of false memory to words, low levels to pictures. The patients exhibited significantly lower levels of false memory to words. One patient showed significantly elevated levels of false memory to pictures. The patients' false memories were accompanied by reduced levels of recollection, as tested by a Remember\/Know procedure. PPC damage causes decreased levels of false memories and an abnormal Remember\/Know profile. Their false memory rate is similar to the rate exhibited by patients with medial temporal lobe damage. These results support the view that portions of the PPC play a critical role in objective and subjective aspects of recollection. ","1026":"This study aimed to resolve discrepant findings in the literature regarding the effects of massed repetition and a single long study presentation on memory in amnesia. Experiment 1 assessed recognition memory in 9 amnesic patients and 18 controls following presentation of a study list that contained items shown for a single short study presentation, a single long study presentation, and three massed repetitions. In Experiment 2, the same encoding conditions were presented in a blocked rather than intermixed format to all participants from Experiment 1. In Experiment 1, control participants showed benefits associated with both types of extended exposure, and massed repetition was more beneficial than long study presentation, F(2, 34) = 14.03, p &lt; .001, partial eta(2) = .45. In contrast, amnesic participants failed to show benefits of either type of extended exposure, F &lt; 1. In Experiment 2, both groups benefited from repetition, but did so in different ways, F(2, 50) = 4.80, p = .012, partial eta(2) = .16. Amnesic patients showed significant and equivalent benefit associated with both types of extended exposure, F(2, 16) = 5.58, p = .015, partial eta(2) = .41, but control participants again benefited more from massed repetition than from long study presentation, F(2, 34) = 23.74, p &lt; .001, partial eta(2) = .58. The findings suggest that previous inconsistencies in the literature were due to procedural differences across studies.

","1027":"To relate lateralized impairments of visual perception in Parkinson's disease to asymmetries in the severity of motor symptoms. Ten patients with worse left-sided motor symptoms (LPD), 15 with worse right-sided (RPD), and 13 healthy age-matched controls (all right-handed) viewed mirror-imaged pairs of emotional chimeric faces, (left side smiling, right neutral, and vice versa), of greyscales (strips whose luminance varied smoothly from black on the left to white on the right, and vice versa) and of gender chimeric faces (left side male, right female, and vice versa). Participants signaled which stimulus appeared happier, brighter, or more feminine, respectively, so showing which side received more attention. For emotional chimeras, controls and LPD showed little bias, whereas RPD showed a strong bias to left hemispace (p = .018, r = .45). Across all patients, this bias was associated with severity of right-sided motor impairment (p = .018, r = .49). The bias was much weaker and insignificant for greyscales (p = .72, r = .14). For gender chimeras, RPD again showed a significantly greater left hemispace bias than did LPD (p = .037, r = .47), although neither patient group differed significantly from controls. Across all patients, this bias correlated with ratio of right-to-left symptom severity (p = .044, r = .48). The left hemispace bias in RPD is greater for facial than for luminance judgments, and is amplified for emotional judgments. Asymmetrical degeneration of the striatum, particularly involving the left side, appears to underlie this deficit in visual processing. ","1028":"This study compares self-paced timing performance (cross-sectionally and longitudinally) between participants with prodromal Huntington's disease (pr-HD) and a comparison group of gene non-expanded participants from affected families (NC). Participants (747 pr-HD: 188 NC) listened to tones presented at 550-ms intervals, matched that pace by tapping response keys and continued the rhythm (self-paced) after the tone had stopped. Standardized cross-sectional and longitudinal linear models examined the relationships between self-paced timing precision and estimated proximity to diagnosis, and other demographic factors. Pr-HD participants showed significantly less timing precision than NC. Comparison of pr-HD and NC participants showed a significant performance difference on two task administration conditions (dominant hand: p &lt; .0001; alternating thumbs: p &lt; .0001). Additionally, estimated proximity to diagnosis was related to timing precision in both conditions, (dominant hand: t = -11.14, df = 920, p &lt; .0001; alternating thumbs: t = -11.32, df = 918, p &lt; .0001). Longitudinal modeling showed that pr-HD participants worsen more quickly at the task than the NC group, and rate of decline increases with estimated proximity to diagnosis in both conditions (dominant hand: t = -2.85, df = 417, p = .0045; alternating thumbs: t = -3.56, df = 445, p = .0004). Effect sizes based on adjusted mean annual change ranged from -0.34 to 0.25 in the longitudinal model. The self-paced timing paradigm has potential for use as a screening tool and outcome measure in pr-HD clinical trials to gauge therapeutically mediated improvement or maintenance of function.

Ninety-eight participants diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were reevaluated approximately 10 years later. Eighty-five never-ADHD controls similar in age, IQ, sociodemographic background, and gender distribution served as a comparison group. Participants were administered a psychiatric interview and the Stimulus and Response Conflict Tasks (Nassauer &amp; Halperin, 2003). Participants with childhood ADHD demonstrated slower and less accurate responses to both control and conflict conditions relative to the comparison group, as well as more variable responses in both conditions of the motor inhibition task; there was no specific effect of childhood ADHD on perceptual or motor inhibition. ADHD persisters and partial remitters did not differ in overall accuracy, speed or variability in responding, but relative to partial remitters, persisters demonstrated greater slowing in response to perceptual conflict. These findings are consistent with theories positing state regulation, but not inhibitory control deficits in the etiology of ADHD, and suggest that improved perceptual inhibition may be associated with better outcome for ADHD. ","1030":"The main aim of the study was to examine blood oxygen level-dependent response during task switching in adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Fifteen male adults with ADHD and 14 controls participated and performed a task-switching paradigm. Behaviorally, no specific executive control problems were observed in the ADHD participants, although they did display more errors in general. The neuroimaging data did show remarkable differences between the ADHD and control adults: Adults with ADHD engaged more strongly the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, lingual gyrus, precentral gyrus, and insula than did the healthy controls during task switching. Controls displayed more task-related activity in the putamen, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, and postcentral gyrus. ADHD adults did not display specific executive control problems at a behavioral level, but did engage different brain areas during task switching compared with healthy controls. The results are discussed in the framework of the executive frontostriatal circuitry, conflict detection, and attentional networks. ","1031":"The purpose of this study was to examine whether neuropsychological tests translated into Spanish measure the same cognitive constructs as the original English versions. Older adult participants (N = 2,664), who did not exhibit dementia from the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), a community-based cohort from northern Manhattan, were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The study cohort includes both English (n = 1,800) and Spanish speakers (n = 864) evaluated in their language of preference. Invariance analyses were conducted across language groups on a structural equation model comprising four neuropsychological factors (memory, language, visual-spatial ability, and processing speed). The results of the analyses indicated that the four-factor model exhibited partial measurement invariance, demonstrated by invariant factor structure and factor loadings but nonequivalent observed score intercepts. The finding of invariant factor structure and factor loadings provides empirical evidence to support the implicit assumption that scores on neuropsychological tests are measuring equivalent psychological traits across these two language groups. At the structural level, the model exhibited invariant factor variances and covariances. ","1032":"This study aimed to investigate the effects of high altitude on reaction time (RT) mean and intra-individual variability. Ten students (6 men, 4 women) took a 4-choice RT test and had their vital signs and Lake Louise (LL) score measured on 21 occasions during the Edinburgh Altitude Research Expedition of 2008 to the Western Himalayas (max. altitude 5,565 m). Linear mixed modeling revealed that mean RT was significantly impaired at altitudes above 4,000 m (p &lt; .001), but relatively unaffected below that threshold. An estimated increase in RT between 4,000 and 5,000 m was 15.5 ms, 95% CI [11.1, 19.9]. LL score was related to slower RTs (B = 1.97, 95% CI [0.70, 3.23], p &lt; .01), while number of errors was associated with faster RTs (B = -1.50, 95% CI [-2.60, -0.39], p &lt; .01). There were persistent practice effects in mean RT (B = -2.16, 95% CI [-2.49, -1.83], p &lt; .001. Log-transformed intra-individual variability in RT increased with higher LL scores (B = 0.01801, 95% CI [0.0049, 0.0311], p &lt; .01) and decreased with rising temperature (B = -0.00754, 95% CI [-0.0119, -0.0032], p &lt; .001). However, after controlling for mean RT, these effects were no longer significant. RTs become significantly impaired above a threshold of 4,000 m. Altitude-related changes in RT intra-individual variability were accounted for by mean RT. ","1033":"The aims were (1) to explore the effects of normal aging on the main aspects of episodic memory--what, where, and when,--and on feature binding in a virtual environment; (2) to explore the influence of the mode of learning, intentional versus incidental; and (3) to benchmark virtual environment findings collected with older adults against data recorded in classical neuropsychological tests. We tested a population of 82 young adults and 78 older adults without dementia (they participated in a short battery of neuropsychological tests). All the participants drove a car in an urban virtual environment composing of 9 turns and specific areas. Half of the participants were told to drive through the virtual town; the other half were asked to drive and to memorize the environment (itinerary, elements, etc.). All aspects of episodic memory were then assessed (what, where, when, and binding). The older participants had less recollection of the spatiotemporal context of events than the younger with intentional encoding (p &lt; .001), but similar recollection with incidental encoding (except for verbal spatial aspect). The younger participants showed better binding than older ones regardless of the type of encoding (p &lt; .001). For the older participants the virtual test was sensitive to mnesic complaints as well as general cognitive changes (p &lt; .05 to p &lt; .01). We view these results as an indication that virtual environments could provide helpful standard tools for assessing age effects on the main aspects of episodic memory. ","1034":"Enhanced understanding of cognitive deficits, and the neurobiological abnormalities that mediate them, can be achieved through translational research that employs comparable experimental approaches across species. This study employed a multiple-systems framework derived from the rodent literature to investigate visual-spatial memory abilities associated with schizophrenia. Using the bin task, a human analog of rodent maze tasks, everyday objects were hidden in visually identical bins. Following a 1-min filled delay, participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (n = 30) and healthy community controls (n = 30) were asked to identify both the object hidden and bin used on the basis of its spatial location. Three dimensions of visual-spatial memory were contrasted: (a) memory for spatial locations versus memory for objects, (b) allocentric (viewpoint independent) versus egocentric (body-centered) spatial representations, and (c) event (working) memory versus reference memory. Most pronounced was a differential deficit in memory for spatial locations under allocentric (p = .005, d = -0.77) but not egocentric viewing conditions (p = .298, d = -0.28) in the schizophrenia group relative to healthy controls. Similarly, schizophrenia-related spatial memory deficits were pronounced under demands for event memory (p = .004, d = -0.77) but not reference memory (p = .171, d = -0.33). These results support a heuristic of preferential deficits in hippocampal-mediated forms of memory in schizophrenia. Moreover, the task provides a useful paradigm for translational research and the pattern of deficits suggests that persons with schizophrenia may benefit from mnemonic approaches favoring egocentric representations and consistency when interacting with our visual-spatial world. ","1035":"Anterograde amnesia is characterized by a profound inability to retain new information. Recent research suggests that at least some of this severe memory impairment may be the product of retroactive interference. What exactly interferes with memory in amnesic patients, however, remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine whether or not postlearning material which is highly dissimilar from the material to be remembered would interfere with amnesic patients' memory. Prose retention was tested in 10 densely amnesic patients and 10 controls following a 10 minute delay period, which was either unfilled (minimal interference) or filled with a tone detection task in which participants were required to listen for piano notes (nonspecific interference). A significant nonspecific retroactive interference effect was observed in the amnesic patients (p &lt; 0.004): Whereas 7 out of the 10 amnesic patients were able to recall some prose material following the unfilled delay period, only 1 of them was able to recall any material after the tone detection delay. The data reveal that some amnesic patients have the capacity to retain new material for much longer than usual but that apparently any new postlearning information profoundly interferes with such retention. This nonspecific retroactive interference effect deviates from the item-specific interference effect that is typically assessed in clinical practice and which is frequently observed in patients with executive impairment. We hypothesize that these interference effects are qualitatively different, occurring during distinct memory processes, namely retrieval (item-specific interference) and consolidation (nonspecific interference). ","1036":"This study sought to determine whether the family environment moderates psychosocial outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children. Participants were recruited prospectively from consecutive hospital admissions of 3- to 6-year-old children, and included 19 with severe TBI, 56 with complicated mild\/moderate TBI, and 99 with orthopedic injuries (OI). They completed 4 assessments across the first 18 months postinjury. The initial assessment included measures of parenting style, family functioning, and the quality of the home. Children's behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social competence were assessed at each occasion. Mixed model analyses examined the relationship of the family environment to psychosocial outcomes across time. The OI and TBI groups differed significantly in social competence, but the family environment did not moderate the group difference, which was of medium magnitude. In contrast, group differences in behavioral adjustment became more pronounced across time at high levels of authoritarian and permissive parenting; among children with severe TBI, however, even those with low levels of permissive parenting showed increases in behavioral problems. For adaptive functioning, better home environments provided some protection following TBI, but not over time for the severe TBI group. These 3-way interactions of group, family environment, and time postinjury were all of medium magnitude. The findings indicate that the family environment moderates the psychosocial outcomes of TBI in young children, but the moderating influence may wane with time among children with severe TBI. ","1037":"To examine the association of age and time postinjury with cognitive outcome 5-22 years following traumatic brain injury (TBI), in relation to matched uninjured controls. One hundred twelve participants with mild to very severe TBI, aged 16-81 years at the time of injury, were cognitively assessed on measures of processing speed and attention, verbal and visual memory, executive function, and working memory. Results were compared with those of 112 healthy controls individually matched for current age, gender, education, and estimated IQ. Older injured individuals performed worse than did younger injured individuals across all cognitive domains, after controlling for the performance of controls. In relation to matched controls, long-time survivors performed disproportionately worse than did more recently injured individuals, irrespective of age. After maximum spontaneous recovery from TBI, poorer cognitive functioning appears to be associated with both older age at the time of injury and increased time postinjury. These findings have implications for prognosis, early treatment recommendations, and long-term issues of differential diagnosis and management planning. ","1038":"The present study aimed to investigate prospective memory (PM) in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Twenty individuals with MCI (10 with an amnestic profile and 10 with a dysexecutive profile of cognitive impairment) and 20 control subjects (CS) were recruited. In the PM tasks, subjects had to execute three actions after 20 min had elapsed (time-based condition) or after a timer rang (event-based condition). Separate scores were computed for correct recall of the intention to perform the actions (prospective component) and for correct execution of the actions (retrospective component). Although individuals with MCI were less accurate than CS in both prospective (Cohen's d ranged from 1.04 to 2.23) and retrospective (Cohen's d ranged from 0.81 to 1.06) components of the experimental task, they were significantly more impaired in the former than the latter component (Cohen's d = 0.42). Moreover, the deficit in the prospective component of the time-based task was particularly evident in MCI participants presenting with a dysexecutive impairment in respect to amnestic MCI individuals (Cohen's d = 0.99). Results of the present study show that the ability of subjects with MCI to comply effectively with a planned delayed intention is impaired and suggest that dysexecutive disorders are likely responsible for this deficit. ","1039":"To investigate whether, in patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), recognition deficits are mainly due to a selective impairment of recollection rather than familiarity. Nineteen patients with a-MCI and 23 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent two experimental investigations, using the Process Dissociation Procedure (PDP) and the Remember\/Know (R\/K) procedure, to assess the differential contribution of recollection and familiarity to their recognition performance. Both experimental procedures revealed a selective preservation of familiarity in a-MCI patients. Moreover, the R\/K procedure showed a statistically significant impairment of recollection in a-MCI patients for words that were either read or anagrammed during the study phase. A-MCI is known to be commonly associated with a high risk of conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several previous studies have demonstrated a characteristic impairment of episodic memory in a-MCI, with an early dysfunction of recognition. Our findings are consistent with the knowledge of neurodegeneration occurring in AD, which is characterized, at the earliest disease stages, by a selective involvement of the entorhinal cortex. Moreover, the current study supports the dual process model of recognition, which hypothesizes recollection and familiarity to be independent processes associated with distinct anatomical substrates. ","1040":"The characteristics of response time (RT) distributions beyond measures of central tendency were explored in 3 attention tasks across groups of young adults, healthy older adults, and individuals with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Participants were administered computerized Stroop, Simon, and switching tasks, along with psychometric tasks that tap various cognitive abilities and a standard personality inventory (NEO-FFI). Ex-Gaussian (and Vincentile) analyses were used to capture the characteristics of the RT distributions for each participant across the 3 tasks, which afforded 3 components: mu and sigma (mean and standard deviation of the modal portion of the distribution) and tau (the positive tail of the distribution). The results indicated that across all 3 attention tasks, healthy aging produced large changes in the central tendency mu parameter of the distribution along with some change in sigma and tau (mean etap(2) = .17, .08, and .04, respectively). In contrast, early stage DAT primarily produced an increase in the tau component (mean etap(2) = .06). tau was also correlated with the psychometric measures of episodic\/semantic memory, working memory, and processing speed, and with the personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness. Structural equation modeling indicated a unique relation between a latent tau construct (-.90), as opposed to sigma (-.09) and mu constructs (.24), with working memory measures. The results suggest a critical role of attentional control systems in discriminating healthy aging from early stage DAT and the utility of RT distribution analyses to better specify the nature of such change. ","1041":"Impairment in odor-naming ability and in verbal and visual semantic networks raised the hypothesis of a breakdown in the semantic network for odors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study addressed this hypothesis. Twenty-four individuals, half patients with probable AD and half control participants, performed triadic-similarity judgments for odors and colors, separately, which, utilizing the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique of individual difference scaling analysis (INDSCAL), generated two-dimensional configurations of similarity. The abilities to match odors and colors with written name labels were assessed to investigate disease-related differences in ability to identify and conceptualize the stimuli. In addition, responses on attribute-sorting tasks, requiring the odor and color perceptions to be categorized as one polarity of a certain dimension, were obtained to allow for objective interpretation of the MDS spatial maps. Whereas comparison subjects generated spatial maps based predominantly on relatively abstract characteristics, patients with AD classified odors on perceptual characteristics. The maps for patients with AD also showed disorganized groupings and loose associations between odors. Their normal configurations for colors imply that the patients were able to comprehend the task per se. The data for label matching and for attribute sorting provide further evidence for a disturbance in semantic odor memory in AD. The patients performed poorer than controls on both these odor tasks, implying that the ability to identify and\/or conceptualize odors is impaired in AD. The results provide clear evidence for deterioration of the structure of semantic knowledge for odors in AD. ","1042":"To further understanding of text comprehension abilities in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a think-aloud protocol was used to examine the role of inferencing and the memory operations used to produce inferences. Twenty participants with AD and 20 cognitively healthy older adults (OA) read narratives, pausing to talk aloud after each sentence. A verbal protocol analysis developed by Trabasso and Magliano (1996a) was used to code participants' utterances into inferential and noninferential clause types; inferential statements were then coded to identify the memory operation used in their generation. Compared with OA controls, the AD participants showed poorer story comprehension, d = 2.0, produced fewer inferences, d = .67, and were less skilled at providing explanations of story events, d = 1.27, and in using prior text information to explain outcomes, d = .90. The AD group also appeared to rely more on the activation of world knowledge, d = .58, which contributed to less effective inferences and produced more incoherent noninferential statements, d = 1.05. Poorer text comprehension for the AD group was associated with poorer verbal memory abilities, r's &gt; .55, and poorer use of prior text events when producing explanatory inferences, r = .42. The findings suggest that the memory difficulties of the AD group appear to be an important cognitive factor interfering with their ability to integrate story events through the use of inferences and to create a global coherence to support text comprehension. ","1043":"Significant declines in longitudinal comparisons of neurocognitive performance are seldom evident until adults are in their 60s or older, but relatively little is known about the existence, or nature, of age-related changes at earlier periods in adulthood. The current research was designed to address this issue by examining characteristics of change in measures from 12 neuropsychological and cognitive tests at different periods in adulthood. Although change was largely positive for adults under about 55 years of age and frequently negative for adults at older ages, the reliabilities of the changes in the neuropsychological and cognitive variables were similar at all ages. Furthermore, there were few systematic relations of age on the reliability-adjusted correlations between the changes in composite scores representing different abilities. These results imply that although neurocognitive declines may not be apparent at young ages because of positive retest effects or other factors, at least in some respects longitudinal changes may have nearly the same meaning across all of adulthood.","1044":"The testing effect is a robust cognitive phenomenon by which memory retrieval on a test improves subsequent recall more than restudying. Also known as retrieval practice, the testing effect has been studied almost exclusively in healthy undergraduates. The current study investigated whether retrieval practice during testing leads to better delayed recall than restudy among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurologic disease associated with memory dysfunction. In a within-subjects design, 32 persons with MS and 16 demographically matched healthy controls (HC) studied 48 verbal paired associates (VPA) divided across 3 learning conditions: massed restudy (MR), spaced restudy (SR), and spaced testing (ST). Delayed VPA cued recall was measured after 45 min. There was a large main effect of learning condition (etap2 = .54, p &lt; .001) such that both MS and HC participants produced better delayed recall for VPAs learned through ST relative to MR and SR; and SR relative to MR. This same pattern was observed for MS participants with objective memory impairment (n = 16), thereby providing the first evidence that retrieval practice improves memory more than restudy among persons with neurologically based memory impairment.","1045":"Burgmans, van Boxtel, Vuurman, et al. (2009) published an interesting study titled \"The Prevalence of Cortical Gray Matter Atrophy May Be Overestimated in the Healthy Aging Brain\" on how subclinical cognitive disorders may affect correlations between age and cortical volume. Correlations between cortical gray matter volume and age were found in 30 elderly with cognitive decline after 6 years, but not in 28 elderly without cognitive decline. This study is important, and demonstrates that preclinical cognitive disorders may affect cortical brain volumes before being detectable by neuropsychological tests. However, we are not convinced by the conclusions: \"... gray matter atrophy... is to a lesser extent associated with the healthy aging process, but more likely with brain processes underlying significant cognitive decline\" (p. 547) and \"... cortical gray matter atrophy in the aging brain may be overestimated in a large number of studies on healthy aging\" (p. 547). We analyzed the cross-sectional MR data (n = 1,037) as well as longitudinal data from a sample of very well-screened elderly followed by cognitive testing for 2 years. In the cross-sectional data, the correlations between age and brain volumes were generally not much reduced when the upper age limit was lowered. This would not be expected if age-related incipient cognitive disorders caused the correlations given that the incidence of cognitive decline increased with age. Longitudinally, 1-year atrophy was identified in all tested regions. It is likely that cortical brain atrophy is manifested in cognitively normal elderly without subclinical cognitive disorders.","1046":"The extant longitudinal literature consistently supports the notion of age-related declines in human brain volume. In a report on a longitudinal cognitive follow-up with cross-sectional brain measurements, Burgmans and colleagues (2009) claim that the extant studies overestimate brain volume declines, presumably due to inclusion of participants with preclinical cognitive pathology. Moreover, the authors of the article assert that such declines are absent among optimally healthy adults who maintain cognitive stability for several years. In this comment accompanied by reanalysis of previously published data, we argue that these claims are incorrect on logical, methodological, and empirical grounds.","1047":"Working memory deficits have been identified in bipolar disorder, but there is evidence suggesting that these deficits may be markers for psychosis rather than affective disorder. The current study examined this issue by comparing two groups of individuals with bipolar disorder, one with psychotic features and one without psychotic features, with a group of normal controls. Working memory was conceptualized as a multicomponent system that includes auditory and visuospatial short-term stores, executive control processes, and an episodic buffer that allows for communication between short- and long-term memory stores (Baddeley &amp; Logie, 1999). Results indicated that only executive control processes significantly differentiated the psychotic and nonpsychotic bipolar groups, although visuospatial working memory differentiated both bipolar groups from controls. The results support the idea that some aspects of working memory performance are markers for psychosis, while others may be more general markers for bipolar disorders.","1048":"Attentional control has been conceptualized as executive functioning by neuropsychologists and as working memory capacity by experimental psychologists. We examined the relationship between these constructs using a factor analytic approach in an adult life span sample. Several tests of working memory capacity and executive function were administered to more than 200 subjects between 18 and 90 years of age, along with tests of processing speed and episodic memory. The correlation between working memory capacity and executive functioning constructs was very strong (r = .97), but correlations between these constructs and processing speed were considerably weaker (rs approximately .79). Controlling for working memory capacity and executive function eliminated age effects on episodic memory, and working memory capacity and executive function accounted for variance in episodic memory beyond that accounted for by processing speed. We conclude that tests of working memory capacity and executive function share a common underlying executive attention component that is strongly predictive of higher level cognition.","1049":"Forty-nine carefully diagnosed adults with persistent attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who had never been medicated for their ADHD, were compared with 49 normal control adults matched for age and gender on a large battery of tests in five domains of executive functioning (inhibition, fluency, planning, working memory, and set shifting) and several other neuropsychological functions to control for nonexecutive test demands. After stringent controls for nonexecutive function demands and IQ, adults with ADHD showed problems in inhibition and set shifting but not in any of the other executive functioning domains tested. We argue that adult ADHD may be mainly a disorder of inhibition.","1050":"Although hypertension is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and is highly prevalent in African Americans, little is known about how blood pressure (BP) affects brain-behavior relationships in this population. In predominantly Caucasian populations, high BP is associated with alterations in frontal-subcortical white matter and in executive functioning aspects of cognition. We investigated associations among BP, brain structure, and neuropsychological functioning in 52 middle-older-age African Americans without diagnosed history of CVD. All participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging for examination of white matter integrity, indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA). Three regions of interest were derived in the anterior (genu) and posterior (splenium) corpus callosum and across the whole brain. A brief neuropsychological battery was administered from which composite scores of executive function and memory were derived. Blood pressure was characterized by mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). When controlling for age, higher MABP was associated with lower FA in the genu, and there was a trend for this same relationship with regard to whole-brain FA. When the sample was broken into groups on the basis of treatment for BP regulation (medicated vs. nonmedicated), MABP was related to genu and whole-brain FA only in the nonmedicated group. Neither MABP nor FA was significantly related to either neuropsychological composite score regardless of medication use. These data provide important evidence that variation in BP may contribute to significant alterations in specific neural regions of white matter in nonmedicated individuals without symptoms of overt CVD.","1051":"The current study investigated one possible mechanism of impaired visual attention among patients with schizophrenia: a reduced visual span. Visual span is the region of the visual field from which one can extract information during a single eye fixation. This study hypothesized that schizophrenia-related visual search impairment is mediated, in part, by a smaller visual span. To test this hypothesis, 23 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls completed a visual search task where the target was pseudorandomly presented at different distances from the center of the display. Response times were analyzed as a function of search condition (feature vs. conjunctive), display size, and target eccentricity. Consistent with previous reports, patient search times were more adversely affected as the number of search items increased in the conjunctive search condition. It was important however, that patients' conjunctive search times were also impacted to a greater degree by target eccentricity. Moreover, a significant impairment in patients' visual search performance was only evident when targets were more eccentric and their performance was more similar to healthy controls when the target was located closer to the center of the search display. These results support the hypothesis that a narrower visual span may underlie impaired visual search performance among patients with schizophrenia.","1052":"Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown deficits in the ability to recognize emotion. However, these results have been inconsistent. In addition, questions remain about whether any deficit in PD is secondary to depression and broader cognitive impairments, and the effects of stimulus modality, task type, and specific emotion remain unclear. A meta-analysis of 34 comparisons, using data from 1,295 individual participants, was conducted to (a) provide a reliable estimate of the magnitude of the purported deficit in emotion recognition and (b) examine the influence of several potential moderators of emotion recognition abilities in PD. Results show a robust link between PD and specific deficits in recognizing emotion, from both the face and the voice (overall effect size g = 0.52). The deficit extends across stimulus modalities and task types and is particularly acute with respect to negative emotions. Although this deficit does not appear to be secondary to comorbid depression or visuospatial impairments, the potential role of working memory constraints warrants further investigation. We highlight the potential implications of these findings for communication abilities in PD.","1053":"Postconcussion symptoms are relatively common in the acute recovery period following mild traumatic brain injury. However, for a small subset of patients, self reported postconcussion symptoms continue long after injury. Many factors have been proposed to account for the presence of persistent postconcussion symptoms. The influence of personality traits has been proposed as one explanation. The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between postconcussion-like symptom reporting and personality traits in a sample of 96 healthy participants. Participants completed the British Columbia Postconcussion Symptom Inventory and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III). There was a strong positive relation between the majority of MCMI-III scales and postconcussion-like symptom reporting. Approximately half of the sample met the International Classification of Diseases-10 Criterion C symptoms for Postconcussional Syndrome. Compared with those participants who did not meet this criterion, the PCS group had significant elevations on the negativistic, depression, major depression, dysthymia, anxiety, dependent, sadistic, somatic, and borderline scales of the MCMI-III. These findings support the hypothesis that personality traits can play a contributing role in self reported postconcussion symptoms.","1054":"This exploratory study was conducted to increase understanding of neuropsychological test performance in those with blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The two variables of interest for their impact on test performance were presence of mTBI symptoms and history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Forty-five soldiers postblast mTBI, 27 with enduring mTBI symptoms and 18 without, completed a series of neuropsychological tests. Seventeen of the 45 met criteria for PTSD. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (Frencham, Fox, &amp; Mayberry, 2005; Spreen &amp; Strauss, 1998) was the primary outcome measure. Two-sided, 2-sample t tests were used to compare scores between groups of interest. Presence of mTBI symptoms did not impact test performance. In addition, no significant differences between soldiers with and without PTSD were identified. Standard neuropsychological assessment may not increase understanding about impairment associated with mTBI symptoms. Further research in this area is indicated.","1055":"To investigate postconcussive symptoms (PCS) following pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), 8- to 15-year-old children with mTBI (n = 186) and a comparison group with uncomplicated orthopedic injuries (OI, n = 99) were recruited from two emergency departments. Parent and child ratings of PCS and symptom counts were obtained within 3 weeks after injury (baseline) and at 1, 3, and 12 months postinjury. The mTBI group also completed magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. Group differences were examined using growth modeling, controlling for age at injury, sex, socioeconomic status, and (for parent-based measures) preinjury symptom levels. Relative to the OI group, the mTBI group had higher ratings of somatic PCS and parent counts of PCS at the initial assessments, but higher parent ratings of cognitive PCS and child counts of PCS throughout follow-up. Higher levels of PCS in the mTBI group were associated with motor-vehicle-related trauma, loss of consciousness, neuroimaging abnormalities, and hospitalization. The findings validate both transient and persistent PCS in children with mTBI and document associations of symptoms with injury and noninjury factors.","1056":"Deficits in self awareness and taking the perspective of others are often observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Nine adolescents (ages 12-19 years) who had sustained moderate to severe TBI after an average interval of 2.6 years and nine typically developing (TD) adolescents underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while performing a perspective taking task (D'Argembeau et al., 2007). Participants made trait attributions either from their own perspective or from that of the significant other. The groups did not differ in reaction time or on a consistency criterion. When thinking of the self from a third-person perspective, adolescents with TBI demonstrated greater activation in posterior brain regions implicated in social cognition, the left lingual gyrus (BA 18) and posterior cingulate (BA 31), extending into neighboring regions not generally associated with social cognition, that is, cuneus (BA 31) and parahippocampal gyrus, relative to TD adolescents. We postulate that adolescents with moderate to severe TBI recruited alternative neural pathways during perspective-taking because traumatic axonal injury disrupted their fronto-parietal networks mediating social cognition.","1057":"Positive schizotypal traits have been associated with right hemisphere activation. Previous research has indicated that the left and right hemispheres differ in their processing of semantic ambiguity; specifically, given sufficient time, the left hemisphere primes dominant meanings and inhibits subordinate meanings, and the right hemisphere primes both dominant and subordinate meanings. The authors examined whether individuals who differed in positive schizotypy demonstrated different patterns of priming on a semantic ambiguity task, reflective of differences in hemispheric activation. Individuals low in schizotypy demonstrated the expected pattern of priming the dominant meaning while inhibiting the subordinate meaning. Individuals high in schizotypy demonstrated similar priming of the dominant meaning but no inhibition of the subordinate meaning. The role of this failure of inhibition in the generation of schizotypal thought is discussed.","1058":"The authors examined the relationship between neuropsychological performance and MRI of the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the cingulum bundle (CB) within groups of patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects. The authors analyzed data from subjects, who had participated in prior MRI, DTI, and neuropsychological studies (Nakamura et al., 2008; Nestor et al., 2008). In comparison to healthy subjects, patients showed the expected reductions across CB fractional anisotropy (white matter) and OFC gray matter volume as well as lower neuropsychological scores. In addition, in comparison to healthy subjects, patients showed a very different pattern of functional-anatomical correlates. For patients, CB white matter but not OFC gray matter correlated with various aspects of intelligence, including general abilities and working memory. For controls, OFC gray matter but not CB white matter correlated with scores on tests of intelligence and decision making. These results point to the potentially important role of CB white matter in the neuropsychological disturbance in schizophrenia.","1059":"Understanding the trajectory of cognitive changes in the development of schizophrenia may shed light on the neurodevelopmental processes in the beginning stage of illness. Subjects at risk for psychosis (AR, n = 48), patients in their first episode of schizophrenia (FE, n = 20), and normal comparison subjects (n = 29) were assessed on a neurocognitive battery at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up. There were significant group differences across all cognitive domains as well as a significant group by time interaction in the verbal learning domain. After statistically controlling for practice effects and regression to the mean, a high proportion of FE subjects showed an improvement in verbal learning, and a significant number of AR subjects improved in general intelligence. Moreover, a higher than expected percentage of FE subjects, as well as AR subjects who later converted to psychosis, showed a deterioration in working memory and processing speed. These inconsistent trajectories suggest that some domains may improve with stabilization in the early stages of psychosis, whereas others may decline with progression of the illness, indicating possible targets for cognitive remediation strategies and candidate vulnerability markers for future psychosis.","1060":"Investigations of memory impairment in schizophrenia have frequently revealed a strategic processing deficit at encoding. The authors studied an early encoding process, refreshing (in this case, thinking of a stimulus that has just-previously been presented), and its impact on recognition memory in schizophrenia. Following simultaneous presentation of three words or a single word in the top, middle, or bottom position of the screen, 25 patients with schizophrenia and 25 control participants saw and read a new word (read condition), or a word presented on the previous screen (repeat condition), or saw a dot indicating that they should think of and say the last word to have appeared in that position (refresh condition). Later, on a surprise test, participants were asked to recognize words seen previously and give a Remember, Know, or Guess response according to whether they recognized each on the basis of conscious recollection, familiarity, or guessing. The cognitive operation of refreshing was impaired in schizophrenia: patients were slower on 1-word trials and less accurate on 3-word trials to refresh a word, and their Remember responses did not benefit from refreshing.","1061":"Follow-up studies of preterm children without serious neonatal medical complications have consistently found poor visuomotor and visuospatial skills. In the first round of current follow-up study, we found a deficit in elementary visuomotor processes in preterm children without Cerebral Palsy (CP). To determine whether the development of these processes was delayed or different, we carried out a quasi-longitudinal study in which kinematic characteristics of pointing movements in 7- to 11-year-old preterm born children without CP and in an age-matched full-term group were analyzed. Multi-level analysis suggested a difference rather than a delay in the preterm born group: we found a regression around 8 years of age in the control but not in the preterm group. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide longitudinal data confirming this regression in the development of movement control in typically developing children. Our results are also consistent in suggesting that elementary visuomotor processes are less efficient in preterm born children without CP: their movements were either slower or less accurate. While these differences were subtle, they persisted until 11 years of age.","1062":"Previous work has consistently reported a facilitatory influence of positive emotion in face recognition (e.g., D'Argembeau, Van der Linden, Comblain, &amp; Etienne, 2003). However, these reports asked participants to make recognition judgments in response to faces, and it is unknown whether emotional valence may influence other stages of processing, such as at the level of semantics. Furthermore, other evidence suggests that negative rather than positive emotion facilitates higher level judgments when processing nonfacial stimuli (e.g., Mickley &amp; Kensinger, 2008), and it is possible that negative emotion also influences latter stages of face processing. The present study addressed this issue, examining the influence of emotional valence while participants made semantic judgments in response to a set of famous faces. Eye movements were monitored while participants performed this task, and analyses revealed a reduction in information extraction for the faces of liked and disliked celebrities compared with those of emotionally neutral celebrities. Thus, in contrast to work using familiarity judgments, both positive and negative emotion facilitated processing in this semantic-based task. This pattern of findings is discussed in relation to current models of face processing.","1063":"Cognitive fatigue is a common, often debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although MS patients frequently report that fatigue negatively affects cognitive functioning, most studies have found little evidence for a direct relationship between self-reported cognitive fatigue and traditional measures of neuropsychological functioning. The purpose of the present study was to examine the association between self-reported cognitive fatigue and a measure of response time variability (RTV). MS patients demonstrated significantly higher RTV than controls, and RTV was highly correlated with self-reported cognitive fatigue among relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS patients. Results highlight the need to implement newer methods to further elucidate the relationship between cognitive fatigue and neuropsychological functioning in MS.","1064":"The influence of hormone treatment on brain and cognition in postmenopausal women has been a controversial topic. Contradictory patterns of results have prompted speculation that a critical period, or limited window of opportunity, exists for hormone treatment to protect against neurocognitive. In this cross-sectional study of 102 postmenopausal women, we examined whether hippocampal, amygdala, or caudate nucleus volumes and spatial memory performance were related to the interval between menopause and the initiation of hormone treatment. Consistent with a critical period hypothesis, we found that shorter intervals between menopause and the initiation of hormone treatment were associated with larger hippocampal volumes compared with longer intervals between menopause and treatment initiation. Initiation of hormone treatment at the time of menopause was also associated with larger hippocampal volumes when compared with peers who had never used hormone treatment. Furthermore, these effects were independent from potentially confounding factors such as age, years of education, the duration of hormone treatment, current or past use of hormone therapy, the type of therapy, and age at menopause. Larger hippocampal volumes in women who initiated hormone treatment at the time of menopause failed to translate to improved spatial memory performance. There was no relationship between timing of hormone initiation, spatial memory performance, and amygdala or caudate nucleus volume. Our results provide support for a limited window of opportunity for hormone treatment to influence hippocampal volume, yet the degree to which these effects translate to improved memory performance is uncertain.","1065":"This study explored the ability to control familiarity-based information in a memory exclusion paradigm in healthy young, older adults, and early stage DAT individuals. We compared the predictive power of memory exclusion performance to standard psychometric performance in discriminating between aging and the earliest stage of DAT and between APOe4-present and APOe4-absent genotype in healthy control individuals. Participants responded \"yes\" to words that were previously semantically encoded, and \"no\" to words that were previously read aloud and to new words. The number of targets and distractors on the read \"distractor\" list was manipulated to investigate the degree to which aging and DAT influence the ability to recollect in the face of distractor familiarity due to repetition. Memory exclusion performance was better for healthy older adults than very mild DAT individuals and better for healthy control individuals with APOe4 allele than those without APOe4 allele even after controlling for standard psychometric performance. Discussion focuses on the importance of attentional control systems in memory retrieval and the utility of the opposition paradigm for discriminating healthy versus pathological aging.","1066":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), the visual variant of Alzheimer's disease, are neurodegenerative diseases that present with progressive deterioration in visual perception. However, little is known about the precise nature underlying the complex visual deficits associated with both conditions. The present study compared DLB, PCA, and healthy control participants, in four visual tasks designed to measure the efficiency of the visual system at different levels of processing. In ascending order of complexity there were tasks of visual acuity, line orientation, contour integration, and rotated object comparison. DLB patients did not differ from controls in low level visual functions of visual acuity and line orientation, suggesting that early visual processing areas including V1 were relatively preserved, consistent with pathology evidence (Yamamoto et al., 2006). However, higher level visual functions of contour integration, mediated by extrastriatal areas, and the most complex task of object rotation, relying on processing within inferior temporal (IT), parietal, and frontal cortices, were impaired in DLB. In contrast, PCA patients were impaired in all tasks, consistent with evidence of widespread pathology within occipital and parietal areas in PCA. The latter suggests that both lower and higher level visual impairments contribute to the complex visual symptoms associated with PCA.","1067":"The effects of major depressive disorder (MDD) on neurocognitive function remain poorly understood. Results from published studies vary widely in terms of methodological factors, and very little is known about the effects of depression severity and other clinical characteristics on neurocognitive function. The purpose of this review was to synthesize prior research findings regarding neurocognitive functioning in patients with MDD and varying levels of depression severity and to provide recommendations for future directions. Overall, this review suggests that MDD has been inconsistently associated with neurocognitive functioning and there is limited understanding regarding the relationship between depression severity and neurocognitive sequelae. There was much heterogeneity on depression severity-related factors across studies assessing neurocognitive function in MDD, as well as substantial variability in the consideration of depression severity among studies, which suggests a need to further explore this important issue.","1068":"Bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) can produce emotional disorders that have been linked to disturbance of the STN's limbic territory. The aim of this study was to confirm the impairment of the recognition of facial emotions (RFE) induced by STN DBS, not only ruling out the effect of the disease's natural progression in relation to the effect of DBS, but also assessing the influence of modifications in dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) following STN DBS. RFE was investigated in 24 PD patients who underwent STN DBS and 20 PD patients treated with apomorphine. They were assessed 3 months before and after treatment. The 2 patient groups were compared with a group of 30 healthy matched controls. The results showed that RFE for negative emotions (fear and sadness) was impaired in only the STN DBS group in the posttreatment condition and was unrelated to DRT. Results confirm the selective reduction of RFE induced by STN DBS, due neither to the disease's natural progression nor to modifications in DRT.","1069":"According to the \"sensory-motor model of semantic knowledge,\" different categories of knowledge differ for the weight that different \"sources of knowledge\" have in their representation. Our study aimed to evaluate this model, checking if subjective evaluations given by normal subjects confirm the different weight that various sources of knowledge have in the representation of different biological and artifact categories and of unique entities, such as famous people or monuments. Results showed that the visual properties are considered as the main source of knowledge for all the living and nonliving categories (as well as for unique entities), but that the clustering of these \"sources of knowledge\" is different for biological and artifacts categories. Visual data are, indeed, mainly associated with other perceptual (auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactual) attributes in the mental representation of living beings and unique entities, whereas they are associated with action-related properties and tactile information in the case of artifacts.","1070":"The extent to which verbal (VM) and visuospatial memory (VSM) tests measure the same or multiple constructs is unclear. Likewise the relationship between VM and VSM across development is not known. These questions are addressed using genetically informative data, studying two age cohorts (young adults and children) of twins and siblings. VM and VSM were measured in the working memory and short-term memory domain. Multivariate genetic analyses revealed that two highly correlated common genetic factors, one for VM and one for VSM, gave the best description of the covariance structure among the measures. Only in children, specific genetic factors were also present. This led to the following conclusions: In children, one genetic factor is responsible for linking VM and VSM. Specific genetic factors create differences between these two domains. During the course of development, the influence of genetic factors unique to each of these domains disappears and the genetic factor develops into two highly correlated factors, which are specific to VM and VSM respectively. At the environmental level, in both age cohorts, environmental factors create differences between these domains.","1071":"The authors examined the structure and invariance of executive functions (EF) across (a) a continuum of cognitive status in 3 groups of older adults (cognitively elite [CE], cognitively normal [CN], and cognitively impaired [CI]) and (b) a 3-year longitudinal interval. Using latent variable analyses (LISREL 8.80), the authors tested 3-factor models (\"Inhibition\": Hayling [Burgess &amp; Shallice, 1997], Stroop [Regard, 1981]; \"Shifting\": Brixton [Burgess &amp; Shallice, 1997], Color Trails [D'Elia et al., 1996]; and \"Updating\": Reading and Computational Span [Salthouse &amp; Babcock, 1991]) and 1-factor models within each group. Participants (initial N = 570; 53-90 years) were from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (Sample 3, Waves 1 and 2). Cross-sectionally, the authors observed a 3-factor EF structure especially for the CE group and 1-factor solutions for all 3 groups. Longitudinally, temporal invariance was supported for the 3-factor model (CE and CN groups) and the 1-factor model (CI and CN groups). Subgroups with higher cognitive status and greater 3-year stability performed better on EF factors than corresponding groups with lower cognitive status and less stability. Studies of EF structure, performance, dedifferentiation, and dysfunction will benefit from considering initial cognitive status and longitudinal stability.","1072":"Diagnosis of different types of dementia is often based on clinical symptomatology rather than underlying pathology; therefore, accurate diagnosis depends on a thorough description of cognitive functioning in different dementias. Furthermore, direct comparison of cognitive functions between different types of dementia is necessary for differential diagnosis. Executive dysfunction is common in several types of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD); however, FTD and LBD patients have never been directly compared on measures of executive functioning. The authors compared the performance of 17 FTD and 15 LBD patients on 6 measures of executive functioning in terms of statistical group differences, mean severity of clinical impairment in comparison to normal controls, and frequency of impairment. Results indicated a remarkably similar pattern of performance across all areas examined in terms of mean performance, as well as degree and frequency of impairment. Only the Stroop test produced results that could potentially differentiate the patient groups. These findings suggest that both FTD and LBD should be considered disorders involving executive dysfunction.","1073":"A group of patients with Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy elderly controls were tested with a lexical-decision task that included words with dense or sparse orthographic and associative neighborhoods to investigate whether there is automatic orthographic and semantic activation of related representations in these populations similar to that found with younger samples. Although some studies support the idea of deteriorated connections in semantic networks in Alzheimer's disease, other studies propose that the automatic spread of activation at lexicosemantic levels remains intact and that intergroup differences are a consequence of impaired retrieval or attentional deficits. In this study, participants responded to words with dense orthographic and associative neighborhoods faster than they did to words with sparse neighborhoods, providing evidence in favor of a preserved automatic spread of activation through intact orthographic and semantic representations. Furthermore, no differences were found between the two groups regarding the magnitude of the effects, although control participants responded significantly faster than patients.","1074":"This study explored differences in intraindividual variability in 3 attention tasks across a large sample of healthy older adults and individuals with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Three groups of participants (healthy young adults, healthy older adults, very mild DAT) were administered 3 experimental measures of attentional selection and switching (Stroop, Simon, task switching). The results indicated that a measure of intraindividual variability, coefficient of variation (CoV; SD\/M), increased across age and early stage DAT. The CoV in Stroop discriminated the performance of epsilon4 carriers from noncarriers in healthy older controls and the CoV in task switching was correlated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers predictive of DAT.","1075":"This study investigated episodic memory and metamemory for verbs and nouns in patients who have cognitive impairments associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients and healthy control participants were asked to recall word pairs and provide feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgments for the items they were unable to recall. This was followed by a 4-alternative recognition test. PD patients were impaired in both recall and recognition, compared with controls. In terms of metamemory, PD patients were less confident in their ability to recognize the unrecalled items in a future recognition test. Most important, accuracy of PD patients' FOK judgments was not above chance and was lower than that of control participants. The PD group correctly recognized fewer verbs than nouns, but type of material (verb vs. noun) had no impact on recall or FOK judgments. In addition, contribution of executive functions to FOK accuracy was different in PD patients and controls.","1076":"Attention deficits are nearly ubiquitous after traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the subacute phase of moderate to severe TBI, these deficits may be difficult to measure with the precision needed to predict outcomes, assess degree of recovery, and monitor treatment response. This article reports the findings of four studies, three observational and one a randomized, controlled treatment trial of methylphenidate (MP), designed to provide construct validation of the Moss Attention Rating Scale (MARS), an observational measure of attention dysfunction following TBI. One hundred seven participants with moderate to severe TBI were enrolled during treatment on an inpatient rehabilitation unit. MARS scores were provided independently by four rehabilitation disciplines (Physical, Occupational and Speech Therapies and Nursing). Results indicated that the MARS: (1) is more strongly related to concurrent measures of cognitive versus physical disability, supporting its validity as a measure of cognition, (2) is more strongly related to concurrent psychometric measures of attention versus measures thought to rely less on attention, supporting its validity as a measure of attention; and (3) predicts 1-year outcomes of TBI better than psychometric measures of attention. However, the MARS (4) was not differentially affected by MP versus placebo treatment. Results support the construct validity and utility of the MARS, with further research needed to clarify its role in treatment outcome assessment.","1077":"In describing academic attainment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), results are typically reported at the group mean level. This may mask subgroups of individuals for whom academic achievement is incommensurate with intellectual ability. The authors tested the IQ, literacy, and mathematical abilities of a large group (N = 100) of adolescents (14-16 years old) with ASD. Seventy-three percent of the sample had at least one area of literacy or mathematical achievement that was highly discrepant (approximately 14 standard score points) from full-scale IQ (FSIQ). The authors focused on four subgroups with either word reading (\"Reading Peak\" and \"Reading Dip\") or arithmetic (\"Arithmetic Peak\" and \"Arithmetic Dip\") higher or lower than FSIQ. These subgroups were largely mutually exclusive and were characterized by distinct intellectual profiles. The largest was the \"Arithmetic Peak\" subgroup of participants, who presented with average intellectual ability alongside superior arithmetic skills and who were predominantly in a mainstream educational setting. Overall, the most pervasive profile was discrepantly poor reading comprehension, which associated with severity of social and communication difficulties. The high rate of uneven academic attainment in ASD has implications for educational practice.","1078":"To assess neurocognitive functioning in adult survivors of childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) malignancy, a large group of CNS malignancy survivors were compared to survivors of non-CNS malignancy and siblings without cancer on a self-report instrument (CCSS-NCQ) assessing four factors, Task Efficiency, Emotional Regulation, Organization and Memory. Additional multiple linear regressions were used to assess the contribution of demographic, illness, and treatment variables to reported neurocognitive functioning in CNS malignancy survivors and the relationship of reported neurocognitive functioning to socioeconomic indicators. Survivors of CNS malignancy reported significantly greater neurocognitive impairment on all CCSS-NCQ factors than non-CNS cancer survivors or siblings (p &lt; .01). Within the CNS malignancy group, medical complications (hearing deficits, paralysis and cerebrovascular incidents) resulted in a greater likelihood of reported deficits on all CCSS-NCQ factors. Total or partial brain irradiation and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement was associated with greater impairment on Task Efficiency and Memory. Female gender was associated with a greater likelihood of impaired scores on Task Efficiency and Emotional Regulation, while diagnosis before age 2 years resulted in less likelihood of reported impairment on the Memory factor. CNS malignancy survivors with more impaired CCSS-NCQ scores demonstrated significantly lower educational attainment (p &lt; .01), less household income (p &lt; .001), less full time employment (p &lt; .001), and fewer marriages (p &lt; .001). Survivors of childhood CNS malignancy were found to be at significant risk for neurocognitive impairment that continues to adulthood and is correlated with lower socioeconomic achievement.","1079":"The posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) consists of transient cerebellar mutism, cognitive symptoms, and neurobehavioral abnormalities that typically develop in children following posterior fossa (PF) tumor resection. The pathophysiological substrate of the syndrome remains unclear. We investigated eight children of whom five presented with a variety of clinically relevant non-motor language symptoms associated with cognitive and behavioral disturbances after PF tumor resection. Four children developed transient cerebellar mutism followed by dysarthric speech. Non-motor language symptoms consisted of agrammatism, anomia, impaired verbal fluency, comprehension deficits, and a spontaneous speech. Neurocognitive deficits included executive dysfunctions, concentration deficits, and visuo-spatial disorders. In addition, all children presented with behavioral and affective disturbances. Functional neuroimaging studies during the phase of mutism by means of SPECT showed perfusional deficits in the anatomo-clinically suspected supratentorial areas subserving language dynamics, syntax, naming, executive functioning, affective regulation, and behavior. A significant improvement of frontal perfusional deficits paralleled the clinical remission of mutism. These results add to the view that the PFS might represent a cerebello-cerebral diaschisis phenomenon, reflecting the metabolic impact of the cerebellar lesion on supratentorial cognitive and affective functions.","1080":"The authors used logistic regression, dichotomous and multiple level likelihood ratios, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to examine Wada Memory Asymmetries (WMAs) in 324 patients who subsequently underwent temporal lobe (TL) surgery (left TL surgery = 172; right TL surgery = 152) using the Medical College of Georgia Wada protocol. Logistic regression correctly classified 84% of left TL patients and 77% of right TL patients using WMA. Corresponding dichotomous likelihood ratios (LRs) were: LR+ = 3.64; LR- = 0.21. The area under the curve using ROC was similarly highly significant (.886, standard error = .018, p &lt; .001). When classifying patients using multiple level LRs, 40 left TL patients (23.3%) obtained asymmetry scores greater than +4, whereas no right TL patients obtained asymmetry scores in this range. No left TL patients obtained a WMA of -8 or less, although 12 right TL patients (7.9%) obtained a difference score of -8. Multiple level LRs indicate impressive diagnostic sensitivity for certain WMA ranges, greatly increasing the probability of undergoing either left or right TL surgery depending on WMA magnitude.","1081":"Numerous studies indicate deficient time estimation in individuals with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several hypotheses have been raised to explain this deficit including delay aversion, vulnerability to nontemporal distractions, deficient working memory, as well as pure deficit in temporal processing. To test the different hypotheses, adults with or without ADHD performed a prospective time-estimation task under different conditions: with or without nontemporal distraction; and with or without increased load of working memory. Such design was used to rule out the effect of motor control and to manipulate the hypothesized mechanisms of working memory and attention to nontemporal stimuli. The authors report that compared with the control group, adults with ADHD showed greater and more variable deviation in time estimation. In addition, the magnitude of time estimation was affected by allocation of attention to nontemporal stimuli and by load of working memory. The intraindividual variability of time estimation was only partially accounted for by load of working memory. These findings suggest that the ADHD-associated deficit in prospective time estimation is not attributable to special attention to nontemporal stimuli or compromised working memory.","1082":"The main objective of the present study was to determine whether event-related potentials (ERPs) predominant in prefrontal cortex (PFC) respond in a similar fashion to ERPs predominant in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in duration and size discrimination tasks. The results indicate that contingent negative variation (CNV) and P300 components changed according to task demands. In the time-related task, amplitudes and duration of both components increased as a function of stimulus duration and easier discriminability. This was not the case in the size discrimination task. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis of a functional link between PFC and PPC in timing behavior. The later-appearing LPCt component was observed in both tasks, but its amplitude increased only as a function of stimulus duration.","1083":"Traditional models of face processing posit independent pathways for the processing of facial identity and facial expression (e.g., Bruce &amp; Young, 1986). However, such models have been questioned by recent reports that suggest positive expressions may facilitate recognition (e.g., Baudouin et al., 2000), although little attention has been paid to the role of negative expressions. The current study used eye movement indicators to examine the influence of emotional expression (angry, happy, neutral) on the recognition of famous and novel faces. In line with previous research, the authors found some evidence that only happy expressions facilitate the processing of famous faces. However, the processing of novel faces was enhanced by the presence of an angry expression. Contrary to previous findings, this paper suggests that angry expressions also have an important role in the recognition process, and that the influence of emotional expression is modulated by face familiarity. The implications of this finding are discussed in relation to (1) current models of face processing, and (2) theories of oculomotor control in the viewing of facial stimuli.","1084":"Memory for context is known to rely on episodic binding and strategic retrieval processes. It is unclear, however, whether memory for different contextual features taps the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. Here, the authors compare memory for a perceptual feature (i.e., the format in which an item had been presented) and for a semantic feature (i.e., the concept with which an item had been paired) in 13 patients with lesions in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including patients with and without confabulation, and 13 healthy controls. Participants studied picture-word pairs and received an old-new recognition test that included intact pairs, rearranged pairs, format pairs (studied pairs in which the picture-word format of each item was switched), old-new pairs, and new-new pairs. Hit rates for intact pairs were similar for all participant groups. Compared with controls, patients, especially those with confabulation, had higher false-alarm rates for format pairs but comparable false-alarm rates for rearranged pairs. The authors propose that distinct monitoring processes are engaged during retrieval of perceptual and semantic context, with only the former crucially dependent on ventromedial prefrontal cortex.","1085":"Recent studies with the Deese\/Roediger-McDermott (Deese 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995) paradigm have revealed that amnesic patients do not only show impaired veridical memory, but also diminished false memory for semantically related lure words. Due to the typically used explicit retrieval instructions, however, this finding may reflect problems at encoding, at recollection, or both. Therefore, the present experiments examined implicit as well as explicit false memory in patients suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome and controls. In Experiment 1, encoding instructions either focused on remembering individual list words, or on discovering semantic relationships among the words. In Experiment 2, different presentation durations were used. Results emphasize the distinction between automatic and intentional retrieval: Korsakoff patients' veridical and false memory scores were diminished when explicit recollection was required, but not when memory was tested implicitly. Encoding manipulations only significantly affected veridical memory: Priming was reduced with thematic encoding, and explicit retrieval was facilitated when given more study time.","1086":"Some patients with amnesia are able to retain new information for much longer than expected when the time that follows new learning is devoid of further stimuli. Animal work shows that the absence or delaying of interference improves long-term memory consolidation. Our study suggests that this is also true for at least some patients with amnesia. Retention of new verbal material was significantly higher in a sample of patients with amnesia (N = 12) when interference occurred at the end of a 9-min delay interval than when it occurred in the middle or at the beginning of the interval. Such findings cannot be accounted for by the mere use of explicit short-term memory rehearsal. Any such rehearsal should have been blocked by the interference, irrespective of interference onset, thus leading to poor retention in all three conditions. The current findings suggest that at least some of the severe forgetting observed in amnesia is the product of a disruption of memory consolidation by immediate postlearning interference.","1087":"Although patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are known to exhibit a wide range of cognitive and personality difficulties, some evidence suggests that there may be a degree of selectivity in their reasoning impairments. Based on a recent review of the neuroimaging literature on reasoning, the authors hypothesized that the presence or absence of familiar content may have a selective impact on the reasoning abilities of patients with FTD. Specifically, the authors predicted that patients with frontal-variant FTD would be more impaired when reasoning about transitive arguments involving familiar spatial environments than when reasoning about identical logical arguments involving unfamiliar spatial environments. As predicted, patients with FTD were less accurate than normal controls only when the content of arguments involved familiar spatial environments. These results indicate a degree of selectivity in the cognitive deficits of this patient population and suggest that the frontal-temporal lobe system may play a necessary role in reasoning about familiar material.","1088":"Impairment in executive cognition (EC) is now recognized as relatively common among older persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and may be predictive of the development of dementia. However, both MCI and executive functioning are broad and heterogeneous constructs. The present study sought to determine whether impairments in specific domains of EC are associated with specific subtypes of MCI. MCI patients (n = 124) were divided into 4 subgroups (amnestic vs. nonamnestic, and single- vs. multiple-domain) on the basis of their performance of widely used neuropsychological screening tests. These patients and 68 normal older persons were administered 18 clinical and experimental tests of executive function. Principal components analysis suggested 2 highly reliable EC components, planning\/problem solving and working memory, and a less reliable 3rd component, judgment. Planning\/problem solving and working memory, but not judgment, were impaired among the MCI patients. This was true even among those with \"pure amnestic\" MCI, the least impaired group overall. Multiple-domain MCI patients had more severe impairments in planning\/problem solving and working memory than single-domain patients, leading to the supposition that they, not pure amnestic MCIs, are at highest risk of imminent dementia.","1089":"This study aimed to measure semantic inhibitory capacities in persons with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in healthy older and younger adults. This was done by relying on a computerized adaptation of the Hayling task, designed to diminish the likelihood of using alternative noninhibitory strategies. Participants with both AD and MCI showed impaired performance on the inhibition condition. Participants with AD showed both poorer score and an increased number of errors, whereas persons with MCI obtained lower score. There was also an effect of normal aging in the inhibition condition when considering reaction time only. In participants with MCI and AD, there was a significant correlation between lexico-semantic capacities and performance on the automatic condition. Follow-up analysis revealed that participants with MCI who experienced a subsequent significant cognitive decline had impaired performance in the inhibition condition at the time of the experiment, while participants with MCI who remained stable did not. Overall, results indicate that semantic inhibition of a prepotent response is impaired in participants with MCI and may have predictive value regarding future decline, supporting its prognostic role in the early identification of dementia.","1090":"Using a longitudinal design, the authors examined coping and cognitive functioning in the development of depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Coping style was evaluated in 2 conceptually distinct roles: as moderator and mediator of the impact of cognitive dysfunction on depression. Using indices derived from the COPE (C. S. Carver, M. F. Scheier, &amp; J. K. Weintraub, 1989), the authors operationalized coping in 3 ways-as active, avoidant, and an index accounting for relative levels of both. Coping both moderated and partially mediated the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and depression. Moderation results suggest that the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and depression is dependent on coping style-adaptive coping protects individuals from experiencing depression related to their cognitive deficits; however, when individuals use maladaptive coping, cognitive dysfunction puts them at risk for depression. Mediational results suggest that cognitive dysfunction leads to depression partially due to cognitive dysfunction's effects on coping. That is, cognitive deficits may impair individuals' ability to use adaptive coping strategies, leaving them more likely to use maladaptive strategies. Clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","1091":"Recent models assume that some symptoms of schizophrenia originate from defective reward processing mechanisms. Understanding the precise nature of reward-based learning impairments might thus make an important contribution to the understanding of schizophrenia and the development of treatment strategies. The present study investigated several features of probabilistic reward-based stimulus association learning, namely the acquisition of initial contingencies, reversal learning, generalization abilities, and the effects of reward magnitude. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia exhibited attenuated overall performance during acquisition, whereas learning rates across blocks were similar to the rates of controls. On the group level, persons with schizophrenia were, however, unable to learn the reversal of the initial reward contingencies. Exploratory analysis of only the subgroup of individuals with schizophrenia who showed significant learning during acquisition yielded deficits in reversal learning with low reward magnitudes only. There was further evidence of a mild generalization impairment of the persons with schizophrenia in an acquired equivalence task. In summary, although there was evidence of intact basic processing of reward magnitudes, individuals with schizophrenia were impaired at using this feedback for the adaptive guidance of behavior.","1092":"Children with autism often have difficulty performing skilled movements. Praxis performance requires basic motor skill, knowledge of representations of the movement (mediated by parietal regions), and transcoding of these representations into movement plans (mediated by premotor circuits). The goals of this study were (a) to determine whether dyspraxia in autism is associated with impaired representational (\"postural\") knowledge and (b) to examine the contributions of postural knowledge and basic motor skill to dyspraxia in autism. Thirty-seven children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 50 typically developing (TD) children, ages 8-13, completed (a) an examination of basic motor skills, (b) a postural knowledge test assessing praxis discrimination, and (c) a praxis examination. Children with ASD showed worse basic motor skill and postural knowledge than did controls. The ASD group continued to show significantly poorer praxis than did controls after accounting for age, IQ, basic motor skill, and postural knowledge. Dyspraxia in autism appears to be associated with impaired formation of spatial representations, as well as transcoding and execution. Distributed abnormality across parietal, premotor, and motor circuitry, as well as anomalous connectivity, may be implicated.","1093":"A meta-analysis of neuropsychological studies of patients with bipolar disorder comprised of 42 studies of 1,197 patients in euthymia, 13 studies consisting of 314 patients in a manic\/mixed phase of illness, and 5 studies of 96 patients in a depressed state. Cohen d values were calculated for each study as the mean difference between patient and control group score on each neuropsychological measure, expressed in pooled SD units. For euthymia, results revealed impairment across all neuropsychological domains, with d values in the moderate-to-large range (d = .5 - .8) for the vast majority of measures. There was evidence of large effect-size impairment on measures of verbal learning (d = .81), and delayed verbal and nonverbal memory (d = .80 - .92), while effect-size impairment on measures of visuospatial function was small-to-moderate (d &lt;or= .55). Patients tested during a manic\/mixed or depressed phase of illness showed exaggerated impairment on measures of verbal learning, whereas patients tested during a depressed phase showed greater decrement on measures of phonemic fluency. These results suggest that bipolar illness during euthymia is characterized by generalized moderate level of neuropsychological impairment with particular marked impairment in verbal learning and memory. These results also show that a subset of these deficits moderately worsen during acute disease states.","1094":"Prevailing opinion holds that normal brain aging is characterized by substantial atrophy of cortical gray matter. However, this conclusion is based on earlier studies whose findings may be influenced by the inclusion of subjects with subclinical cognitive disorders like preclinical dementia. The present magnetic resonance imaging study tested this hypothesis. Cognitively healthy subjects (mean age 72 years, range 52-82) who remained cognitively stable over a 3-year period were compared to subjects with significant cognitive decline. Subjects who developed dementia within 6 years after the scan session were excluded. The gray matter volumes of seven cortical regions were delineated on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants without cognitive decline did not exhibit an age effect on the gray matter volume. Conversely, participants with cognitive decline exhibited a significant age effect in all the seven areas. These results suggest that cortical gray matter atrophy may have been overestimated in studies on healthy aging, since most studies were unable to exclude participants with a substantial atypical cognitive decline or preclinical dementia. Our results underscore the importance of establishing stringent inclusion criteria for future studies on normal aging.","1095":"People suffering from developmental dyscalculia (DD) show an abnormal pattern of the size congruity effect. They do not display a facilitation component in a numerical Stroop task. In this task, participants are presented with 2 digits that differ both in physical size and numerical value, and they have to compare the digits while ignoring one of the dimensions. The present study examined performance of those with DD and control participants in the numerical Stroop task under cognitive load. The no-load condition replicated previous findings (i.e., lack of facilitation in the physical task for the DD group). Load had opposite effects on interference and facilitation. Load eliminated facilitation and increased interference in the control group. Load increased interference only in the physical task in the DD group. The opposite effect of load on facilitation and interference suggests that these components are related to different cognitive mechanisms. The fact that load produced a DD-like pattern in the control group could suggest that individuals with DD suffer from difficulty in recruiting attention in addition to the deficits in numerical processing.","1096":"Many symptom validity tests (SVTs) assess performance validity via declarative memory paradigms. One widely used SVT, the Word Memory Test (WMT), uses a variety of memory tests to assess performance. It is well known that declarative memory requires the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures. In the present study, WMT performance was examined in nonlitigating amnesic subjects (n = 3) with well-documented focal bilateral hippocampal atrophy who were nondemented and otherwise cognitively unimpaired compared with matched controls. The amnesic subjects had no external incentives. Amnesic subjects performed significantly below the level of matched comparison subjects but above established cutoff scores on the immediate recognition and delay recognition subtests and consistency component. In contrast, the amnesic subjects were impaired relative to our comparison subjects on the multiple-choice, paired associate, free-recall, and long delay free-recall subtests and had extremely low performance on these measures. Thus, there was a differential effect of hippocampal damage on WMT performance where the recognition subtests were performed within the normal range, yet the free recall was profoundly impaired in amnesic subjects. Such an approach where SVT performance is assessed in populations with well-known cognitive impairments adds breadth to SVT clinical interpretations.","1097":"Unilateral spatial neglect, a debilitating condition affecting awareness of one side of space, is commonly assessed using cancellation tasks in which patients cross out targets distributed over a sheet. Standard scores emphasize the left-right distribution of omissions. Here, the additional value of extracting temporal as well as spatial aspects of performance from video recordings was examined. Videos from 18 patients with left neglect and 19 healthy age-matched control participants were obtained. Interrater reliability of the video analysis was high. In addition to overall differences in target detection and bias, patients significantly differed from the control group in terms of the location of first cancellation, overall slowness, greater variability in speed, systematic slowing with time on task and as a function of target location, less coherent search organization, and a sharply increased tendency to recancel targets. Considering a subset of patients whose scores, by standard criteria, were at or near the normal range indicated that these additional variables indeed increased the sensitivity of the task as well as allowed the simultaneous assessment of spatial and nonspatial aspects of the disorder.","1098":"Evidence exists that fluctuating levels of sex hormones affect interhemispheric interaction in women during the menstrual cycle. The present study investigated whether interhemispheric interaction is susceptible to direct hormonal manipulations via hormone therapy (HT). Sixty-eight postmenopausal women who received HT either with estrogen alone (n = 15), an estrogen-gestagen combination (n = 22) or without HT (n = 31) were investigated. Participants were asked to match letters according to their physical or name identity. Matches were presented either within or across visual half-fields. Additionally, a simple reaction time task, assumed to estimate interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT), was used. Overall, postmenopausal women showed an across-field advantage in the more demanding name-identity task but not in the less demanding physical-identity task. However, across both tasks, the groups differed in responses to within- and across-field trials: the control group performed better on across- than within-field trials, whereas both HT groups showed faster responses on within- than across-field trials. IHTT did not differ between groups. The findings suggest that postmenopausal estrogen-therapy affects the relative efficiency of interhemispheric integration by modulating within-hemisphere functioning.","1099":"Relationships between self-reported retrospective falls and cognitive measures (executive function, reaction time [RT], processing speed, working memory, visual attention) were examined in a population based sample of older adults (n = 658). Two of the choice RT tests involved inhibiting responses to either targets of a specific color or location with hand and foot responses. Potentially confounding demographic variables, medical conditions, and postural sway were controlled for in logistic regression models, excluding participants with possible cognitive impairment. A factor analysis of cognitive measures extracted factors measuring RT, accuracy and inhibition, and visual search. Single fallers did not differ from nonfallers in terms of health, sway or cognitive function, except that they performed worse on accuracy and inhibition. In contrast, recurrent fallers performed worse than nonfallers on all measures. Results suggest that occasional falls in late life may be associated with subtle age-related changes in the prefrontal cortex leading to failures of executive control, whereas recurrent falling may result from more advanced brain ageing that is associated with generalized cognitive decline.","1100":"The vast majority of brain-injured patients with semantic impairment have better comprehension of concrete than abstract words. In contrast, several patients with semantic dementia (SD), who show circumscribed atrophy of the anterior temporal lobes bilaterally, have been reported to show reverse imageability effects, that is, relative preservation of abstract knowledge. Although these reports largely concern individual patients, some researchers have recently proposed that superior comprehension of abstract concepts is a characteristic feature of SD. This would imply that the anterior temporal lobes are particularly crucial for processing sensory aspects of semantic knowledge, which are associated with concrete not abstract concepts. However, functional neuroimaging studies of healthy participants do not unequivocally predict reverse imageability effects in SD because the temporal poles sometimes show greater activation for more abstract concepts. The authors examined a case-series of 11 SD patients on a synonym judgment test that orthogonally varied the frequency and imageability of the items. All patients had higher success rates for more imageable as well as more frequent words, suggesting that (1) the anterior temporal lobes underpin semantic knowledge for both concrete and abstract concepts, (2) more imageable items--perhaps because of their richer multimodal representations--are typically more robust in the face of global semantic degradation and (3) reverse imageability effects are not a characteristic feature of SD.","1101":"Our objectives were to assess age differences in perceptual repetition priming and perceptual skill learning and to determine whether they are mediated by cognitive resources and regional cerebral volume differences. Fragmented picture identification paradigm allows the study of both priming and learning within the same task. The authors presented this task to 169 adults (ages 18-80), assessed working memory and fluid intelligence, and measured brain volumes of regions that were deemed relevant to those cognitive skills. The data were analyzed within a hierarchical path modeling framework. In addition to finding age-related decrease in both perceptual priming and learning, the authors observed several dissociations with regards to their neural and cognitive mediators. Larger visual cortex volume was associated with greater repetition priming, but not perceptual skill learning, and neither process depended upon hippocampal volume. In contrast, the volumes of the prefrontal gray and white matter were differentially related to both processes via direct and indirect effects of cognitive resources. The results indicate that age-related differences in perceptual priming and skill learning have dissociable cognitive and neural correlates.","1102":"The extremes of birth weight and preterm birth are known to result in a host of adverse outcomes, yet studies to date largely have used cross-sectional designs and variable-centered methods to understand long-term sequelae. Growth mixture modeling (GMM) that utilizes an integrated person- and variable-centered approach was applied to identify latent classes of achievement from a cohort of school-age children born at varying birth weights. GMM analyses revealed 2 latent achievement classes for calculation, problem-solving, and decoding abilities. The classes differed substantively and persistently in proficiency and in growth trajectories. Birth weight was a robust predictor of class membership for the 2 mathematics achievement outcomes and a marginal predictor of class membership for decoding. Neither visuospatial-motor skills nor environmental risk at study entry added to class prediction for any of the achievement skills. Among children born preterm, neonatal medical variables predicted class membership uniquely beyond birth weight. More generally, GMM is useful in revealing coherence in the developmental patterns of academic achievement in children of varying weight at birth and is well suited to investigations of sources of heterogeneity.","1103":"The goal was to compare incidental and intentional spatial sequence learning in youth-onset psychosis and ADHD. The authors tested 8- to 19-year-olds with psychosis or ADHD and healthy controls on a serial reaction time (RT) task and used manual and oculomotor measures to examine learning. Participants were also administered a block in which they were explicitly instructed to learn a sequence. As in our previous studies with healthy adults and children, oculomotor anticipations and RTs showed learning effects similar to those in the manual modality. Results showed intact sequence-specific learning but fewer oculomotor anticipations in both clinical groups during incidental learning. In intentional learning, only the psychosis group showed impairments compared to controls. There were no interactions between age and diagnosis. Thus, the psychosis group showed relatively preserved incidental learning despite impairments in intentional learning. Additionally, both clinical groups showed impairments in the ability to search for, extract, and anticipate regularities (whether the regularities were there or not), but not in the ability to respond to these regularities when they were there.","1104":"Survivors of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at increased risk for emotional sequelae. The current study utilized the error-related negativity (ERN) and posterror positivity (Pe) components of the event-related potential (ERP) to test the hypothesis that negative affect disproportionately impairs performance-monitoring following severe TBI. High-density ERPs were acquired while 20 survivors of severe TBI and 20 demographically matched controls performed a single-trial Stroop task. Response-locked ERPs were separately averaged for correct and error trials. Negative affect was measured as the single latent factor of measures of depression and anxiety. Groups did not differ on overall level of negative affect. Control and TBI participants did not differ on error rates as a function of negative affect, but differed in response times. ERP results revealed disproportionately smaller ERN amplitudes in participants with TBI relative to controls as a function of negative affect. Pe amplitude did not differ between groups. Negative affect inversely correlated with ERN amplitude in TBI but not control participants. Overall, results support a \"double jeopardy\" hypothesis of disproportionate impairments in performance monitoring when negative affect is overlaid on severe TBI.","1105":"The aim of the present study was to investigate the contribution of impaired information processing speed and strategic control of attention to performance on attentional tasks after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Forty moderately to severely injured rehabilitation inpatients and 40 healthy controls completed a selection of attentional tasks. Slowed processing speed in the TBI group was identified on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), 2&amp;7 Selective Attention Test (2&amp;7), Selective Attention (SAT), and Four Choice Reaction Time (4CRT) tasks. Impaired working memory was evident on the Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) task. Structural equation modeling revealed that the group difference in RT on the complex SAT was accounted for by slowed speed of processing on the simple SAT, and not working memory. TBI participants made more errors and missed responses on the complex version of the SAT, suggesting impairment in some aspects of strategic control of attention, and appeared unable to benefit from the automatic condition of the 2&amp;7 Test. There was little evidence of deficit on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The present study provides evidence for a significant contribution of slowed processing speed to impaired performance on attentional tasks after TBI.","1106":"Differentiating between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) remains difficult but important if existing pharmacological treatments are to provide symptomatic relief in the case of AD or to alter disease progression in the case of VaD. Cognitive assessments play an important role in aiding diagnosis, despite a lack of clear evidence defining the cognitive abilities and tests that best distinguish between the two types of dementia. The current study therefore completed a meta-analysis of research comparing the cognitive abilities of persons diagnosed with AD and VaD. A comprehensive search was undertaken of the PubMed and PsychInfo databases, with 81 studies being eligible for inclusion. Weighted Cohen's d effect sizes, percentage overlap statistics, fail-safe Ns, and confidence intervals were calculated for all cognitive tests. Of the tests that were examined by more than one study, there was one test of perception and one test of verbal memory that showed large and significant group differences. There were an additional 12 tests that may prove useful. However, all cognitive tests were limited in their ability to discriminate between AD and VaD, suggesting that they should be used cautiously and only in conjunction with other information (imaging, medical history) when diagnosing patients.","1107":"In bilingual aphasics, the neural correlates of rehabilitation benefits and their generalization across languages are still scarcely understood. The authors present the case of a highly proficient bilingual woman (Flemish, L1\/Italian, L2) with chronic aphasia who, in the presence of the same pattern of impairment in both languages, showed parallel recovery in both languages after long-term rehabilitation therapy in L2. The authors postulated that this recovery was due to the engagement of the same neural substrates. To confirm this the authors used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to explore cortical activation during an overt picture naming task, performed in both Flemish and Italian once before and once after 2 weeks of training in L2. Behaviorally, the patient showed complete recovery of both languages. The fMRI results indicated that the same cerebral regions were recruited for both languages before and after training. Increasing activations were observed perilesionally and in homologous contralesional areas. Our data, in agreement with previous results of fMRI studies in healthy bilinguals, indicate a promising direction for future research on the neural mechanisms associated with recovery in bilingual aphasics.","1108":"The authors tested the hypothesis that activity inhibition (AI), a measure of the frequency of the word \"not\" in written material, marks a propensity to engage functions of the right hemisphere (RH) and disengage functions of the left hemisphere (LH), particularly during stress. Study 1 and Study 2 showed that high AI predicts faster detection of stimuli presented to the RH, relative to the LH. Study 2 provided evidence that the AI-laterality effect is specific to perceptual, but not motor, laterality and that it is particularly strong in individuals with low mood, but absent in individuals in a positive mood state. Study 3 showed that negative affective stimuli prime the AI-laterality effect more strongly than positive affective stimuli. Findings from Study 4 suggest that situationally induced frustration (losing a contest), in conjunction with high AI, leads to increased attentional laterality. The present findings substantially bolster the construct validity of AI and contribute to a better understanding of earlier findings linking AI to physiological stress responses, immune system functioning, alcohol abuse, and nonverbal behavior.","1109":"It is assumed that attention problems (AP) are related to impaired executive functioning. We investigated the association between AP and inhibitory control and tested to what extent the association was due to genetic factors shared with IQ. Data were available from 3 independent samples of 9-, 12-, and 18-year-old twins and their siblings (1,209 participants). AP were assessed with checklists completed by multiple informants. Inhibitory control was measured with the Stroop Color Word Task (Stroop, 1935), and IQ with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Wechsler et al., 2002) or Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1997). AP and inhibitory control were only correlated in the 12-year-old cohort (r = .18), but appeared non-significant after controlling for IQ. Significant correlations existed between AP and IQ in 9- and 12-year olds (r = -.26\/-.34). Inhibitory control and IQ were correlated in all cohorts (r = -.16, -.24 and -.35, respectively). Genetic factors that influenced IQ also influenced inhibitory control. We conclude that the association between AP and inhibitory control as reported in the literature may largely derive from genetic factors that are shared with IQ.","1110":"Children with attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) choose smaller sooner (SS) over larger later (LL) rewards more than controls. Here we assess the contributions of impulsive drive for immediate rewards (IDIR) and delay aversion (DAv) to this pattern. We also explore the characteristics of, and the degree of familiality in, ADHD SS responders. We had 360 ADHD probands; 349 siblings and 112 controls (aged between 6 to 17 years) chose between SS (1 point after 2 s) and LL reward (2 points after 30 s) outcomes on the Maudsley Index of Delay Aversion (Kuntsi, Oosterlaan, &amp; Stevenson, 2001): Under one condition SS choice led to less overall trial delay under another it did not. ADHD participants chose SS more than controls under both conditions. This effect was larger when SS choice reduced trial delay. ADHD SS responders were younger, had lower IQ, more conduct disorder and had siblings who were more likely to be SS responders themselves. The results support a dual component model in which both IDIR and DAv contribute to SS choice in ADHD. SS choice may be a marker of an ADHD motivational subtype.","1111":"Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder linked with frontostriatal dysfunction. Previous work has shown some evidence of mild performance deficits on a range of different tasks that involve inhibitory processes. The present study evaluated this in adult participants with uncomplicated TS. Interference control was measured using the Stroop and flanker tasks and a Stroop-flanker task that combined the inhibitory demands of both. Motor inhibition was measured using a letter continuous performance test (CPT) task and word CPT tasks that manipulated the inhibitory demands using compatible and incompatible words. The TS group was found to be slower than the control group on most measures, but showed differential slowing under conditions with enhanced inhibitory demands on the combined Stroop-flanker and the incompatible CPT tasks. The findings suggest that TS-alone is linked to mild impairments in aspects of inhibitory function, and that these can be detected by relatively powerful inhibitory manipulations. A range of different types of inhibitory tasks may be sensitive to TS-alone, and this may depend on both the type of inhibition and the strength of the inhibitory manipulation.","1112":"Prospective memory is a complex cognitive construct ubiquitous in everyday life that is thought to sometimes rely on executive skills commonly affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study investigated the effect of PD on prospective memory tasks with varying demand on executive control processes, namely on the amount of strategic attentional monitoring required for intention retrieval. Individuals with PD but without dementia and healthy adults performed laboratory event-based prospective memory tasks that varied in whether strategic attentional monitoring (nonfocal condition) or spontaneous processes (focal condition) were primarily involved in intention retrieval. Participants also completed a questionnaire rating their frequency of prospective memory failures in everyday life for both self-cued and environment-cued tasks. PD participants performed worse than non-PD participants in the nonfocal, but not focal, condition of the laboratory task. They also reported more everyday failures than non-PD participants for self-cued, but not environment-cued, prospective memory tasks. Thus, nondemented individuals with PD are preferentially impaired on prospective memory tasks for which higher levels of executive control are needed to support intention retrieval. This pattern is consistent across laboratory and reported real-world performance.","1113":"Few studies have assessed whether the patterns of neuropsychological impairment in patients with different frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) subtypes remain distinct over the duration of their illness or devolve into a common, undifferentiated neuropsychological state. A longitudinal neuropsychological analysis was obtained over 100 months assessing executive control, language\/naming, and visuoconstruction in 441 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and four FTLD subtypes, i.e., a social comportment\/dysexecutive (SOC\/EXEC) disorder; progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA); semantic dementia (SemD); and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Initial group differences on each measure were maintained over the duration of illness, including several double dissociations. For example, AD patients exhibited a decline in 'animal' fluency; PNFA patients had difficulty on tests of executive control, SemD maintained their impairment on tests of naming, and CBD had presented with performance on visuoconstructional tests. None of the group by neuropsychological task interactions evaluating longitudinal decline was significant, suggesting that performance does not converge onto a common subtype over time. These data indicate that distinct patterns of neuropsychological impairment are maintained longitudinally, reflecting the unique anatomic distribution of relative disease burden in AD and FTLD.","1114":"Compromised neurocognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. Following Heinrichs and Zakzanis's (1998) seminal meta-analysis of middle-aged and predominantly chronic schizophrenia samples, the aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of neurocognitive findings from 47 studies of first-episode (FE) schizophrenia published through October 2007. The meta-analysis uses 43 separate samples of 2,204 FE patients with a mean age of 25.5 and 2,775 largely age- and gender-matched control participants. FE samples demonstrated medium-to-large impairments across 10 neurocognitive domains (mean effect sizes from -0.64 to -1.20). Findings indicate that impairments are reliably and broadly present by the FE, approach or match the degree of deficit shown in well-established illness, and are maximal in immediate verbal memory and processing speed. Larger IQ impairments in the FE compared to the premorbid period, but comparable to later phases of illness suggests deterioration between premorbid and FE phases followed by deficit stability at the group level. Considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies, however, underscores variability in manifestations of the illness and a need for improved reporting of sample characteristics to support moderator variable analyses.","1115":"Patients with schizophrenia and water imbalance may represent a subset of patients with distinct pathophysiological abnormalities and susceptibility to cognitive impairment. Specifically, patients with polydipsia and hyponatremia have been shown to have smaller anterior hippocampal volumes, which are also associated with various impairments in neuroendocrine function. To determine whether abnormalities in patients with water imbalance extend to the cognitive realm, the present study evaluated neuropsychological functioning in three groups of patients with schizophrenia: polydipsic hyponatremic, polydipsic normonatremic, and nonpolydipsic normonatremic. Participants were administered cognitive tests assessing intelligence, attention, learning\/memory (verbal, nonverbal, emotional), and facial discrimination. Hyponatremic patients showed poorer overall neuropsychological functioning relative to all other patients, and polydipsic normonatremic patients performed intermediate to the other two groups. Results indicate that patients with schizophrenia and polydipsia, and particularly those with hyponatremia, show prominent cognitive deficits relative to patients without water imbalance. The clinical, neuroendocrine, and cognitive abnormalities in these patients may arise from pathology within the anterior hippocampus and associated prefrontal\/limbic brain regions.","1116":"Selecting what is important to remember, attending to this information, and then later recalling it can be thought of in terms of the strategic control of attention and the efficient use of memory. To examine whether aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) influenced this ability, the present study used a selectivity task, where studied items were worth various point values and participants were asked to maximize the value of the items they recalled. Relative to younger adults (N = 35) and healthy older adults (N = 109), individuals with very mild AD (N = 41), and mild AD (N = 13) showed impairments in the strategic and efficient encoding and recall of high value items. Although individuals with AD recalled more high value items than low value items, they did not efficiently maximize memory performance (as measured by a selectivity index) relative to healthy older adults. Performance on complex working memory span tasks was related to the recall of the high value items but not low value items. This pattern suggests that relative to healthy aging, AD leads to impairments in strategic control at encoding and value-directed remembering.","1117":"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) continues to be one of the leading causes of death and disability in the pediatric population. Although the literature on neurocognitive outcomes is relatively rich, studies vary significantly in the methods used to group subjects on several moderating variables, including age at injury, injury severity, and time since injury, making it difficult to combine and summarize the data for comparison. Further complicating this effort is the wide range of measures used to document functional outcomes in key neurocognitive domains. In this meta-analytic review, 28 publications (1988 to 2007) that met inclusion criteria were summarized based on three distinct injury severity and time post injury groups for 14 key neurocognitive domains. Effect sizes were calculated to reflect the extent to which the above groups differed in case-control and case-case studies, as well as address recovery based on longitudinal studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published quantitative summary of the literature on neurocognitive outcomes after pediatric TBI. Limitations of the current state of the literature as well as recommendations for future studies are discussed.","1118":"Longitudinal patterns of functional deficits were investigated in 37 children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), 40 children with moderate TBI, and 44 children with orthopedic injuries. They were from 6 to 12 years of age when injured. Their neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive, and academic functioning were assessed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3-5 years postinjury. Functional deficits (&lt;10th percentile for age) were identified within each outcome domain at each occasion. Children were classified into 4 a priori longitudinal patterns of outcomes within domains (i.e., no deficits, improvement, deterioration, persistent deficits). In multinomial logistic regression analyses, severe TBI predicted an increased likelihood of persistent deficits in all outcome domains, as well as deterioration in behavioral functioning and improvement in neuropsychological, adaptive, and academic functioning. Severe TBI also predicted a greater total number of functional deficits across domains at each occasion. However, many children with severe TBI showed no deficits from 6 months to 4 years postinjury in 1 or more outcome domains. The findings help clarify the course of recovery for individual children following TBI.","1119":"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with anomalies in dopamine systems. Recent advances in the understanding of the core cognitive deficits in ADHD suggest that dopamine dysfunction might be expressed through shortened time scales in reward-based learning. Here this perspective is extended by the conjecture that temporal span in working memory systems might generally be shortened. As a test of this conjecture the authors focus on the implicit memory system involved in rhythmic movement, assessing the minimum tempo at which rhythmic feeling can be sustained in adults with diagnosed ADHD and in a control group of normal adults. The authors found that people with ADHD do in fact have a rhythm cut-off that is faster in tempo than those without ADHD. This finding is consistent with the idea that impaired dopamine dynamics have systemic consequences for cognitive function, essentially recalibrating the clock that sets the time scale for the subjective experience of temporal events.","1120":"Hypothesis testing with multiple outcomes requires adjustments to control Type I error inflation, which reduces power to detect significant differences. Maintaining the prechosen Type I error level is challenging when outcomes are correlated. This problem concerns many research areas, including neuropsychological research in which multiple, interrelated assessment measures are common. Standard p value adjustment methods include Bonferroni-, Sidak-, and resampling-class methods. In this report, the authors aimed to develop a multiple hypothesis testing strategy to maximize power while controlling Type I error. The authors conducted a sensitivity analysis, using a neuropsychological dataset, to offer a relative comparison of the methods and a simulation study to compare the robustness of the methods with respect to varying patterns and magnitudes of correlation between outcomes. The results lead them to recommend the Hochberg and Hommel methods (step-up modifications of the Bonferroni method) for mildly correlated outcomes and the step-down minP method (a resampling-based method) for highly correlated outcomes. The authors note caveats regarding the implementation of these methods using available software.","1121":"This study explores the effects of language status on hemispheric involvement in lexical decision. The authors looked at the responses of native Arabic speakers in Arabic (L1 for reading) and in two second languages (L2): Hebrew, which is similar to L1 in morphological structure, and English, which is very different from L1. Two groups of Arabic speakers performed lateralized lexical decision tasks in the three languages, using unilateral presentations and bilateral presentations. These paradigms allowed us to infer both hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric communication in the three languages, and the effects of language status (native vs. nonnative) and similarity on hemispheric patterns of responses. In general the authors show an effect of language status in the right visual field (RVF), reflecting the greater facility of the left hemisphere (LH) in recognizing words in the participant's native Arabic than in their other languages. The participants revealed similar patterns of interhemispheric integration across the languages, with more integration occurring for words than for nonwords. Both hemispheres revealed sensitivity to morphological complexity, a pattern similar to that of native Hebrew readers and different from that of native English readers.","1122":"Drawing tasks have attained a central position in neuropsychological assessment and are considered a rich source of information about the presence (or absence) of cognitive and perceptuo-motor abilities. However, unlike other tests of cognitive impairment, drawing tasks are often administered without reference to normative models of graphic production, and their results are often analyzed qualitatively. I begin this article by delineating the different ways in which drawing errors have been used to indicate particular functional deficits in neurological patients. I then describe models of drawing that have been explicitly based on the errors observed in patient drawings. Finally, the case is made for developing a more sensitive set of metrics in order to quantitatively assess patient performance. By providing a finer grain of analysis to assessment we will not only be better able to characterize the consequences of cognitive dysfunction, but may also be able to more subtly characterize and dissociate patients who would otherwise have been placed in the same broad category of impairment.

However, left hemisphere damaged patients have often been excluded from investigation because of their associated language deficits. In this study we assessed anosognosia for motor disorders in a group of left hemisphere damaged patients using 2 tools that assess the presence of unawareness-a structured interview that is a common method of assessment of anosognosia in clinical settings, and a new tool, the Visual-Analogue Test for Anosognosia for Motor Impairment (VATAm; Della Sala, Cocchini, Beschin, &amp; Cameron, in press). The structured interview relies heavily on language and enquires about general motor ability whereas the VATAm is less dependent on language abilities and enquires about specific motor tasks. Results suggest that the frequency of anosognosia in left brain damaged patients may have been underestimated due to methodological reasons, and that anosognosia for motor impairment can also be associated with lesions of the left hemisphere.","1124":"The authors report findings of a large-scale, multitask investigation of sex differences in both structural asymmetries and lateralization of word reading. Two hundred participants were tested in eight divided visual field lexical tasks, and each received a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan. The authors examined whether there was evidence for sex differences in overall measures of neuroanatomical and behavioral lateralization, in specific language tasks and brain regions, and in variation in asymmetry within and across tasks and brain regions. There was very little evidence for sex differences on any behavioral measure. The few indications of sex differences in the current report accounted for 2% or less of the individual variation in asymmetry and could not be replicated in independent subsamples. No sex differences were observed in the asymmetry of structures in Broca's and Wernicke's areas such as pars triangularis, pars opercularis, the planum temporale, planum parietale, or Heschl's gyrus. There were also no sex differences in the variability of neuroanatomical asymmetries within or between brain regions. However, a significant relationship between planum temporale and behavioral asymmetry was restricted to men.","1125":"Prospective memory (PM) is the formation of an intention and remembering to perform this intention at a future time or in response to specific cues. PM tasks are a ubiquitous part of daily life. Currently, there is a paucity of information regarding PM impairments in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and less empirical evidence regarding effective remediation strategies to mitigate these impairments. The present study employed two levels of a motivational enhancement (i.e., a monetary incentive) to determine whether event-based PM could be improved in children with severe TBI. In a crossover design, children with orthopedic injuries and mild or severe TBI were compared on two levels of incentive (dollars vs. pennies) given in response to accurate performance. All three groups performed significantly better under the high- versus low-motivation conditions. However, the severe TBI group's high-motivation condition performance remained significantly below the low-motivation condition performance of the orthopedic injury group. PM scores were positively and significantly related to age-at-test, but there were no age-at-injury or time-postinjury effects. Overall, these results suggest that event-based PM can be significantly improved in children with severe TBI.","1126":"The new diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment (Winblad et al., 2004, p. 243) list \"evidence of decline over time in objective cognitive tasks\" as one diagnostic sign, implying the repeated neuropsychological testing. This study aimed to compare different assessment methods of longitudinal change based on the performances of 366 cognitively healthy participants (237 men, 129 women) examined with a German version of the California Verbal Learning Test (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987) at baseline and 2 years later. Age, education, gender, and baseline performance were taken into account. Results revealed marked practice effects after 2 years. Normal ranges for change that controls for practice effects and regression to the mean proved to be superior to other reliable change indexes. This new method allows for more valid interpretation of change in neuropsychological functioning and thus diagnosis of MCI.","1127":"Accurate time estimation abilities are assumed to play an important role in efficient performance of many daily activities. The authors investigated the role of episodic memory impairment in temporal perception using a prospective verbal time estimation paradigm. Verbal time estimations were made for filled intervals both within (i.e., &lt;30 s) and beyond the time frame of working memory. In Experiment 1, the verbal time estimates of 24 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were comparable with those of age-matched controls at both short and long (i.e., &gt;30 s) intervals. The verbal time estimates of both older adult groups, however, deviated more significantly from true time when compared with younger adult controls. In Experiment 2, 17 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrated greater error and variability in their time estimates, but no disproportionate differences emerged between short- and long-duration estimates when compared with age-matched controls. The findings did not support a noteworthy role for episodic memory impairment in temporal perception but rather elucidated a significant effect of normal aging, as well as a detrimental effect of AD on temporal perception.","1128":"The authors evaluated multiple memory processes and explored their contributions to everyday functional limitations in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants included individuals with amnestic MCI, nonamnestic MCI, and healthy older adults. As expected, the amnestic MCI group performed more poorly than the control and nonamnestic MCI groups on a content memory measure. Both MCI groups, however, performed more poorly than controls on the noncontent memory measures of prospective memory, temporal order memory, and source memory. Informants also reported that the MCI groups were experiencing greater difficulty than controls completing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Noncontent memory measures were found to make an independent contribution to IADL performances over and above that of content memory. These findings demonstrate that impairments in memory beyond the traditionally assessed content memory are present in individuals with amnestic MCI and with nonamnestic MCI. The results further show that these noncontent memory processes, which have been linked with executive functioning, play a role in supporting IADLs.","1129":"Psychometric measures of processing speed are strong predictors of cognitive functioning with aging; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Recently, the authors reported a negative association between calculated free testosterone levels (cEFT) and processing speed in men aged between 50 and 70 years (Martin, Wittert, Burns, &amp; McPherson, 2008). Ex-Gaussian decomposition of reaction time (RT) distributions allows for the robust estimation of skew in the distribution, which may reflect poorer attentional control. In a reanalysis of data from this previous study, the authors examined the associations between age, cEFT levels, and ex-Gaussian parameters derived from four RT tasks as predictors of cognitive functioning performance in 96 middle-to-older aged men. Results indicated that cEFT levels were significantly associated with increased skew in the RT distribution (i.e., the exponential portion) but not with the estimates derived from the Gaussian portion of the curve. Further, path analysis across the entire data set showed that this association was a strong predictor of processing speed performance. Taken together these results suggest that cEFT levels moderate cognitive functioning performance in males via attentional control processes.","1130":"Performance of patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and herpes encephalitis was compared on a retrograde amnesia (RA) test, asking subjects to recall and recognize the definitions of words that had come into the language at different time periods. Performance was also compared on a related test in which participants were asked to produce the words to definitions they were given in free recall and cued recall versions. It was hypothesized that, if the temporal gradient in remote memory results from a shift of information from episodic to semantic memory, then there should be a temporal gradient on these tasks, possibly steeper (i.e., greater relative sparing of early memories) in the patients in the Korsakoff group than in the herpes encephalitis group, who have widespread temporal lobe damage. Furthermore, in comparing semantic and episodic remote memory tests, consolidation theory would predict uniform temporal gradients across such tasks, whereas multiple trace theory would predict a differential pattern. The results showed that patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and patients with herpes encephalitis were significantly impaired across all time periods on the vocabulary tests, with only minimal evidence of temporal gradients, relative to healthy participants, and there was no evidence of a differential pattern of impairment between the two patient groups. Comparison with performance on measures of episodic retrograde amnesia, in which there was a differential pattern of temporal gradient, suggests that the relative preservation of early episodic remote memories in patients with Korsakoff's syndrome does not result from an episodic-to-semantic shift in the quality with which memories are stored. These findings are discussed in relation to existing theories of RA and to the patients' underlying patterns of neuropathology.","1131":"What are the neural correlates of attractiveness? Using functional MRI (fMRI), the authors addressed this question in the specific context of the apprehension of faces. When subjects judged facial beauty explicitly, neural activity in a widely distributed network involving the ventral occipital, anterior insular, dorsal posterior parietal, inferior dorsolateral, and medial prefrontal cortices correlated parametrically with the degree of facial attractiveness. When subjects were not attending explicitly to attractiveness, but rather were judging facial identity, the ventral occipital region remained responsive to facial beauty. The authors propose that this region, which includes the fusiform face area (FFA), the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and medially adjacent regions, is activated automatically by beauty and may serve as a neural trigger for pervasive effects of attractiveness in social interactions.","1132":"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is characterized by a disruption in the metabolism of phenylalanine and is associated with dopamine deficiency (Diamond, Prevor, Callender, &amp; Druin, 1997) and cerebral white matter abnormalities (e.g., Anderson et al., 2007). From a neuropsychological perspective, prefrontal dysfunction is thought to underlie the deficits in executive abilities observed in individuals with PKU (Christ, Steiner, Grange, Abrams, &amp; White, 2006; Diamond et al., 1997; White, Nortz, Mandernach, Huntington, &amp; Steiner, 2001, 2002). The purpose of our study was to examine a specific aspect of executive ability, response monitoring, as measured by posterror slowing. The authors examined posterror reaction time (RT) in 24 children with well-controlled, early treated PKU and 25 typically developing control children using a go\/no-go task. Results showed that RTs of both controls and children with PKU slowed significantly following the commission of errors. The magnitude of posterror slowing, however, was significantly less for children with PKU. These findings indicate deficient response monitoring in children with PKU.","1133":"Chronic and recreational use of cocaine has been shown to impair inhibitory output control (response inhibition) but whether input control is also affected is an open question. For the first time, this study compared the ability to perform a cued target-discrimination task that measured inhibition of return (IOR), a reflexive inhibitory mechanism that delays attention from returning to a previously attended location, in adult recreational users and in a cocaine-free-matched sample controlled for age, race, gender distribution, and level of intelligence. Results show that the recreational use of cocaine eliminates IOR, suggesting that input control is strongly impaired.","1134":"This study investigated the relationship between premorbid and current cognitive function with respect to the clinical features of patients with various types of neurodegeneration in the form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), as compared with a healthy control group (C). Clinical features (MMSE, cognitive and depressive symptoms), genetics (apolipoprotein E; APOE) and measures of neurodegeneration (Abeta(42), t-tau, and p-tau) were examined, as well as present cognitive function. Various methods of assessing premorbid cognitive function were compared, including a Swedish NART-analogous test (Irregularly Spelled Words; ISW), a Swedish lexical decision test (SLDT), a Hold test (Information in WAIS-R), Best current performance test, and combined demographic characteristics. Results showed that cognitive decline (premorbid minus current cognitive function) based on SLDT and ISW was a significant predictor for MMSE and Abeta(42), whereas corresponding associations for present cognitive function and decline measures based on other methods were less powerful. Results also showed that specific verbal abilities (e.g., SLDT and ISW) were insensitive to AD and that these abilities indicated premorbid cognitive function in retrospect. In conclusion, cognitive decline from premorbid status reflects the disease processes.","1135":"Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to neural and cognitive variation in healthy adults. We examined contribution of three polymorphisms frequently associated with individual differences in cognition (Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase Val158Met, Brain-Derived-Neurotrophic-Factor Val66Met, and Apolipoprotein E epsilon4) and a vascular risk factor (hypertension) in a sample of 189 volunteers (age 18-82). Genotypes were determined from buccal culture samples, and cognitive performance was assessed in 4 age-sensitive domains?fluid intelligence, executive function (inhibition), associative memory, and processing speed. We found that younger age and COMT Met\/Met genotype, associated with low COMT activity and higher prefrontal dopamine content, were independently linked to better performance in most of the tested domains. Homozygotes for Val allele of BDNF polymorphism exhibited better associative memory and faster speed of processing than the Met allele carriers, with greater effect for women and persons with hypertension. Carriers of ApoE epsilon4 allele evidenced steeper age-related increase in costs of Stroop color interference, but showed no negative effects on memory. The findings indicate that age-related cognitive performance is differentially affected by distinct genetic factors and their interactions with vascular health status.","1136":"Adverse consequences such as institutionalization and death are associated with compromised activities of daily living in aging, yet there is little known about risk factors for the development and progression of functional disability. Using generalized linear models, the authors examined the association between the ability to benefit from repetition and rate of change in functional ability in 160 nondemented elders participating in the Religious Orders Study. Three single-word repetition priming tasks were administered that varied in the degree to which visual-perceptual or conceptual processing was invoked. Decline in functional ability was less rapid, during follow-up of up to 10 years, in persons with better baseline priming performance on a task known to draw on both visual-perceptual and conceptual processing (word-stem completion). By contrast, change in functional ability was not associated with priming on tasks that are known to draw primarily on either visual-perceptual (threshold word-identification) or conceptual (category exemplar production) processing. The results are discussed in terms of a common biological substrate in the inferotemporal neocortex, supporting efficient processing of meaningful visual-perceptual experience and proficient performance of activities of daily living.","1137":"People with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) may well be emotionally soothed by listening to music. However, very few systematic studies have been conducted to support the anecdotal evidence. DAT does damage certain cerebral structures that subsume emotional processing, and some studies have demonstrated deficits affecting emotional judgments of facial expression and prosody in DAT. Accordingly, this study addressed the question of whether DAT might leave musical emotional judgment intact. Twelve early DAT participants and 12 healthy elderly participants took part in this study. Emotional judgments were examined in relation to mode and tempo, two important structural properties that contribute to the happy-sad distinction in music. Their respective contributions were assessed in four different experimental conditions. The DAT participants' responses were similar to those of healthy elderly participants, showing spared ability to employ tempo and mode as cues for emotional interpretation. The DAT participants' performance was not correlated with their global cognitive functioning. These results constitute a preliminary empirical demonstration that, in early DAT, musical emotional judgments appear to be based on normal structural analysis of musical input.","1138":"Although it is established that apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), epidemiological studies indicate that genetic risk decreases late in life. This raises the question of whether the effects of APOE on cognition that are seen in midlife arise from a cognitive phenotype of APOE or from the presence of early AD in some APOE-e4 carriers. The authors addressed this question by comparing the cognitive consequences of variation in the APOE gene between individuals over the age of 80 (old-old) and middle-aged and young-old individuals. A spatially cued discrimination paradigm--previously shown to be sensitive to AD and to APOE genotype--required a speeded categorization of a target letter following cues that were valid, invalid, or neutral in predicting target location. Results revealed greater costs of invalid cues in the APOE-e4 carriers of middle-aged and young-old, but not old-old, groups. The dissipation of the APOE effect in old-old individuals at lower risk of AD suggests that visuospatial attention impairments seen as early as midlife in APOE-e4 carriers may be a preclinical marker of AD.","1139":"This study investigated working memory (WM) consolidation, that is, the time required to create durable WM representations, at different levels of WM load in schizophrenia. Twenty-three schizophrenia spectrum patients and 16 control subjects participated in a change-detection task in which a sample array of 1-3 squares appeared followed by a delay and a test array. An array of pattern masks was inserted into the delay interval--covering the locations of the sample-array squares--100-800 ms after the offset of the sample array. If a durable WM representation is formed prior to mask onset, the mask should not impair performance. The degree of masking at an interval reflects the degree of WM consolidation at that time. Neither group showed masking at set size 1. Unlike controls, patients demonstrated robust masking effects at set size 2. Both groups showed masking at set size 3, but masking effects were larger and longer lasting in patients. These data demonstrate abnormally prolonged WM consolidation in schizophrenia. This impairment may slow the formation of stable representations of the visual environment, impacting everyday visually guided behavior.","1140":"Hallucinations have been recently associated with inhibitory deficits in memory. In this study, the authors investigated whether hallucinations were related to difficulties to inhibit irrelevant information from episodic memory (Experiment 1) and working memory (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, a directed forgetting task was used. This task measures participants' ability to intentionally forget some recently learned material, when instructions indicate that it is no longer relevant. In Experiment 2, an updating task was used. This task requires participants to intentionally suppress irrelevant information from working memory. Results showed that patients with schizophrenia with hallucinations presented inhibitory deficits in the directed forgetting task and an increase in the number of intrusions in the updating task, compared to patients without hallucinations and healthy controls. No correlations were found between indices of inhibition and other general, negative or positive symptoms. These findings support the existence of an association between intentional inhibition in memory and hallucinations, and they suggest that problems to suppress memory representations can underlie hallucinations in schizophrenia.","1141":"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by partial loss of growth control that affects the central nervous system. NF1 has been consistently associated with cognitive dysfunction, although there is no consensus on the cognitive profile in NF1 or on brain-cognition relationships. To clarify the pattern of cognitive dysfunction, performance of 16 NF1 patients and 16 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age = 14.5 years, SD = 1.3) was compared on computerized tasks measuring perception, executive functioning (inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and working memory), and motor control. A further aim of this study was to contrast performance on tasks or task parts requiring varying levels of cognitive control to find out whether this could explain potential difficulties experienced by this population in different cognitive domains or at different stages of information processing. Repeated measures analyses of variance showed that group differences, indicating poorer performance of NF1 patients, varied as a function of the level of cognitive control required. Evidence was also found for more basic motor skill problems in NF1 patients. Furthermore, NF1 patients were generally slower than controls. Results are discussed in the context of what is known about brain-cognition relationships in NF1.","1142":"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently affects both the basic and the superordinate components of attention; deficits vary according to patient age. This study evaluated the efficacy of a specific remediation intervention for attention. Sixty-five TBI patients (aged 6?18 years) with attention deficit were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up: 40 patients received attention-specific neuropsychological training for 6 months, and the control group comprised 25 patients. Cognitive assessment included a Wechsler Intelligence Scale (e.g., A. Orsini, 1993) and the Continuous Performance Test II (CPT II; C. K. Conners, 2000). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; S. Sparrow, D. Balla &amp; D. V. Cicchetti, 1984) was administered to assess the treatment's ecological validity. At baseline, all patients presented with a mild intellectual disability and pathological scores on the CPT II. At follow-up, significant differences were found between the 2 groups on the CPT II and VABS: The clinical group improved more than the control group. Specific remediation training for attention, including a combination of a process-specific approach and metacognitive strategies, significantly improved attention performance. Improvement in attention skills also affected adaptive skills positively.","1143":"The present study provides a meta-analysis of cognitive rehabilitation literature (K = 115, N = 2,014) that was originally reviewed by K. D. Cicerone et al. (2000, 2005) for the purpose of providing evidence-based practice guidelines for persons with acquired brain injury. The analysis yielded a small treatment effect size (ES = .30, d(+) statistic) directly attributable to cognitive rehabilitation. A larger treatment effect (ES = .71) was found for single-group pretest to posttest outcomes; however, modest improvement was observed for nontreatment control groups as well (ES = .41). Correction for this effect, which was not attributable to cognitive treatments, resulted in the small, but significant, overall estimate. Treatment effects were moderated by cognitive domain treated, time postinjury, type of brain injury, and age. The meta-analysis revealed sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of attention training after traumatic brain injury and of language and visuospatial training for aphasia and neglect syndromes after stroke. Results provide important quantitative documentation of effective treatments, complementing recent systematic reviews. Findings also highlight gaps in the scientific evidence supporting cognitive rehabilitation, thereby indicating future research directions.","1144":"Lead is a neurotoxicant that accumulates in bone with a half life of 25-30 years. To evaluate the association of lead biomarkers and cognitive function, a cohort of exposed and nonexposed workers who had been previously assessed in 1982 was retested approximately 22 years later. For the current assessment, both blood lead and tibia bone lead levels were determined. In addition, cognitive function was tested with the Pittsburgh Occupational Exposures Test battery, which had previously been administered in 1982. In exposed workers, bone lead level predicted lower current cognitive performance and cognitive decline over 22 years. In those lead-exposed workers older than age 55, higher levels of bone lead predicted poorer cognitive scores, suggesting vulnerability for older workers with higher past lead exposure. Finally, there was no association with bone lead level and recency of exposure, suggesting that cumulative body burden is most likely responsible for the progressive cognitive decrement evidenced with vulnerability because of aging.","1145":"Type 2 diabetes may be associated with exacerbated aging-related declines in cognitive neuropsychological performance. The authors examined whether such effects are systematic (i.e., broadly distributed across domains or domain-specific) or moderated by age (i.e., varying across age within older adults). The authors assembled recent cross-sectional data from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS) Sample 3 (Wave 1; initial n = 570; initial age = 53-90 years). Using a comprehensive, multidimensional spectrum of cognitive neuropsychological tests, the authors examined performance differences by diabetes status (diabetes group vs. healthy controls) and age (young-old vs. old-old). Our results showed that healthy controls significantly outperformed the diabetes group only on markers of executive functioning and speed. Notably, the diabetes-related effects were robust across the two late-life age groups. Future research examining longitudinal changes is recommended.","1146":"Although within-person comparisons allow direct assessments of change, some of the observed change may reflect effects associated with prior test experience rather than the processes of primary interest. One method that might allow retest effects to be distinguished from other influences of change involves comparing the pattern of results in a longitudinal study with those in a study with a very short retest interval. Three short-term retest studies with moderately large samples of adults are used to provide this type of reference information about the magnitude of change, test-retest correlations, reliabilities of change, and correlations of the change in different cognitive variables with each other, and with other types of variables.","1147":"Substantial gains have been made on the neurobiology of attention from systems neuroscience work in animal models and human cognitive neuroscience. However, the integration of rodent-based research on the specific neurotransmitter systems that subserve attention with the results from human behavioral and neuroimaging studies has been hampered by the lack of tasks that validly assess attention in both species. To address this issue, an operant sustained attention task that has been extensively used in research on the neurobiology of attention in rats was redesigned and validated for use in humans. Although humans showed better performance overall, the two species showed similar effects of several attention-related variables, including the introduction of distractor-related challenge. This task provides a useful tool for integrative, cross-species research and may help to determine how specific neurotransmitter systems contribute to the hemodynamic changes observed in human functional neuroimaging experiments.","1148":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drugs of abuse affect common neural systems underlying procedural memory, including the striatum. The authors compared performance of 48 HIV seropositive (HIV+) and 48 HIV seronegative (HIV-) participants with history of cocaine and\/or heroin dependence across multiple Trial Blocks of three procedural learning (PL) tasks: Rotary Pursuit (RP), Mirror Star Tracing (MST), and Weather Prediction (WP). Groups were well matched on demographic, psychiatric, and substance use parameters, and all participants were verified abstinent from drugs. Mixed model analyses of variance revealed that the individuals in the HIV+ group performed more poorly across all tasks, with a significant main effect of HIV serostatus observed on the Mirror Star Tracing and a trend toward significance obtained for the Rotary Pursuit task. No significant differences were observed on the Weather Prediction task. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in performance across all three procedural learning tasks. It is important to note that no significant Serostatus x Trial Block interactions were observed on any task. Thus, the individuals in the HIV+ group tended to perform worse than those in the HIV- group across all trial blocks of procedural learning tasks with motor demands, but showed no differences in their rate of improvement across all tasks. These findings are consistent with HIV--associated deficits in complex motor skills, but not in procedural learning.","1149":"Several studies have shown that children with spina bifida meningomyelocele (SBM) and hydrocephalus have attention problems on parent ratings and difficulties in stimulus orienting associated with a posterior brain attention system. Less is known about response control and inhibition associated with an anterior brain attention system. Using the Gordon Vigilance Task (Gordon, 1983), we studied error rate, reaction time, and performance over time for sustained attention, a key anterior attention function, in 101 children with SBM, 17 with aqueductal stenosis (AS; another condition involving congenital hydrocephalus), and 40 typically developing controls (NC). In SBM, we investigated the relation between cognitive attention and parent ratings of inattention and hyperactivity and explored the impact of medical variables. Children with SBM did not differ from AS or NC groups on measures of sustained attention, but they committed more errors and responded more slowly. Approximately one-third of the SBM group had attention symptoms, although parent attention ratings were not associated with task performance. Hydrocephalus does not account for the attention profile of children with SBM, which also reflects the distinctive brain dysmorphologies associated with this condition.","1150":"Follow-up studies of preterm children without serious neurological complications have consistently found deficits in visuomotor skills. To determine whether these deficits may be related to impaired elementary visuomotor processes, we investigated movement programming and execution of simple pointing movements in 7- to 10-year-old preterm (&lt;34 weeks g.a. and\/or b.w. &lt;1800 g) and full-term children. Such detailed analysis of simple pointing movements provides information on the extent to which processes associated with dorsal and\/or cerebellar functions are impaired. Multi-level analysis showed that movement programming and execution were slowed in the 7-, 9-, and 10-year-old preterm groups. This indicates impaired dorsal visual stream functioning in preterm children, but do not rule out impaired cerebellar functioning. At 8 years of age, there were no differences between the two groups in movement execution time. This could have reflected a transition in the development of movement control in the control group, which has been associated in typically developing children with a decrease in motor speed. Interestingly, a similar decrease was not found in the preterm group at 8 years of age.","1151":"Prospective memory (PM), which is the ability to remember to carry out actions that are planned for the future, plays an important role in professional and social life as well as in activities of daily living. This study examined PM performance among adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) and evaluated the efficacy of a mnemonic strategy, implementation intentions. Compared to controls, adults with MS were impaired on PM, both in terms of acting when encountering the correct circumstances (prospective component) and in terms of remembering the correct action to perform (retrospective component). The prospective-component deficit was greater for tasks that depended on more resource-demanding cognitive processes and smaller on tasks that could be performed more automatically. Use of implementation intentions improved MS-group performance on the prospective component, particularly on the more resource-demanding tasks, consistent with the explanation that implementation intentions improved performance by allowing the use of more automatic processes to perform these PM tasks. Implications for providing environmental support to encourage the use of mnemonic strategies are discussed.","1152":"Several studies have claimed that hemispheric asymmetries affect word recognition right up to the point of fixation because each fovea is split precisely at its vertical midline and information presented either side of this midline projects unilaterally to different, contralateral hemispheres. To investigate this claim, four-letter words were presented to the left or right of fixation, either close to fixation entirely in foveal vision (0.15, 0.25, and 0.35 degrees from fixation) or further from fixation entirely in extrafoveal vision (2.00, 2.10, and 2.20 degrees from fixation). Fixation location and stimulus presentation were controlled using an eye-tracker linked to a fixation-contingent display and performance was assessed using a forced-choice task to suppress confounding effects of guesswork. A left hemisphere advantage was observed for words presented in extrafoveal locations but no hemisphere advantage (left or right) was observed for words presented in any foveal location. These findings support the well-established view that words encountered outside foveal vision project to different, contralateral hemispheres but indicate that this division for word recognition occurs only outside the fovea and provide no support for the claim that a functional split in hemispheric processing exists at the point of fixation.","1153":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is often characterized by pronounced impairment in visuospatial skills, attention, and executive functions. However, the strength of the phenotypic expression of DLB varies and may be weaker in patients with extensive concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD). To determine whether strength of the DLB clinical phenotype impacts cognitive decline, visuospatial and language tests were retrospectively used to predict 2-year rate of global cognitive decline in 22 autopsy-confirmed DLB patients (21 with concomitant AD) and 44 autopsy-confirmed \"pure\" AD patients. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) revealed a significant interaction such that poor baseline performances on tests of visuospatial skills were strongly associated with a rapid rate of cognitive decline in DLB but not AD (p &lt; .001). No effect of confrontation naming was found. DLB patients with poor visuospatial skills had fewer neurofibrillary tangles and were more likely to experience visual hallucinations than those with better visuospatial skills. These results suggest that the severity of visuospatial deficits in DLB may identify those facing a particularly malignant disease course and may designate individuals whose clinical syndrome is impacted more by Lewy body formation than AD pathology.","1154":"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), but up to 40% of cases do not develop AD. Examining a case's specific memory profile may help distinguish which MCI cases will progress to AD: An encoding profile is suggestive of incipient AD, whereas a retrieval profile suggests an alternative etiology. Paired associate learning (PAL) tasks are sensitive for preclinical and early detection of AD, but existing tasks do not enable memory profiling. We developed a novel PAL task enabling the differentiation of memory profiles in 19 people with AD, 17 people with amnestic MCI, and 33 normal elderly controls. Unexpectedly, the AD group demonstrated a retrieval profile for PAL using yes-no recognition, although an encoding profile was evident for forced-choice recognition and for the California Verbal Learning Test--Second Edition (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 2000). There was considerable heterogeneity within the AD and MCI groups as well as intraindividual discordance for memory profiles. The findings challenge the clinical application of memory profiling in the differential diagnosis of AD, and, by extension, question its potential application in the assessment of MCI.","1155":"Dual-process theories of recognition posit that perceptual fluency contributes to both familiarity-based explicit recognition and perceptual priming. However, the priming-without-recognition dissociation, as observed through the intact mere exposure effect and impaired recognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), might indicate that familiarity and perceptual priming are functionally distinct. This study investigated whether the AD patients' processing strategies at testing may explain this priming-without-recognition dissociation. First, we replicated the priming-without-recognition effect in 16 patients who exhibited intact exposure effects despite null recognition. Second, we showed that, under identical conditions, inducing a holistic processing strategy during recognition testing increased AD patients' recognition--performance was similar for AD patients and healthy control participants. Furthermore, prompting analytic processing during both priming and recognition tasks decreased AD patients' performance in both tasks. These findings suggest that the extent to which AD patients use perceptual fluency in priming and recognition tasks is contingent on their processing approach. The choice of processing strategy may depend on how difficult patients perceive the task to be.","1156":"Naming difficulty is common in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the nature of this problem is not well established. The authors investigated the presence of semantic breakdown and the pattern of general and semantic errors in patients with mild AD, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and normal controls by examining their spontaneous answers on the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and verifying whether they needed or were benefited by semantic and phonemic cues. The errors in spontaneous answers were classified in four mutually exclusive categories (semantic errors, visual paragnosia, phonological errors, and omission errors), and the semantic errors were further subclassified as coordinate, superordinate, and circumlocutory. Patients with aMCI performed normally on the BNT and needed fewer semantic and phonemic cues than patients with mild AD. After semantic cues, subjects with aMCI and control subjects gave more correct answers than patients with mild AD, but after phonemic cues, there was no difference between the three groups, suggesting that the low performance of patients with AD cannot be completely explained by semantic breakdown. Patterns of spontaneous naming errors and subtypes of semantic errors were similar in the three groups, with decreasing error frequency from coordinate to superordinate to circumlocutory subtypes.","1157":"Spatial neglect is characterized by a deviation of the eyes and the head during active search, as well as at rest. Here the authors investigate the hitherto unknown relationship between these striking behaviors in the course of recovery. Gaze, eye-in-head, and head-on-trunk positions were recorded separately under two experimental conditions: (i) at rest (i.e., without any specific requirements, doing nothing) and (ii) during active exploratory search in a large visual array of 240 degrees x 80 degrees over a 10-month period. The authors observed a parallel decrease of eye and head (= gaze) deviation in both conditions, accompanied by a comparable decline in neglect severity. The results strengthen the view that the marked gaze deviation toward the ipsilesional side in patients with spatial neglect is due to a very elementary disturbance of human spatial information processing.","1158":"In this study, a task using forced-choice lexical familiarity judgments of irregular versus archaic words (a newly developed measure called the Lexical Orthographic Familiarity Test; LOFT) was compared to a standardized oral word-reading measure (the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading; WTAR) in a group of 35 aphasic adults and a comparison group of 125 community dwelling, nonbrain damaged adults. When compared to the comparison group, aphasics had significantly lower scores on the WTAR but not the LOFT. Although both the WTAR and LOFT were significantly correlated with education in the nonbrain-damaged group, only the LOFT was correlated with education and also with the Barona full scale IQ index in the aphasic group. Lastly, WTAR performance showed a significantly greater relationship to the severity of language disorder in the aphasic group than did the LOFT. These results have both theoretical and clinical implications for the assessment of language-disordered adults, as they indicate that patients with aphasia may retain aspects of verbally mediated intelligence, and that the LOFT may provide a better estimate of premorbid functioning in aphasia than other currently available measures.","1159":"Human anterograde amnesia can result from a variety of etiologies, including hypoxic brain injury and anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysm rupture. Although each etiology can cause a similarly severe disruption in declarative memory for verbal and visual material, there may be differences in incrementally acquired, feedback-based learning, as well as generalization. Here, 6 individuals who survived hypoxic brain injury, 7 individuals who survived ACoA aneurysm rupture, and 13 matched controls were tested on 2 tasks that included a feedback-based learning phase followed by a transfer phase in which familiar information is presented in new ways. In both tasks, the ACoA group was slow on initial learning, but those patients who completed the learning phase went on to transfer as well as controls. In the hypoxic group, 1 patient failed to complete either task; the remaining hypoxic group did not differ from controls during learning of either task, but was impaired on transfer. These results highlight a difference in feedback-based learning in 2 amnesic etiologies, despite similar levels of declarative memory impairment.","1160":"The current study investigated how mechanisms of attention that have been well-characterized in the cognitive psychology literature (Lavie, Hirst, De Fockert, &amp; Viding, 2004; Maylor &amp; Lavie, 1998) may be differentially associated with psychopathic traits in nonincarcerated men. Previous research on cognition and psychopathy indicated that primary psychopathic traits were associated with overfocused attention and\/or reduced processing of information peripheral to the focus of attention. Conversely, deficits in executive functioning, such as working memory and cognitive control, were implicated in secondary psychopathic traits. Results revealed a significant relationship between traits typically associated with primary psychopathy (e.g., low anxiety, social dominance, fearlessness, callousness) and reduced processing of task-irrelevant distractors, suggesting diminished basic attentional capacity among individuals high on these traits. In contrast, some characteristics linked to secondary psychopathy (e.g., social alienation, cynicism) showed a positive relationship with impaired working memory functioning, indicative of deficits in cognitive control, whereas other traits (i.e., self-centeredness, antagonism) did not. These results suggest that psychopathic traits are differentially related to selective impairments in attentional functioning, which may help explain the observed heterogeneity in psychopathic manifestations.","1161":"Despite increasing evidence that the fornix is important for memory, uncertainty remains about the exact nature of subsequent impairments arising from damage to this tract. This uncertainty is often created by pathology in additional brain structures. The present study involved a young man, DN, who had almost complete bilateral loss of the rostral columns of the fornix and much of the surrounding septum in the left hemisphere following the surgical removal of a cavernous angioma. Quantitative MRI analyses of structure size, normalized to intracranial volume, showed no difference in any of the additional brain regions measured, apart from those areas removed to expose the tumor. DN showed a marked, stable anterograde memory impairment that was still present 4 years postsurgery. In contrast, DN performed within normal levels on most tests of recognition memory. This sparing was most striking when given a 24-hr delay between study and test of the Warrington Recognition Memory Test. This recall\/recognition dissociation provides further evidence for neuroanatomical divisions within recognition memory processes.","1162":"Old adults have to face many situations that require important decisions. In the present investigation, the authors examined the effects of aging on both decisions under ambiguity and decisions under risk. To this purpose, healthy young and old adults completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Probability-Associated Gambling task (PAG task). Old adults performed the PAG task as well as young adults, demonstrating ability to make decisions when full information about the problem situation, the options' probabilities and the associated gains and losses was given. Differently, old adults showed poor performance on the IGT relative to young adults, indicating difficulty in making advantageous decisions under ambiguous conditions. Indeed, in the IGT, participants are not aware of the rules for gains and losses and have to learn about the utility of their selections through experience. Results of our analyses point to the contribution of executive functions to all types of decisions. Our findings have also practical implications, suggesting that old people can make advantageous decisions when complete information about the decision situation is available.","1163":"The ability to ignore or control the processing of distracting information may underlie many age-related and individual differences in cognitive abilities. Using a large sample of adults aged 18 to 87 years, this article presents data examining the mediating role of distraction control in the relationship between age and higher order cognition. The reading with distraction task (Connelly, Hasher, &amp; Zacks, 1991) has been used as a measure of the access function of distraction control. Results of this study suggest that distraction control, as measured by this paradigm, plays an important role in mediating age-related effects on measures of working memory and matrix reasoning.","1164":"Brain atrophy and decline in executive functioning have been reported during late life, but the relationship between the 2 phenomena is not clear. To examine associations between executive tasks and morphometry, MRIs of the prefrontal cortex from 23 healthy elders were manually masked and automatically segmented. Total brain matter of the bilateral orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, gyrus rectus, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus were computed as ratios of intracranial volume. A neuropsychological battery of five clinical tests of executive function was administered. Better performance on a response inhibition task was associated with larger volume in anterior cingulate, and performance on a nonverbal inductive reasoning task was associated with larger gyrus rectus volumes. In contrast, larger orbitofrontal volumes were associated with lower verbal and nonverbal generative output. An aggregated error index from 4 executive tests correlated negatively with a regional composite brain index. In conclusion, some executive abilities correlate with volumes of specific prefrontal subregions despite a robust neural interconnectedness between the subregions.","1165":"Many previous studies investigating long-term cognitive impairments following traumatic brain injury (TBI) have focused on extremely severely injured patients, relied on subjective reports of change and failed to use demographically relevant control data. The aim of this study was to investigate cognitive impairments 10 years following TBI and their association with injury severity. Sixty TBI and 43 control participants were assessed on tests of attention, processing speed, memory, and executive function. The TBI group demonstrated significant cognitive impairment on measures of processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT], Smith, 1973; Digit Symbol Coding, Wechsler, 1997), memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]; Rey, 1958; Lezak, 1976), Doors and People tests; Baddeley, Emslie &amp; Nimmo-Smith, 1994) and executive function (Hayling C [Burgess &amp; Shallice, 1997] and SART errors, Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley &amp; Yiend, 1997). Logistic Regression analyses indicated that the SDMT, Rey AVLT and Hayling C and SART errors most strongly differentiated the groups in the domains of attention\/processing speed, memory and executive function, respectively. Greater injury severity was significantly correlated with poorer test performances across all domains. This study shows that cognitive impairments are present many years following TBI and are associated with injury severity.","1166":"Schizophrenia patients consistently show deficits on tasks of explicit learning and memory. In contrast, their performance on implicit processing tasks often appears to be relatively intact, although most studies have focused on implicit learning of motor skills. This study evaluated implicit learning in 59 medicated schizophrenia outpatients and 43 controls using 2 different cognitive skill tasks. Participants completed a probabilistic classification task to assess procedural habit learning and an artificial grammar task to assess incidental learning of complex rule-based knowledge, as well as an explicit verbal learning and memory task. In addition to performing worse than controls on the explicit learning task, patients showed worse overall performance on the probabilistic classification task, which involves gradual learning through trial-by-trial performance feedback. However, patients and controls showed similar levels of learning on the artificial grammar task, suggesting a preserved ability to acquire complex rule-based knowledge in the absence of performance feedback. Discussion focuses on possible explanations for schizophrenia patients' poor probabilistic classification task performance.","1167":"The aim of the present study was to investigate verbal fluency in preclinical Huntington's disease (HD). Phonemic and semantic fluency and the rate of word production over time were assessed for 29 asymptomatic gene carriers and 34 noncarriers of HD. The relationship between fluency tasks and other cognitive domains was investigated. Compared to noncarriers, carriers produced fewer words and produced them more slowly in the phonemic fluency task but not in the semantic fluency task. When the carrier group was divided on the basis of Predicted-Years-To-Onset (PYTO), only carriers with &lt;12 PYTO performed worse than noncarriers on both fluency tasks. Correlational analyses revealed that phonemic fluency was associated with cognitive speed and working memory, while semantic fluency was linked with crystallized abilities. The difference between carriers and noncarriers in phonemic fluency and a difference between the two carrier groups (&lt;12 PYTO and &gt;or=12 PYTO) in semantic fluency, but not in phonemic fluency, suggest that frontostriatal deficits may precede temporal involvement in preclinical HD.","1168":"Working memory maintenance processes for visual-spatial and visual-object information were evaluated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). PD patients and controls performed a working memory task with two conditions that differed only in the aspect of the stimuli that the participant was instructed to remember: their locations or shapes. Maintenance processes were investigated by measuring accuracy over 1-s, 5-s, and 10-s delays. Results indicated that patients were impaired in maintaining object information over the delay. In contrast, the patients showed impairment on the spatial condition only when the to-be-remembered stimulus was highly similar in location to the probe, but this impairment was equivalent across the delays, suggesting that this deficit was not due to maintenance impairment. These results suggest that deficits in working memory for spatial and object information are mediated by distinct cognitive processes in nondemented patients with PD and may differ in their pathophysiological basis.","1169":"The study investigates the relative degree and timing of cortical activation in parietal, temporal, and frontal regions during simple arithmetic tasks in children who experience math difficulties. Real-time brain activity was measured with magnetoencephalography during simple addition and numerosity judgments in students with math difficulties and average or above average reading skills (MD group, N = 14), students with below average scores on both math and basic reading tests (MD\/RD group, N = 16) and students with above average scores on standardized math tests (control group, N = 25). Children with MD showed increased degree of neurophysiological activity in inferior and superior parietal regions in the right hemisphere compared to both controls and MD\/RD students. Left hemisphere inferior parietal regions did not show the expected task-related changes and showed activity at a significant temporal delay. MD students also showed increased early engagement of prefrontal cortices. Taken together, these findings may indicate increased reliance on a network of right hemisphere parietal (and possibly frontal areas as well) for simple math calculations in students who experience math difficulties but perform within normal range in reading.","1170":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by atypicalities in domains that are posited to rely on implicit learning processes such as social communication, language, and motor behavior. The authors examined 2 forms of implicit learning in 14 children with high-functioning ASD (10 of whom were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome) and 14 control children, learning of spatial context known to be mediated by the medial temporal lobes (using the contextual cueing task) and of sequences known to be mediated by frontal-striatal and frontal-cerebellar circuits (using the alternating serial reaction time task). Both forms of learning were unimpaired in ASD. Spatial contextual implicit learning was spared in ASD despite slower visual search of spatial displays. The present findings provide evidence for the integrity of learning processes dependent on integration of spatial and sequential contextual information in high-functioning children with ASD.","1171":"The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is widely used in clinical neuropsychological practice. The CDT has been used traditionally as a \"parietal lobe\" test (e.g., Kaplan, 1988), but most empirical work has focused on its sensitivity and specificity for detecting and differentiating subtypes of dementia. There are surprisingly few studies of its neuroanatomical correlates. The authors investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of the CDT, using 133 patients whose lesions provided effective coverage of most of both hemispheric convexities and underlying white matter. On the CDT, 30 subjects were impaired and 87 were unimpaired (16 were \"borderline\"). Impairments on the CDT were associated with damage to right parietal cortices (supramarginal gyrus) and left inferior frontal-parietal opercular cortices. Visuospatial errors were predominant in patients with right hemisphere damage, whereas time setting errors were predominant in patients with left hemisphere lesions. These findings provide new empirical evidence regarding the neuroanatomical correlates of the CDT, and together with previous work, support the use of this quick and easily administered test not only as a screening measure but also as a good index of focal brain dysfunction.","1172":"Research suggests that the severity of left spatial neglect can be modulated by changes in general alertness. Analogous effects in healthy volunteers now suggest that this may reflect an amplified form of a normal pattern. Recent neuropsychological studies also suggest that concurrent cognitive load may exacerbate rightward bias. In this study, for the first time, the authors examined the effect of both factors on spatial bias in healthy volunteers. Participants performed a task in which as many letters as possible needed to be reported from a briefly presented visual array under three conditions (alone, with a syllable-discrimination secondary task and with a pitch-discrimination secondary task). The results confirmed a significant rightward shift associated with time-on-task across all conditions--the first demonstration of such an effect within a fixation controlled, brief presentation task. While the secondary tasks influenced overall visual performance, there was no discernable effect on bias.","1173":"This article describes the development and validation of an instrument to assess cognitively mediated functional abilities in older adults, Everyday Cognition (ECog). The ECog is an informant-rated questionnaire comprised of multiple subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine its factor structure. Convergent validity was evaluated by comparing it to established measures of everyday function. External validity was evaluated by comparing ECog results across different clinical groups [cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia]. CFA supported a seven-factor model including one global factor and six domain-specific factors (Everyday Memory, Language, Visuospatial Abilities, Planning, Organization, and Divided attention). The ECog correlated with established measures of functional status and global cognition, but only weakly with age and education. The clinical groups performed differently in each domain. In addition to the global factor, the Everyday Memory factor independently differentiated MCI from Normal, while the Everyday Language domain differentiated Dementia from MCI. Different subtypes of MCI also showed different patterns. Results suggest the ECog shows promise as a useful tool for the measurement of general and domain-specific everyday functions in the elderly.","1174":"Strongly right (SR)-handedness is associated with poorer memory performance than nonstrongly right (nSR)-handedness (e.g., Propper, Christman, &amp; Phaneuf, 2005). The hemispheric interaction theory states that the nSR memory advantage occurs because nSR handedness, compared with SR, is a behavioral marker for greater interaction of the cerebral hemispheres. The hemispheric interaction theory predicts that the nSR advantage should be observed exclusively on memory tasks that require hemispheric interaction. The authors tested that prediction by comparing middle-aged and older adults on two memory tasks thought to depend on hemispheric interaction (paired associate recall, source memory) and two thought not to (face recognition, forward digit span). An nSR advantage was more robust for middle-aged than older subjects and, consistent with the hemispheric interaction theory, was found only on the tasks that depend on hemispheric interaction.","1175":"Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to study the organization of executive functions in older adults. The four primary goals were to examine (a) whether executive functions were supported by one versus multiple underlying factors, (b) which underlying skill(s) predicted performance on complex executive function tasks, (c) whether performance on analogous verbal and nonverbal tasks was supported by separable underlying skills, and (d) how patterns of performance generally compared with those of young adults. A sample of 100 older adults completed 10 tasks, each designed to engage one of three control processes: mental set shifting (Shifting), information updating or monitoring (Updating), and inhibition of prepotent responses (Inhibition). CFA identified robust Shifting and Updating factors, but the Inhibition factor failed to emerge, and there was no evidence for verbal and nonverbal factors. SEM showed that Updating was the best predictor of performance on each of the complex tasks the authors assessed (the Tower of Hanoi and the Wisconsin Card Sort). Results are discussed in terms of insight for theories of cognitive aging and executive function.","1176":"Aging is associated with declines in episodic memory. In this study, the authors used a path analysis framework to explore the mediating role of differences in brain structure, executive functions, and processing speed in age-related differences in episodic memory. Measures of regional brain volume (prefrontal gray and white matter, caudate, hippocampus, visual cortex), executive functions (working memory, inhibitory control, task switching, temporal processing), processing speed, and episodic memory were obtained in a sample of young and older adults. As expected, age was linked to reduction in regional brain volumes and cognitive performance. Moreover, neural and cognitive factors completely mediated age differences in episodic memory. Whereas hippocampal shrinkage directly affected episodic memory, prefrontal volumetric reductions influenced episodic memory via limitations in working memory and inhibitory control. Age-related slowing predicted reduced efficiency in temporal processing, working memory, and inhibitory control. Lastly, poorer temporal processing directly affected episodic memory. No direct effects of age on episodic memory remained once these factors were taken into account. These analyses highlight the value of a multivariate approach with the understanding of complex relationships in cognitive and brain aging.","1177":"The authors examined category effects on tasks of picture naming, naming to definition, and word-picture matching in 38 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 30 elderly controls. Each task was matched across category on all \"nuisance\" variables known to differ across domains. Standard analyses revealed significant category disadvantages for classifying living things in AD patients but also for elderly controls on each task. To overcome the ceiling effect in controls, the authors conducted 1,000 bootstrap analyses of covariance, with control performance as a difficulty index covariate. These covariate analyses eliminated the category effect in AD patients on all 3 tasks. Indeed, the authors report that control performance accounted for 64% (picture naming), 49% (naming to description), and 42% (word-picture matching) of variance in AD performance. This suggests that, although category effects in AD patients do not reflect intrinsic variables, the size and direction of the category effect are not different from those in elderly controls.","1178":"The aim of the study was to compare the performance of Robust and Conventional neuropsychological norms in predicting clinical decline among healthy adults and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The authors developed Robust baseline cross sectional and longitudinal change norms from 113 healthy participants retaining a normal diagnosis for at least 4 years. Baseline Conventional norms were separately created for 256 similar healthy participants without follow-up. Conventional and Robust norms were tested in an independent cohort of longitudinally studied healthy (n=223), MCI (n=136), and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=162) participants; 84 healthy participants declined to MCI or AD (NL--&gt;DEC), and 44 MCI declined to AD (MCI--&gt;AD). Compared to Conventional norms, baseline Robust norms correctly identified a higher proportion of NL--&gt;DEC with impairment in delayed memory and attention-language domains. Both norms predicted decline from MCI--&gt;AD. Change norms for delayed memory and attention-language significantly incremented baseline classification accuracies. These findings indicate that Robust norms improve identification of healthy individuals who will decline and may be useful for selecting at-risk participants for research studies and early interventions.","1179":"The main aim in this work was to study the interaction between auditory and kinesthetic stimuli and its influence on motion control. The study was performed on healthy subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Thirty-five right-handed volunteers (young, PD, and age-matched healthy participants, and PD-patients) were studied with three different motor tasks (slow cyclic movements, fast cyclic movements, and slow continuous movements) and under the action of kinesthetic stimuli and sounds at different beat rates. The action of kinesthesia was evaluated by comparing real movements with virtual movements (movements imaged but not executed). The fast cyclic task was accelerated by kinesthetic but not by auditory stimuli. The slow cyclic task changed with the beat rate of sounds but not with kinesthetic stimuli. The slow continuous task showed an integrated response to both sensorial modalities. These data show that the influence of the multisensory integration on motion changes with the motor task and that some motor patterns are modulated by the simultaneous action of auditory and kinesthetic information, a cross-modal integration that was different in PD-patients.","1180":"The working memory (WM) concept has stimulated substantial research since Baddeley and Hitch advanced their model in 1974. There has also been growing interest in WM in Parkinson's disease (PD) where the brain structures considered important for WM are often compromised. However, it remains unclear how and to what degree WM is affected in PD. The authors used meta-analysis to clarify the research findings on WM in PD. The results confirmed that people with PD are impaired on tests of WM. This impairment is small for verbal span but moderate on complex verbal and both simple and complex visuospatial tasks. These data do not support the belief that WM impairment in PD is solely at the level of the central executive. However, our findings support the notion that impairment is more pronounced for visuospatial than verbal WM. A number of different interpretations of these results are discussed. It remains to be established what these statistically significant differences mean in terms of clinically significant levels of impairment in WM. Another important methodological issue that demands greater consideration in this area is that of sampling and the generalizability of results.","1181":"Considerable evidence indicates that cognitive dysfunction and impairments in everyday life activities are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the relationship between these cognitive and functional deficits has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of cognitive dysfunction in the functional status of individuals with MS. Participants were 74 adults with MS and 35 healthy comparison participants (HCs) who underwent neuropsychological testing and completed the Executive Functions Performance Test (EFPT; Baum, Morrison, Hahn, &amp; Edwards, 2003), an objective measure of everyday life activities. Between-groups comparisons and correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between cognition and functional capacity. Significant differences in EFPT performance were revealed between individuals with MS with and without cognitive impairment and HCs. In individuals with MS, performance on cognitive constructs was related to performance on the EFPT. Furthermore, a linear regression model comprised of indices of cognitive functioning explained a significant portion of the variance in everyday life activities. Findings suggest that individuals with and without cognitive impairment differ in functional status and that aspects of cognition are predictive of functional status in MS.","1182":"Although the cognitive disorder of multiple sclerosis (MS) is well characterized, little is known about personality changes that may occur in this disease. There are reliable personality tests available for research in neurological disease, based on the well-known Five Factor Model. Preliminary research suggests that cognitively impaired MS patients exhibit elevation in Neuroticism, and diminution in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, as do patients with Alzheimer's disease. We predicted that these characteristics would be associated with lower neocortical volume. We studied 44 patients using brain MRI and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Regression models controlling for T2 lesion volume, depression, and cognitive dysfunction revealed significant correlation between cortical atrophy and reduction in Extraversion and Conscientiousness. Discrepancies between patient- and informant-reports were found, and overreporting of high Openness and Conscientiousness among patients was associated with lower neocortical volume. A final regression model accounting for depression, cognitive function, and personality accounted for 38% of the variance in neocortical volume. These findings suggest that cortical atrophy in MS is associated with adverse impact on personality, although longitudinal research is needed to test this hypothesis.","1183":"The authors studied the relationship between the antioxidant system and cognitive functions in a group of 36 early and continuously treated phenylketonuric (PKU) patients (mean age=9.7 years) and 29 controls. The authors measured antioxidant cofactors and free radical damage markers in plasma (selenium, retinol, tocopherol, coenzyme Q10, malondialdehide) and antioxidant enzymes in red blood cells (glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase). The authors used neuropsychological tests to screen for several cognitive functions. PKU patients showed significantly lower values of selenium, coenzyme Q10, and catalase, and significantly higher levels of malondialdehide. PKU patients showed a significantly negative correlation between plasma selenium concentrations and several Conner's Continuous Performance Test measures (more omission errors, fluctuating attention and inconsistency of response times, and slowing reaction time as the test progressed). Selenium deficiency was thus associated with a worsened performance on the Conner's Continuous Performance Test among PKU patients. In conclusion, it is important not only to control blood Phe levels in PKU but also other nutritional components such as selenium. Selenium status seems to be associated with attention functions in these PKU patients.","1184":"Eight adolescents (ages 13-18 years) who sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) and eight gender- and age-matched typically developing (TD) adolescents underwent event-related functional MRI (fMRI) while performing a Sternberg letter recognition task. Encoding, maintenance, and retrieval were examined with memory loads of one or four items during imaging. Both groups performed above a 70% accuracy criterion and did not differ in performance. TD adolescents showed greater increase in frontal and parietal activation during high-load relative to low-load maintenance than the TBI group. The TBI patients showed greater increase in activation during high-load relative to low-load encoding and retrieval than the TD group. Results from this preliminary study suggest that the capability to differentially allocate neural resources according to memory load is disrupted by TBI for the maintenance subcomponent of working memory. The overrecruitment of frontal and extrafrontal regions during encoding and retrieval following TBI may represent a compensatory process.","1185":"This study investigated motivational changes in a 44 year-old man (PJ) who developed considerable reduction in spontaneous activity and speech, flat affect, social withdrawal, loss of interest, inability to \"feel,\" and lack of concern regarding his medical condition after bilateral, focal, anoxic lesions of the globus pallidus. PJ and 30 male controls performed a task designed to parse hedonic evaluation, or liking, from incentive motivation, or wanting. Affective stimuli were presented on a computer screen and subjects controlled viewing time by pressing keys. PJ's liking and wanting of unpleasant stimuli was similar to that of controls. In response to pleasant stimuli, PJ showed normal ratings of wanting and hedonic appreciation, but significantly reduced viewing time or made no responses. Active withdrawal from liked stimuli could constitute the basic mechanism underlying poor motivation and social withdrawal associated with globus pallidus damage.","1186":"An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a series of confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on 17 variables designed to assess different cognitive abilities in a sample of healthy older adults. In the EFA, 4 factors emerged corresponding to language, memory, processing speed, and fluid ability constructs. The results of the confirmatory factor analyses suggested that a 5-factor model with an additional Attention factor improved the fit. The invariance of the 5-factor model was examined across 3 groups: a group of cognitively healthy older adults, a group of patients diagnosed with questionable dementia (QD), and a group of patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results of the invariance analysis suggest that the model may have configural invariance across the 3 groups but not metric invariance. Specifically, preliminary analyses suggest that the memory construct may represent something different in the QD and AD groups as compared to the healthy older adult group, consistent with the underlying pathology in early AD.","1187":"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the processing of sincere and sarcastic statements by the cerebral hemispheres. Forty right-handed students were asked to localize sincere and sarcastic statements presented dichotically. Participants either indicated the ear that perceived the sarcastic statement or the ear that perceived the sincere statement in counterbalanced blocks of trials. As expected, results revealed a left ear advantage for sarcastic statements and a right ear advantage for sincere statements. In addition, participants showed faster response time when localizing targets (both sarcastic and sincere) to the left ear compared to the right. Finally, a significant negative correlation between laterality effects in the two tasks provided support for causal hemispheric complementarity. Results are discussed with reference to the contribution of the right and left hemispheres to language processing. Their implications for models of sarcasm perception are also discussed.","1188":"An association between hallucinations and reality-monitoring deficit has been repeatedly observed in patients with schizophrenia. Most data concern auditory\/verbal hallucinations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between visual hallucinations and a specific type of reality-monitoring deficit, namely confusion between imagined and perceived pictures. Forty-one patients with schizophrenia and 43 healthy control participants completed a reality-monitoring task. Thirty-two items were presented either as written words or as pictures. After the presentation phase, participants had to recognize the target words and pictures among distractors, and then remember their mode of presentation. All groups of participants recognized the pictures better than the words, except the patients with visual hallucinations, who presented the opposite pattern. The participants with visual hallucinations made more misattributions to pictures than did the others, and higher ratings of visual hallucinations were correlated with increased tendency to remember words as pictures. No association with auditory hallucinations was revealed. Our data suggest that visual hallucinations are associated with confusion between visual mental images and perception. ","1189":"In healthy individuals, filtering of distractors improves when the perceptual difficulty, or load, of a central task increases. Following an earlier study by Lavie and Robertson (2001), this study examined whether increasing the perceptual load of a visual discrimination task attenuates the influence of ipsilesional and contralesional distractors in patients with spatial extinction. The authors used a flanker task in which participants identified a central target letter flanked by congruent, incongruent, or neutral distractors in the left and right hemifields. Perceptual load was manipulated by positioning the central target letter above or below a hash mark (#) in the low-load condition, or a letter (\"R\") in the high-load condition. Target identification was significantly more difficult under high load than low load. Despite this difference in task difficulty, the interference from incongruent flankers was equivalent across the two load conditions, for both contralesional and ipsilesional flankers. Our results suggest that perceptual load does not attenuate the distracting influence of ipsilesional stimuli. Rather, selectivity is strongly influenced by the strength of representations in brain areas that code salience across the visual field.","1190":"Effects of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) on social problem-solving were examined in a longitudinal study of 103 children with moderate-to-severe TBI (n = 52) or orthopedic injury (OI; n = 51) using the Interpersonal Negotiation Strategies task (INS). Children solved age-appropriate hypothetical social conflicts, with responses for four problem-solving steps scored by developmental level. The OI group performed better than the TBI group, but rate of change in performance over time did not differ between groups, suggesting improvement in children with TBI was not due to recovery from injury. Strong relations between INS performance and memory and language skills emerged, but emotional processing was only weakly related to INS performance. Frontal focal lesions influenced INS performance in younger (but not older) children with TBI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), revealed strong relationships between the INS and increased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measures indexing connectivity in the dorsolateral and cingulate regions in both TBI and OI groups, and in the temporal and parietal regions in the TBI group. These findings inform studies of social problem-solving skills during the first year post TBI.

Three hundred and thirteen right-handed participants (157 women) were given two behavioral tests of lateralization: a handedness questionnaire and a chimeric faces test. Two further handedness measures were taken: familial left-handedness and writing posture. Regression analysis showed that both degree of handedness and sex were predictive of degree of lateralization. Individuals who were strongly right-handed were also more strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere for the task. Men were more strongly lateralized than women. Data were reanalyzed for men and women separately. The relationship between handedness and lateralization remained for men only. Neither familial left-handedness nor writing posture were associated with cerebral lateralization for men or women. The results suggest a positive relationship between degree of handedness and degree of cerebral lateralization, and further that there is a sex difference in this relationship.","1192":"Several studies have examined corpus callosum (CC) morphology in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A meta-analysis of atypical brain morphology in children and adolescents with ADHD by Valera, Faraone, Murray, and Seidman (2006) reported a reduction in the splenium of the CC in this group compared with healthy controls. This meta-analysis undertook a more detailed examination of callosal morphology by also considering comorbid conditions and gender differences. The data from 13 studies were analyzed. Consistent with Valera et al. (2006), the splenium was smaller in children and adolescents with ADHD than in healthy controls. However, this result appears to be the result of a smaller splenium in females with ADHD. In addition, boys exhibited a smaller rostral body. There were no significant differences in CC measurements of studies that included ADHD samples with comorbid conditions. However, comorbidities were not consistently reported, making it difficult to accurately evaluate the impact of comorbidity on CC size. Additional research is needed to investigate whether gender differences reflect different ADHD subtypes. In addition, it is not known if these CC differences persist into adulthood.","1193":null,"1194":"The existence of small numbers of schizophrenia patients with superior ability in specific cognitive domains is implied by meta-analytic evidence as well as by occasional empirical reports. The authors identified 25 patients with superior (i.e., &gt; or =90th percentile) ability on the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd edition (Wechsler, 1997). These cognitively advantaged patients were compared with 22 healthy participants performing at the superior level and with 126 schizophrenia patients and 50 healthy participants scoring below the superior range. Verbally superior schizophrenia patients and verbally superior healthy participants had similar cognitive profiles and life skills performance, but diverged markedly in terms of independent \"real-world\" functioning. Verbally superior patients significantly outperformed more typical patients in other aspects of cognitive performance, life skills, and support requirements. However, severity of positive and negative symptoms was equivalent in the patient groups. Detailed biobehavioral study of cognitively exceptional patients may offer new insights into mechanisms mediating psychotic disorders.","1195":"This study investigated the processing of second-order relational face information in schizophrenia. Twenty-eight schizophrenic patients and 28 controls were asked to say whether the space between the eyes was the same in 2 side-by-side faces. The 2 faces were derived from the same original face, but the spacing between the eyes was either the same or differed by various distances. The results showed that schizophrenic patients needed a space that was twice as great as controls to see a difference. The authors conclude that schizophrenic patients have a deficit in processing second-order relational face information.","1196":"Confirmatory factor analyses of the commonly used 11 subtests of the Wechsler child and adult intelligence scales were accomplished for 137 children and 117 adults with high functioning autism (HFA) and for comparable age groups from the standardization samples contained in the Wechsler manuals. The objectives were to determine whether the structure of intelligence in HFA groups was similar to that found in the normative samples, and whether a separate \"social context\" factor would emerge that was unique to HFA. Four-factor models incorporating a Social Context factor provided the best fit in both the autism and normative samples, but the subtest intercorrelations were generally lower in the autism samples. Findings suggest similar organization of cognitive abilities in HFA, but with the possibility of underconnectivity or reduced communication among brain regions in autism.","1197":"Past research suggests a link between socioeconomic status (SES) and brain processes in children, but direct evidence from neuroimaging is scarce. The authors investigated the relationships among SES, performance, and the neural correlates of auditory selective attention, by comparing event-related potentials (ERPs) in lower- and higher-SES preadolescent children during a task in which they attended to two types of pure tones but ignored two other types. Our hypothesis was that, at comparable performance levels, higher-SES children ignore distracters (the unattended, irrelevant tones) while lower-SES children attend equally to distracters and to targets (the attended, relevant tones). The authors found that ERP waveform differences between attended and unattended tones (Nd, difference negativity) were significant in the higher-SES but not in the lower-SES group. However, the groups did not differ in reaction times or accuracy. Electroencephalographic power analysis revealed a differential pattern of theta activity concomitant with irrelevant tones for the two groups, indicating that although they performed similarly the children from these groups recruited different neural processes. Lower-SES children, the authors suggest, deployed supplementary resources to also attend to irrelevant information.","1198":"This study investigated prospective memory and its relationship to executive and memory functions in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-three individuals with PD and 25 healthy comparison participants participated in the study. In the prospective memory tasks, participants were asked to execute 3 actions after 20 min (time-based condition) or after a timer ring (event-based condition). A score was computed for the correct recall of the intention to perform the actions (prospective component) and for the correct execution of the actions (retrospective component). Participants with PD also received an extensive neuropsychological test battery. PD participants were less accurate than comparison participants in the prospective component of the time-based but not the event-based task. Individuals with PD were also impaired on the retrospective component of both tasks. In the PD group, a general trend toward significant correlations was found between performance level on the prospective memory component of the time-based task and scores on executive and working memory measures. These results document that prospective memory is impaired in PD possibly in relation to a dysregulation of cognitive functions associated with frontal systems.","1199":"A number of studies investigating trace eyeblink conditioning have found impaired, but not eliminated, acquisition of conditioned responses (CRs) in both animals and humans with hippocampal removal or damage. The underlying mechanism of this residual learning is unclear. The present study investigated whether the impaired level of learning is the product of residual hippocampal function or whether it is mediated by another memory system that has been shown to function normally in delay eyeblink conditioning. Performance of bilateral medial temporal lobe amnesic patients who had a prior history of participating in eyeblink conditioning studies was compared to a control group with a similar training history and to an untrained control group in a series of single cue trace conditioning tasks with 500 ms, 250 ms, and 0 ms trace intervals. Overall, patients acquired CRs to a level similar to the untrained controls, but were significantly impaired compared to the trained controls. The pattern of acquisition suggests that amnesic patients may be relying on the expression of previously acquired, likely cerebellar based, procedural memory representations in trace conditioning.","1200":"Guessing occurs on forced-choice (FC) tests for which responses cannot be based on relevant knowledge. Its importance is in inverse relation to the level of knowledge being measured, so that it becomes an increasing component of test scores as the level of knowledge decreases. It is also used as a benchmark to detect simulated impairment. This investigation examined the role of guessing in a 2-alternative FC face recognition test. Chance groups shown only the test items were asked to guess which were the targets, to measure the variation in scores likely to be found with pure guessing. Controls performed normally, and two simulation groups tried to fake amnesia. Results suggested that simple guessing in the chance group produced variable scores that overlapped both low genuine and \"malingering\" performance. Low control scores were hidden by the guessing \"chance bonus,\" which ameliorated the apparent level of decline in memory. Simulators told of their role at the outset (before presentation of the target items) produced more convincing \"amnesic\" scores than those told only just before the test, who produced the expected below-chance level of score. It is suggested that guessing variability should be taken into account in interpreting FC scores.","1201":"Memory deficits have been reported in several neuropsychological studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Dysfunction in nonverbal memory has been consistently reported, whereas findings on verbal memory are more heterogeneous. The authors studied 50 patients with OCD who were matched for sex, age, educational level, and hand dominance with 50 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive performance in both groups was assessed on verbal and nonverbal memory tasks, and several clinical variables were also assessed in the patient group. Patients with OCD showed a pattern of cognitive dysfunction with alterations in areas of nonverbal memory (recall and recognition), and verbal memory (learning and recall). Older age at onset of OCD was associated with poorer performance on verbal memory tasks. Low scores on some verbal memory tasks were associated with severity of OCD, and nonverbal memory was influenced by depressive symptoms. The study suggests the existence of dysfunction in the execution of verbal and nonverbal memory tasks in OCD; the influence of clinical variables depends on the specific neuropsychological function.","1202":"Verbal memory is known to be affected by word features. Concrete words are remembered better than abstract words (concreteness effect), presumably due to the concurrent activation of image-based and\/or semantic associations. Vivid remembering during recognition (recollection) has been linked to the hippocampus and is thought to be more affected by healthy aging than familiarity-based recognition. Recent evidence also implicated the hippocampus in the processing of concrete words. Based on these observations, we hypothesized age-related changes in recollection to affect concrete words more than abstract words. This prediction was tested in a cross-sectional design with three consecutive age groups (mean ages 21 years, 42 years, and 61 years). Changes in recollection, but not familiarity, across ages were significantly modulated by word concreteness. Recollection of concrete words showed a steady decline across age, while recollection of abstract words decreased only from young to middle age, leading to a reduced concreteness effect in the oldest group. These findings are consistent with the idea that changes in hippocampally mediated recollective processes during aging affect concrete words more than abstract words.","1203":"Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects underwent both neuropsychological evaluation and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, during which the cingulum bundle (CB) and the uncinate fasciculus (UF) were defined with fiber tractography and their integrity was quantified. On the basis of prior findings, it was hypothesized that neuropsychological disturbance in schizophrenia may be characterized, in part, by 2 dissociable functional neuroanatomical relationships: (a) executive functioning-CB integrity and (b) episodic memory-UF integrity. In support of the hypothesis, hierarchical regression results indicated that reduced white matter of the CB and the UF differentially and specifically predicted deficits in executive functioning and memory, respectively. Neuropsychological correlates of the CB also extended to lower generalized intelligence, as well as to reduced visual memory that may be related to failures of contextual monitoring of to-be-remembered scenes. Reduced white matter of the CB and the UF may each make distinct contributions to neuropsychological disturbance in schizophrenia.","1204":"Relative to our understanding of the memory and language deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about problems with everyday action performance (i.e., meal preparation, grooming). The resource theory proposes that everyday action problems are best explained by a unitary deficit in general cognitive resources. However, recent research suggests that omission and commission errors may reflect dissociable aspects of action impairment, with only omissions associated with resource limitations. This study examined everyday action performance in 70 participants with AD who also underwent a neuropsychological evaluation. First, correlation and principal component analyses were performed to examine the construct(s) that might explain everyday action impairment. Second, relations between everyday task component(s) and neuropsychological tests were examined by using correlation and regression analyses. Third, differences in everyday action error patterns were examined among participants of comparable overall impairment levels. Results showed omission and commission errors were uncorrelated and distinct components of everyday action performance, predicted by different neuropsychological tests, and differentially distributed even among participants with comparable overall impairment.","1205":"Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is a neurogenetic disorder associated with very high risk for developing schizophrenia. More than half of affected individuals experience transient psychotic symptoms during childhood and a third may develop schizophrenia. Memory regulation deficits disturbing both the encoding and retrieval stages of memory represent core deficits in the cognitive profile associated with schizophrenia. In this study, the authors investigate memory regulation processes in 33 individuals with VCFS along with 33 age- and sex-matched control participants. By using a directed forgetting paradigm and a continuous recognition paradigm, the authors examined selective encoding and suppression of irrelevant contents during retrieval in VCFS. Group comparison analyses revealed comparable performances on selective encoding and recognition accuracy between the VCFS group and control group. However, individuals with VCFS were more likely to make false recognitions and showed deficits in the suppression of irrelevant contents. Results suggest that trait-like deficits of memory regulation in VCFS can be observed during the retrieval stage, while selective encoding remains efficient. Memory regulation processes during retrieval may constitute a trait deficit in the memory profile of individuals with VCFS and may contribute to the cognitive deficits underlying an increased risk for developing schizophrenia in this population.","1206":"Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by poor attention to detail, poor attention maintenance, and variability throughout task performance. The authors used a quantitative trait loci approach to assess the association between the dopamine transporter (DAT1) high-risk genotype, cognitive performance (visual search and vigilance), and ADHD symptoms in a community sample of boys 6-11 years of age. The potential confounding effects of IQ and chronological age were also investigated. Results demonstrate that accuracy in target detection, not speed, distinguishes poor attenders from good attenders. The authors speculate that the measure of performance (e.g., time and false alarms) may be critical in detecting attentional weaknesses. In contrast, DAT1 gene, known to be associated with the behavioral symptoms of ADHD, was unrelated to visual search or vigilance performance, although it was related to ADHD symptoms.","1207":"The present study employed a combined semantic judgment and lexical decision priming paradigm to examine the impact of working memory on the inhibitory processes of lexical ambiguity resolution. The results indicated that overall, participants activated one meaning of a presented homograph while not priming the alternative meaning. As hypothesized, participants with high working-memory spans exhibited a pattern of priming for congruent conditions and a lack of positive priming for incongruent conditions. In contrast, participants with low working-memory capacity showed priming for both congruent and incongruent conditions, but only for conditions in which the context was related to the dominant meaning of the homograph. The results suggest that people with low working-memory capacity have difficulty inhibiting inappropriate homograph meanings and further demonstrate that these difficulties may vary as a function of context-meaning dominance.","1208":"Evidence has shown that alcoholism leads to volume reductions in brain regions critical for associative learning using the eyeblink classical conditioning paradigm (EBCC). Evidence indicates that cerebellar shrinkage causes impairment in simple forms of EBCC, whereas changes in forebrain structures result in impairment in more complex tasks. In this study, the ability of abstinent alcoholics and matched control participants to acquire learned responses during delay discrimination and discrimination reversal was examined and related to severity of drinking history and neuropsychological performance. During discrimination learning, one tone (CS+) predicted the occurrence of an airpuff (unconditioned stimulus), and another tone (CS-) served as a neutral stimulus; then the significance of the tones was reversed. Alcoholics who learned the initial discrimination were impaired in acquiring the new CS+ after the tones reversed; this is a function that has previously been linked to forebrain structures. It is suggested that a factor important to alcoholic addiction may be the presence of alcoholic-related associative responses that interfere with the ability to learn new more adaptive associations.","1209":"Previous research has demonstrated impairment in comprehension of emotional prosody in individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present pilot study further explored the prosodic processing impairment in AD, aiming to extend our knowledge to encompass both grammatical and emotional prosody processing. As expected, impairments were seen in emotional prosody. AD individuals were also found to be impaired in detecting sentence modality, suggesting that impairments in affective prosody processing in AD may be ascribed to a more general prosodic processing impairment, specifically in comprehending prosodic information signaled across the sentence level. AD participants were at a very mild stage of the disease, suggesting that prosody impairments occur early in the disease course.","1210":"Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms of the memory impairment associated with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We explored recollection and familiarity in 27 healthy young adults, 45 healthy older adults, and 17 individuals with aMCI. Relative to the younger adults, recollection was reduced in the older adults, especially among those with aMCI. Familiarity did not differ among groups. In the healthy younger and older adults, better performance on a set of clinical memory measures that are sensitive to medial temporal lobe functioning was associated with greater recollection. In addition, among the healthy older adults better executive functioning was also associated with greater recollection. These results are consistent with the notion that recollection is a product of strategic processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex that suppport the retrieval of context-dependent memories from the hippocampus. Hippocampal atrophy associated with aMCI may disrupt this brain network, and thereby interfere with recollection.","1211":"Recent evidence has shown that inhibition of return, IOR, is impaired in patients with parietal damage with or without clinical signs of neglect (Bartolomeo, Sieroff, Decaix, &amp; Chokron, 2001; Vivas, Humphreys, &amp; Fuentes, 2003, respectively). In addition to environment-based IOR, Tipper et al. (1991) showed that IOR could be also associated with dynamic, object-based representations. In our study, we examined four patients with unilateral lesions to the parietal lobe, and a group of healthy controls, in an IOR procedure with moving objects where a pre-cued object could move, clockwise or counterclockwise, 90 degrees in polar coordinates. The group of control participants showed a small but significant object-based IOR effect. In contrast, the patients showed an object-based IOR effect when the objects moved from the contralesional field toward the ipsilesional field, whereas there was no IOR effect when they moved from the ipsilesional to the contralesional field. These findings are discussed in terms of the role of the parietal cortex in implementing attentional biases in both environment-based (Vivas et al., 2003) and object-based frames of reference.","1212":"Identifying cognitive deficits associated with pediatric brain tumors and their treatment is important in delineating the mechanisms of intellectual decline often associated with these diseases. The authors evaluated sustained attention, information processing speed, working memory, and IQ in 64 patients with posterior fossa tumors, including those treated with either: (a) surgery and cranial radiation (n = 32), and (b) surgery without radiation (n = 32). Ten patients treated for non-CNS solid tumors were included as a comparison group. The authors also examined the impact of relevant demographic and medical variables on neurocognitive outcome. The authors found that neither age at, nor time since, diagnosis predicted cognitive outcome in this sample. Further, sustained attention and working memory were largely intact and there were no differences between groups. Patients treated with cranial radiation demonstrated lowered short-form IQ and slow information processing speed: Patients treated with cranial radiation and who experienced postsurgical complications demonstrated the poorest performance. The authors consider information processing speed to be an excellent candidate mechanism in understanding the impact of cranial radiation on intellectual outcome.","1213":"In previous work, the authors found that an anatomical risk index created from the combination of 7 neuroanatomical measures predicted reading and oral language skills in individuals with learning disabilities. Individuals with small auditory brain structures and reduced asymmetry had more deficits than those with large structures and exaggerated asymmetry. In the present study, the same anatomical index predicted reading and other cognitive abilities in 45 individuals with chronic schizophrenia. The anatomical risk index was significantly associated with broad cognitive ability (Pearson r = .53, p &lt; .0001), reading comprehension (r = .58, p &lt; .0001), and a measure of nonverbal reasoning (r = .39, p &lt; .01), but not with age, parental socioeconomic status, symptom measures, alcohol use, or processing speed. These findings support the prediction that reduced size and asymmetry in temporal lobe auditory cortex and cerebellum may not be specific risk factors for schizophrenia but for cognitive deficits that characterize a broad spectrum of developmental disorders.","1214":"Two experiments are reported that investigate the effects of saccadic bilateral eye movements on the retrieval of item, associative, and contextual information. Experiment 1 compared the effects of bilateral versus vertical versus no eye movements on tests of item recognition, followed by remember-know responses and associative recognition. Supporting previous research, bilateral eye movements enhanced item recognition by increasing the hit rate and decreasing the false alarm rate. Analysis of remember-know responses indicated that eye movement effects were accompanied by increases in remember responses. The test of associative recognition found that bilateral eye movements increased correct responses to intact pairs and decreased false alarms to rearranged pairs. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of eye movements on the recall of intrinsic (color) and extrinsic (spatial location) context. Bilateral eye movements increased correct recall for both types of context. The results are discussed within the framework of dual-process models of memory and the possible neural underpinnings of these effects are considered.","1215":"The relationships between the anterior-posterior and left-right regions of the brain have been characterized as mutually inhibitory. Whereas the left hemisphere attends to right proximal hemispace and is associated with positive emotions, the right hemisphere attends to left distal hemispace and is associated with negative emotions. Because of the excitatory and inhibitory influences between the left and right frontal and posterior regions of the brain, the expression of emotion will result in an ipsilateral attentional bias. Given these functional systems, we hypothesized that positive emotions would be associated with a bias for left distal hemispace and negative emotions would be associated with a bias for right proximal hemispace. We tested these hypotheses by having 138 undergraduate students place emotionally labeled pegs on a large board. Our results indicated that the positively labeled pegs were placed in left distal hemispace and the relative placement of negatively labeled pegs was rightward and proximally. Whereas numerous research investigations have examined how attention is biased for emotional stimuli, ours is the first investigation to provide evidence that emotions can bias attentional allocation.","1216":"This study is an investigation of the moderating effect of cognitive schema on the relationship between stress and depression in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the study, the authors employed a performance-based measure of affective memory bias and a self-report measure of everyday stress to assess both direct and interactive effects of cognitive schema and stress on depression in individuals with MS. The specific hypotheses were that high stress would be more highly associated with depression if an individual also demonstrated a bias for negative information, but that a bias for positive information may buffer against the effects of stress on depression. Results supported the hypotheses, demonstrating a significant effect of the interaction and differential effects of stress based on the direction of memory bias. Implications for understanding depression in MS are discussed, as well as dominant theories of adult depression in the general population. The results are also discussed as a potential contradiction to A. T. Beck's (1967, 1976) developmental hypothesis of cognitive schemas.","1217":"HIV infection is associated with impairments in prospective memory (ProM), an aspect of episodic memory that refers to the ability to execute a future intention, such as remembering to take a medication at a specific time. The current study sought to examine the relationship between HIV-associated ProM impairment and the successful management of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). In a cohort of 66 HIV-infected individuals, ProM accounted for a significant proportion of variance in self-reported IADL dependence, over and above that which was explained by retrospective memory and by current affective distress. Analysis of component cognitive processes revealed that the relationship between HIV-associated ProM deficits and IADL dependence was driven by impaired cue detection and by deficits in self-initiated intention retrieval. Results were not better explained by demographic factors, HIV disease severity, psychiatric comorbidity, or substance use. Collectively, these data support the potential incremental ecological validity of ProM as a predictor of dependence in IADLs among persons living with HIV infection.","1218":"It has been suggested that patients with schizophrenia have corticostriatal circuit dysfunction (Carlsson &amp; Carlsson, 1990). Skill learning is thought to rely on corticostriatal circuitry and different types of skill learning may be related to separable corticostriatal loops (Grafton, Hazeltine, &amp; Ivry, 1995; Poldrack, Prabhakaran, Seger, &amp; Gabrieli, 1999). The authors examined motor (Serial Reaction Time task, SRT) and cognitive (Probabilistic Classification task, PCT) skill learning in patients with schizophrenia and normal controls. Development of automaticity was examined, using a dual task paradigm, across three training sessions. Patients with schizophrenia were impaired at learning on the PCT compared to controls. Performance gains of controls occurred within the first session, whereas patients only improved gradually and never reached the performance level of controls. In contrast, patients were not impaired at learning on the SRT relative to controls, suggesting that patients with schizophrenia may have dysfunction in a specific corticostriatal subcircuit.","1219":"Most of human cognitive activity involves, to a greater or lesser extent, the integration of information from different modalities, a process also referred to as 'binding'. Although the neural basis of several forms of binding has been extensively investigated, the neurobiological mechanisms of the encoding phase of integration of words and their spatial location have not been previously investigated. This process is at the core of what Baddeley proposed in his revised model as episodic buffer. In the current experiment, the authors used magnetoencephalography to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity related to encoding words, locations, and the integration of both types of information using a working memory paradigm. The spatiotemporal analysis showed a preferential activation of superior parietal lobe (SPL) during the integration of information, which was modulated by performance in the task. These findings are in agreement with proposals suggesting that SPL participates in binding processes by encoding and maintaining a detailed, complex integrated representation in working memory (WM). Considering Baddeley's episodic buffer, it appears that the same mechanisms involved in integrating information within one subsystem (i.e., visuospatial buffer) also support the integration of information between previously considered independent subsystems (i.e., verbal and visuospatial buffers).","1220":"In this study, the authors aimed to examine 4 domains of executive functioning in adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--namely interference control, concept shifting, verbal fluency, and verbal working memory. Four groups of participants were included: (a) adults diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD-super(-); n = 20), (b) adults diagnosed with both ADHD and 1 or more comorbid disorder(s) (ADHD-super(+); n = 22), (c) adults referred for ADHD because of ADHD symptomatology but not diagnosed as such (non-ADHD; n = 34), and (d) healthy controls (n = 136). ADHD-related deficits (independent of comorbidity) were revealed for concept shifting and verbal working memory. In addition, the ADHD-super(+) and non-ADHD groups displayed deficits in terms of general processing speed. Given that these deficits were not found in the ADHD-super(-) group, the authors contend that these deficits are likely attributable to comorbidity rather than ADHD itself. Contrary to the authors' expectations, these findings do not correspond with the cognitive subtype hypothesis.","1221":"Selective deficits in visuospatial processing are present early in development among children with perinatal focal brain lesions (PL). Children with right hemisphere PL (RPL) are impaired in configural processing, while children with left hemisphere PL (LPL) are impaired in featural processing. Deficits associated with LPL are less pervasive than those observed with RPL, but this difference may reflect the structure of the tasks used for assessment. Many of the tasks used to date may place greater demands on configural processing, thus highlighting this deficit in the RPL group. This study employed a task designed to place comparable demands on configural and featural processing, providing the opportunity to obtain within-task evidence of differential deficit. Sixty-two 5- to 14-year-old children (19 RPL, 19 LPL, and 24 matched controls) reproduced from memory a series of hierarchical forms (large forms composed of small forms). Global- and local-level reproduction accuracy was scored. Controls were equally accurate on global- and local-level reproduction. Children with RPL were selectively impaired on global accuracy, and children with LPL on local accuracy, thus documenting a double dissociation in global-local processing.","1222":"Fragile X-associated tremor\/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) develops in a subset of fragile X premutation carriers and involves gait ataxia, action tremor, Parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic disorders, and cognitive impairment. The study was designed to define the nature of cognitive deficits affecting male premutation carriers with and without FXTAS. A sample of 109 men underwent motor, cognitive, genetic, and neurologic testing, as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were classified into 3 groups: (a) asymptomatic premutation carriers, (b) premutation carriers with FXTAS, and (c) normal controls. Men with FXTAS performed worse than controls on mental status, intelligence, executive cognitive functioning (ECF), working memory, remote recall of information, declarative learning and memory, information processing speed, and temporal sequencing, as well as 1 measure of visuospatial functioning. Language and verbal comprehension were spared. Asymptomatic carriers performed worse than controls on ECF and declarative learning and memory. This comprehensive examination of cognitive impairment in male premutation carriers suggests that FXTAS involves substantial executive impairment and diffuse deficits in other cognitive functions. Longitudinal research currently underway will provide insight into the progression of the disorder.","1223":"The performance of 54 boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS), ages 7 to 13 years, was compared to that of a group of typically developing boys who were matched on mental age (MA) and ethnicity across multiple measures of executive function (EF). Boys with FXS varied in their ability to complete EF measures, with only 25.9% being able to complete a set-shifting task and 94.4% being able to complete a memory for word span task. When compared to the control group, and controlling for MA and maternal education, boys with FXS showed significant deficits in inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility\/set-shifting, and planning. No group differences were observed in processing speed. Mental age significantly impacted performance on working memory, set-shifting, planning, and processing speed tasks for both groups. In boys with FXS, MA significantly predicted performance on working memory and set-shifting tasks. Our findings suggest that deficits in EF in boys with FXS are not solely attributable to developmental delays but, rather, present as a true array of neurocognitive deficits.","1224":"This article compares lexical and grammatical abilities of a mental-age-matched sample of Italian preschoolers with Down syndrome (DS), specific language impairment (SLI), or typical development. Results showed that the children with DS or with SLI performed significantly worse than did the typically developing children. Although no significant differences emerged in lexical abilities and morphosyntactic comprehension abilities between the children with DS or with SLI, significant differences did emerge in morphosyntactic production capacities. Qualitative analysis of the morphosyntactic errors revealed strong similarities between the two groups. The results are discussed in terms of the role of verbal memory abilities and the linguistic features of Italian.","1225":"Early neuropsychological deficits associated with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been characterized as memory deficits and impaired executive function or attention. The functional impact of early impairment was investigated by evaluating performance of everyday actions in older adults with mild AD (n = 15) as compared with healthy age-matched controls (n = 16). Everyday actions were familiar activities, for example, making a cup of tea, but were varied in complexity (simple, complex) and were performed under varied attention demand (single task, dual task). Although both participant groups responded to increasing task complexity by making more errors, the AD group made more errors under dual-task conditions regardless of the complexity of the task. Furthermore, a task requiring strategic retrieval of semantic information from long-term memory and manipulation of attention online (category fluency) was able to account for a large proportion of the group-related variance in everyday task performance. Results are discussed in relation to the role of components of working memory in performance of everyday actions in mild AD.","1226":"The earliest neuroanatomical changes in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) involve the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, structures implicated in the integration and learning of associative information. The authors hypothesized that individuals with aMCI would have impairments in associative memory above and beyond the known impairments in item memory. A group of 29 individuals with aMCI and 30 matched control participants were administered standardized tests of object-location recall and symbol-symbol recall, from which both item and associative recall scores were derived. As expected, item recall was impaired in the aMCI group relative to controls. Associative recall in the aMCI group was even more impaired than was item recall. The best group discriminators were measures of associative recall, with which the sensitivity and specificity for detecting aMCI were 76% and 90% for symbol-symbol recall and were 86% and 97% for object-location recall. Associative recall may be particularly sensitive to early cognitive change in aMCI, because this ability relies heavily on the medial temporal lobe structures that are affected earliest in aMCI. Incorporating measures of associative recall into clinical evaluations of individuals with memory change may be useful for detecting aMCI.","1227":"Absolute differences in global brain volume predict differences in cognitive ability among healthy older adults. However, absolute differences confound lifelong differences in brain size with amounts of age-related shrinkage. Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume were made to estimate age-related shrinkage in 93 healthy volunteers aged 63 to 86 years. Their current levels of brain shrinkage predicted their amounts of decline over the previous 8 to 20 years on repeated assessments during a longitudinal study on the Cattell \"Culture Fair\" Intelligence Test, on two tests of information processing speed, and marginally on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (D. Wechsler, 1981), but not on three memory tests. Loss of brain volume is an effective marker both for current cognitive status and for amounts and rates of previous age-related cognitive losses.","1228":"Individuals with semantic dementia (SD; n=12) or Alzheimer's disease (AD; n=20) and healthy volunteers (n=40) were tested on tasks probing attribute rather than associative knowledge of animals and objects in the visual and verbal domains. The tasks were within modality, in that they probed knowledge in a single presentation modality (pictures or written words) and did not require cross-modal matching. Participants were required to make the same simple judgment about triads of animal stimuli (\"Which is the largest and smallest?\") and object stimuli (\"Which is the heaviest and lightest?\"). Control participants scored at ceiling on this simple task. Overall, the SD patients were significantly more impaired on this task than were the AD patients, who in turn were significantly more impaired than the controls. There was a strong trend for SD but not AD patients to show worse performance with verbal than visual material. However, no significant effects of category were found in either patient group. The Size\/Weight Attribute Test has the potential to assess modality-specific deficits of semantic knowledge.","1229":"This investigation examined the effect of concussion on intraindividual variability in 5 processing speed tasks. Forty-four adults, including 22 concussed and 22 healthy age- and gender-matched participants, completed the Headminder Concussion Resolution Index (D. M. Erlanger, D. J. Feldman, K. C. Kutner,&amp; M. McCrea, 2001) twice. The test consists of a series of tasks including 25 trials of simple response time task, 70 trials of cued response time task (CuRT), 60 trials each for 2 visual recognition tasks, and 30 trials of symbol scanning task. Concussed participants completed a preinjury baseline assessment and were retested within 48 hours of injury diagnosis. The nonconcussed participants were retested 45 days after initial assessment. Average response time (RT), standard deviation, and response accuracy were calculated for each individual. Overall, concussed individuals had increased RTs across all tasks and were less accurate in the CuRT. RT variability for all tasks was elevated in concussed individuals, but controlling for mean RT at follow-up eliminated group differences. These findings indicate that response-time-variability increases in concussed individuals are proportional to processing-time increases. As such, RT variability is not a unique identifier of cognitive dysfunction following concussion. These results highlight that transient brain injury has significantly different neurobiological consequences than chronic conditions have.","1230":"The current investigation examined changes in working memory (WM) component processes following total sleep deprivation (TSD) in a sample of healthy young persons. Forty subjects were administered a verbal form of a continuous recognition test (CRT) before and after 42 hr of TSD. Parameters of a computational model of the CRT reflecting attention, WM span, and rate of episodic memory encoding were estimated for each individual. Subjects made more errors on the test following sleep deprivation. Analysis of model parameters revealed statistically independent declines in both the attention and WM span parameters, with a larger effect observed for the decline in WM span. Examination of individual profiles suggested that the effects of TSD on verbal WM component processes vary from person to person. Declines in global verbal WM functioning appear to be primarily driven by reduced WM span and attention; however, these effects may be individual-specific. Further applications of the computational model for examining WM component processes with sleep deprivation and other clinical populations are discussed.","1231":"Individuals with alcoholism exhibit poor decision making as reflected by their continued alcohol use despite encountering problems and by low performance in laboratory tasks of decision making. Here, the authors investigated the relative contribution of several distinct processes of executive functions in performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; A. Bechara, A. R. Damasio, H. Damasio, &amp; S. W. Anderson, 1994) in recently detoxified individuals with alcoholism. Compared to matched healthy participants, individuals with alcoholism showed below-normal scores in the last 20 trials of the IGT as well as on other tasks of executive functions, specifically those assessing the capacity to manipulate information stored in working memory, detect abstract rules, or inhibit prepotent responses. Prepotent response inhibition best predicted performance in the late trials of the IGT, that is, when participants have likely acquired knowledge about the reward\/punishment contingencies of the task. These results underline the important role that response inhibition plays in decision making, especially in risky situations, when knowledge of the probability of a given outcome becomes available (i.e. decisions under risk).","1232":"Twenty-seven schizophrenia spectrum patients and 25 healthy controls performed a probabilistic version of the serial reaction time task (SRT) that included sequence trials embedded within random trials. Patients showed diminished, yet measurable, sequence learning. Postexperimental analyses revealed that a group of patients performed above chance when generating short spans of the sequence. This high-generation group showed SRT learning that was similar in magnitude to that of controls. Their learning was evident from the very 1st block; however, unlike controls, learning did not develop further with continued testing. A subset of 12 patients and 11 controls performed the SRT in conjunction with positron emission tomography. High-generation performance, which corresponded to SRT learning in patients, correlated to activity in the premotor cortex and parahippocampus. These areas have been associated with stimulus-driven visuospatial processing. Taken together, these results suggest that a subset of patients who showed moderate success on the SRT used an explicit stimulus-driven strategy to process the sequential stimuli. This adaptive strategy facilitated sequence learning but may have interfered with conventional implicit learning of the overall stimulus pattern.","1233":"This study examined familiality of attentional control and mental flexibility in multiplex attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) families. The authors hypothesized that siblings of ADHD probands, although not behaviorally expressing ADHD, have deficits in these executive functions and that the performance of probands, unaffected siblings, and control participants are on a continuum. Participants (aged 6 to 17) were 25 ADHD probands with a family history of ADHD, their 25 unaffected siblings, and 48 control participants. The unaffected siblings did not differ from the ADHD probands on attentional control or on some measures of mental flexibility. Linear changes in performance across the groups reflected an intermediate position of the unaffected siblings between the probands and control participants. These results suggest that these executive functions may be suitable endophenotypes of ADHD.","1234":"In addition to the core psychopathology of bulimia nervosa (BN), patients with BN often show impulsive behavior that has been related to decision making deficits in other patient groups, such as individuals with anorexia nervosa and pathological gamblers. However, it remains unclear whether BN patients also show difficulties in decision making. In this study, 14 patients with BN and 14 healthy comparison subjects, matched for age, gender, education, body mass index, and intelligence, were examined with the Game of Dice Task (M. Brand, E. Fujiwara, et al., 2005), a gambling task that has fixed winning probabilities and explicit rules for gains and losses, as well as with a neuropsychological test battery and personality questionnaires. On the task, the patients with BN chose the disadvantageous alternatives more frequently than did the comparison subjects. Performance on the Game of Dice Task was related to executive functioning but not to other neuropsychological functions, personality, or disease-specific variables in the BN group. Thus, in patients with BN, decision making abnormalities and executive reductions can be demonstrated and might be neuropsychological correlates of the patients' dysfunctional everyday-life decision making behavior. Neurocognitive functions should be considered in the treatment of BN.","1235":"Children without dyslexia (n=10) received nonphonological treatment, and those with dyslexia received phonological (n=11) or nonphonological (n=9) treatment. Before and after treatment they performed aural repeat, visual decode, and aural match pseudoword tasks during functional MRI scanning that separated stimulus input from response production. Group map analysis indicated that children with dyslexia overactivated compared with good readers during the aural-repeat\/aural-match contrast in bilateral frontal (Brodmann's area [BA] 3, 4, 5, 6, 9), left parietal (BA 2, 3), left temporal (BA 38), and right temporal (BA 20, 21, 37) regions (stimulus input) and underactivated in right frontal (BA 24, 32) and right insula (BA 48) regions (response production); they underactivated in BA 19\/V5 during the visual-decode\/aural-match contrast (response production). Individual brain analysis for children with dyslexia revealed that during the aural-repeat\/aural-match contrast (stimulus input), phonological treatment decreased and normalized activation in left supramarginal gyrus and postcentral gyrus. Nonphonological treatment increased and normalized activation during the visual-decode\/aural-match contrast (response production) in BA19\/V5 and changed activation in the same direction as good readers during aural-repeat\/aural-match contrast (stimulus input) in left postcentral gyrus. The significance of the findings for competing theories of dyslexia is discussed.","1236":"Lateralized displays are used widely to investigate hemispheric asymmetry in language perception. However, few studies have used lateralized displays to investigate hemispheric asymmetry in visual speech perception, and those that have yielded mixed results. This issue was investigated in the current study by presenting visual speech to either the left hemisphere (LH) or the right hemisphere (RH) using the face as recorded (normal), a mirror image of the normal face (reversed), and chimeric displays constructed by duplicating and reversing just one hemiface (left or right) to form symmetrical images (left-duplicated, right-duplicated). The projection of displays to each hemisphere was controlled precisely by an automated eye-tracking technique. Visual speech perception showed the same, clear LH advantage for normal and reversed displays, a greater LH advantage for right-duplicated displays, and no hemispheric difference for left-duplicated displays. Of particular note is that perception of LH displays was affected greatly by the presence of right-hemiface information, whereas perception of RH displays was unaffected by changes in hemiface content. Thus, when investigated under precise viewing conditions, the indications are not only that the dominant processes of visual speech perception are located in the LH but that these processes are uniquely sensitive to right-hemiface information.","1237":"Hemispheric involvement in reasoning abilities has been debated for some time, and it remains unclear whether the right hemisphere's involvement in problem solving is modality specific or dependent on the type of spatial reasoning required. In the current study, 2 types of nonverbal reasoning abilities were examined, spatial reasoning and proportional reasoning, in 109 patients with cerebrovascular disease that was confined to either the right or the left hemisphere or was diffuse in nature. Results indicated that no lateralizing effects were present based on type of spatial reasoning. Findings are consistent with the suggestion that higher order cognitive processes involved in nonverbal abstraction and problem solving are not strongly lateralized to the right hemisphere but rather are more generally distributed throughout the cortex.","1238":"This study examined whether the cognitive profile of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with vascular disease differs from that of MCI subjects with no vascular disease. Consecutive MCI subjects with vascular disease (n=60) and matched MCI subjects with no vascular disease (n=60) were included in the study and were compared with healthy control subjects (n=60). The neuropsychological assessment comprised tests of speed and attention, episodic memory, visuospatial function, language, and executive function. Control subjects performed significantly better than did both MCI groups on the neuropsychological battery. MCI subjects with no vascular disease performed better overall than did MCI subjects with vascular disease, most clearly on tests of speed and attention, visuospatial function, and executive function. MCI subjects with and without vascular disease exhibited differences, both in terms of overall performance and of cognitive profiles. These differences can be largely explained by deficits in speed and attention and in executive function of the MCI subjects with vascular disease.","1239":"Previous research suggests that patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit cognitive impairment in the years preceding a clinical diagnosis. Memory impairments are particularly pronounced, but the relative degree to which other cognitive functions are impaired and the speed with which they decline during the preclinical years remains unclear. The authors report a detailed neuropsychological evaluation of 11 patients over the course of 3 years up to and including the 1st year of nonnormal diagnosis. The results suggest that performance falls off rapidly in all areas of cognitive functioning but that abilities thought to be subserved by the medial and lateral temporal lobes (episodic and semantic memory, respectively) appear to be substantially more impaired than those abilities thought to be subserved by the frontal lobes.","1240":"Brain images were obtained from 133 healthy people of ages 61-85 years who completed 20 tests of information processing speed, intelligence, frontal and executive function, memory, and vocabulary. Structural equation models examined relationships between cognitive test scores, ages and measurements of global age-associated atrophy, white matter lesions, and cerebral blood flow. These neurophysiological measures jointly account for all age-related variance in information processing speed. Speed entirely mediated relationships between neurophysiological measures and memory and partly mediated relationships between neurophysiological measures and intelligence and frontal function. Neurophysiological measures, but not calendar age, accounted for vocabulary scores. Cognitive slowing was responsible for some, but not all, age-related declines in mental function. Age-related declines in intelligence, frontal function, and speed were due to changes in different functional systems.","1241":"In this commentary on P. M. Greenwood's Functional Plasticity in Cognitive Aging: Review and hypothesis ( 2007), the author raises a number of questions stimulated by the article. Although it may be premature to expect answers to those questions, the author argues that they ultimately need to be addressed and answered before Greenwood's speculations can be considered true hypotheses rather than a conceptual framework.","1242":"Brain aging is characterized by a complex pattern of decline and stability that includes differential regional shrinkage as well as redistribution of functional activation and deactivation. Many have noticed an apparent paradox of age-related increase in activation of structures that undergo the greatest structural deterioration. P. M. Greenwood proposes a theoretical framework for explaining that paradox by postulating plastic compensatory remodeling in the aging brain. This is a worthy first step, although several problems in formulating a testable set of hypotheses remain to be addressed. The working definition of plasticity that is driving this theory needs to be clarified. The biological basis, strength, and replicability of structure-function relationships derived from neuroimaging, on which Greenwood relies in her theorizing, remain to be established. The extrapolation of plasticity phenomena observed in acute lesions to gradual aging process needs to be justified. All in all, this is a positive development in the field that may be ripe for theoretical generalizations.","1243":"Neuroimaging experiments have shown that prefrontal regions of the brain, which have the most age-related volume loss, are also the regions most likely to be more active in older adults than in younger adults. In an attempt to solve this puzzle, P. M. Greenwood has proposed a cascade that flows from age-related atrophy in the brain to changed processing strategies that result in plastic changes in regions adjacent and contralateral to the atrophic areas, culminating in greater functional activity. This hypothesis should stimulate research into these mechanisms and hopefully will ultimately inform researchers' ability to rehabilitate cognitive disorders in the elderly.","1244":"Cognitive aging reflects not only loss but also adaptation to loss. The adult brain is capable of plastic change, including change in cortical representation. This has been seen in association not only with frank lesions but also in healthy individuals as a function of experience and training. This review considers the potential for adult plasticity together with evidence of a relation in old age between regional cortical atrophy\/shrinkage and increased activation in neuroimaging. Those cortical regions shown most consistently to shrink in adulthood--prefrontal and parietal cortices--are the same regions showing increased regional activation in aging. Combining several strands of behavioral and neuroimaging evidence, the author argues that functional plasticity alters the course of cognitive aging. The author advances the hypothesis that losses in regional brain integrity drive functional reorganization through changes in processing strategy and makes specific predictions from that hypothesis.","1245":"The present study investigated the influence of attention and word-emotion congruency on auditory asymmetries with stimuli that include verbal and emotional components. Words were presented dichotically to 80 participants and were pronounced in either congruent or incongruent emotional tones. Participants were asked to identify the presence of a target word or emotion under 1 of 2 conditions. The blocked condition required detection of a word or emotional target in separate blocks. In the randomized condition, the target was changed across trials by means of a postcue. A right-ear advantage (REA) and a left-ear advantage (LEA) were found for word and emotion targets, respectively. However, the finding of a Condition x Stimulus Type x Ear x Congruency interaction indicated that in the randomized condition, a REA was obtained for words when the stimuli were congruent and a LEA was observed for emotions when the stimuli were incongruent. The findings suggest that randomizing the target reduced the influence of the attentional set established by blocking the target. It is likely that this promoted the detection of hemispheric interference in the randomized condition.","1246":"The impact of monetary reward on verbal working memory (vWM) and verbal long-term memory (vLTM) was evaluated in 50 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 52 matched healthy participants. This research was motivated by the observations that negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with reduced drive and that patients with these symptoms exhibit greater mnemonic impairments. Reward-related gains were evaluated across two levels of vWM load on the n-back task and across three aspects of vLTM derived from the California Verbal Learning Test-II (i.e., learning, total immediate recall, and retention). Although healthy individuals benefited from reward at a high vWM load level, schizophrenia patients exhibited no reward-related improvements in vWM. In contrast, improvement in vLTM retention was induced by reward for both patients and controls. Finally, symptomatic and pharmacology treatment factors were associated with reward-related gains in persons with schizophrenia. In conclusion, contingent monetary rewards delivered during vWM and vLTM enhanced specific aspects of memory. The influence was relatively small and dependent on the specific neurocognitive operation examined, the mental health status of the participants, and for patients, their particular symptoms and pharmacological treatments.","1247":"Probability matching is a nonoptimal strategy consisting of selecting each alternative in proportion to its reinforcement contingency. However, matching is related to hypothesis testing in an incidental, marginal, and methodologically disperse manner. Although some authors take it for granted, the relationship has not been demonstrated. Fifty-eight healthy participants performed a modified, bias-free probabilistic two-choice task, the Simple Prediction Task (SPT). Self-reported spurious rules were recorded and then graded by two independent judges. Participants who produced the most complex rules selected the probability matching strategy and were therefore less successful than those who did not produce rules. The close relationship between probability matching and rule generating makes SPT a complementary instrument for studying decision making, which might throw some light on the debate about irrationality. The importance of the reaction times, both before and after responding, is also discussed.","1248":"Regression equations have many useful roles in neuropsychological assessment. This article is based on the premise that there is a large reservoir of published data that could be used to build regression equations; these equations could then be used to test a wide variety of hypotheses concerning the functioning of individual cases. This resource is currently underused because (a) not all neuropsychologists are aware that equations can be built with only basic summary data for a sample and (b) the computations involved are tedious and prone to error. To overcome these barriers, the authors set out the steps required to build regression equations from sample summary statistics and the further steps required to compute the associated statistics for drawing inferences concerning an individual case. The authors also develop, describe, and make available computer programs that implement the methods. Although caveats attach to the use of the methods, these need to be balanced against pragmatic considerations and against the alternative of either entirely ignoring a pertinent data set or using it informally to provide a clinical \"guesstimate.\"","1249":"First-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia are at genetic risk for the illness and show deficits on high-load information-processing tasks. In a prior study of auditory working memory (WM) using functional MRI (fMRI), the authors demonstrated that adult relatives had significantly increased activation in the dorsomedial (DM) thalamus, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex (H. W. Thermenos et al., 2004). In this study, the authors extended this work using a parametric WM task designed for fMRI in an independent, unmedicated sample. Twelve nonpsychotic relatives of persons with schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls were administered multiple versions of an auditory continuous performance test during fMRI. Data were analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Compared with controls, relatives showed significantly greater task-elicited activation in the DM thalamus. When fMRI signal change was modeled as a function of increasing WM load, there was a significant Group x Load interaction, with relatives showing significantly greater task-elicited activation in the right DM thalamus compared with controls. Greater DM thalamic activation in the relatives remained significant when WM performance, vocabulary score, and education were controlled. This replication suggests that altered thalamic activation is a feature of neurobiological risk for schizophrenia.","1250":"Research suggests that individuals who are intoxicated at the time of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have worse cognitive outcome compared with those who are sober. Worse outcome in patients with day-of-injury intoxication might (a) be related to the increased magnitude of brain injury resulting from a variety of negative responses not present following TBI in nonintoxicated individuals, or (b) reflect the effect of pre-injury alcohol abuse that is prevalent in individuals intoxicated at the time of injury. Most studies in this area have focused on patients with moderate to severe TBIs, and on medium- to long-term neuropsychological outcome. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative contributions of day-of-injury intoxication versus pre-injury alcohol abuse on short-term cognitive recovery following mild TBI. Participants were 169 patients with uncomplicated mild TBIs who were assessed on 13 cognitive measures within 7 days postinjury. The prevalence of intoxication at the time of injury was 54.4%. The prevalence of possible pre-injury alcohol abuse was 46.2%. Overall, the results suggest that pre-injury alcohol abuse, compared with day-of-injury alcohol intoxication, had the most influence on short-term neuropsychological outcome from uncomplicated mild TBI. However, the influence of pre-injury alcohol abuse was considered small at best.","1251":"Planning ability was investigated in 26 patients diagnosed with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder in adulthood and in 27 control participants, with groups matched for age, predicted IQ, and social class. They were tested using the 3-dimensional computerized Tower of London Test (Morris, Ahmed, Syed, &amp; Toone, 1993; Morris, Rushe, Woodruffe, &amp; Murray, 1995), which measures planning latencies as well as accuracy, with problems increasing in graded difficulty. For the control group, planning latencies increased systematically with task difficulty, with the participants slowing their initial responses to ensure accuracy. For those with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, there was no increase in planning time and a corresponding diminution in accuracy on the most difficult problems. This pattern of impairment is interpreted as resulting from failure to inhibit responses when confronted with problem solving, leading to reduced planning activity.","1252":"Genetic and environmental influences on cognitive components of reading span in 345 middle-aged male twin pairs were examined. Shared variance among word recognition (reading only), digits forward (short-term memory only), and reading span (concurrent reading plus memory) was almost entirely mediated by common genetic influences. Overall heritability was .52 for word recognition, .27 for digits forward, and .51 for reading span. All of the genetic influences on word recognition and digits forward, but only about one-half of the genetic influences on reading span, came from a common latent phenotype. The genetic influences that were specific to reading span were concluded to most likely reflect an executive function component. Implications for genetic studies of aging and prefrontal brain function are discussed.","1253":"This study explored the relationship between episodic memory and anosognosia (a lack of deficit awareness) among patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants studied words and pictures for subsequent memory tests. Healthy older adults made fewer false recognition errors when trying to remember pictures compared with words, suggesting that the perceptual distinctiveness of picture memories enhanced retrieval monitoring (the distinctiveness heuristic). In contrast, although participants with AD could discriminate between studied and nonstudied items, they had difficulty recollecting the specific presentation formats (words or pictures), and they had limited use of the distinctiveness heuristic. Critically, the demands of the memory test modulated the relationship between memory accuracy and anosognosia. Greater anosognosia was associated with impaired memory accuracy when participants with AD tried to remember words but not when they tried to remember pictures. These data further delineate the retrieval monitoring difficulties among individuals with AD and suggest that anosognosia measures are most likely to correlate with memory tests that require the effortful retrieval of nondistinctive information.","1254":"Episodic long-term, short-term, and implicit memory were investigated in 79 elderly subjects who fulfilled criteria for the amnestic form of mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI; i.e., by having an idiopathic amnestic disorder with absence of impairment in cognitive areas other than memory and without confounding medical or psychiatric conditions) and who developed Alzheimer's disease (AD) after 2 years as well as in 111 subjects affected by a-MCI who did not develop dementia. Results document a memory profile in a-MCI subjects characterized by preserved short-term and implicit memory and extensive impairment of episodic long-term memory. In virtually all episodic memory indexes examined (learning, forgetting, recognition abilities), a-MCI subjects who converted to AD were more severely impaired than were subjects who did not become demented. This memory profile, which closely resembles that exhibited by amnestic patients with bilateral mesial-temporal lobe lesions, confirms a precocious phase in preclinical AD characterized by selective involvement of mesial-temporal areas and worsening of the memory impairment as atrophic changes progress in hippocampal structures. In this context of pervasive episodic memory impairment, tests assessing the free recall of verbal material following a delay interval demonstrated the greater sensitivity to memory deficits of a-MCI subjects who developed AD.","1255":"The current study examined the relationship between cognitive function and falls in older people who did not meet criteria for dementia or mild cognitive impairment (N = 172). To address limitations of previous research, the authors controlled for the confounding effects of gait measures and other risk factors by means of associations between cognitive function and falls. A neuropsychological test battery was submitted to factor analysis, yielding 3 orthogonal factors (Verbal IQ, Speed\/Executive Attention, Memory). Single and recurrent falls within the last 12 months were evaluated. The authors hypothesized that Speed\/Executive Attention would be associated with falls. Additionally, the authors assessed whether associations between different cognitive functions and falls varied depending on whether single or recurrent falls were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that lower scores on Speed\/Executive Attention were associated with increased risk of single and recurrent falls. Lower scores on Verbal IQ were related only to increased risk of recurrent falls. Memory was not associated with either single or recurrent falls. These findings are relevant to risk assessment and prevention of falls and point to possible shared neural substrates of cognitive and motor function.","1256":"Working memory deficits in normal aging have been well documented, and studies suggest that high memory load plus the presence of distraction negatively impacts successful memory performance to a greater degree in older individuals. However, characterization of the component processes that are impaired by these task manipulations is not clear. In this behavioral study, younger and older subjects were tested with a delayed-recognition and recall task in which the encoding and delay period were both manipulated. During the encoding period, the subjects were presented with either a single letter or multiple letters at their predetermined forward letter span, and the delay period was either uninterrupted or interrupted with a visual distraction. There was an age-related impairment of working memory recognition accuracy only in the combination of high memory load and distraction. These results suggest that when working memory maintenance systems are taxed, faulty recognition processes may underlie cognitive aging deficits in healthy older individuals.","1257":"The frontal and temporal lobe regions of the brain have a high vulnerability to injury as a consequence of cerebral trauma. One reason for this selective vulnerability is how the frontal and temporal regions are situated in the anterior and cranial fossa of the skull. These concavities of the skull base cup the frontal and temporal lobes which create surface areas of contact between the dura, brain, and skull where mechanical deformation injures the brain. In particular, the sphenoid ridge and the free-edge of the tentorium cerebelli are uniquely situated to facilitate injury to the posterior base of the frontal lobe and the anterior pole and medial surface area of the temporal lobe. Three-dimensional image reconstruction with computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are used to demonstrate the vulnerability of these regions. How neuropsychological deficits result from damage to these areas is reviewed and discussed.","1258":"Variable reports of neuropsychological deficits in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may, in part, be attributable to methodological limitations. In this study, these limitations were addressed by controlling for genetic and environmental influences and by assessing the effects of comorbid depression and mode of illness onset. Specifically, the researchers conducted a co-twin control study of 22 pairs of monozygotic twins, in which 1 twin met strict criteria for CFS and the co-twin was healthy. Twins underwent a structured psychiatric interview and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment evaluating 6 cognitive domains. Results indicated that twin groups had similar intellectual and visual memory functioning, but fatigued twins exhibited decreases in motor functions (p = .05), speed of information processing (p = .02), verbal memory (p = .02), and executive functioning (p = .01). Major depression did not affect neuropsychological functioning among fatigued twins, although twins with sudden illness onset demonstrated slowed information processing compared with those with gradual onset (p = .01). Sudden onset CFS was associated with reduced speed of information processing. If confirmed, these findings suggest the need to distinguish illness onset in future CFS studies and may have implications for treatment, cognitive rehabilitation, and disability determination.","1259":"The authors examined whether a form of implicit memory that has been unambiguously dissociated from conscious awareness--learning of spatial context on the contextual cuing task introduced by M. M. Chun and Y. Jiang (1998)--is mature in childhood as predicted by an evolutionary view of cognition. School-aged children did not show reliable learning relative to adults who performed the same version of the task or another version that slowed responses to match those of children. Thus, unreliable learning in childhood was mediated by immature implicit representations of spatial context rather than by slower baseline response speed. The present finding is inconsistent with the prediction of the evolutionary view of cognition but consistent with incomplete maturation of medial temporal lobes known to mediate contextual learning.","1260":"Intervention-related changes in spatiotemporal profiles of regional brain activation were examined by whole-head magnetoencephalography in 15 children with severe reading difficulties who had failed to show adequate progress to quality reading instruction during Grade 1. Intensive intervention initially focused on phonological decoding skills (for 8 weeks) and, during the subsequent 8 weeks, on rapid word recognition ability. Clinically significant improvement in reading skills was noted in 8 children who showed \"normalizing\" changes in their spatiotemporal profiles of regional brain activity (increased duration of activity in the left temporoparietal region and a shift in the relative timing of activity in temporoparietal and inferior frontal regions). Seven children who demonstrated \"compensatory\" changes in brain activity (increased duration of activity in the right temporoparietal region and frontal areas, bilaterally) did not show adequate response to intervention. Nonimpaired readers did not show systematic changes in brain activity across visits.","1261":"This study examined the relationship between morphological structure of languages and performance asymmetries of native speakers in lateralized tasks. In 2 experiments, native speakers of English (concatenative morphology stem plus affix) and of Hebrew and Arabic (nonconcatenative root plus word-form morphology) were presented with lateralized lexical decision tasks, in which the morphological structure of both words and nonwords was manipulated. In the 1st study, stimuli were presented unilaterally. In the 2nd study, 2 stimuli were presented bilaterally, and participants were cued to respond to 1 of them. Three different indexes of hemispheric integration were tested: processing dissociation, effects of distractor status, and the bilateral effect. Lateralization patterns in the 3 languages revealed both common and language-specific patterns. For English speakers, only the left hemisphere (LH) was sensitive to morphological structure, consistent with the hypothesis that the LH processes right visual field stimuli independently but that the right hemisphere uses LH abilities to process words in the left visual field. In Hebrew and Arabic, both hemispheres are sensitive to morphological structure, and interhemispheric transfer of information may be more symmetrical than in English. The relationship between universal and experience-specific effects on brain organization is discussed.","1262":"The goal of the present study was to assess 3 attentional control processes--divided attention, manipulation capacities, and inhibition--in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Manipulation capacities were tested by comparing immediate serial recall with alphabetical-order recall of words. Divided attention was tested with the Brown-Peterson procedure, in which participants divide their attention between simple addition tasks and consonant trigrams over delays. Inhibition was tested with the Hayling procedure, in which participants complete sentences with words irrelevant to their context. Persons with AD showed severe impairment on the 3 attentional control components. Persons with MCI exhibited impaired performance on the Brown-Peterson procedure but normal performance on the other 2 tasks. With AD and MCI participants, there was a negative correlation between general cognitive deficits and impairment on attentional control tasks, indicating that attentional control deficits increase in the MCI\/AD continuum. When separating MCI with and without significant subsequent decline, those with subsequent decline showed impaired performance on both the Brown-Peterson procedure and manipulation task. These data suggest that control of attention tasks can track AD at a preclinical stage and that impairment increases gradually during the preclinical phase of AD.","1263":"Neuropsychologists often recommend that patients with dementia and their caregivers use environmental adaptations to improve everyday functioning. Although these recommendations are intuitive (e.g., reduce clutter), most have never been experimentally tested. This study examined whether and how environmental adaptations improved everyday action in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Forty-six outpatients completed the Naturalistic Action Test (NAT; M. F. Schwartz, L. J. Buxbaum, M. Ferraro, T. Veramonti, &amp; M. Segal, 2003), which requires completion of 3 everyday tasks. The NAT was administered under 2 conditions: standard and user centered. The standard NAT followed the procedures of the manual; object placement was standardized, but objects were not meaningfully arranged on the tabletop. In the user-centered NAT, objects were arranged in the order needed in the task, and a visual cue to monitor performance was placed on the table. These conditions were counterbalanced across participants. The user-centered condition improved performance on all NAT items and reduced commission and omission error rates. However, post hoc examination of commission error types showed improvement of substitution and off-task errors but no difference in anticipation and perseveration errors. Thus, environmental adaptations improved everyday performance in AD by facilitating task accomplishment, object selection, and task-congruent actions.","1264":"Everyday action is impaired among individuals with schizophrenia, yet few studies have characterized the nature of this deficit using performance-based measures. This study examined the performance of 20 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder on the Naturalistic Action Test (M. F. Schwartz, L. J. Buxbaum, M. Ferraro, T. Veramonti, &amp; M. Segal, 2003). Performance was coded to examine overall impairment, task accomplishment, and error patterns and was compared with that of healthy controls (n = 28) and individuals with mild dementia (n = 23). Additionally, 2 competing accounts of everyday action deficits, the resource theory and an executive account, were evaluated. When compared with controls, the participants with schizophrenia demonstrated impaired performance. Relative to dementia patients, participants with schizophrenia obtained higher accomplishment scores but committed comparable rates of errors. Moreover, distributions of error types for the 2 groups differed, with the participants with schizophrenia demonstrating greater proportions of errors associated with executive dysfunction. This is the 1st study to show different Naturalistic Action Test performance patterns between 2 neurologically impaired populations. The distinct performance pattern demonstrated by individuals with schizophrenia reflects specific deficits in executive function.","1265":"Patients with schizophrenia show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. However, there is a paucity of work focusing on the empathic abilities of these patients. The present study was designed to examine the degree of impairment in cognitive and affective empathy in schizophrenia and to evaluate the contribution of executive prefrontal functions to empathy in these patients. To explore the neurocognitive processes that underlie the empathic ability in schizophrenic patients, the relationship between empathy scores and the performance on a cognitive flexibility task that assesses dorsolateral and orbitofrontal functioning (set shifting and reversal, respectively) was examined in 26 patients with schizophrenia and 31 healthy control subjects. Results indicated that patients with schizophrenia were significantly impaired in both cognitive and affective empathy compared with healthy control subjects. The degree of impaired empathy related to the severity of negative symptoms. In addition, patients showed impaired performance on measures of both shifting and reversal. However, while cognitive empathy was particularly related to measurements of orbitofrontal (rather than dorsolateral) functioning, affective empathy was related to measures of social functioning.","1266":"Information on the rarity or abnormality of an individual's test scores (or test score differences) is fundamental in interpreting the results of a neuropsychological assessment. If a standardized battery of tests is administered, the question arises as to what percentage of the healthy population would be expected to exhibit one or more abnormally low test scores (and, in general, j or more abnormally low scores). Similar issues arise when the concern is with the number of abnormal pairwise differences between an individual's scores on the battery, or when an individual's scores on each component of the battery are compared with the individual's mean score. A generic Monte Carlo simulation method for tackling such problems is described (it requires only that the matrix of correlations between tests be available) and is contrasted with the use of binomial probabilities. The method is then applied to Index scores for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Third Edition (WAIS-III; D. Wechsler, 1997) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; D. Wechsler, 2003). Three computer programs that implement the methods are made available.","1267":"Cross-sectional studies of normal aging indicate an association between memory and hippocampal volume, and between executive functioning and subcortical-frontal circuits. Much less is known, however, about the relationship between longitudinal MRI changes and cognitive decline. The authors hypothesized that longitudinal change in memory would be best predicted by change in hippocampal volumes, whereas change in executive functioning would be best predicted by cortical atrophy and progression of MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease. For this study, 50 healthy elderly subjects underwent structural MRI and cognitive testing at baseline and again at follow-up, with a mean follow-up interval of 45 months. Volumetric MRI measures were hippocampus, cortical gray matter, white matter signal hyperintensity (WMSH), and lacunae. Neuropsychological measures were psychometrically robust composite scores of episodic memory (MEM) and executive functioning (EXEC). Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that a decrease in hippocampus was associated with a decline in MEM, whereas decreased cortical gray matter and increased WMSH were independently associated with a decline in EXEC. Results suggest that in normal aging, cognitive functioning declines as cortical gray matter and hippocampus decrease, and WMSH increases. The association between WMSH and EXEC further highlights the cognitive sequealae associated with cerebrovascular disease in normal elderly.","1268":"Samples of adults across a wide age range performed a battery of 16 cognitive tests in 3 sessions within an interval of approximately 2 weeks. Estimates of within-person variability across the 3 assessments were relatively large and were equivalent in magnitude to the cross-sectional age differences expected over an interval of 15-25 years. These findings raise questions about the precision of assessments based on a single measurement and imply that it may be difficult to distinguish true change from short-term fluctuation. Because there were large individual differences in the magnitude of this variability, it is proposed that change might be most meaningfully expressed in units of each individual's own across-session variability.","1269":"A well-known challenge for research in the cognitive neuropsychology of aging is to distinguish between the deficits and changes associated with normal aging and those indicative of early cognitive impairment. In a series of 2 studies, the authors explored whether 2 neurocognitive markers, speed (mean level) and inconsistency (intraindividual variability), distinguished between age groups (64-73 and 74-90+ years) and cognitive status groups (nonimpaired, mildly impaired, and moderately impaired). Study 1 (n = 416) showed that both level and inconsistency distinguished between the age and 2 cognitive status (not impaired, mildly impaired) groups, with a modest tendency for inconsistency to predict group membership over and above mean level. Study 2 (n = 304) replicated these results but extended them because of the qualifying effects associated with the unique moderately impaired oldest group. Specifically, not only were the groups more firmly distinguished by both indicators of speed, but evidence for the differential contribution of performance inconsistency was stronger. Neurocognitive markers of speed and inconsistency may be leading indicators of emerging cognitive impairment.","1270":"Prior studies of emotion suggest that young adults should have enhanced memory for negative faces and that this enhancement should be reduced in older adults. Several studies have not shown these effects but were conducted with procedures different from those used with other emotional stimuli. In this study, researchers examined age differences in recognition of faces with emotional or neutral expressions, using trial-unique stimuli, as is typically done with other types of emotional stimuli. They also assessed the influence of personality traits and mood on memory. Enhanced recognition for negative faces was found in young adults but not in older adults. Recognition of faces was not influenced by mood or personality traits in young adults, but lower levels of extraversion and better emotional sensitivity predicted better negative face memory in older adults. These results suggest that negative expressions enhance memory for faces in young adults, as negative valence enhances memory for words and scenes. This enhancement is absent in older adults, but memory for emotional faces is modulated in older adults by personality traits that are relevant to emotional processing.","1271":"MRI scans measured white matter lesion prevalence (WMLP) in 65 people ages 65-84 years who also took 17 cognitive tests: 3 tests of general fluid intelligence, 3 of vocabulary, 2 of episodic and 3 of working memory, 2 of processing speed, and 4 of frontal and executive function. Entry of age with WMLP into regression equations as predictors of test scores showed that inferences about the functional relationships between markers of brain aging and cognitive impairments are seriously misleading if they are based on simple correlations alone. A new finding that WMLP accounts for all of the age-related variance between individuals in tests of speed and executive ability but for none of the age-related variance in intelligence revises current hypotheses that gross brain changes affect general fluid intelligence and other mental abilities solely through their effects on information-processing speed.","1272":"This study sought to differentiate alcoholism-related changes in judgments of emotional stimuli from those of other populations in which such changes have been documented. Two sets of visual stimuli, one containing words and the other containing drawings of faces (representing a range of emotional content), were presented to abstinent alcoholic adults with and without Korsakoff's syndrome, as well as to a healthy control group and four groups of patients with other neurobehavioral disorders: Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants rated the stimuli according to emotional valence and intensity of emotion. Results implicated bi-hemispheric frontal and subcortical involvement in the abnormalities of emotion identification associated with alcoholism, and they also support the notion of age-related vulnerabilities in conjunction with alcoholism.","1273":"The current article examined the relationships among aging, intelligence, intracranial volume, and brain shrinkage in alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracranial and cerebral volumes in 146 subjects with alcohol use disorders and 42 comparison subjects who were not alcoholic. The authors' findings show that performance on Block Design decreases as alcoholics age, and this decrease is predicted by brain shrinkage. This is consistent with a process of cumulative brain damage related to alcohol use. However, the authors' data also show that vocabulary does not decrease with age and is correlated with premorbid brain size as measured by intracranial volume, suggesting that lower verbal ability precedes heavy alcohol use and may be a risk factor for alcoholism.","1274":"In the present study, we investigated whether a hemispheric division of labor is most advantageous to performance when lateralized inputs place unequal resource demands on the left and right cerebral hemispheres. In each trial, participants decided whether 2 rotated letters, presented either in the same visual field (within-field trials) or in opposite visual fields (across-field trials), were both of normal orientation, or whether one was normal and the other was mirror-reversed. To discriminate a letter's orientation, one must rotate the letter to the upright position. Therefore, we manipulated whether the two letters imposed similar or dissimilar demands on cognitive resources by varying the number of degrees that each letter needed to be rotated to reach the upright position. As predicted, in 2 experiments we found that the across-field advantage increased as the number of degrees each letter needed to be rotated became more dissimilar. These findings support a current model of hemispheric interactions, which posits that an unequal hemispheric distribution of cognitive load allows the cerebral hemispheres to take the lead for different aspects of cognitive processing.","1275":"It has been demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia perform poorly on tasks that require orienting, focusing, maintaining, and shifting attention. However, it is unknown how patients with schizophrenia can track multiple moving targets. To elucidate this issue, the authors investigated fast and slow multiple-object tracking in patients with schizophrenia (n = 30) and in matched healthy control participants (n = 30) and assessed their relationship with motion perception (velocity discrimination), sustained attention and context processing (Continuous Performance Test, 1-9 version; J. R. Finkelstein, T. D. Cannon, R. E. Gur, R. C. Gur, &amp; P. Moberg, 1997), and object and spatial working memory. Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia displayed impaired performances on multiple-object tracking tasks. Linear regression analysis revealed a specific relationship among object tracking, velocity discrimination, and spatial working memory. In patients with schizophrenia, velocity discrimination and spatial working memory were the predictive factors of multiple-object tracking, whereas in healthy control participants, the single predictive factor was velocity discrimination. Probabilistic regression analysis revealed that only the Continuous Performance Test made significant contribution to discriminating between patients and control participants. These results suggest that multiple-object tracking is impaired in schizophrenia, and that it is specifically associated with motion perception and spatial working memory.","1276":"Several lines of evidence suggest the possibility of abnormal interhemispheric communication in psychopathy, but there have been few direct empirical studies. To address this gap in the literature, the authors examined one important aspect of interhemispheric communication, the efficiency with which information is transferred across the corpus callosum. Using A. T. Poffenberger's (1912) paradigm for estimating interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) from simple motor responses to lateralized stimuli, the authors found a substantially prolonged IHTT among psychopathic criminals relative to nonpsychopathic criminals. This prolonged IHTT was somewhat more pronounced when participants were using their right hand to respond. This study provides initial behavioral evidence of slowed interhemispheric transfer in psychopathy.","1277":"Research on psychopathy in women has generated equivocal laboratory findings. This study examined the performance of psychopathic women in 2 laboratory tasks designed to assess abnormal selective attention associated with response modulation deficits: a computerized picture-word (PW) task, and a picture-word Stroop (PW Stroop) task. Consistent with data from psychopathic men, women receiving high scores on the Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (Hare, 1991) displayed reduced Stroop interference on the PW and PW Stroop tasks. Results suggest that despite some differences in the expression of psychopathy across gender, psychopathic women are characterized by selective attention abnormalities predicted by the response modulation hypothesis and similar to those exhibited by psychopathic men.","1278":"In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between the cognitive status of normal adults and age-related changes in attention to novel and target events. Old, middle-age, and young subjects, divided into cognitively high and cognitively average performing groups, viewed repetitive standard stimuli, infrequent target stimuli, and unique novel visual stimuli. Subjects controlled viewing duration by a button press that led to the onset of the next stimulus. They also responded to targets by pressing a foot pedal. The amount of time spent looking at different kinds of stimuli served as a measure of visual attention and exploratory activity. Cognitively high performers spent more time viewing novel stimuli than cognitively average performers. The magnitude of the difference between cognitively high and cognitively average performing groups was largest among old subjects. Cognitively average performers had slower and less accurate responses to targets than cognitively high performers. The results provide strong evidence that the link between engagement by novelty and higher cognitive performance increases with age. Moreover, the results support the notion of there being different patterns of normal cognitive aging and the need to identify the factors that influence them.","1279":"Dichotic listening to verbal stimuli results in a right ear advantage (REA), indicating a left hemisphere processing superiority. The magnitude of the REA can be modulated by instructions to direct attention to the left or right ear stimulus. A previous study from our laboratory showed that presenting a prime syllable before the presentation of the dichotic syllables increases reports of the nonprimed syllable, apparently a negative priming effect that inhibits attention to the distracting prime representation. The present study combined attention instruction and priming, making up a 3 x 3 factorial design. The prime stimulus was a single consonant-vowel syllable presented binaurally just before onset of the dichotic consonant-vowel syllables. Results showed that both instructions and priming manipulations had an effect on which dichotic stimulus was selected. There was also a significant interaction between attention instruction and priming manipulation, indicating that the mechanism for instructed attention and the mechanism for negative priming work on the same level of processing.","1280":"Executive function was assessed with the Trail Making Test (Army Individual Test Battery; M. D. Lezak, 1983), the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (C. Reynolds, 2002), and a neurocognitive measure of executive control (Attentional Network Task [ANT]; J. I. Fan, B. D. McCandliss, T. Somer, A. Raz, &amp; M. I. Posner, 2002) in 19 undergraduates with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale-Self-Report version; E. B. Foa, D. S. Riggs, C. V. Dancu, &amp; B. O. Rothbaum, 1993), 15 high trauma participants without PTSD, and 18 low trauma control participants. Although groups did not differ on any trail making task or on the ANT measures of alerting or orienting, PTSD participants were significantly more impaired on the ANT executive network index than were high or low trauma control participants, even when level of depressive symptoms was covaried. Previous animal research identified a relationship between dopamine and the ANT measure of executive function. Elevated PTSD symptom severity and levels of hyperarousal, reexperiencing, and avoidance-numbing were associated significantly with executive function deficits indexed by the ANT. These results indicate a potentially subtle but specific deficit in executive function and a possible relationship between PTSD symptoms and irregularities in dopamine function.","1281":"The current study prospectively followed girls with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with a matched comparison sample, 5 years after childhood neuropsychological assessments. Follow-up neuropsychological measures emphasized attentional skills, executive functions, and language abilities. Paralleling childhood findings, the childhood-diagnosed ADHD group displayed moderate to large deficits in executive\/attentional performance as well as in rapid naming relative to the comparison group at follow up (M-sub(age) 14.2 years). ADHD-inattentive versus ADHD-combined contrasts were nonsignificant and of negligible effect size, even when a refined, sluggish cognitive tempo subgroup of the inattentive type was examined. Although ADHD versus comparison group differences largely withstood statistical control of baseline demographics and comorbidities, control of childhood IQ reduced executive function differences to nonsignificance. Yet when the subset of girls meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adolescence was compared with the remainder of the participants, neuropsychological deficits emerged even with full statistical control. Overall, childhood ADHD in girls portends neuropsychological and executive deficits that persist for at least 5 years.","1282":"Previous reviews and meta-analyses that addressed abnormal Stroop interference in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) yielded mixed results. The authors of the present study argue that the inconsistencies may reflect the problematic nature of 2 frequently used methods to quantify Stroop interference-the difference score and Golden's method (C. J. Golden, 1978). Golden's method correction for base-word reading is inadequate, and the difference score is sensitive to the nature of the outcome variable. The latter can be remedied with a ratio score. Contrasting previous meta-analyses, this meta-analysis covers all age groups and all Stroop test variants, and it excludes studies using the Golden quantification method. Mean effect sizes for interference in ADHD as quantified by difference scores relative to control scores were 0.24 across all studies but 1.11 for time-per-item studies; outcome variable was a significant moderator variable, reflecting the sensitivity of the difference score to this variable. Consistency analysis of ratio scores across 19 studies reveals more interference for the ADHD groups relative to the control groups. It is concluded that interference control is consistently compromised in individuals with ADHD.","1283":"The ability to detect left-sided stimuli (visual or tactile) was studied in visual and tactile extinction (RBD) patients and in healthy (C) subjects. Stimuli were single or double; double stimuli were always cross-modal and could be released across the 2 hemispaces or within the same hemispace. Moreover, the stimuli could be either simultaneous or separated by 1 of 3 different asynchronies (105, 505, 905 ms). C subjects were perfect in all conditions. RBD patients omitted the contralesional tactile stimulus in bilateral trials (across space, classical extinction). They also omitted the tactile stimulus in unilateral left trials (within hemispace). Both effects showed the same temporal modulation with lower extinction rates at longer stimulus onset asynchronies. Results suggest that attentional processing of a visual stimulus inhibits processing of a tactile one, even if both are delivered in the same contralesional hemispace.","1284":"This study examines the corpus callosum in 68 readers nested in 24 families. Callosa were measured and controlled for whole brain volume, intelligence, and gender. The relation of corpus callosum size to the within-family variance of oral reading was investigated with various measurements: volume, midsagittal area, and anterior-to-posterior one-fifth area segmentations. Because this is the first known publication of MRI calculations of corpus callosum volume, some basic questions about bilateral symmetry and the efficacy of area versus volumetric measurements were explored. Results suggest that better readers within families have larger midsagittal areas at the midbody. Although reliably measured, volume did not contribute to oral reading but was highly correlated with area. Bilateral volumes of the corpus callosum were symmetric.","1285":"The ability to accurately monitor one's memory is a metacognitive process that is important in everyday life. The authors examined episodic memory feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ratings in 21 moderate to severe closed-head injury (CHI) participants (more than 1 year postinjury) and 21 controls. Participants studied 36 critical cue-target word pairs. Following a brief delay, they were asked to recall the target that corresponded to a given cue. Confidence ratings were made for recalled words, and FOK judgments were made for nonrecalled words in terms of the likelihood of recognizing the target word on a subsequent recognition test. CHI participants demonstrated less accurate recall but accurate ability to judge their recall performance (retrospective memory monitoring). They also demonstrated intact FOK judgments when providing binary judgments but demonstrated difficulties making finer discriminations on an ordinal scale (prospective memory monitoring). These findings suggest that memory monitoring is not a unitary construct. It is proposed that CHI participants may display intact memory monitoring when predictions are based on familiarity assessment but not when continued probing for additional episodic information is required.","1286":"Deficits in attention are frequently reported following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, methodological differences make it difficult to reconcile inconsistencies in the research findings in order to undertake an evidence-based assessment of attention. The current study therefore undertook a meta-analytic review of research examining attention following severe TBI. A search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases spanning the years 1980 to 2005 was undertaken with 24 search terms. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to screen all articles, leaving 41 studies that were included in the current meta-analysis. Weighted Cohen's d effect sizes, percentage overlap statistics, and confidence intervals were calculated for the different tests of attention. Fail-safe Ns were additionally calculated to address the bias introduced by the tendency to publish significant results. Large and significant deficits were found in specific measures of information-processing speed, attention span, focused\/selective attention, sustained attention, and supervisory attentional control following severe TBI. Finally, age, education, and postinjury interval were not significantly related to these deficits in attention.","1287":"Semantic fluency tasks, with the categories of birds and furniture as stimuli, were administered to normal subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Normal subjects showed a gender-related double dissociation consistent with the literature data because men were more fluent with the birds category and women with the furniture category. Also, patients with AD showed a Gender x Category interaction, but the double dissociation between birds and furniture was not present because of a prevalent impairment of the living category birds that was irrespective of gender. This pattern of impairment in patients with AD was independent from the disease stage. The authors conclude that (a) gender-related categorical effects cannot be considered as inborn, sex-related cognitive differences but as familiarity effects and (b) both lesion-related and familiarity-related factors must be taken into account to explain category-specific effects of patients with brain damage and patients with AD.","1288":"We taught a novel animal category by rule-based and similarity-based processes to participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and healthy age-matched participants. Healthy participants successfully categorized by either process. AD patients' rule-based categorization was impaired, while their similarity-based categorization resembled that of healthy participants. Correlations of AD patients' performance with measures of executive functioning suggested a deficit in the cognitive resources necessary for engaging rule-based categorization. The contribution of limited executive resources to categorization difficulty in AD was further demonstrated in a second experiment in which features determining category membership were of lower salience. CBD patients were relatively impaired at similarity-based processing, suggesting that qualitatively distinct categorization processes can be selectively compromised in patients with focal neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, AD patients' impaired categorization correlated with performance on a measure of semantic memory, implicating this categorization deficit in AD patients' semantic memory difficulty.","1289":"Nondemented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are impaired in learning to categorize simple perceptual stimuli when category membership is defined by a nonlinear relationship between stimulus dimensions but not when the relationship is linear (J. V. Filoteo, W. T. Maddox, D. P. Salmon, &amp; D. D. Song, 2005). In the present study, the authors examined whether performance in either of these 2 category learning conditions was predictive of global cognitive decline following a mean of 1.6 years since the time patients were 1st seen. Results indicated that final block accuracy in the nonlinear condition, but not the linear condition, predicted global cognitive decline. Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) did not significantly predict global cognitive decline, although there was a trend for this to be the case. In addition, the association between nonlinear category learning and global cognitive decline was not impacted by patients' performance on the WCST. Results suggest that nonlinear category learning predicts cognitive decline in nondemented patients with PD and that nonlinear category learning and WCST performances may provide independent measures of integrity of the posterior and anterior caudate, respectively.","1290":"The authors examined the degree to which aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) influence the ability to control attention when conflict is presented in terms of incongruent mapping between a stimulus and the appropriate response. In a variant of the Simon task, healthy older adults and older adults with mild or very mild AD showed disproportionately larger reaction time (RT) costs when the stimulus and response were in conflict relative to RT costs of healthy younger adults. Analyses of RT distributions provide support for a 2-process model of the Simon effect in which there is a short-lived transient effect of the irrelevant dimension in younger adults and a more sustained influence across the RT distribution in older adults. An analysis of error rates showed that the older adults with mild and very mild AD made more errors on incongruent trials, suggesting that AD leads to increased likelihood of selecting the prepotent pathway. The findings are discussed in terms of the special nature of the response requirements of the Simon task to better illuminate the attentional decrements in both healthy aging and early stage AD.","1291":"The authors used mixed-effects growth models to examine longitudinal change in neuropsychological performance over a 4-year period among 197 individuals who were either normal or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. At follow-up, the participants were divided into 4 groups: (a) controls: participants who were normal at both baseline and follow-up (n = 33), (b) stables: participants with MCI whose Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score did not differ between the first and last evaluations (n = 22), (c) decliners: participants with MCI whose CDR-SB score declined between the first and last evaluations (n = 95), and (d) converters: participants who received a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease during the follow-up period (n = 47). Only the Episodic Memory factor showed a significantly greater rate of decline over the follow-up period among the converters. Two other factors were significantly lower in converters at baseline in comparison with other groups (the executive function factor and the general knowledge factor), but the rate of decline over time did not differ. Individuals with an APOE epsilon4 allele scored lower on the episodic memory and executive function factors at baseline.","1292":"The impact of vascular health on the relations between structural brain changes and cognition was assessed in a longitudinal study of 46 adults, 23 of whom remained healthy for 5 years and 23 of whom had hypertension at baseline or acquired vascular problems during follow-up. At both measurement occasions, the volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and regional brain volumes correlated with age. In 5 years, WMH volume more than doubled in the vascular risk group but did not increase in healthy participants. The frontal lobes had the highest WMH load at baseline and follow-up; the parietal WMH showed the greatest rate of expansion. In the vascular risk group, systolic blood pressure at follow-up correlated with posterior WMH volume. The fastest cortical shrinkage was observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Fluid intelligence correlated with WMH burden and declined along with faster WMH progression. In the vascular risk group, WMH progression and shrinkage of the fusiform cortex correlated with decline in working memory. Thus, poor vascular health contributes to age-related declines in brain and cognition, and some of the age-related declines may be limited to persons with elevated vascular risk.","1293":"Two of the most consistent correlates of sexual orientation in men are handedness and fraternal birth order (i.e., number of older brothers). In the present study, the relationship among handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation was studied in 4 samples of heterosexual and gay or bisexual men (N = 944). Unlike previous studies, which have only observed an increased rate of non-right-handedness in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men, an elevated rate of extreme right-handedness was found in gay or bisexual men relative to heterosexual men. The results also demonstrated that older brothers moderate the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation. Specifically, older brothers increase the odds of being gay or bisexual in moderate right-handers only; in both non-right-handers and extreme right-handers, older brothers do not affect (or decrease) the odds of being gay or bisexual. The results have implications for an early neurodevelopmental origin to sexual orientation in men.","1294":"Among possible markers of age-related cognitive decline, uric acid (UA) is controversial because it has antioxidant properties but is increased in diseases that often lead to cognitive impairment. In this study of 96 elderly adults, participants with mildly elevated (but normal) serum UA were 2.7 to 5.9 times more likely to score in the lowest quartile of the sample on measures of processing speed, verbal memory, and working memory. Even after controlling for age, sex, race, education, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and alcohol abuse, the multivariate-adjusted odds of poor verbal memory and working memory remained significant (ps &lt; .05). Despite its antioxidant properties, these findings suggest that even mild elevations of UA might increase the risk of cognitive decline among older adults.","1295":"Fifty-two subjects between ages 40 and 79 years were administered a questionnaire assessing their ability to recall semantic information about famous people from 4 different decades and to recollect its episodic source of acquisition together with autonoetic consciousness via the remember-know paradigm. In addition, they underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests to assess episodic and semantic memory and executive functions. The analyses of age reveal differences for the episodic source score but no differences between age groups for the semantic scores within each decade. Regardless of the age of people, the analyses also show that semantic memory subcomponents of the famous person test are highly associated with each other as well as with the source component. The recall of semantic information on the famous person test relies on participants' semantic abilities, whereas the recall of its episodic source depends on their executive functions. The present findings confirm the existence of an episodic-semantic distinction in knowledge about famous people. They provide further evidence that personal source and semantic information are at once distinct and highly interactive within the framework of remote memory.","1296":"Deaf and hearing individuals who either used sign language (signers) or not (nonsigners) were tested on visual memory for objects and shapes that were difficult to describe verbally with a same\/different matching paradigm. The use of 4 groups was designed to permit a separation of effects related to sign language use (signers vs. nonsigners) and effects related to auditory deprivation (deaf vs. hearing). Forty deaf native signers and nonsigners and 51 hearing signers and nonsigners participated in the study. Signing individuals (both deaf and hearing) were more accurate than nonsigning individuals (deaf and hearing) at memorizing shapes. For the shape memory task but not the object task, deaf signers and nonsigners displayed right hemisphere (RH) advantage over the left hemisphere (LH). Conversely, both hearing groups displayed a memory advantage for shapes in the LH over the RH. Results indicate that enhanced memory performance for shapes in signers (deaf and hearing) stems from the visual skills acquired through sign language use and that deafness, irrespective of language background, leads to the use of a visually based strategy for memory of difficult-to-describe items.","1297":"Twenty-six patients suffering from damage to the right side of the brain, 19 of whom exhibited signs of left neglect, as well as 32 matched controls, ran 3 spatial cuing tasks. Patients were also tested with 2 cancellation tests, a line-bisection test, the copy of a complex drawing, and a visual extinction procedure. Results first showed correlations between extinction and cancellation tests performance on one hand, and between line bisection and copy on the other hand. Second, results demonstrated that an engagement deficit toward contralesional targets appeared to be the most striking feature of neglect, and the engagement score was correlated with the cancellation score and extinction. Most patients with neglect also presented a deficit in disengagement, a deficit of inhibition of return, and probably a deficit of alertness. Deficits in engagement and in disengagement, as well as poor scores in cancellation tests, seemed to be related with posterior cortical and subcortical lesions. Most important, even if an endogenous deficit (frequently related with a thalamic lesion) could aggravate the neglect behavior, neglect syndrome was mainly explained by a deficit of exogenous attention.","1298":"The goal of the present study was to determine whether a reduced capacity for interhemispheric integration can explain the attention deficits seen in psychopathic individuals under conditions that place substantial demands on left-hemisphere-specific resources. The present study examined the performance of 54 incarcerated psychopathic and nonpsychopathic male offenders on a same-different global-local paradigm that permits manipulation of both the magnitude of processing demands and the demand for interhemispheric coordination. Prior studies with similar paradigms have demonstrated that the cerebral hemispheres can function more efficiently as relatively independent processors on simple tasks, whereas communication between the hemispheres improves performance when processing demands are heavy. Analyses indicated that psychopathic offenders are not deficient in interhemispheric integration but provided additional evidence consistent with the left hemisphere activation hypothesis of psychopathy.","1299":"The present study examined quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) profile for children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Five-minute QEEG data were obtained from 90 normal controls (NCs) and 66 children with ASD. Spectrum analyses revealed that ASD children showed significantly less relative alpha and more relative delta than NC. Specifically, 26% of ASD children and 2% of NCs showed 1.5 SDs of relative alpha below the normative mean. Children with this QEEG profile had 17 times the risk of having ASD than those without such a profile. Sensitivity and specificity of relative alpha were 91% and 73%, respectively. Split-half cross-validation yielded a sensitivity of 76%.","1300":"The authors assessed visual information processing in high-functioning individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and their parents. The authors used tasks for contrast sensitivity, motion, and form perception to test visual processing occurring relatively early and late in the magnocellular-dorsal and parvocellular-ventral pathways. No deficits were found in contrast sensitivity for low or high spatial frequencies or for motion or form perception between individuals with PDD in comparison with a matched control group. Individuals with PDD performed equally with or better than controls on motion detection tasks. In addition, the authors did not find differences on any of the tasks between parents of the PDD group and matched control parents. These results indicate that high-functioning individuals with PDD and their parents are able to process visual stimuli that rely on early or late processing in the magnocellular-dorsal and parvocellular-ventral pathways as well as controls.","1301":"The question of whether attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) represents a continuum of attentional and executive dysfunction or a natural category has yet to be extensively investigated. Subjective report and neuropsychological data from 437 individuals referred for neuropsychological evaluation were analyzed using latent class and taxometric analyses (mean above minus below a cut [MAMBAC], maximum eigenvalue [MAXEIG], and latent mode [LMODE]). Results indicated no significant evidence for a taxonic representation of ADHD across multiple procedures and indicator sets. Similarly, there was no evidence that ADHD subtypes represent a qualitative distinction. These findings may suggest that current diagnostic conceptualizations are inadequate for accurately identifying and characterizing individuals with problems related to attention and executive dysfunction. Alternatively, the null findings may have resulted from inadequate indicator selection. A dimensional model may better facilitate accurate identification of individuals at risk for functional impairment.","1302":"The primary focus of this study was to examine whether there is early neuropsychological impairment in presymptomatic Huntington's disease (HD). A broad neuropsychological assessment battery was administered to 24 asymptomatic gene carriers (HD+) and 31 noncarriers (HD-). The gene carriers revealed inferior cognitive functioning as compared with the noncarriers in memory and executive functions. When the gene carriers were assigned to 2 groups based on predicted years to onset (with 15 and over being HD+ late and under 15 being HD+ near), the HD+ near group performed significantly worse than the HD+ late group in all domains but ability to shift conceptually and visuospatial memory. Results suggest that early cognitive deficits are detectable prior to motor symptoms, first in memory functions and then in executive functions and perceptual motor speed.","1303":"Patients with autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 16) and Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 32) were compared on first-letter and semantic category fluency tasks. Despite being matched on age, education, and dementia severity, FTD patients performed worse overall and showed similar impairment in letter and semantic category fluency, whereas AD patients showed greater impairment in semantic category than letter fluency. A measure of the disparity between letter and semantic category fluency (the semantic index) was effective in differentiating FTD from AD patients, and this disparity increased with increasing severity of dementia. These unique patterns of letter and semantic category fluency deficits may be indicative of differences in the relative contribution of frontal-lobe-mediated retrieval deficits and temporal-lobe-mediated semantic deficits in FTD and AD.","1304":"The authors assessed comprehension of carefully matched classes of words, manipulating grammatical subcategory (noun and verb) and semantic (concrete and abstract) characteristics for participants with semantic dementia (SD) or probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants selected the best of four words that matched a verbal description. Participants with AD or SD were significantly impaired with verbs compared with nouns. Moreover, participants with SD showed significantly greater difficulty with motion verbs compared to cognition verbs. The authors argue that two factors contribute to the difficulty with motion verbs for patients with SD. First, the verb semantic network is very poorly organized relative to the noun semantic network, leaving verbs more vulnerable to a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Second, visual feature knowledge is degraded in patients with SD because of the anatomic distribution of the disease in visual association cortex, causing relatively greater difficulty for concrete verbs compared to abstract verbs.","1305":"There is evidence that the cognitive effects of Alzheimer's disease can be seen decades before disease diagnosis. If this is the case, then the apolipoprotein E (APOE) *E4 allele might be expected to have effects on cognitive functioning earlier in the life span. To assess such effects, the authors examined data on the *E4 allele and cognitive functioning from a population sample of 6,560 Caucasians covering the age groups of 20-24, 40-44, and 60-64 years. Participants were assessed on tests of episodic memory, working memory, mental speed, reaction time, and reading vocabulary. Although performance on all tests except reading vocabulary declined across age groups, there was no effect of the APOE *E4 allele at any age. These results indicate that APOE *E4 does not have preclinical effects early in the life span on these cognitive functions. Cognitive aging effects between the ages of 20 and 64 years must not be due to preclinical Alzheimer's disease.","1306":"A. Tales, R. J. Snowden, M. Brown, and G. Wilcock (2006) have questioned the authors' view of a possible interdependence between attentional systems mediating exogenous spatial orienting and phasic alerting as well as the authors' suggestion that phasic alerting deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be influencing their performance on tests of spatial orienting. Consistent with this possibility, both laboratories have previously demonstrated increased spatial orienting and decreased phasic alerting in patients with AD. In Tales et al.'s current study, however, they have instead suggested that their results provide evidence for functional independence between these attentional systems in AD. In this commentary, the authors address the misinterpretations of their study and evaluate the degree to which Tales et al.'s study addresses the issues that they raise. Given Tales et al.'s difficulty performing analyses on response time data because of variance issues, the presence of a reduced (although not significant) alerting effect in Tales et al.'s AD group (consistent with the authors' previous findings), and a potential floor effect in their measure of alerting, the authors question the validity of Tales et al.'s conclusions and reaffirm their position that not considering interactions among attentional systems can lead to inaccurate characterizations of the mechanisms by which they operate.","1307":"Recently, researchers (E. Festa-Martino, B. R. Ott, &amp; W. C. Heindel, 2004; A. Tales, J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, R. Jones, &amp; R. J. Snowden, 2002; A. Tales, J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, &amp; R. J. Snowden, 2002 have found significantly abnormal spatial orienting together with the abolishment of the alerting effect in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these research groups differed in their interpretation of the results. A. Tales, J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, R. Jones, and R. J. Snowden (2002) and A. Tales, J. L. Muir, A. Bayer, and R. J. Snowden (2002) explained their data in terms of two independent processes, whereas E. Festa-Martino et al. (2004) interpreted their findings as indicative of an inverse association, namely that the increased spatial orienting effect in AD was the direct result of the abolition of the phasic alerting effect. In this further study examining exogenous spatial orienting and phasic alerting, the authors present evidence to suggest that the increased spatial orienting effect in AD is not the result of a decreased phasic alerting effect.","1308":"To investigate medial frontal lobe mediation of human empathy, the authors analyzed the activation areas in statistical parametric maps of 80 studies reporting neural correlates of empathic processing. The meta-analysis revealed 6 spatially distinct activation clusters in the medial part of the frontal lobe dorsal to the intercommissural plane. The most dorsal cluster coincided with the left supplementary motor area (SMA). Rostrally adjacent was a cluster that overlapped with the right pre-SMA. In addition, there were 3 left-hemispheric and 1 right-hemispheric clusters located at the border between the superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyrus. A broad spectrum of cognitive functions were associated with these clusters, including attention to one's own action, which was related to activations in the SMA, and valuation of other people's behavior and ethical categories, which was related to activations in the most rostroventral cluster. These data complement the consistent observation that lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex interfere with a patient's perception of own bodily state, emotional judgments, and spontaneous behavior. The results of the current meta-analysis suggest the medial prefrontal cortex mediates human empathy by virtue of a number of distinctive processing nodes. In this way, the authors' findings suggest differentiated aspects of self-control of behavior.","1309":"The present study tested whether participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) overestimate the incidence frequency of OCD-relevant phenomena and display a decreased hindsight bias for concern-related information, which may represent a maintenance factor for OCD. Thirty participants with OCD and 39 control participants were requested to estimate the incidence frequency of 8 events in each of 4 domains: washing-relevant, checking-relevant, negative, or neutral. Subsequently, participants received the correct statistics for all items and were requested to affectively appraise these. Two hours later participants had to reproduce their initial estimates. No differences emerged between participants with OCD and control participants regarding initial estimates. In case the frequency of an OCD-relevant item was initially largely overestimated, control participants expressed more relief when confronted with the correct solution than participants with OCD, especially for washing-relevant items. The recalled estimates showed a typical hindsight bias (i.e., the reproduced estimates were biased toward the correct response), but with no difference between groups. In sum, participants were normal in their subjective estimates of OCD-relevant events, and there was no evidence for a heightened maintenance of false beliefs.","1310":"To investigate the role of interhemispheric attentional processes, 25 alcoholic and 28 control subjects were tested with a Stroop match-to-sample task and callosal areas were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Stroop color-word stimuli were presented to the left or right visual field (VF) and were preceded by a color cue that did or did not match the word's color. For matching colors, both groups showed a right VF advantage; for nonmatching colors, controls showed a left VF advantage, whereas alcoholic subjects showed no VF advantage. For nonmatch trials, VF advantage correlated with callosal splenium area in controls but not alcoholic subjects, supporting the position that information presented to the nonpreferred hemisphere is transmitted via the splenium to the hemisphere specialized for efficient processing. The authors speculate that alcoholism-associated callosal thinning disrupts this processing route.","1311":"Studies have shown differences in neuropsychological functioning between groups with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and control participants. Because individuals with PTSD often have a history of comorbid alcohol abuse, the extent to which an alcohol confound is responsible for these differences remains a concern. The current study compares neuropsychological testing scores in 4 groups of veterans with and without PTSD (PTSD+ and PTSD-, respectively) and with and without a history of alcohol abuse (ETOH+ and ETOH-, respectively): n for PTSD+\/ETOH- = 30, n for PTSD+\/ETOH- = 37, n for PTSD-\/ETOH+ = 30, and n for PTSD-\/ETOH- = 31. Results showed that PTSD, when alcohol, educational level, vocabulary, and depression are controlled for, was associated with decreased verbal memory, attention, and processing speed performance. Alcohol abuse history was associated with decreased visual memory performance. By controlling for alcohol and depression, the authors can more conclusively demonstrate that verbal memory and attention differences are associated with PTSD.","1312":"Patients with left spatial neglect, patients with right hemisphere damage but no neglect, and a control group were asked to judge the final position of a series of moving targets. Both patient groups showed attentional deficits. All 3 groups demonstrated a forward displacement bias, overestimating the final target position along the object trajectory. However, in both patient groups the size of this forward displacement bias decreased as the distance the target traveled before vanishing increased. For horizontally moving targets, at the maximum distance only the control group showed significant forward displacement. For all 3 groups, the direction in which the target traveled had no influence, but the size of the forward displacement increased as target speed increased. Several attentional explanations of these results are considered, including the differential allocation of spatial attention between central and peripheral locations, differences between exogenous and endogenous attention, and deficits in sustained attention.","1313":"In a previous study, N. Cherbuin and C. Brinkman (2006) showed that in right-handed participants, interhemispheric transfer time (measured with A. T. Poffenberger's, 1912, paradigm) was a significant predictor of the efficiency of hemispheric interactions (measured with a split visual field, letter-matching task). No effect was found for degree of handedness in this study. This was surprising because handedness has been shown to be associated with differences in the morphology and the structure of the corpus callosum, and cerebral anatomical lateralization, as well as functional lateralization both in behavioral and scanning studies. Because these findings were found in a large sample, but one limited to right-handed participants, the aim of the present study was to determine whether a similar relationship was present between interhemispheric transfer time and hemispheric interaction in left-handed participants (using identical measures) and to assess whether the analysis of a larger sample that comprised both left- and right-handed participants might reveal an effect of handedness. Results demonstrate significant handedness effects, suggesting that left-handed individuals tend to have more efficient hemispheric interactions.","1314":"The ordering of words in category fluency lists is indicative of the semantic distance between items in conceptual memory. Several studies have concluded from structural analyses of such data, using cluster analysis or multidimensional scaling, that the semantic memory of patients with schizophrenia is more disorganized than that of controls. Previous studies have based their analyses on a measure of average interitem dissimilarity devised by A. S. Chan et al. (1993). Here the authors derive a new and improved method of determining dissimilarity and show that when this measure is applied to the fluency lists of patients with schizophrenia, the average pattern of organization for the animal category has similar structure to that of controls, but with greater variability between individuals.","1315":"The authors used a predictable, externally cued task-switching paradigm to investigate executive control in a severe closed-head injury (CHI) population. Eighteen individuals with severe CHI and 18 controls switched between classifying whether a digit was odd or even and whether a letter was a consonant or vowel on every 4th trial. The target stimuli appeared in a circle divided into 8 equivalent parts. Presentation of the stimuli rotated clockwise. Participants performed the switching task at both a short (200 ms) and a long (1,000 ms) preparatory interval. Although the participants with CHI exhibited slower response times and greater switch costs, similar to controls, additional preparatory time reduced the switch costs, and the switch costs were limited to the 1st trial in the run. These findings indicate that participants with severe CHI were able to take advantage of time to prepare for the task switch, and the executive control processes involved in the switch costs were completed before the 1st trial of the run ended.","1316":"This study tested the hypothesis that when tasks are complex, response selection and performance monitoring are divided across the hemispheres, and when tasks are simple, response selection and error monitoring are done in the same hemisphere. Using a divided visual field paradigm, the authors presented a target and an interference stimulus, either to the same visual field or to different visual fields, and encouraged error correction. The interference stimulus was timed to interfere with posited error processing. Four tasks were used: bar graph identification, lexical decision, and complex and simple versions of the flankers task. The first three tasks revealed a pattern of contralateral interference, suggesting that error processing occurred in the hemisphere that did not process the initial target. The fourth task showed ipsilateral interference, suggesting that the same hemisphere processed the target and monitored itself. The authors conclude that the pattern of hemispheric cooperation in error processing is affected by task complexity.","1317":"This experiment examines whether the age-related decrease in the generation effect of rhymes is mediated by executive functioning. Young and elderly adults read and generated pairs of rhyming words for subsequent recall. Participants were also administered neuropsychological tests (executive and mnemonic functions). Results showed that elderly adults performed less well on the neuropsychological tests and benefited less than the younger participants from the generation effect. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the executive functions composite score was correlated with the generation effect and that it accounted for a large proportion of the age-related variance of the size of this measure. This finding supports the view that the age-related decrement in strategic encoding implementation is due to a decrease of executive functioning.","1318":"In a prospective cohort study, the authors demonstrated a more pronounced epsilon4-related deficit for participants 70 years of age and older in tasks assessing episodic recall. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) and age interacted for episodic memory tasks, whereas the interaction for semantic memory tasks was between APOE and test wave. Heterozygotes of epsilon4 between middle-age and young-old participants performed at a higher level than noncarriers of this allele in recall tasks. A dose effect was found such that carriers of 2 epsilon4 alleles failed more profoundly in acquiring and recollecting episodic information than carriers of 1 epsilon4 allele, who in turn failed more than carriers of non-epsilon4 alleles. The pattern of findings observed for older epsilon4 carriers suggests that these individuals have particular difficulty when the executive task demands are high. Several factors (e.g., smaller hippocampal volumes, less effective neural repair mechanisms) may account for these findings. On the basis of the data obtained, the authors argue that analyses of the effect of specific genes in cognition should be accompanied by assessment of performance at a specific level, with due attention to the individual's age.","1319":"The present study examined whether prospective memory performance discriminates healthy aging from very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and individuals at risk for DAT because of the presence of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 allele. Four groups (young subjects, young-old control subjects, old-old control subjects, and subjects with very mild DAT) engaged in an event-based prospective memory task wherein they responded to a specific word embedded in a general knowledge test. Results indicated that prospective memory performance was clearly impaired in the very mild DAT group relative to the healthy older control groups. Moreover, prospective memory performance appears to capture unique variance in discriminating these 2 groups above and beyond standard retrospective memory tests. However, prospective memory was not affected by ApoE status in the young-old control group and, contrary to predictions, the epsilon4+ old-old control subjects showed better performance than did the epsilon4- subjects. In contrast to the healthy individuals, in the very mild DAT group, epsilon4+ subjects showed deficits in performance relative to the epsilon4- subjects. Discussion focuses on prospective memory as a cognitive indicator of early stage DAT.","1320":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) reduces associative effects on false recognition in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott task, either due to impaired memory for gist or impaired use of gist in memory decisions. Gist processes were manipulated by blocking or mixing studied words according to their associations and by varying the associative strength between studied and nonstudied words at test. Both associative blocking and associative strength had smaller effects on false recognition in AD patients than in control participants, consistent with gist memory impairments. However, unlike the case with control participants, blocking influenced true and false recognition equally in AD patients, demonstrating an overdependence on gist when making memory decisions. AD also impaired item-specific recollections, relative to control participants, as true recognition of studied words was reduced even when the two groups were equated on gist-based false recognition. We propose that the overdependence on degraded gist memory in AD is caused by even larger impairments in item-specific recollections.","1321":"Several core characteristics of the psychopathic personality disorder (i.e., impulsivity, failure to attend to interpersonal cues) suggest that psychopaths suffer from disordered attention. However, there is mixed evidence from the cognitive literature as to whether they exhibit superior or deficient selective attention, which has led to the formation of several distinct theories of attentional functioning in psychopathy. The present experiment investigated participants' abilities to purposely allocate attentional resources on the basis of auditory or visual linguistic information and directly tested both theories of deficient or superior selective attention in psychopathy. Specifically, 91 male inmates at a county jail were presented with either auditory or visual linguistic cues (with and without distractors) that correctly indicated the position of an upcoming visual target in 75% of the trials. The results indicated that psychopaths did not exhibit evidence of superior selective attention in any of the conditions but were generally less efficient in shifting attention on the basis of linguistic cues, especially in regard to auditory information. Implications for understanding psychopaths' cognitive functioning and possible neuropsychological deficits are addressed.","1322":"A number of methodological questions have been raised about the reliability and validity of measuring executive functioning (EF) across multiple time points. In this study, correlational and latent-variable analyses were used to examine test-retest reliability of 5 common measures of EF and the stability of a latent EF construct. One hundred eighteen nondemented older adults were tested twice over a 4- to 8-week period. Findings demonstrated modest reliability of individual EF measures but very high stability of a latent EF construct. Relative contributions of each measure to the latent EF factor did not change across measurement trials. In addition, age-related effects on EF were similar at the 2 time points and were within the expected range. Implications for future studies of EF are discussed.","1323":"Nonambiguous idiom comprehension was assessed in 15 right brain-damaged (RBD) and 12 left brain-damaged (LBD) aphasic patients by means of a string-to-picture matching task. Idiom comprehension was found to be severely impaired with a bias toward literal interpretation. The RBD patients, though impaired, performed significantly better than LBD patients; their performance was correlated with visuospatial abilities and was significantly affected by lesion site. The results of this study suggest that the performance of RBD patients in the comprehension of idiomatic sentences may be affected by (a) an involvement of the frontal lobe and\/or (b) visuospatial deficits that may impair their performance on the picture-matching task.","1324":"Functional MRI was used to examine language lateralization of Chinese characters and English words associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in Chinese-English bilinguals with left or right TLE. The results suggest that the neural basis of processing Chinese and English seems to be different, as normal controls demonstrated left hemispheric lateralization in reading English words but bi-hemispheric lateralization in reading Chinese characters. This difference in the neural bases of Chinese and English processing was found to affect the patterns in change-of-language processing associated with TLE. That is, whereas left-TLE patients were more likely than right-TLE patients to demonstrate a bi-hemispheric language involvement in reading English, both left- and right-TLE patients demonstrated primarily bilateral hemispheric involvement for reading Chinese characters.","1325":"In this study, the cognitive and neurochemical factors underlying learned irrelevance, one of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for attentional set-shifting deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD), were investigated. In a visual discrimination learning task, the extent to which a target dimension was irrelevant prior to an extra-dimensional shift was varied. Twenty patients with PD and 22 healthy participants performed the task twice, with patients tested on and off L-dopa. The patients made more errors than control participants in the condition in which the target dimension was completely irrelevant prior to the extradimensional shift, but not when it was partially reinforced. Moreover, L-dopa had no effect on the patients' task performance, despite improving their working memory. These results confirm that learned irrelevance is a significant factor in accounting for attentional set-shifting deficits in patients with PD, although unlike other executive impairments in this group, the phenomenon appears to be unrelated to their central dopaminergic deficit.","1326":"Two experiments examined different forms of gist and detail memory in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In Experiment 1, 14 AD, 14 MCI, and 22 control participants were assessed with the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. Results indicated that false recognition of nonstudied critical lures (gist memory) was diminished in the AD compared with the MCI and control groups; the two latter cohorts performed similarly. In Experiment 2, 14 AD, 20 MCI, and 26 control participants were tested on a text memory task. Results revealed that recall of both macropropositions (gist information) and micropropositions (detail information) decreased significantly in AD and in MCI as compared with control participants. This experiment also revealed that the impairment was comparable between gist and detail memory. In summary, the results were consistent across experiments in the AD but not in the MCI participants. The discrepancy in MCI participants might be explained by differences in the degree of sensitivity of the experimental procedures and\/or by the differences in the cognitive processes these procedures assessed.","1327":"Action naming has been reported to be disproportionately impaired in comparison to object naming in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This finding has been attributed to the crucial role of frontal cortex in action naming. The investigation of object and action naming in the different subtypes of FTD, as well as in the related conditions of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), may thus contribute to the elucidation of the cerebral correlates of the action-object discrepancy as well as provide clues to the underlying cognitive mechanisms. The results indicated that, with the exception of semantic dementia, action naming was more impaired than object naming in all patient groups. The discrepancy was similar in frontal variant of FTD and Alzheimer's disease patients, whereas patients with nonfluent primary progressive aphasia, PSP, and CBD were significantly more impaired in the oral production of actions than of objects. These findings indicate that action naming impairment is not a general feature of FTD, but rather is associated with conditions that affect the frontoparietal-subcortical circuits involved in action knowledge and action representation.","1328":"Age-related gross head size; adjusted age-related change in brain volume and carotid and basilar blood flow; as well as scores on 3 tests of fluid intelligence (gf), 2 tests of information-processing speed, 2 memory tests, and 3 tests of executive function were obtained from 69 volunteers aged from 62 to 84 years. Brain volume negatively predicted scores on all 10 cognitive tasks, accounting for up to 78% of age-related variance in scores on the speed tasks and on 1 executive task. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively predicted scores on 8 cognitive tasks, accounting for up to 36% of age-related variance in speed scores. However, neither brain volume nor CBF accounted for significant age-related variance between individuals on any of 3 gf tests. We conclude that speed, but not gf, is an exceptionally sensitive behavioral index of the progress of gross brain changes that affect cognition in old age and that speed and gf do not reflect integrity of the same functional systems.","1329":"Older adults have been hypothesized to show reduced priming relative to younger adults on implicit memory tests that require production of a response because these tasks place high demands on attentional processes associated with frontal lobe function, which are often reduced with age (see D. A. Fleischman &amp; J. D. E. Gabrieli, 1998). The current study directly tested this frontal lobe hypothesis of age effects in production priming. Younger adults and older adults who differed in their attentional abilities as measured by a battery of neuropsychological tests were given two production priming tasks, word stem completion and category production, followed by explicit free recall tests. Results showed that explicit memory performance was reduced by age and older adults' frontal functioning. Age and frontal functioning influenced category production priming but not word stem completion priming. Results failed to support the frontal account of age reductions in production priming. Instead, results implicate the influence of other processes often involved in production priming tasks, such as explicit memory strategies and response competition, as critical for understanding age effects in implicit memory performance.","1330":"Verbal working memory involves two major components: a phonological store that holds auditory-verbal information very briefly and an articulatory rehearsal process that allows that information to be refreshed and thus held longer in short-term memory (A. Baddeley, 1996, 2000; A. Baddeley &amp; G. Hitch, 1974). In the current study, the authors tested two groups of patients who were chosen on the basis of their relatively focal lesions in the inferior parietal (IP) cortex or inferior frontal (IF) cortex. Patients were tested on a series of tasks that have been previously shown to tap phonological storage (span, auditory rhyming, and repetition) and articulatory rehearsal (visual rhyming and a 2-back task). As predicted, IP patients were disproportionately impaired on the span, rhyming, and repetition tasks and thus demonstrated a phonological storage deficit. IF patients, however, did not show impairment on these storage tasks but did exhibit impairment on the visual rhyming task, which requires articulatory rehearsal. These findings lend further support to the working memory model and provide evidence of the roles of IP and IF cortex in separable working memory processes.","1331":"Recent theories have suggested that resistance to interference is a unifying principle of executive function and that individual differences in interference may be explained by executive function (M. J. Kane &amp; R. W. Engle, 2002). Measures of executive function, memory, and perceptual speed were obtained from 121 older adults (ages 63-82). We used structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships of these constructs with interference in a working memory task. Executive function was best described as two related subcomponent processes: shifting and updating goal-relevant representations and inhibition of proactive interference. These subcomponents were distinct from verbal and visual memory and speed. Individual differences in interference susceptibility and recollection were best predicted by shifting and updating and by resistance to proactive interference, and variability in familiarity was predicted by resistance to proactive interference and speed.","1332":"Functional neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia have demonstrated abnormal activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during working memory (WM) performance. However, findings of increased and decreased activity have been reported. The authors used meta-analysis to investigate whether diverging results arise as a function of differential WM task performance between patients and control participants. Results indicate that the magnitude of the group difference in WM performance is a moderator of DLPFC activation differences, and concepts such as hypo- or hyperfrontality do not universally characterize WM findings in schizophrenia. Thus, the variability in the WM activation findings between participants with schizophrenia and control participants reflects the specific conditions under which WM functions are evaluated, not just the WM construct per se.","1333":"The aim of the present study was to examine impairment of implicit learning in Parkinson's disease (PD) by means of a meta-analysis of studies that used the serial reaction time (SRT) task. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published journal articles (1987-2005) that used the SRT task with patients with PD. The principal outcome measures used to compare studies were (a) the difference in reaction time between the last block of ordered sequence trials and the randomized block for PD and control participants and (b) fixed and random effects pooled estimates by the inverse weighting method. Six studies, including 67 patients with PD, met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that implicit learning was impaired in PD, relative to healthy controls, with a standardized mean difference of 0.73 (95% confidence interval = 0.38, 1.07). Implicit sequence learning appears to be impaired in patients with PD. Some common methodological weaknesses and limitations in the reporting of statistical data are discussed.","1334":"Partial knowledge is a common but rarely studied consequence of damage to conceptual representations and is characterized by the retained ability to retrieve crude, superordinate information but not specific, detailed information about a conceptual entity. Previous studies have described partial knowledge for concrete items particularly following semantic dementia (SD). The present study was designed to investigate the occurrence of partial knowledge effects in the conceptual domain of abstract words. A novel 3-level synonym comprehension test was administered to 9 patients with SD, 20 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 40 healthy control subjects. All subject groups showed weaker performance on tasks requiring a fine specification of word meaning compared with those for which a broad sense of meaning or valence was necessary. However, this gradient of partial knowledge was significantly greater for SD and AD subjects than for controls. These results demonstrate that partial knowledge is a general property of a degraded knowledge base and is not restricted to the concrete word domain. It constitutes a normal phenomenon that is exacerbated in the context of neurodegenerative disease.","1335":"The influence of aging and frontal function on the neural correlates of regulative and evaluative control was examined by means of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The behavioral data indicated that interference was greater for older than for younger adults and that this difference was mediated by frontal function. The ERP data revealed effects of aging on the neural correlates of both regulative and evaluative control. Prestimulus neural activity was correlated with response time and frontal function, and these relationships were moderated by the response-to-stimulus interval (RSI); the poststimulus data also revealed age-related differences in the neural correlates of evaluative control that interacted with RSI. These data support predictions derived from the context processing deficit theory of aging.","1336":"An underlying theme common to prominent theoretical accounts of cognition in schizophrenia is that information processing is disproportionately influenced by recently\/currently encountered information relative to the influence of previously learned information. In this study, the authors tested this account by using the hindsight bias or knew-it-all-along (KIA) paradigm, which demonstrates that newly acquired knowledge influences recall of past events. In line with the account that patients with schizophrenia display a disproportionately strong influence of recently encountered information relative to the influence of previously learned information, patients displayed a KIA effect that was significantly greater than in controls. This result is discussed in the context of the cognitive underpinnings of the KIA effect and delusion formation.","1337":"Working memory theories heavily rely on the concept of processing resources and the their efficient deployment. Some recent work with schizophrenia-spectrum patients has suggested that many associated cognitive impairments may be reduced to deficits in working memory, possibly related to reductions in information-processing capacity resources. In this study, 38 patients with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD), 22 patients with other personality disorders, and 14 healthy comparison participants performed a dual-task processing assessment that was designed specifically for use in this type of study. Participants recalled lists of digits at their predetermined maximum digit span and performed box-checking tests, first alone and then in a dual-task format. Instructions included equal prioritization of both tasks. SPD patients had significantly shorter digit spans, and they also showed more deterioration on both tasks. Performance operating characteristics curves indicated that SPD patients' reduced performance was not due to abnormal resource allocation strategies leading to strategic failures. The authors discuss the implications of these processing capacity limitations for understanding both the signature of cognitive impairment within the schizophrenia spectrum and general abnormalities in working memory.","1338":"An impairment in the build-up and use of context has been proposed as a core feature of schizophrenia. The current study tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients show impairments in building up context within sentences because of abnormalities in combining semantic with syntactic information. Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls read and made acceptability judgments about sentences containing verbs that were semantically associated with individual preceding words but that violated either the meaning (animacy\/semantic constraints) or the syntactic structure (morphosyntactic constraints) of their preceding contexts. To override these semantic associations and determine that such sentences are unacceptable, participants must integrate semantic with syntactic information. These sentences were compared with congruous and pragmatically\/semantically violated sentences that imposed fewer semantic-syntactic integration demands. At sentence-final words and decisions, patients showed smaller reaction time differences than controls to animacy\/semantically violated or morphosyntactically violated sentences relative to pragmatically\/semantically violated or nonviolated sentences. The relative insensitivity to these violations in patients with schizophrenia may arise from impairments in combining semantic and syntactic information to build up sentence context.","1339":"Faulty inhibition is theorized to be a central feature in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it remains unclear whether inhibitory impairments encompass both motoric and attentional domains. Further, characterization of inhibitory deficits in adults with ADHD is needed. We experimentally assessed adults who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD and a subgroup who had partially remitted. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) subtype effects were also examined. Motoric inhibition was assessed with the antisaccade task, and attentional inhibition was assessed with the attentional blink (AB) task. Antisaccade results replicated prior findings of extended latencies and increased anticipatory saccades in ADHD. Errors, however, appeared to be epiphenomenal to ADHD as they were absent when symptoms had partially remitted. Anticipatory saccades appeared as potential core problems that remained even when symptoms had improved. Differential response patterns were found for predominantly inattentive and combined subtypes, with the latter showing increasing anticipatory movements with increasing fixation time. In the AB task, ADHD groups committed more errors but showed no convincing evidence of an abnormal blink. These results demonstrate clear effects on motoric inhibition but not attentional inhibition in adults with ADHD.","1340":"Following a distributed network model of visuospatial attention, the authors used an A-X version of the Continuous Performance Test and a covert orienting paradigm to examine the vigilance, anterior, and posterior attention systems. Compared with control participants without attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), children with the predominantly inattentive (ADHD-I) and combined (ADHD-C) subtypes had lower sensitivity (d') to detect targets from nontargets. Children with ADHD-C, but not ADHD-I, additionally had a highly activated response style (lnbeta). Performance for both subtypes decreased to a greater extent over time in a manner consistent with problems in sustained attention. Together, these results suggest the presence of vigilance system deficits in participants with both ADHD subtypes. However, consistent with previous meta-analytic work, there was no evidence for anterior or posterior system orienting dysfunctions in either subtype.","1341":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is clinically heterogeneous. The authors examined how specific OCD symptom dimensions were related to neuropsychological functions using multiple regression analyses. A total of 39 OCD patients and 40 controls completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; A. Bechara, A. R. Damasio, H. Damasio, &amp; S. W. Anderson, 1994), which is a test of decision making, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (R. K. Heaton, 1981), which is a test of set shifting. OCD patients and controls showed comparable decision making. However, patients with prominent hoarding symptoms showed impaired decision making on the IGT as well as reduced skin conductance responses. OCD patients had poorer set shifting abilities than controls, and symmetry\/ordering symptoms were negatively associated with set shifting. These results help explain previous inconsistent findings in neuropsychological research in OCD and support recent neuroimaging data showing dissociable neural mechanisms involved in mediating the different OCD symptom dimensions.","1342":"Most studies into acquired theory of mind (ToM) deficits assessed patients once, long after the onset of brain injury. As a result, the time course of acquired ToM impairments is largely unknown. The present study examined whether ToM impairments following traumatic brain injury (TBI) recover, remain stable, or worsen over time. Because of the alleged association between ToM and social communication, ToM impairments may deteriorate because of changes in patients' social environment following injury. ToM ability and executive functioning were assessed shortly after injury and at 1-year follow-up. Compared with the orthopedic control group, the TBI group was impaired on ToM and executive functioning tasks at both assessments. Furthermore, the ToM impairments in the TBI group remained stable over time.","1343":"Random number generation (RNG) is a functionally complex process that is highly controlled and therefore dependent on Baddeley's central executive. This study addresses this issue by investigating whether key predictions from this framework are compatible with empirical data. In Experiment 1, the effect of increasing task demands by increasing the rate of the paced generation was comprehensively examined. As expected, faster rates affected performance negatively because central resources were increasingly depleted. Next, the effects of participants' exposure were manipulated in Experiment 2 by providing increasing amounts of practice on the task. There was no improvement over 10 practice trials, suggesting that the high level of strategic control required by the task was constant and not amenable to any automatization gain with repeated exposure. Together, the results demonstrate that RNG performance is a highly controlled and demanding process sensitive to additional demands on central resources (Experiment 1) and is unaffected by repeated performance or practice (Experiment 2). These features render the easily administered RNG task an ideal and robust index of executive function that is highly suitable for repeated clinical use.","1344":"The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between subjective fatigue and selective attention deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Forty-six participants with mild-severe TBI and 46 healthy controls completed fatigue scales (Visual Analogue Scale--Fatigue, Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS] and Causes of Fatigue Questionnaire [COF]), and attentional measures including subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention, and the Complex Selective Attention Task (C-SAT). TBI participants reported greater fatigue on the FSS and COF, performed more slowly on attentional measures, and made more errors on the C-SAT. After controlling for anxiety and depression, fatigue was significantly correlated with performance only on the C-SAT. Findings suggest a relationship between subjective fatigue and impairment on tasks requiring higher order attentional processes.","1345":"Impairment in the inhibitory mechanism of visual selective attention in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. The present study sought to understand disparate findings in a manner analogous to the relative preservation of exogenously evoked movement and impairment of endogenously evoked movement. The authors examined inhibition of return (i.e., exogenously evoked inhibition; IOR) and negative priming (i.e., endogenously evoked inhibition; NP) in a group of 14 patients with PD and 14 healthy controls (HC). Unlike the HC, who demonstrated significant inhibition in both tasks, the group with PD demonstrated intact inhibition only in the IOR task. Dopamine replacement therapy did not affect performance. The findings are discussed within the context of a model that differentiates the essential involvement of the basal ganglia for endogenously evoked spatial inhibition.","1346":"Attention deficits are a hallmark of the teratogenic effects of alcohol. However, characterization of these deficits remains inconclusive. Children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and nonexposed controls were evaluated using a paradigm consisting of three conditions: visual focus, auditory focus, and auditory-visual shift of attention. For the focus conditions, participants responded manually to visual or auditory targets. For the shift condition, participants alternated responses between visual targets and auditory targets. For the visual focus condition, alcohol-exposed children had lower accuracy and slower reaction time for all intertarget intervals (ITIs), while on the auditory focus condition, alcohol-exposed children were less accurate but displayed slower reaction time only on the longest ITI. Finally, for the shift condition, the alcohol-exposed group was accurate but had slowed reaction times. These results indicate that children with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure have pervasive deficits in visual focused attention and deficits in maintaining auditory attention over time. However, no deficits were noted in the ability to disengage and reengage attention when required to shift attention between visual and auditory stimuli, although reaction times to shift were slower.","1347":"Decision making was assessed using a laboratory gambling task in 67 adults with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV+) and in 19 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) control participants. Neurocognitive test performance across several domains was also analyzed to examine potential cognitive mechanisms of gambling task performance. As predicted, the HIV+ group performed worse on the gambling task, indicating greater risky decision making. Specifically, the HIV+ group selected more cards from the \"risky\" or disadvantageous deck that included relatively large payoffs but infrequent large penalties. The control group also selected such risky cards but quickly learned to avoid them. Exploratory analyses also indicated that in the HIV+ group, but not in the control group, gambling task performance was correlated with Stroop Interference performance and long delay free recall on the California Verbal Learning Test, suggesting the role of inhibitory processes and verbal memory in the poorer gambling task performance in HIV. These findings indicate the usefulness of the gambling task as a laboratory tool to examine risky decision making and cognition in the HIV population.","1348":"While it is generally agreed that the right fusiform gyrus is specialized for face recognition, the question of whether knowledge about persons is lateralized in the temporal lobes is more contentious. Does knowledge about people differ from other kinds of object knowledge with respect to brain laterality? Are side-of-lesion effects mediated by stimulus modality? This study aimed to investigate these questions by comparing patients with left temporal (LT) (n=8) and right temporal (RT) (n=11) lesions to control subjects (n=12) on verbal and visual tests of people, buildings, and objects. The RT group was impaired at recognizing famous faces, but not at choosing the picture of a famous building or a famous name from nonfamous distracters. The LT group was impaired at naming people, buildings, and objects, regardless of stimulus modality. When presemantic processing was controlled for, neither patient group was impaired in producing person-specific knowledge to faces or names, supporting the notion that semantic knowledge for people as for other kinds of objects, is stored in a distributed network across both hemispheres, regardless of stimulus modality.","1349":"Experiment 1 found that mixed-handedness, which is associated with increased interaction between the left and right cerebral hemispheres relative to strong right-handedness, was associated with an earlier offset of childhood amnesia. In Experiment 2, bilateral saccadic eye movements, which have been shown to enhance interhemispheric interaction, were also associated with an earlier offset of childhood amnesia. These results build upon a growing body of research indicating an interhemispheric basis for the retrieval of episodic memories. Moreover, the results of Experiment 2 suggest that interhemispheric interaction has its effect on the retrieval, not encoding, of episodic memories.","1350":"Using semantic dementia (SD) as a reference point, the authors assessed semantic memory in four other neurodegenerative disorders: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), frontal variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Individuals with SD were more impaired than other groups on semantic measures and showed a characteristic pattern across tasks: category fluency (CF) worse than letter fluency (LF), naming worse than comprehension, and visual and verbal comprehension equally affected, suggesting disruption to an amodal semantic system. Individuals with AD demonstrated a similar pattern to a milder degree. Although PNFA, fvFTD, and PCA groups had abnormal scores (relative to controls) on most semantic measures, their differing patterns across measures indicate that the apparent semantic impairment in these conditions is largely secondary to other factors.","1351":"The neuropsychological substrate of scripts, routines which guide much of human behavior, is unclear. We propose a model of script comprehension characterized by the interaction of semantic knowledge for script content, and executive resources that organize this knowledge into goal directed behavior. We examined these neuropsychological components by asking participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (behavioral disorder\/dysexecutive syndrome (BDD) and semantic dementia (SD) subtypes), to judge the coherence of four-phrase scripts. The BDD group detected significantly fewer sequencing errors than semantic errors; the AD and SD groups detected these errors with equal frequency. Independent semantic measures predicted both semantic and sequencing script errors, while executive measures predicted sequencing errors only. Findings support a multi-component model of script comprehension.","1352":"Research has suggested that semantic processing deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) are related to striatal dopamine deficiency. As an investigation of the influence of dopamine on semantic activation in PD, 7 participants with PD performed a lexical-decision task when on and off levodopa medication. Seven healthy controls matched to the participants with PD in terms of sex, age, and education also participated in the study. By use of a multipriming paradigm, whereby 2 prime words were presented prior to the target word, semantic priming effects were measured across stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 250 ms and 1,200 ms. The results revealed a similar pattern of priming across SOAs for the control group and the PD participants on medication. In contrast, within-group comparisons revealed that automatic semantic activation was compromised in PD participants when off medication. The implications of these results for the neuromodulatory influence of dopamine on semantic processing in PD are discussed.","1353":"Although it might seem that people with schizophrenia would perform poorly on measures of emotion-based learning, several studies have shown normal levels of performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; C. E. Y. Evans, C. H. Bowman, &amp; O. H. Turnbull, 2005; L. M. Ritter, J. H. Meador-Woodruff, &amp; G. W. Dalack, 2004; B. Shurman, W. P. Horan, &amp; K. H. Nuechterlein, 2005; K. E. Wilder, D. R. Weinberger, &amp; T. E. Goldberg, 1998). The present article describes a newly developed modification of the IGT involving initial familiarization with the basic contingency pattern then 3 periods of contingency shift. Control participants showed substantial gains during the later trials of each shift period. Analyzed in terms of positive symptoms, those with schizophrenia were little different from control participants. Those high in negative symptoms could perform the basic task but showed remarkably poor performances (no better than chance) in the shift phases, retaining a preference for decks that had previously been \"good,\" even when they experienced substantial losses.","1354":"Previous work has shown that individuals with psychopathy are impaired on some forms of associative learning, particularly stimulus-reinforcement learning (Blair et al., 2004; Newman &amp; Kosson, 1986). Animal work suggests that the acquisition of stimulus-reinforcement associations requires the amygdala (Baxter &amp; Murray, 2002). Individuals with psychopathy also show impoverished reversal learning (Mitchell, Colledge, Leonard, &amp; Blair, 2002). Reversal learning is supported by the ventrolateral and orbitofrontal cortex (Rolls, 2004). In this paper we present experiments investigating stimulus-reinforcement learning and relearning in patients with lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala, and individuals with developmental psychopathy without known trauma. The results are interpreted with reference to current neurocognitive models of stimulus-reinforcement learning, relearning, and developmental psychopathy.","1355":"The objective of the present study was to examine the role of the corpus callosum (CC) in dichotic listening. For this purpose, 40 right-handed healthy male participants were assessed with morphological and diffusion tensor imaging, which yielded macrostructural (midsagittal area) and microstructural (mean diffusion, fractional anisotropy) measures of the total CC and predefined subregions. Applying the standard consonant-vowel Bergen Dichotic Listening Test (including 3 different attentional instructions), the authors found dichotic listening performance to be substantially related to the integrity of the CC at both macro- and microstructural levels. Results indicate a dual role of the CC; it is relevant not only for the stimulus-driven (bottom-up) transfer of left-ear input to the left hemisphere but also for its attentional (top-down) modulation.","1356":"In contrast to the standard use of regression, in which an individual's score on the dependent variable is unknown, neuropsychologists are often interested in comparing a predicted score with a known obtained score. Existing inferential methods use the standard error for a new case (s-subN+1) to provide confidence limits on a predicted score and hence are tailored to the standard usage. However, s-subN+1 can be used to test whether the discrepancy between a patient's predicted and obtained scores was drawn from the distribution of discrepancies in a control population. This method simultaneously provides a point estimate of the percentage of the control population that would exhibit a larger discrepancy. A method for obtaining confidence limits on this percentage is also developed. These methods can be used with existing regression equations and are particularly useful when the sample used to generate a regression equation is modest in size. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the validity of the methods, and computer programs that implement them are described and made available.","1357":"The present study examined the source of explicit category learning deficits previously noted in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Task stimuli consisted of 4 binary-valued cues that together determined category assignment, although some cues were more important for the categorization decision. Participants verbalized the hypotheses being tested to provide several measures of the hypothesis testing. Analyses of these verbal protocols indicated that PD patients were impaired on rule generation and selection but not rule shifting. Patients had particular difficulty noting the relative importance of the cues. Specific aspects of performance were differently correlated with neuropsychological measures of working memory and hypothesis testing ability. Together, the results suggest that the cognitive processes required for explicit category learning are mediated by partially distinct neural mechanisms.","1358":"Hemispheric asymmetry was examined for Urdu-English bilinguals identifying printed Urdu words and nonwords, separated Urdu letter strings, digits, and English nonwords. In all cases, fewer errors occurred when stimuli were presented to the right visual field\/left hemisphere (RVF\/LH) than to the left visual field\/right hemisphere (LVF\/RH). Qualitative error patterns suggested that separated Urdu letter strings were processed more serially than Urdu letter strings joined to form words or pronounceable nonwords and more serially on RVF\/LH than on LVF\/RH trials. This qualitative laterality effect is similar to that found for Hebrew and Arabic but opposite that found for English and suggests that the qualitative manner of processing printed verbal material is influenced by language-specific factors such as scanning direction, orthographic-to-phonological mapping rules, and morphology.","1359":"The authors used affective modulation of the eyeblink startle response to examine the impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on emotional reactions to pictures. Participants were 13 individuals with severe TBI and 24 controls. Participants were presented with pictures that differed in affective valence (e.g., mutilated bodies, erotic couples, and household objects) while the eyeblink startle response to an acoustic probe was measured. Startle amplitude was used to assess valence of emotional response, and startle latency was used to index interest in the pictures. Subjective ratings of the affect and arousal elicited by the various pictures were also obtained. TBI impaired startle potentiation to unpleasant pictures but not startle attenuation to pleasant pictures. Further, subjective ratings indicated that TBI participants found unpleasant pictures less arousing than did controls. The results are consistent with recent evidence of differential impairment in negative versus positive emotions after TBI and are discussed in relation to 2 competing explanations of startle modulation.","1360":"The authors examined the relationship between cognition and gait velocity, performed with and without interference, in elderly participants. Neuropsychological test scores from 186 cognitively normal elders were submitted to factor analysis that yielded 3 factors: Verbal IQ, Speed\/Executive Attention, and Memory. Regression analyses revealed that these factors were significant predictors of variance in gait velocity, but the relationship varied as a function of task condition. All 3 factors predicted gait velocity without interference. However, the Speed\/Executive Attention and Memory factors but not Verbal IQ predicted gait velocity in the interference condition. These findings suggest that gait velocity and cognitive function may have both shared and independent brain substrates. Future studies should explore gait velocity and cognitive function as predictors of dementia and falls.","1361":"The authors examined the factor structure of 4 indicators of executive functioning derived from 2 new (i.e., Hayling and Brixton) and 2 traditional (i.e., Stroop and Color Trails) tests. Data were from a cross-sectional sample of 55- to 85-year-old healthy adults (N=427) from the Victoria Longitudinal Study. Confirmatory factor analysis (LISREL 8.52) tested both a 2-factor model of Inhibition (Hayling, Stroop) and Shifting (Brixton, Color Trails) and a single-factor model. The 2-factor model did not fit the data because the covariance matrix of the factors was not positive definite. The single-factor model fit the data well, chi(2)(2, N=427)=0.32, p=.85, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA)=.00, comparative fit index (CFI)=1.00, goodness-of-fit index (GFI)=1.00. Moreover, the single-factor structure of executive functioning was invariant (configural and metric) across gender, and invariant (configural with limited metric) across age. Structural relations showed that poorer executive functioning performance was related to older age and lower fluid intelligence, chi(2)(11, N=418)=23.04, p=.02, RMSEA=.05, CFI=.97, GFI=.98.","1362":"Recognition can be guided by familiarity, a restricted form of retrieval devoid of contextual recall, or by recollection, which occurs when retrieval is sufficient to support the full experience of remembering an episode. Recollection and familiarity were disentangled by testing recognition memory using silhouette object drawings, high target-foil resemblance, and both yes-no and forced-choice procedures. Theoretically, forced-choice recognition could be mediated by familiarity alone. Alzheimer's disease and its preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), were associated with memory impairments that were greater on the yes-no test. Remarkably, forced-choice recognition was unequivocally normal in patients with MCI compared with age-matched controls. Neuropathology in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, known to be present in MCI, presumably disrupted recollection while leaving familiarity-based recognition intact.","1363":"Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched controls were compared on a series of tasks designed to measure errors of mis-attribution, the act of attributing a memory or idea to an incorrect source. Mis-attribution was indexed through the illusory truth effect, the tendency for participants to judge previously encountered information to be true. Cognitive theories have suggested that the illusory truth effect reflects the mis-attribution of experimentally produced familiarity (a nonspecific sense that an item has been previously encountered) to the veracity of previously encountered information. Consistent with earlier suggestions that AD impairs both familiarity and recollection (specific memory for contextual details of the study episode), AD patients demonstrated significantly fewer mis-attribution errors under conditions in which the illusory truth effect is thought to rely on relative familiarity (uncued condition), but more mis-attribution errors under conditions thought to rely on relative amounts of contextual recollection (cued condition). These results help further specify the precise nature of memory impairments in AD.","1364":"The corpus callosum (CC) is essential to hemispheric interaction, but it is unclear how individual callosal properties affect interaction between the cerebral hemispheres. A number of studies have demonstrated some relationship between morphology or structure of the CC and measures of hemispheric interaction. However, to the authors' knowledge, none of these studies has been able to show a clear, direct relationship between a behavioral measure of transfer speed through the CC, interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT), and a behavioral measure of hemispheric interaction. Eighty participants were tested over 6 sessions on 2 tasks assessing IHTT and hemispheric interaction. The Poffenberger paradigm was used to measure IHTT, and a divided split-visual-field letter-matching task was used to assess hemispheric interaction. A significant correlation that could not be accounted for by other factors such as functional lateralization, handedness, age, sex, or attention was found between these 2 measures. These results are discussed in relation to CC morphology and structure and functional and structural hemispheric lateralization.","1365":"The authors' goal was to assess neuropsychological performance in girls with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and evaluate the role of comorbid learning disabilities (LDs). Participants were 140 girls with ADHD and 122 girls without ADHD, ages 6-17 years. Neuropsychological performance was measured in a standardized manner, blind to clinical status. LD was defined by a combined regression-based and low-achievement classification. ADHD was associated with modest, but significant, neuropsychological impairment, as measured with an aggregate measure of performance and with the Stroop Color-Word Test, independent of age, social class, IQ, and psychiatric comorbidity. Neuropsychological deficits were most pronounced in girls with both ADHD and an LD and in those without medications. These results extend to females the previously documented association of LDs with neuropsychological functioning in males with ADHD.","1366":"Frontal lobe and consequent executive dysfunction have long been related to psychopathy. More recently, there have been suggestions that specific regions of frontal cortex, rather than all of frontal cortex, may be implicated in psychopathy. To examine this issue, the authors presented 25 individuals with psychopathy and 30 comparison individuals with measures preferentially indexing the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; object alternation task), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; spatial alternation task), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; number-Stroop reading and counting tasks). The individuals with psychopathy showed significant impairment on the measure preferentially sensitive to OFC functioning. In contrast, the 2 groups did not show impairment on the measures preferentially sensitive to the functioning of the DLPFC or ACC. These results are interpreted with reference to executive dysfunction accounts of the disorder.","1367":null,"1368":"By combining a flanker task and a cuing task into a single paradigm, the authors assessed the effects of orienting and alerting on conflict resolution and explored how normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) modulate these attentional functions. Orienting failed to enhance conflict resolution; alerting was most beneficial for trials without conflict, as if acting on response criterion rather than on information processing. Alerting cues were most effective in the older groups--healthy aging and AD. Conflict resolution was impaired only in AD. Orienting remained unchanged across groups. These findings provide evidence of different life span developmental and clinical trajectories for each attentional network.","1369":"Intact executive functioning is believed to be required for performance on tasks requiring cognitive estimations. This study used a revised version of a cognitive estimations test (CET) to investigate whether patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were impaired on the CET compared with normal elderly controls (NECs). Neuropsychological tests were administered to determine the relationship between CET performance and other cognitive domains. AD patients displayed impaired CET performance when compared with NECs but MCI patients did not. Negative correlations between tests of working memory (WM) and semantic memory and the CET were found in NECs and AD patients, indicating that these cognitive domains were important for CET performance. Regression analysis suggests that AD patients were unable to maintain semantic information in WM to perform the task. The authors conclude that AD patients display deficits in working memory, semantic memory, and executive function, which are required for adequate CET performance.","1370":"The authors investigated gist memory (the general meaning, idea, or gist conveyed by a collection of items) for categorized color photographs in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using an experimental paradigm in which participants are instructed to respond \"yes\" when a test item fits with a previously studied category, regardless of whether the specific item was actually studied. Compared with controls, the patients endorsed fewer studied items and similar numbers of nonstudied lure items. After the authors corrected for the baseline false-alarm rate, the patients showed a lower level of endorsements for nonstudied lure items compared with that of controls, suggesting that their gist memory is impaired. Implications of these findings for understanding gist memory and response bias in patients with AD are discussed.","1371":"Children treated for medulloblastoma demonstrate a variety of cognitive deficits in addition to white matter and hippocampal neuropathology. This study examined 40 children treated for medulloblastoma as compared with 40 demographically matched controls on the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (D. C. Delis, J. H. Kramer, E. Kaplan, &amp; B. A. Ober, 1994). Results revealed significantly poorer performance on indices of word recall in the patient group as compared with the controls in addition to milder but still significantly poorer recognition memory. These findings suggest that children treated for medulloblastoma demonstrate a mixed profile of memory impairment consisting of both retrieval and recognition deficits. Implications of these findings for understanding neurobehavioral sequelae within pediatric medulloblastoma populations and for designing educational and remediation strategies to be used with these children are discussed.","1372":"This study investigated potential right hemisphere involvement in the verb generation task. Six divided visual field experiments explored cerebral asymmetries for word retrieval in the verb generation task as well as in rhyme generation and immediate and delayed word pronunciation. The typical right visual field\/left hemisphere (RVF\/LH) advantage was observed for pronunciation and rhyme generation. For verb generation, the RVF\/LH advantage was obtained only when stimulus items had a single prepotent response and not when there were multiple response alternatives. A semantic priming experiment suggested that activation for less common, related verbs was maintained for a longer time course within the right than within the left hemisphere. The authors suggest that the right hemisphere may play a role in continued activation of semantically related response alternatives in word generation and discuss methodological implications of their findings.","1373":"Prior studies have documented greater impairments in driving performance and greater alcohol consumption among adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examined whether alcohol consumption produces a differentially greater impairment in driving among adults with ADHD in comparison to a community control group. The present study compared 50 adults with ADHD (mean age 33 years) and 40 control adults (mean age 29 years) on the effects of 2 single, acute doses of alcohol (0.04 and 0.08 blood alcohol concentration) and a placebo on their driving performance. The authors used a virtual reality driving simulator, examiner and self-ratings of simulator performance, and a continuous performance test (CPT) to evaluate attention and inhibition. Approximately half of the adults in each group were randomized to either the low or high dose alcohol treatment arms. Alcohol consumption produced a greater impact on the CPT inattention measures of the ADHD than the control group. Similar results were obtained for the behavioral observations taken during the operation of the driving simulator. Driving simulator scores, however, showed mainly a deleterious effect of alcohol on all participants but no differentially greater effect on the ADHD group. The present results demonstrated that alcohol may have a greater detrimental effect on some aspects of driving performance in ADHD than control adults.","1374":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is relatively smaller, and the corpus callosum (CC) larger, in adults with Tourette syndrome (TS). The authors explored the possible roles of the PFC and the CC in mediating interhemispheric interference and coordination in TS adults. They measured performance on M. Kinsbourne and J. Cook's (1971) verbal-manual interference task and on the bimanual Purdue Pegboard in 38 adults with TS and 34 healthy adults. Compared with controls, TS subjects were impaired on the bimanual Purdue Pegboard. On the dual task, right-hand performance did not differ between groups, but the normally expected left-hand advantage (opposite hemisphere condition) was absent in TS subjects. In the control group only, better left-hand performance accompanied larger PFC volumes but not CC cross-sectional area. PFC dysfunction might have precluded executive control of interference in the TS group.","1375":"Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with frontostriatal dysfunction. The extent of any cognitive impairment associated with uncomplicated TS is unclear, as comorbid psychiatric symptomatology is thought to contribute to cognitive deficits. Previous studies have found evidence of mild performance deficits, most commonly on tasks that involve inhibitory processes. The present study evaluated this in carefully screened adult participants with TS. The findings showed the TS group to perform more poorly on one test involving behavioral inhibition (sentence completion), but did not provide strong support for an interpretation based solely on inhibitory deficits, and there was no evidence of impairment on another behavioral inhibition task (flanker test). There were also no differences between the groups on tasks involving working memory (n-back), task switching, or object alternation learning. The findings provide further evidence that uncomplicated TS is associated with only mild, circumscribed impairment. The nature of any impairment is discussed.","1376":"Much is known about outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in school-age children; however, recovery in early childhood is less well understood. Some argue that such injuries should lead to good outcome, because of the plasticity of the developing brain. Other purport that the young brain is vulnerable, with injury likely to result in a substantial impairment (H. G. Taylor &amp; J. Alden, 1997). The aim of this study was to examine outcomes following TBI during early childhood, to plot recovery over the 30 months postinjury, and to identify predictors of outcome. The study compared 3 groups of children sustaining mild, moderate, and severe TBI, ages 2.0 to 6.11 years at injury, with healthy controls. Groups were comparable for preinjury adaptive and behavioral function, psychosocial characteristics, age, and gender. Results suggested a strong association between injury severity and outcomes across all domains. Further, 30-month outcome was predicted by injury severity, family factors, and preinjury levels of child function. In conclusion, children with more severe injuries and lower preinjury adaptive abilities, and whose families are coping poorly, are at greatest risk of long-term impairment in day-to-day skills, even several years postinjury.","1377":"Configural processing in autism was studied in Experiment 1 by using the face inversion effect. A normal inversion effect was observed in the participants with autism, suggesting intact configural face processing. A priming paradigm using partial or complete faces served in Experiment 2 to assess both local and configural face processing. Overall, normal priming effects were found in participants with autism, irrespective of whether the partial face primes were intuitive face parts (i.e., eyes, nose, etc.) or arbitrary segments. An exception, however, was that participants with autism showed magnified priming with single face parts relative to typically developing control participants. The present findings argue for intact configural processing in autism along with an enhanced processing for individual face parts. The face-processing peculiarities known to characterize autism are discussed on the basis of these results and past congruent results with nonsocial stimuli.","1378":"A clinical memory test was administered to 38 high-functioning children with autism and 38 individually matched normal controls, 8-16 years of age. The resulting profile of memory abilities in the children with autism was characterized by relatively poor memory for complex visual and verbal information and spatial working memory with relatively intact associative learning ability, verbal working memory, and recognition memory. A stepwise discriminant function analysis of the subtests found that the Finger Windows subtest, a measure of spatial working memory, discriminated most accurately between the autism and normal control groups. A principal components analysis indicated that the factor structure of the subtests differed substantially between the children with autism and controls, suggesting differing organizations of memory ability.","1379":"The present study compared 20 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with 20 older controls (ages 69-94 years) on their ability to make inferences about emotions and beliefs in others. Six tasks tested their ability to make 1st-order and 2nd-order inferences as well as to offer explanations and moral evaluations of human action by appeal to emotions and beliefs. Results showed that the ability to infer emotions and beliefs in 1st-order tasks remains largely intact in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's. Patients were able to use mental states in the prediction, explanation, and moral evaluation of behavior. Impairment on 2nd-order tasks involving inference of mental states was equivalent to impairment on control tasks, suggesting that patients' difficulty is secondary to their cognitive impairments.

It has been proposed that the key specialization of left TP is for proper nouns (rather than names for persons, per se), which predicts that left TP should support other categories whose members are denoted by proper names (e.g., landmarks). A lesion study tested the hypothesis that impaired naming of famous unique landmarks would be associated with damage to left TP. A Landmark Recognition and Naming Test was administered to participants with lesions to left TP, right TP, or regions outside TP. The results provided strong support for the hypothesis: Landmark naming was significantly inferior in the left group, supporting the hypothesis. The findings converge with previous lesion and functional imaging data to support the idea that the left TP region is important for the retrieval of names for unique entities. This fits the proposal that left TP contains convergence regions that operate as intermediaries between conceptual knowledge retrieval and lexical retrieval for classes of unique stimuli (H. Damasio, D. Tranel, T. J. Grabowski, R. Adolphs, &amp; A. R. Damasio, 2004).","1381":"The effect of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on longitudinal cognitive decline in midlife was investigated with attentional scaling. Healthy individuals (mean age 59.6 years) genotyped for APOE were tested at 3 12-month intervals on a cued visual search task. A random effects model revealed significant interaction in effect of precue size on search speed between APOE-epsilon4 gene dose and assessment, with longitudinal increases in noncarriers and heterozygotes but longitudinal decreases in homozygotes. Association of APOE-epsilon4 with cognitive decline in midlife is consistent with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) prodrome, albeit a decade or more before average age of AD diagnosis. However, cognitive decline in midlife associated with a gene modulating neuronal response to insult argues that the concept of an AD prodrome includes factors that allow as well as cause AD.","1382":"Previous studies have identified cognitive asymmetries in elderly people at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing standardized neuropsychological tests of verbal and spatial abilities in both preclinical AD and apolipoprotein epsilon4+ elderly groups. This prospective study investigated cognitive asymmetries within a single test by comparing cognitively intact elderly (with and without the epsilon4+ allele) on a learning and memory measure that uses global and local visuospatial stimuli. Both groups demonstrated comparable overall learning and recall. But the epsilon4+ group had a significantly larger discrepancy between their global and local learning scores and had a greater proportion of individuals with more than a one standard deviation difference between their immediate recall of the global and local elements, relative to the epsilon4- group. These findings build on previous studies identifying subgroups of elderly people at greater risk for AD who often demonstrate increased cognitive asymmetries relative to groups without significant risk factors.","1383":"Convergent and divergent validity are critically important in developing psychological measures that reveal interpretable deficits in disordered populations. This article reports on 2 studies that evaluated the validity of context processing measures. In Experiment 1, a confirmatory factor analysis of data from 481 healthy adults established the convergent validity of 2 context processing measures and showed that context processing accounted for significant amounts of variance in standard IQ and working memory measures. In Experiment 2, 20 schizophrenia patients, 16 of their healthy siblings, and 28 controls were evaluated using a novel, short context processing measure, the dot pattern expectancy (DPX) task. The DPX was sensitive to specific deficits in schizophrenia patients and their healthy siblings. These findings support the construct validity of context processing measures, suggest context processing is a component of intellectual functioning, and demonstrate that brief context processing measures remain sensitive to psychopathological deficits.","1384":"Patients with frontal-lobe epilepsy (FLE) or temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) and matched control participants were given a design fluency test that assessed nonverbal fluency and switching ability. Patients with FLE generated fewer designs in the switching condition relative to the TLE patients and controls, whereas group differences did not emerge in the basic fluency conditions. When the side of the seizure focus and the presence or absence of a structural lesion were considered in patients with FLE, only those with left-lesional FLE generated fewer designs than controls did in the switching condition. Furthermore, patients with left-lesional and nonlesional FLE produced a greater proportion of set-loss errors than did controls. These results indicate that patients with FLE are impaired when they must simultaneously generate new designs and engage in cognitive switching; however, the pattern of impairment may depend on the side of the seizure focus and the presence of a structural lesion.","1385":"The hippocampus and frontal lobes both contribute to episodic memory performance. In the present study, the authors evaluated the relative contributions of hippocampus, frontal lobes, anterior temporal cortex, and posterior cortex to memory performance in neurodegenerative patients and normal older controls. Subjects (n=42) were studied with structural MRI and a memory paradigm that measured delayed recall, semantic clustering during recall, recognition discriminability, and recognition response bias. Data were analyzed with multiple regression. Consistent with the authors' hypotheses, hippocampal volumes were the best predictor of delayed recall and recognition discriminability, whereas frontal volumes were the best predictor of semantic clustering and response bias. Smaller frontal volumes were associated with less semantic clustering during recall and a more liberal response bias. Results indicate that hippocampal and frontal contributions to episodic memory can be dissociated, with the hippocampus more important for memory accuracy, and frontal structures more important for strategic processing and decision making.","1386":"This longitudinal study examined the development of the brain mechanism involved in phonological decoding in beginning readers using magnetic source imaging. Kindergarten students were assigned to 2 groups: those who showed mastery of skills that are important predictors of proficient reading (low-risk group) and those who initially did not show mastery but later benefited from systematic reading instruction and developed average-range reading skills at the end of Grade 1 (high-risk responders). Spatiotemporal profiles of brain activity were obtained during performance of letter-sound and pseudoword naming tasks before and after Grade 1 instruction. With few exceptions, low-risk children showed early development of brain activation profiles that are typical of older skilled readers. Provided that temporoparietal and visual association areas were recruited into the brain mechanism that supported reading, the majority of high-risk responder children benefited from systematic reading instruction and developed adequate reading abilities.","1387":"Cognitive impairment is well documented in schizophrenia, though some reports have been interpreted to suggest that it is possible to have schizophrenia without neuropsychological impairment. The authors tested this by comparing the neuropsychological profiles of closely matched patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison participants. Sixty-four patients with schizophrenia and 64 healthy comparison cases, matched to within 3 Full-Scale IQ points, were tested using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997b) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997c). Neuropsychological profiles for these groups were markedly different, with the group of patients with schizophrenia exhibiting performance deficits in memory and speeded visual processing but superior verbal comprehension and perceptual organization relative to the group of healthy comparison participants matched on Full-Scale IQ. Thus, scoring in the normal range does not preclude neuropsychological abnormality in schizophrenia, confirming that neuropsychological impairment is a core feature of the illness.","1388":"The authors examined the influence of age and hypertensive status (normotensive, controlled, untreated, or uncontrolled) on several cognitive tests via multiple regression in 357 nondemented, community-dwelling older men (mean age=67 years) whose hypertensive status was stable over 3 years and who had no medical comorbidities. Age was negatively associated with performance on all but 1 test. Age interacted with hypertensive status on verbal fluency and word list immediate recall; older uncontrolled hypertensives exhibited significantly larger age decrements on these tests compared with normotensives. These findings suggest that uncontrolled hypertension produces specific cognitive deficits beyond those attributable to age alone. These and previous findings illustrate that health conditions such as hypertension should be regularly considered in studies of \"normal\" cognitive aging.","1389":"In 2 experiments using a converging associates paradigm, the authors evaluated implicit memory for gist information in amnesic patients. In Experiment 1, participants saw multiple sets of associates, each converging on a nonpresented theme word, and were then tested using an implicit word stem completion test and an explicit cued recall test. Amnesic patients showed intact implicit and impaired explicit memory for studied words, but memory for nonpresented lures was impaired, regardless of retrieval instructions. To evaluate whether impaired implicit memory for lures was due to accelerated forgetting of gist information, short study lists were used in Experiment 2, each consisting of a single set of associates. Amnesics' implicit memory for lures was again impaired. These results point to an inability to encode robust gist representations as the cause of impaired gist memory in amnesia.","1390":"The dissociation between intact priming and reduced explicit memory in aging has been called into question on the basis of limited information that suggests that priming measures are less reliable than explicit memory measures. No aging study to date, however, has offered a comprehensive examination of the reliability of these measures. Age-related performance and test-retest stability coefficients for multiple priming and explicit memory tasks were compared. Age effects were found on some tasks but not others, and stability was not related to task performance. Stability was similar for implicit versus explicit task instructions, younger versus older persons, and studied versus unstudied items. Results indicate that dissociations between priming and explicit memory performances cannot be accounted for by differential reliability of the measures.","1391":"Emotion identification appears to decline with age, and deficient visual scanning may contribute to this effect. Eye movements of 20 older adults (OAs) and 20 younger adults (YAs) with normal saccades were recorded while viewing facial expressions. OAs made fewer fixations overall, and they made a higher proportion of fixations to the lower halves of faces. Topographical distribution of fixations predicted better OA accuracy for identifying disgust than other negative emotions. Impaired OA accuracy for fear and anger was specific to vision, with normal identification of these emotions in the auditory domain. Age-related frontal-lobe atrophy may affect the integrity of the frontal eye fields, with consequent scanning abnormalities that contribute to difficulties in identifying certain emotions.","1392":"The cortical pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) should lead to the loss of effective interaction between distinct neocortical areas. This study compared 2 conditions within a single sensory integration task that differed in the demands placed on effective cross-cortical interaction. AD patients were impaired in their ability to bind distinct visual features of a stimulus when this binding placed greater demands on cross-cortical interaction (i.e., motion and color) but were not impaired when this binding placed lesser demands on such interaction (i.e., motion and luminance). In contrast, neurologically intact individuals and patients with Huntington's disease were able to effectively bind features under both conditions. These results provide psychophysical support for the presence of functional disconnectivity in AD and demonstrate the utility of AD for investigating the neurocognitive substrates of sensory integration.","1393":"Three participants with callosal agenesis and 12 neurologically normal participants were tested on a simple reaction time task, with visual evoked potentials collected using a high-density 128-channel system. Independent-components analyses were performed on the averaged visual evoked potentials to isolate the components of interest. Contrary to previous research with acallosals, evidence of ipsilateral activation was present in all 3 participants. Although ipsilateral visual components were present in all 4 unilateral conditions in the 2 related acallosal participants, in the 3rd, these were present only in the crossed visual field-hand conditions and not in the uncrossed conditions. Suggestions are made as to why these results differ from earlier findings and as to the neural mechanisms facilitating this ipsilateral activation.","1394":"The authors examined the right ear advantage in a dichotic listening task in healthy aging and very mild and mild stages of Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were simultaneously presented 3 pairs of digits to the left and right ears (e.g., left ear: 4, 3, 1; right ear: 9, 2, 5) for immediate ordered recall. Four lists of triads were presented, varying in presentation rate between digit pairs within a triad (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 s). Results indicated that the very mild and mild Alzheimer's groups showed a larger right ear advantage in free recall compared with the healthy controls, indicating a tendency to respond to the prepotent left hemisphere pathway for language processing. Also, the right ear advantage and proportion of switches made during recall were correlated with psychometric measures of frontal lobe function in the mild Alzheimer's group but not in the very mild or healthy control groups.","1395":"Treated phenylketonuria (PKU) has been linked to dopaminergic depletion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, potentially leading to selective executive impairment. White matter abnormalities may lead to generalized slowing of information processing. These 2 hypotheses were evaluated in adults with PKU on a lifelong diet. Those with PKU were significantly slower than the control group regardless of working memory load on an n-back task and marginally slower regardless of trial type (inhibitory or noninhibitory) on a flanker task. There were no significant differences in speed on object alternation learning or perceptual judgment tasks. There were no group differences in accuracy on any task. These findings do not appear consistent with the selective executive hypothesis. A cognitive slowing account may prove more informative in adults with PKU, but more evidence is needed. The findings suggest that continuous dietary management is a fairly successful strategy in terms of cognitive outcome for adults.","1396":"The conventional criteria for a classical dissociation in single-case studies require that a patient be impaired on one task and within normal limits on another. J. R. Crawford and P. H. Garthwaite (2005) proposed an additional criterion, namely, that the patient's (standardized) difference on the two tasks should differ from the distribution of differences in controls. Monte Carlo simulation was used to evaluate these criteria. When Type I errors were defined as falsely concluding that a control case exhibited a dissociation, error rates were high for the conventional criteria but low for Crawford and Garthwaite's criteria. When Type I error rates were defined as falsely concluding that a patient with equivalent deficits on the two tasks exhibited a dissociation, error rates were very high for the conventional criteria but acceptable for the latter criteria. These latter criteria were robust in the face of nonnormal control data. The power to detect classical dissociations was studied.","1397":"Research in sex, brain lateralization, and cognition suggests that right-handed women vary in cognitive ability according to handedness inheritance patterns. Right-handed college women with positive familial sinistrality (FS+; i.e., the presence of at least one left-handed biological relative; n=30) were compared with right-handed women with negative familial sinistrality (FS-; n=30) by means of visuospatial (the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised Block Design subtest), verbal (the California Verbal Learning Test and Animal Naming), and motor performance tests (Finger Tapping and Grooved Pegboard). FS+ women outperformed FS- women on spatial tasks and used more efficient spatial strategies. The FS- group showed no corresponding verbal advantage. Spatial differences were not accounted for by motor skill, intellectual ability, or academic major.","1398":"Visual information processing is impaired in schizophrenia patients and their biological relatives. The authors measured vernier thresholds in 72 schizophrenia patients, their 86 siblings, and 60 healthy control subjects. Subjects were asked to detect the direction of the horizontal displacement of 2 stimuli (left or right). During magnocellular (M) pathway tests, stimuli were dots with low contrast (5%) or counterphase-modulated gratings (25 Hz). For parvocellular (P) pathway tests, isoluminant blue-red dots with yellow-green background were used. Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia and their siblings were more impaired in M pathway conditions than in P pathway conditions. There was no color-specific impairment. The patients and their siblings displayed lower performances on tests of executive functions, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory compared with the controls. Visual-perceptual and neuropsychological data did not correlate. In conclusion, M pathway dysfunction is a potential endophenotype of schizophrenia.","1399":"The association between Arabic numerals and the representations of magnitude in adult developmental dyscalculia was examined. University students compared physical size, vertical positioning (height), or grayness (different shades of gray) of 2 Arabic numerals. The numerical values could produce a Stroop-like numerical congruity effect (NCE; 3-5 vs. 3-5). The dyscalculia group did not show NCE in the grayness task, and their physical comparisons produced a significantly smaller NCE compared with that produced by the control group. Whereas previous research suggested that Arabic numerals activate representations of magnitude automatically, the results of this study indicate that this is not the case because (a) people with developmental dyscalculia require attention to associate internal representations of magnitude with Arabic numerals, and (b) activation of internal magnitudes depends on context (task).","1400":"A broad memory test battery (reflecting explicit and implicit memory functioning) was administered to a heterogeneous sample of initially nondemented, community-dwelling elderly subjects. To examine the profile of preclinical dementia, subjects were tested twice: At baseline, all subjects were nondemented according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria; 2 years later, a subgroup had developed dementia. Performance of the preclinically demented subjects was best characterized, relative to that of cognitively impaired subjects who did not develop dementia 2 years later, by an inability to benefit at recall from semantic relations and by absent repetition priming effects. The authors conclude that in addition to testing episodic memory functioning, it is important to be aware of semantic and implicit memory deficits in the early assessment of dementia.","1401":"Implicit and explicit memory were examined in 8- to 15-year-old children with myelomeningocele and shunted hydrocephalus, severe traumatic brain injuries, or orthopedic injuries. Each group included between 22 and 29 children. Children completed a fragmented picture identification task to assess perceptual priming and a semantic decision-making task to assess conceptual priming. Each task also assessed procedural learning as well as explicit recall and recognition. All 3 groups showed significant perceptual and semantic priming of similar magnitude. In contrast, both brain-disordered groups displayed poorer explicit memory than did the comparison group. No group showed significant procedural learning on either task. Age and IQ were stronger predictors of explicit recall than of implicit memory. The findings indicate that implicit memory is relatively intact in many children with congenital and acquired brain disorders, despite deficits in explicit memory, and support the existence of separate memory systems in children.","1402":"Several studies have reported an association between hallucinations and tendency to make false alarms in acoustic signal detection tasks. Previous work on patients with schizophrenia has suggested that false recognitions and other types of memory error were positively associated with hallucinations and inversely associated with certain negative symptoms of withdrawal. In this study, 40 patients with schizophrenia were administered a word recognition task. Mixed lists of high- and low-frequency words were presented, then the target words had to be recognized among distractors in immediate and delayed recognition conditions. Hallucination scores were correlated with an increased bias toward false recognitions of nonpresented words. Affective flattening tended to be correlated with a reduced bias toward false recognitions. Anhedonia was significantly correlated with a reduced response bias. Hallucinations and anhedonia therefore presented an opposite association with the response bias. The influence of word frequency and delay on this association is discussed.","1403":"Although confrontation naming deficits have been observed in dominant temporal lobe epilepsy (DTLE), the relative contribution of impoverished phonologic word retrieval and\/or semantic knowledge remains unclear. Analysis of verbal-semantic, phonemic-literal, and combination paraphasias produced during confrontation naming by participants with seizure disorders (52 DTLE; 47 nondominant temporal lobe epilepsy [NDTLE]; 54 psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [PNES]) indicated that the frequency of: (a) verbal-semantic paraphasias was similar across groups, (b) phonemic-literal paraphasias was highest in DTLE, and (c) combination paraphasias was lowest in PNES. Confrontation naming ability was most strongly related to phonemic-literal paraphasia frequency in DTLE and to verbal IQ in both NDTLE and PNES. Greater confrontation naming deficits in DTLE may be attributed to impairments in phonological processing.","1404":"An understanding of relations between causes and effects is essential for making sense of the dynamic physical world. It has been argued that this understanding of causality depends on both perceptual and inferential components. To investigate whether causal perception and causal inference rely on common or on distinct processes, the authors tested 2 callosotomy (split-brain) patients and a group of neurologically intact participants. The authors show that the direct perception of causality and the ability to infer causality depend on different hemispheres of the divided brain. This finding implies that understanding causality is not a unitary process and that causal perception and causal inference can proceed independently.","1405":"The authors contrasted 2 potential explanations for the cognitive control deficits observed in closed head injury (CHI): a prepotent response inhibition deficit or a deficit in context maintenance, defined as the guidance of appropriate responding by task-relevant information. Healthy and CHI participants performed the traditional card Stroop task and a single-trial Stroop task sensitive to context maintenance deficits. As predicted by a context maintenance deficit, moderate to severe CHI participants showed higher error rates in the single-trial Stroop task only, and only when task instructions had to be maintained over a long delay. Moreover, context maintenance impairment and generalized slowing were both related to reports of daily functioning in CHI participants. Thus, context maintenance could be a useful framework for characterizing cognitive control deficits in CHI.","1406":"The cognitive processes underlying age-related alterations in tests assumed to reflect frontal lobe functions were investigated with a card sorting test and an alternate semantic fluency task. The tests were administered to 133 healthy women belonging to 3 age groups (range=50-92 years) classed according to 2 education levels. The results revealed a negative association between total word fluency and perseveration in the sorting test. Aging similarly affected performance in both education groups in some components of the tasks (atypical word fluency and sensitivity to distraction). However, aging did not affect performance to the same extent in each education group in other components (particularly those reflecting switching abilities and strategies). This quasi-experimental approach provides useful tools to identify specific processing mechanisms underlying executive functions in normal aging.","1407":"Cerebral [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) data from patients suffering amnesia following herpes encephalitis (n=7) or frontal lobe pathology (n=14) were compared with data from age-matched nonamnesic subjects (n=10). All subjects received structural MRI, resting 18FDG-PET scans, and neuropsychological evaluation. PET data were analyzed using complementary statistical parametric mapping and region-of-interest methods. Differential patterns of hypometabolism were found in patients relative to healthy controls. Factor analysis of the neuropsychological data revealed that memory performance was associated with retrosplenial and medial temporal metabolism, and executive function was associated with dorsolateral frontal metabolism. The association between memory performance and retrosplenial metabolism remained statistically significant after accounting for measures of cerebral atrophy using MRI. The significance of the retrosplenium as a major relay station between the thalamus and the medial temporal and frontal lobes--sensitive to changes in either--is discussed in the light of the findings.","1408":"Although frequently mentioned in contemporary neuropsychology, the term executive functioning has been a source of considerable confusion. One way in which the meaning of a variable can be investigated involves examining its pattern of relations with established cognitive abilities. This method was applied to a variety of variables hypothesized to assess executive functioning in 2 data sets, 1 consisting of 328 adults between 18 and 93 years of age and a 2nd composite data set based on nearly 7,000 healthy adults between 18 and 95 years of age. Most of the hypothesized executive functioning variables were strongly related to reasoning and perceptual speed abilities, and very few had any unique relations with age after taking into consideration the relations of age through the cognitive abilities. These results raise questions about the extent to which neuropsychological tests of executive functioning measure a distinct dimension of variation in normal adults.","1409":"To determine the size of the impairment across different cognitive domains in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), a meta-analysis based on 47 studies involving 9,097 controls and 1,207 preclinical AD cases was conducted. There were marked preclinical deficits in global cognitive ability, episodic memory, perceptual speed, and executive functioning; somewhat smaller deficits in verbal ability, visuospatial skill, and attention; and no preclinical impairment in primary memory. Younger age (&lt; 75 years) and shorter follow-up intervals (&lt; 3 years) were associated with larger effect sizes for both global cognitive ability and episodic memory. For global cognitive ability, studies that used population-based sampling yielded larger effect sizes; for episodic memory, larger differences were seen in studies that preidentified groups in terms of baseline cognitive impairment. Within episodic memory, delayed testing and recall-based assessment resulted in the largest effect sizes. The authors conclude that deficits in multiple cognitive domains are characteristic of AD several years before clinical diagnosis. The generalized nature of the deficit is consistent with recent observations that multiple brain structures and functions are affected long before the AD diagnosis.","1410":"Functional imaging studies of sex effects in working memory (WMEM) are few, despite significant normal sex differences in brain regions implicated in WMEM. This functional MRI (fMRI) study tested for sex effects in an auditory verbal WMEM task in prefrontal, parietal, cingulate, and insula regions. Fourteen healthy, right-handed community subjects were comparable between the sexes, including on WMEM performance. Per statistical parametric mapping, women exhibited greater signal intensity changes in middle, inferior, and orbital prefrontal cortices than men (corrected for multiple comparisons). A test of mixed-sex groups, comparable on performance, showed no significant differences in the hypothesized regions, providing evidence for discriminant validity for significant sex differences. The findings suggest that combining men and women in fMRI studies of cognition may obscure or bias results.","1411":"Fifty-two patients with partial epilepsy of left (n=30) or right (n=22) hemisphere origin were compared with 23 healthy subjects to explore the characteristics and mechanisms of verbal semantic deficits. Picture Naming, Picture Pointing, and the Semantic Questionnaire assessed semantic retrieval, comprehension, and judgment, respectively. In comparison with the controls and right hemisphere patients, the left hemisphere patients showed impairments on Picture Naming and the Semantic Questionnaire. On Picture Naming, the left hemisphere patients made significant omissions and intracategorical errors; on the Semantic Questionnaire, they made errors at superordinate and subordinate levels of information, they made more errors in relation to living than nonliving things, and there were significant associations between their Picture Naming and Semantic Questionnaire scores. In this population, the mixed profiles of semantic deficits suggests the coexistence of altered retrieval and information loss.","1412":"This study investigated the relationship between theory of mind (ToM) deficits and visual perception in patients with schizophrenia (N=52; 17 remitted and unmedicated) compared with healthy controls (N=30). ToM was assessed with the Eyes Test, which asked participants to choose which of 4 words best described the mental state of a person whose eyes were depicted in a photograph. Visual perception was evaluated with form and motion coherence threshold measurements. Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia (both remitted and nonremitted) showed deficits on the Eyes Test and the motion coherence task. ToM dysfunctions were associated with higher motion coherence thresholds and more severe negative symptoms. This suggests that ToM deficits are related to motion perception dysfunctions, which indicates a possible role of motion-sensitive areas in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.","1413":"The use of individual brain mapping for a single case study implicitly assumes that the pattern of activation obtained in a single session represents the subject's functional neuroanatomy. It is therefore essential to estimate the potential variability of brain activation in individuals. To this purpose, the authors compared the pattern of activation determined by statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99) in 9 subjects who repeated 3 verbal tasks in 3 separate sessions. In each subject for each task, the authors examined the intersession variability of the volume of activation in a set of regions classically implicated in language processing. Their results show that reproducibility of functional MRI brain mapping for language within subject varies as a function of the activation task and the region of interest for language.","1414":"Heightened distractibility following severe closed head injury (sCHI) may result from a deficit in selective attention. The integrity of inhibitory processes involved in selective attention was assessed through use of a negative priming paradigm, allowing dissociation of inhibitory and episodic retrieval processes. In this task, inhibitory processes are elicited under intact stimulus conditions, whereas episodic retrieval is elicited when target stimuli are degraded. Despite inconsistent evidence of inhibitory deficits following sCHI in the literature, long-term survivors of sCHI showed no negative priming under intact stimulus conditions, providing evidence of compromised inhibitory processing. The sCHI participants' demonstration of negative priming when target stimuli were degraded provides evidence that automatic retrieval processes are intact following sCHI, results that are consistent with prior findings.","1415":"This study examined the relationship of the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales (SENAS) to demographic, cultural, and language fluency variables and to measures of cognition and independent functioning. Participants were 367 Hispanics and 160 Caucasians in the 60+ years age range, all living in the community. In Study 1, education and language use had strong influences on SENAS scores and largely explained ethnic group differences in mean scale scores. Age had weak effects on most scales except for verbal memory measures. Acculturation effects in Hispanics were largely accounted for by education and language use. Study 2 showed equivalent sensitivity of SENAS to cognitive and functional status in Hispanics and Caucasians. Results indicate that interpretation of SENAS scores must be informed by effects related to education and language fluency but provide evidence of equivalent validity in Hispanics and Caucasians with respect to concurrent measures of cognition and independent function.","1416":"Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to an increase in time to react to a target in a previously attended location. Children with spina bifida meningomyelocele (SBM) and hydrocephalus have congenital dysmorphology of the midbrain, a brain region associated with the control of covert orienting in general and with IOR in particular. The authors studied exogenously cued covert orienting in 8- to 19-year-old children and adolescents (84 with SBM and 37 age-matched, typically developing controls). The exogenous cue was a luminance change in a peripheral box that was 50% valid for the upcoming target location. Compared with controls, children with SBM showed attenuated IOR in the vertical plane, a deficit that was associated with midbrain dysmorphology in the form of tectal beaking but not with posterior brain volume loss. The data add to the emerging evidence for SBM deficits in attentional orienting to salient information.","1417":"The authors examined the neuropsychological status of 22 preschoolers at risk for attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 50 matched control children, using measures of nonverbal working memory, perceptual and motor inhibition, and memory for relative time. All tasks included paired control conditions, which allowed for the isolation of discrete executive function constructs. Group differences were evident on several measures of neuropsychological functioning; however, after accounting for nonexecutive abilities, no deficits could be attributed to specific functions targeted by the tasks. Performance on executive measures was not related to objective indices of activity level or ratings of ADHD symptoms. Yet, the fact that at-risk preschoolers were highly symptomatic casts doubt on whether executive function deficits and\/or frontostriatal networks contribute etiologically to early behavioral manifestations of ADHD.","1418":"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate slowed acquisition of the conditioned response (CR) in eyeblink classical conditioning paradigms (EBCC), although it is unknown how early in the course of the disease CR acquisition is affected. This study investigated whether changes in the rate of CR acquisition were apparent in nondemented older adults at greater genetic risk for developing AD (i.e., carriers of the apolipoprotein E [APOE] epsilon 4 allele). Both epsilon 4+ and epsilon 4- participants demonstrated CR acquisition to auditory and olfactory CSs; however, rate of acquisition to the olfactory CS was significantly slower in epsilon 4+ persons. Both groups acquired the CR to an auditory CS at the same rate. Results support olfactory compromise in the earliest stages of the AD disease process. ((c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).","1419":"The influence of Huntington's disease (HD) on the olfactory event-related potential (OERP), an electrophysiological measure of olfactory information processing, has not been reported to date. In the present study, olfactory and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded monopolarly from Fz, Cz, and Pz electrode sites in 8 patients with HD and 8 age- and gender-matched control participants. Results demonstrated that individuals with HD were delayed compared with controls on the P3 component of the OERP (p&lt;.001), with a trend toward a significant delay on the auditory ERP P3 (p&lt;.06). The effect size for OERP P3 latency (pi(2)=.72) was larger than that for the auditory P3 (pi(2)=.24), which has previously been shown to be delayed in HD. Patients performed significantly worse than controls did on all neuropsychological measures. These measures significantly correlated with several components of the OERP. These findings extend the understanding of olfactory deficits in HD.","1420":"The authors' aim in this study was to explore automatic and controlled processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using a variant of the word-stem completion task that applies the process-dissociation procedure. Several methodological precautions were taken in order to limit problems observed in previous studies (e.g., poor task sensitivity, ceiling and\/or floor effects, no control over comprehension of instructions). Our results (a) confirmed the marked deterioration in controlled processes and (b) showed that when psychometric constraints were limited, automatic memory processes were preserved in AD. These data are in line with those from more global studies in suggesting that AD is characterized by an early deterioration in controlled processes and an initial preservation of automatic processes.","1421":"This study examined 2 factors contributing to false recognition of semantic associates: errors based on confusion of source and errors based on general similarity information or gist. The authors investigated these errors in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), age-matched control participants, and younger adults, focusing on each group's ability to use recollection of source information to suppress false recognition. The authors used a paradigm consisting of both deep and shallow incidental encoding tasks, followed by study of a series of categorized lists in which several typical exemplars were omitted. Results showed that healthy older adults were able to use recollection from the deep processing task to some extent but less than that used by younger adults. In contrast, false recognition in AD patients actually increased following the deep processing task, suggesting that they were unable to use recollection to oppose familiarity arising from incidental presentation.","1422":"The authors examined inhibitory control processes in 8 adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit\/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during childhood and in 8 adolescent control participants using functional MRI with the Stimulus and Response Conflict Tasks (K. W. Nassauer &amp; J. M. Halperin, 2003). No group differences in performance were evident on measures of interference control and\/or response competition created by location and direction stimuli. However, the ADHD group demonstrated significantly greater activation of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during interference control as well as greater activation of the left anterior cingulate cortex, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left basal ganglia during the dual task of interference control and response competition. The magnitude of the prefrontal and basal ganglia activation was positively correlated with severity of ADHD. Response competition alone did not yield group differences in activation.","1423":"Researchers examining selective attentional mechanisms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) often report impairment in patients' ability to inhibit irrelevant or distracting information. However, in many studies reporting such failures, researchers used tasks that require semantic processing, which a large body of literature documents to be disrupted in AD. The authors of this study used a spatial location-priming task that minimized semantic processing to examine the phenomena of negative priming and facilitative priming in 13 AD patients and 13 healthy older adults. AD patients demonstrated facilitative and negative priming proportionately equivalent to that of older adults. These findings suggest that both the facilitative and inhibitory mechanisms involved in selective attention are preserved in patients with AD and can be revealed in tasks that minimize semantic processing.","1424":"In numerous studies, researchers have suggested anomalies in semantics in patients with schizophrenia. In this study, the authors addressed whether one such anomaly might reflect a difference in knowledge content or in the structure or organization of this information. Using a category member production task and a typicality rating task, the authors assessed knowledge content and found that patients' and control participants' knowledge about categories of foods and animals was very similar. In terms of structure, their findings from a mathematical model of category judgment (the instantiation model; E. Heit &amp; L. W. Barsalou, 1996) revealed a similar category structure in patients and control participants. In conclusion, the authors suggest that the content and organization of categories in patients with schizophrenia is similar to that in healthy control participants.","1425":"The authors of this study investigated task switching following cerebellar damage. The study group consisted of 7 children and adolescents (M age=13.8 years) who underwent surgical removal of a benign posterior fossa tumor. They were tested at a sufficient interval after surgery (M lag=6.13 years) for restoration of normal cognitive skills and intelligence. Although all showed normal learning of the task compared with control participants, when rapid behavioral changes were required (short preparation time), they exhibited behavioral rigidity manifested by enhanced switching cost. These results are in line with another study on serial reaction time with the same patients (A. Berger et al., in press). They have important implications for our understanding of the cognitive sequelae of early cerebellar damage as well as the involvement of the cerebellum in task switching.","1426":"In 2 experiments involving patients with semantic dementia, the authors investigated the impact of semantic memory loss on both true and false recognition. Experiment 1 involved recognition memory for categories of everyday objects that shared a predominantly semantic relationship. The patients showed preserved item-specific recollection for the pictorial stimuli but, compared with control participants, exhibited significantly reduced utilization of gist information regarding the categories of objects. The latter result is consistent with the patients' degraded semantic knowledge. Experiment 2 involved categories of abstract objects that were related to one another perceptually rather than semantically. Patients with semantic dementia obtained item-specific recollection and gist memory scores that were indistinguishable from those of control participants. These results suggest that the reduction in gist memory in semantic dementia is largely specific to semantic representations and cannot be attributed to general difficulty with abstracting and\/or utilizing gistlike commonalities between stimuli.","1427":"Mental flexibility is required to track and systematically alternate between 2 response sets. In this study, 719 individuals, 20 to 89 years old, engaged in 3 different tasks that required verbal and nonverbal cognitive switching. Of importance, each task allowed for independent measurement of component skills that are embedded in the higher level tasks. When gender, education, Full Scale IQ, and component skills were partialed out by multiple regression analyses, significant age effects were revealed for each task. This study provides evidence that executive functions--and verbal and nonverbal cognitive switching in particular--are affected by age independently from age-related changes in component skills. The results are discussed in terms of theories of executive control and neurologic correlates across the adult life span.","1428":"Using neuropsychological models of prefrontal function, the authors investigated the pattern of interindividual prefrontal performance differences in healthy volunteers. Using a correlation and an extreme group approach, they compared verbal and visuospatial working memory capacity with performance on the Stroop interference task as a measure of executive control and on the direct and indirect semantic priming tasks as a measure of semantic access. Subjects with low visuospatial working memory capacity exhibited increased Stroop interference Subjects with low verbal memory capacity showed increased priming and Stroop interference only. The study shows that prefrontal functioning varies interindividually, forming patterns of performance differences. These findings suggest that working memory, executive control, and semantic retrieval are functionally related to some extent.","1429":"In neuropsychological single-case studies, a patient is compared with a small control sample. Methods of testing for a deficit on Task X, or a significant difference between Tasks X and Y, either treat the control sample statistics as parameters (using z and zD) or use modified t tests. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that if z is used to test for a deficit, the Type I error rate is high for small control samples, whereas control of the error rate is essentially perfect for a modified t test. Simulations on tests for differences revealed that error rates were very high for zD. A new method of testing for a difference (the revised standardized difference test) achieved good control of the error rate, even with very small sample sizes. A computer program that implements this new test (and applies criteria to test for classical and strong dissociations) is made available.","1430":"Intraindividual variability in cognitive test performance has the potential to be a good marker of preclinical Alzheimer's disease status (S. C. Li &amp; U. Lindenberger, 1999). Using cross-sectional community data from 2,317 individuals aged 60-64 years, the authors of this study found that variability was greater in individuals who met criteria for mild cognitive impairment or aging-associated cognitive decline but not for age-associated memory impairment. Higher variability was associated with lower education and a non-English-speaking background. In contrast to previous findings, variability in this study did not contribute uniquely to meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment. The reasons for the differences may reside in the authors' method of estimating mean independent variability, the use of an occasion-specific measure, or the relatively younger age of the participants. Follow-up of the cohort in 4 years will yield data on the prospective validity of variability as a risk factor for impairment.","1431":"Changes in spatiotemporal profiles of brain magnetic activity were investigated in healthy volunteers as a function of varying demands for phonological storage of spoken pseudowords. Greater activity for the phonological memory task was restricted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the left hemisphere. During performance of the memory task, activity was initially found in the left superior temporal gyrus (between 100 and 200 ms), followed by activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal, motor, and premotor cortices (between 200 and 300 ms). Activity in DLPFCs was first observed consistently across participants later, between 300 and 400 ms. The data are consistent with the purported role of posterior temporal cortices in phonological analysis and in the online storage of phonological information, the contribution of ventrolateral and motor processing areas in establishment and short-term maintenance of articulatory representations through rehearsal, and the role of DLPFCs in the executive control of the maintenance operation.","1432":"The authors explored the neurobiology of sarcasm and the cognitive processes underlying it by examining the performance of participants with focal lesions on tasks that required understanding of sarcasm and social cognition. Participants with prefrontal damage (n=25) showed impaired performance on the sarcasm task, whereas participants with posterior damage (n=16) and healthy controls (n=17) performed the same task without difficulty. Within the prefrontal group, right ventromedial lesions were associated with the most profound deficit in comprehending sarcasm. In addition, although the prefrontal damage was associated with deficits in theory of mind and right hemisphere damage was associated with deficits in identifying emotions, these 2 abilities were related to the ability to understand sarcasm. This suggests that the right frontal lobe mediates understanding of sarcasm by integrating affective processing with perspective taking.","1433":"Bilinguals' virtually doubled processing load could lead to general difficulty producing all word forms or to difficulty only in specific conditions. In Experiment 1, bilinguals and monolinguals completed diaries of naturally occurring tip-of-the-tongue states (TOTs), and in Experiment, 2 Spanish-English bilinguals and monolinguals produced the names of pictured objects and people's names given their descriptions. Bilinguals reported the same number (or fewer) TOTs for proper names but significantly more TOTs than did monolinguals for other words. With monolinguals as a baseline, proper names were harder to produce; thus, for a harder task, bilinguals showed relatively better performance. Bilingual disadvantages may be limited to representing multiple forms for individual meanings; proper names improved naming because they have essentially the same form across languages.","1434":"Decision-making deficits reflected by risky decisions in gambling tasks have been associated with frontal lobe dysfunctions in various neurologic and psychiatric populations. The question remains whether decision-making impairments are related to executive functions. The authors developed a new gambling task, the Game of Dice Task, with explicit and stable rules for reinforcement and punishment, to investigate relations between executive functions and risk-taking behavior in an explicit decision-making situation. A sample of 35 alcoholic Korsakoff patients and 35 healthy controls was examined with the Game of Dice Task and a neuropsychological test battery. Results show that Korsakoff patients are strongly impaired in this explicit decision-making task and that these disturbances are correlated with specific executive functions.","1435":"The distinctiveness heuristic is a response mode in which participants expect to remember vivid details of an experience and make recognition decisions on the basis of this metacognitive expectation. The authors examined whether the distinctiveness heuristic could be engaged to reduce false recognition in a repetition-lag paradigm in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with AD were able to use the distinctiveness heuristic--though not selectively--and thus they showed reduction of both true and false recognition. The authors suggest that patients with AD can engage in decision strategies on the basis of the metacognitive expectation associated with use of the distinctiveness heuristic, but the patients' episodic memory impairment limits both the scope and effectiveness of such strategies.","1436":"A meta-analysis of 30 studies with 1,511 participants was conducted to estimate and compare the magnitude of deficits on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency for patients with Huntington's disease (HD) relative to healthy control participants. As has been found for patients with focal frontal cortical lesions (but not for patients with focal temporal cortical lesions), symptomatic HD patients were comparably impaired on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency (rs=.71 and .73, respectively). However, in contrast to patients with focal frontal lobe injuries, fluency deficits did not qualify as differential deficits relative to verbal intelligence or psychomotor speed. Therefore, for patients with HD, deficits on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency do not appear to reflect executive dysfunction but a more generalized cognitive impairment.","1437":"Research in neuropsychology suggests that the etiology of a neurologic injury determines the neuropathological and neuropsychological changes. This study compared neuropsychological outcome in subjects who had traumatic brain injury (TBI) with subjects who had anoxic brain injury (ABI), who were matched for age, gender, and ventricle-to-brain ratio. There were no group differences for morphologic or neuropsychological measures. Both groups exhibited impaired memory, attention, and executive function, as well as slowed mental processing speed. Intelligence correlated with whole brain volume, and measures of memory correlated with hippocampal atrophy. There was no unique contribution of hippocampal atrophy on neuropsychological outcome between the groups. In the absence of localized lesions, the amount of neural tissue loss, rather than etiology, may be the critical factor in neuropsychological outcome.","1438":"Neuroimaging studies have been inconclusive in characterizing the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for maintaining increasingly larger amounts of information in working memory (WM). To address this question, the authors collected event-related functional MRI data while participants performed an item-recognition task in which the number of to-be-remembered letters was parametrically modulated. During maintenance of information in WM, the dorsolateral and the ventrolateral PFC exhibited linearly increasing activation in response to increasing WM load. Prefrontal regions could not be distinguished from one another on the basis of load sensitivity, but the dorsolateral PFC had stronger functional connectivity with the parietal and motor cortex than the ventrolateral PFC. These results suggest an increasingly important role for the PFC in actively maintaining information as the amount of that information increases.","1439":"Information-integration category learning was examined in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in healthy control participants in 2 different conditions. In the linear condition, optimal categorization required a nonverbalizable linear integration of information from the 2 stimulus dimensions, whereas in the nonlinear condition, a nonlinear integration of information was required. Each participant completed 600 trials in each condition and was given corrective feedback following each trial. Results indicated that PD patients were not impaired in the linear condition across all trials, whereas the same patients were impaired in the nonlinear condition, but only later in training. The authors conducted model-based analyses to identify participants who used an information-integration approach, and a comparison of the accuracy rates of those individuals further revealed a specific deficit in information-integration category learning in patients with PD. These findings suggest that the striatum may be particularly involved in information-integration category learning when the rule is highly complex.","1440":"The cognitive consequences of the apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE-epsilon4) allele were examined in middle age, before likely onset of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The authors identified 3 cognitive processes--visuospatial attention, spatial working memory, and the effect of visuospatial attention on working memory--and devised \"behavioral assays\" of the integrity of components of these processes. Redirecting visuospatial attention, retention of memory for location, and attentional modulation of memory of target location were affected by APOE genotype. Visuospatial attention showed additive effects of epsilon4 gene dose; each additional epsilon4 allele inherited further slowed disengagement from invalidly cued space. In contrast, working memory performance was affected only in epsilon4 homozygotes. Effect sizes for the APOE gene were moderate to large, ranging from 14% to 24%. Effects of APOE genotype on component processes of cognition in healthy, middle-aged adults is consistent with the emergence in adulthood of an APOE-epsilon4 cognitive phenotype.","1441":"California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) indices have been shown to be sensitive to the neurocognitive effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The effects of TBI on the learning process were examined with a growth curve analysis of CVLT-C raw scores across the 5 learning trials. The sample with history of TBI comprised 86 children, ages 6-16 years, at a mean of 10.0 (SD=19.5) months postinjury; 37.2% had severe injury, 27.9% moderate, and 34.9% mild. The best-fit model for verbal learning was with a quadratic function. Greater TBI severity was associated with lower rate of acquisition and more gradual deceleration in the rate of acquisition. Intelligence test index scores, previously shown to be sensitive to severity of TBI, were positively correlated with rate of acquisition. Results provide evidence that the CVLT-C learning slope is not a simple linear function and further support for specific effects of TBI on verbal learning.","1442":"Higher education is associated with less age-related decline in cognitive function, but the mechanism of this protective effect is unknown. The authors examined the effect of age on the relation between education and brain activity by correlating years of education with activity measured using functional MRI during memory tasks in young and older adults. In young adults, education was negatively correlated with frontal activity, whereas in older adults, education was positively correlated with frontal activity. Medial temporal activity was associated with more education in young adults but less education in older adults. This suggests that the frontal cortex is engaged by older adults, particularly by the highly educated, as an alternative network that may be engaged to aid cognitive function.","1443":"G. Tremont, S. Halpert, D. J. Javorsky, and R. A. Stern (2000) found that individuals with executive dysfunction were more impaired on less structured versus more structured verbal memory tasks. In the present study, the authors investigated the relationship between executive functions and memory in patients with a history of traumatic brain injury by examining the effect of executive functioning on more structured and less structured verbal and visual memory tasks at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Matched subgroups controlled for differences in severity of neuropsychological impairment unrelated to specific executive functions. The G. Tremont et al. (2000) findings were not replicated. Results showed that when acuteness and severity of injury were controlled, executive impairment played no significant role in performance on either more or less structured memory tasks. However, regardless of structure, executive functions played a role in visual memory performance, suggesting that visual memory may be a more fluid ability than verbal memory.","1444":"Chronic misuse of alcohol affects an integrated neural circuit supporting the formation of associative memories acquired during eyeblink classical conditioning (R. McGlinchey-Berroth et al., 1995). The authors of this study investigated single-cue trace conditioning in amnesic and nonamnesic abstinent alcoholic individuals who either were or were not trained in a single-cue delay conditioning task. Overall, untrained alcoholic participants were severely impaired in acquisition, and alcoholic participants previously trained in single-cue delay conditioning performed similarly to untrained control participants. Individual performance in acquisition varied significantly within task but was relatively stable between the trace and delay tasks; there were nonamnesic and amnesic alcoholic participants who acquired responses at a normal rate in both delay and trace conditioning. The similarity of performances in delay and trace conditioning suggests a common source of impairment across both tasks.","1445":"The published literature on depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is reviewed quantitatively. The authors report mean effect sizes for 20 studies comparing depression scores of MS patients with those of healthy participants (d=1.07) and 21 studies comparing depression scores of MS patients with those of patients who have other chronic conditions (d=-0.14). The confidence interval for the mean overall MS-medical comparison included 0. However, subgroups of patients with chronic fatigue and spinal-neuromuscular conditions were more and less depressed than MS patients, respectively. Results indicate that a majority of MS patients with mild to moderate disability levels are distinguishable from healthy people in terms of depressive symptoms. However, the depression-disease link is complex and not specific to this form of demyelinating illness.","1446":"New learning of semantic information is impaired in amnesia. Several reports have demonstrated that \"errorless\" learning techniques have allowed patients with amnesia to acquire at least some form of new semantic information, although this information appears to be relatively inflexible. Using insights and principles from connectionist modeling of cortical and medial temporal lobe memory systems, the authors describe why errorless learning procedures act as a poor proxy for the medial temporal lobe, suggesting that they artificially eliminate the variability that defines semantic information. The authors trained a patient with severe amnesia on new semantic sentences both with and without variance and then tested him on both repeated and related novel sentences to assess generalization. He successfully learned new semantic information in both conditions but demonstrated better generalization of semantic concepts following training with variance.","1447":"Healthy younger and older adults and individuals with very mild or mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) listened to and read fictional stories containing correct and incorrect facts about the world. Of interest was their use of this story information to answer questions on a later test of general world knowledge. Prior exposure to relatively well-known facts boosted all subjects' ability to correctly answer general knowledge questions. Reading incorrect facts in the stories led to misinformation effects in healthy older adults (although these effects were smaller than those observed in younger adults). DAT individuals showed reduced effects of story exposure; effects were greatest in a situation that reminded DAT individuals that the stories might provide the answers to the questions. Benefits of story reading depended on activation of the semantic network, whereas costs of story reading were more dependent on episodic memory processes.","1448":"The authors examined the nature of the working memory deficit in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Three hypotheses were tested: a limited storage capacity, an impaired executive component, and a reduction of psychomotor speed. Verbal working memory was assessed in 14 PD patients without dementia and 14 matched control participants. Participants were administered a classical verbal span test, working memory tasks that required either updating or manipulation capacities, and motor and psychomotor speed tasks. Patients' performance was comparable to that of control participants on the verbal span test. However, results on the working memory tasks indicated a deficit in manipulation with normal updating capacities. Motor and psychomotor slowing were found in the patient group, but slowing could not fully account for the impairment observed in the manipulation task. Results indicated that there is a genuine but selective working memory impairment in patients with PD.","1449":"Object alternation (OA) tasks are increasingly used as probes of ventral prefrontal functioning in humans. In the most common variant of the OA task, subjects must deduce the task rule through trial-and-error learning. To examine the neural correlates of OA acquisition, the authors measured regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography while subjects acquired an OA task, performed a sensorimotor control condition, or performed already learned and practiced OA. As expected, activations emerged in the ventral prefrontal cortex. However, activation of the presupplemental motor area was more closely associated with successful task performance. The authors suggest that areas beyond the ventral prefrontal cortex are critically involved in OA acquisition.","1450":"Inconsistency in latency across trials of 2-choice reaction time data was analyzed in 273 participants ranging in age from 6 to 81 years. A U-shaped curve defined the relationship between age and inconsistency, with increases in age associated with lower inconsistency throughout childhood and higher inconsistency throughout adulthood. Differences in inconsistency were independent of practice, fatigue, and age-related differences in mean level of performance. Evidence for general and specific variability-producing processes was found in those aged less than 21 years, whereas only a specific process, such as attentional blocks, was evident for those 21 years and older. The findings highlight the importance of considering moment-to-moment changes in performance in psychological research.","1451":"A total of 420 adults between 18 and 91 years of age carried palm pilot (Palm M100; PalmOne, Milpitas, CA) devices and performed several reaction time trials when prompted at random times during the day. On the average, within-person variability in median reaction time from one occasion to the next was nearly the same magnitude as the between-persons variability in across-occasion mean reaction time. Analyses controlling the variation in one variable when examining relations involving the other variable suggested that an individual's mean reaction time is a more powerful predictor of relations with age and with the level of various cognitive abilities than his or her across-occasion SD.","1452":"To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no published reports on visuomotor preparation in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This is unfortunate, because research suggests that ADHD is an output-related deficit, and suboptimal execution of tasks may be the result of incomplete visuomotor preparation. The authors compared 19 children with ADHD with 124 healthy and 120 pathological controls in terms of their performance (speed, speed variability, and accuracy) on the finger precuing test, a test measuring (automatic and controlled) visuomotor preparation. The data implied that children with ADHD have an impaired ability to engage in effortful, controlled visuomotor preparation activities. Fast, automatic response preparation was not affected by ADHD. In addition, children with ADHD showed more variability in overall test performance than other children. No group differences were found in response accuracy.","1453":"The authors explored the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the generation and maintenance of response readiness in a simple reaction time task. They compared performance of idiopathic PD patients without dementia, age-matched controls, and younger controls over short (1-, 3-, and 6-s) and long (12- and 18-s) foreperiod intervals. After each trial, the authors probed memory for visual information that also had to be maintained during the trial interval. Patients and controls did not differ overall in their ability to maintain readiness over long delays. However, within the PD group only, errors in maintaining visual information were correlated with difficulty in maintaining readiness, suggesting that systems impaired in PD may facilitate the maintenance of processing in both motor and cognitive domains.","1454":"Although the Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in this study were severely impaired in recognition performance, their naming performance demonstrated normal priming across transformations in object color. This is evidence for preserved implicit shape-based memory performance in AD patients. For colored-object decision, healthy older adult control participants but not AD patients showed priming for new associations between previously encountered object shapes and colors. The author argues, on the basis of this colored object decision performance, that the deficits present in AD do not allow shape and color to be integrated to form a novel unitized representation that can be used to benefit cognitive performance.","1455":"Methamphetamine (MA) dependence is associated with deficits in episodic verbal memory, but the cognitive mechanisms underlying such impairments are not known. The authors evaluated a component process model of episodic verbal memory in 87 persons with MA dependence (MA+) and 71 demographically similar non-MA-using controls (MA-). Compared with MA- controls, MA+ participants demonstrated deficient overall learning, free recall, and utilization of semantic clustering, as well as higher rates of repetitions and intrusions. No between-groups differences were evident on measures of serial clustering, retention, or recognition discrimination. Taken together, these findings indicate that MA dependence is associated with deficient strategic (i.e., executive) control of verbal encoding and retrieval, which is consistent with the sequelae of MA-related prefronto-striatal circuit neurotoxicity.","1456":"The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, despite uncertainty as to its effect on cognitive function in normal aging. Some evidence suggests poor episodic memory and executive functioning in epsilon4 allele carriers. Prospective memory has been overlooked in investigations of the relationship between APOE and cognition. The authors used a laboratory paradigm to examine the relationship between prospective memory and APOE status in healthy elderly adults, and they varied the association (high vs. low) between a target word and a response word. The authors found a significant deficit in prospective memory for epsilon4 allele carriers but no effect of association in either group. The results suggest the deficit was due to failure of the prospective component of the task.","1457":"This study examined the relation of dual-task performance to individual differences on neuropsychological tests. Neuropsychological test scores from 16 young and 16 older participants were simultaneously submitted to a factor analysis that yielded 2 factors (Attention\/Executive and Memory) that differed by age and 2 (Motor Speed and Cognitive Status) that did not. Regression analyses revealed that these factors were significant predictors of performance on a delayed visual recognition task, but the relationship varied as a function of task condition. The Memory and Motor Speed factors were the strongest predictors of single-task performance, but the Attention\/Executive factor was the most important predictor of dual-task performance. The authors conclude that compromised central executive may underlie age-related decline in dual-task performance.","1458":"A multitarget visual cancellation test was administered to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Attentional loads--physical similarity (number of features shared by target and distractors; 3 levels) and density (number of items per page; 3 levels)--were varied systematically. As physical similarity increased, both groups slowed their search, but whereas the HC group maintained accuracy, the AD group increased commission errors and tended to miss more targets. Increased density yielded slower search and more target omissions in the AD group. Commission errors are additional indicators of higher order attentional deficits, especially in early disease. The findings suggest that patients with AD may rely increasingly on physical features of stimuli during a search, leading to inefficient bottom-up processing strategies.","1459":"Researchers currently debate whether new semantic knowledge can be learned and retrieved despite extensive damage to medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. The authors explored whether H. M., a patient with amnesia, could acquire new semantic information in the context of his lifelong hobby of solving crossword puzzles. First, H. M. was tested on a series of word-skills tests believed important in solving crosswords. He also completed 3 new crosswords: 1 puzzle testing pre-1953 knowledge, another testing post-1953 knowledge, and another combining the 2 by giving postoperative semantic clues for preoperative answers. From the results, the authors concluded that H. M. can acquire new semantic knowledge, at least temporarily, when he can anchor it to mental representations established preoperatively.","1460":"The authors assessed manual performance and verbal dichotic listening performance in 16 epilepsy-free children with congenital unilateral brain lesions and normal IQ to investigate cerebral reorganization. In all children, the paretic hand had fair grip function, but reaction times were impaired, and cerebral reorganization of hand function in those with right hemiplegia was shown by the high incidence of pathological left-handedness. The dichotic listening results showed that most children with left lesions had a left ear advantage significantly related to the extent of brain damage. This finding suggests that extent of cortical damage and presence of thalamic involvement, irrespective of neuropathology, are the primary factors inducing rightward cerebral language reorganization in children with unilateral congenital brain lesions.","1461":"Perisylvian regions important for auditory processing include Heschl's gyrus (HG), the planum temporale (PT), the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), and the posterior ascending ramus (PAR). Sex-linked differences in language functions and anatomy have been suggested. To examine sex-linked differences, the authors used MRI to measure HG, PT, pSTG, and PAR volumes. Sex differences were found in right HG and right pSTG volumes but not in the left volumes of these structures. For the PT, there were sex differences in asymmetry; women exhibited leftward asymmetry of the PT, whereas men did not exhibit PT asymmetry. These findings suggest that there are sex-linked differences in the anatomy of primary and association auditory cortices.","1462":"Differences in cortical surface features between healthy controls (n = 48) and patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 46), ages 14-59, were characterized by means of advanced quantitative MRI processing techniques. Cortical surface features of interest included gyral and sulcal curvature, cortical depth, and total cortical surface area. Epilepsy patients and controls differed on measures of gyrification; the abnormalities generalized despite the focal nature of the primary epileptic process. Changes in cortical surface features were associated with increasing chronological age in both groups. Abnormalities in gyrification were associated with cognitive performance and with other morphometric measurements (e.g., surface cerebral spinal fluid). These findings are related to the literature regarding morphometric changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal aging.","1463":"The authors delineated the time evolution of alpha event-related desynchronization over human frontal, parietal, and primary sensorimotor areas during the expectancy of a go\/no-go task. The main issue under investigation was whether anticipatory processes impinged upon cortical areas in sequential or parallel mode. Compared with the control condition, in the experimental condition there was an Alpha 1 desynchronization over the central midline, an Alpha 2 desynchronization increasing over primary sensorimotor areas, and an Alpha 3 desynchronization increasing in parallel over bilateral primary sensorimotor areas. These processes had different temporal features. Results disclose an anticipatory activity of central midline areas and primary sensorimotor areas in both parallel and sequential modes. This reflects an adaptive, energy-consuming strategy rather than an economic waiting for the go stimulus.","1464":"Patients with lesions of the splenium showed higher validity effects of visuospatial cues than did patients with partial lesions of the corpus callosum anterior to the splenium and control participants. Many of the patients tested had also shown a left-ear suppression for consonant-vowel syllables in a previous dichotic listening study. The authors interpret these parallel findings as evidence for the disruption of signals that normally alert the individual to the presence of behaviorally relevant stimuli, possibly originating in the temporoparietal junction area. After splenial lesions, these signals may not reach the contralateral hemisphere, leading to supramodal deficits in target detection, especially under distracting conditions.","1465":"Category-specific impairment in living things was examined in patients with temporal lobe damage to investigate whether specific neuroanatomical regions could be identified in processing the knowledge of specific categories. Tasks involving more effortful retrieval naming and less effortful attribute judgment were administered to 3 groups of patients with either bilateral, unilateral left, or unilateral right temporal lobe damage. Category-specific impairment in living things was observed for patients with unilateral or bilateral damage, results that are consistent with previous findings. Depending on its site and extent, the damage in the temporal lobe might lead to deficits in processing or loss of semantic knowledge for living things. Therefore, intact category-specific semantic processes may involve associations among different neural substrates in the temporal lobe.","1466":"Remote memory was assessed in persons with HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D), probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Huntington's disease (HD) and in healthy controls. The clinical groups were similar in overall dementia severity. Each clinical group exhibited impairments on remote memory tests relative to controls; however, temporally graded memory loss with selective preservation of older information was observed in the AD group but not the HD or HIV-D group. Analysis of cued retrieval indicated a preferential cuing benefit for the HIV-D and HD groups relative to the AD group. The similar pattern of remote memory performance demonstrated by the HIV-D and HD groups is a novel finding and suggests a subcortically mediated retrograde amnesia in HIV-D. The temporally graded pattern and the abnormal cued retrieval performance in the AD group are consistent with a consolidation deficit associated with extrahippocampal (cortical) and hippocampal damage.","1467":"Although neuroimaging studies have strongly implicated basal ganglia involvement in implicit sequence learning, serial reaction time (SRT) studies with Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have yielded mixed results. The present research sought to examine the ability of people with PD to implicitly learn sequences with different sequential structures and to objectively assess explicit knowledge. A version of the SRT task that reduces motor demands was used to compare 19 patients with PD but not dementia and 37 matched controls. PD patients showed less implicit sequence-specific learning for both sequences and reduced response time improvement over sequential trials for the more complex sequence. A closer examination revealed that the deficit involved higher order sequential associations as well as the learning of pairwise information.","1468":"The aim of this study was to investigate attention and perceptual and spatial working memory abilities in preterm, low birth weight preschool children without evident brain disorders as determined by normal cerebral ultrasound findings and normal motor development. The authors evaluated 19 preterm and 19 typically developing children who were matched for IQ and chronological age. Results indicated that children born prematurely without major neurological deficits and with a normal cognitive level may have specific difficulty in sustained attention, visuospatial processing, and spatial working memory when evaluated at ages 3-4. This finding is relevant for understanding the qualitative aspects of cognitive development in preterm children and the neurobiological substrate underlying this development.","1469":"This study was conducted to investigate the deficits of organizational strategy and visual memory in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Thirty OCD patients and 30 healthy controls aged 20-35 years participated. The Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test were administered to participants. The authors scored ROCF performances using the Boston Qualitative Scoring System. The OCD patients showed poorer planning ability and higher fragmentation than did healthy controls when copying the ROCF, and they showed even poorer performances in the immediate and delayed recall conditions. The authors found that the Organization score in the copy condition mediated the difference between the OCD group and the healthy group in immediate recall. The direct effect of diagnosis (OCD or healthy) on the immediate recall condition of the ROCF was also significant. This study indicates that people with OCD have poor memory function and organizational deficits.","1470":"Children and adolescents (n = 25) with galactosemia homozygous for the common Q188R mutation (substitution of glutamine codon 188 with arginine) were group matched for sex and age with healthy control participants (n = 20). Participants were administered an abbreviated neuropsychological battery by a doctoral-level psychologist. Results indicate that children and adolescents with galactosemia function generally within the low average IQ range, with a small standard deviation (indicating a relatively homogeneous IQ profile), and have many features suggestive of left-hemisphere dysfunction. Word retrieval difficulties are a primary component of the galactosemia profile. In addition, participants with galactosemia have less well-developed executive functions. Child and parental reports of behavioral symptoms differ; parents reported that their children had more internalizing symptoms than the children with galactosemia self-reported. Cognitive complications in galactosemia appear to emerge even in well-treated children.","1471":"Traditionally, studies of cognitive aging have focused on comparing the average performance of younger and older adults, whereas variability around the mean has been attributed to task-irrelevant noise. The present study examined the hypothesis that variability in memory performance increases with age and that estrogen helps temper age-related increases in variability. Postmenopausal estrogen users, estrogen and progestin (est + prog) users, and nonusers, as well as younger women, completed 16 blocks of an item-source memory task. Older women showed greater variability than younger women on measures of dispersion and consistency. Estrogen users, but not est + prog users, performed more consistently than nonusers. Overall, age-related increases in variability differed with the type of variability measured, and estrogen use, but not est + prog use, appeared to reduce age-related increases in at least 1 form of variability.","1472":"Previous functional MRI findings have indicated that a premotor-parietal network is involved in the perceptual processing of sequential information. Given that premotor functions have traditionally been restricted to behaviors requiring motor or sensorimotor computations, the goal of the present patient study was to further investigate whether the lateral premotor cortex is critical in purely perceptual sequencing. Patients with either ventral premotor or inferior parietal lesions, in addition to patients with prefrontal lesions and age- and gender-matched healthy controls, were tested during the processing of temporal, object-specific, and spatial sequences. Results revealed that premotor patients as well as parietal patients showed significantly higher error rates than did healthy controls on all sequence tasks. In contrast, prefrontal patients showed no behavioral deficits. These findings support the significance of the ventrolateral premotor cortex, in addition to parietal areas, in nonmotor (attentional) functions.","1473":"Patients with schizophrenia (n = 41) and healthy comparison participants (n = 46) completed neuropsychological measures of intelligence, memory, and executive function. A subset of each group also completed magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies (fractional anisotropy and cross-sectional area) of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and cingulate bundle (CB). Patients with schizophrenia showed reduced levels of functioning across all neuropsychological measures. In addition, selective neuropsychological-DTI relationships emerged. Among patients but not controls, lower levels of declarative-episodic verbal memory correlated with reduced left UF, whereas executive function errors related to performance monitoring correlated with reduced left CB. The data suggested abnormal DTI patterns linking declarative-episodic verbal memory deficits to the left UF and executive function deficits to the left CB among patients with schizophrenia.","1474":"A meta-analysis of 30 studies with 1,269 participants was conducted to investigate the sensitivity of tests of verbal fluency to the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). As has been found for patients with focal frontal lobe injuries (but not for patients with focal temporal lobe lesions), TBI patients were comparably impaired on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency. The phonemic fluency deficit could not be accounted for by patients' level of premorbid or current verbal IQ and was also substantially (although not significantly) in excess of the deficit on a measure of psychomotor speed. Phonemic fluency was also significantly more sensitive to the presence of TBI than was the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.","1475":"The executive deficit hypothesis of treated phenylketonuria (PKU) suggests that dopaminergic depletion in the lateral prefrontal cortex leads to selective executive impairment. This was examined by comparing adults with PKU on a lifelong diet with a matched healthy control group. Those with PKU were impaired on selective and sustained attention, working memory (Self-Ordered Pointing), and letter fluency. However, they failed to show differential sensitivity to increased cognitive load on the attentional and working memory tasks, and they did not differ significantly on the remaining executive tasks (rule finding, inhibition, and multitasking). Nor did they differ significantly on recall or recognition memory. Overall, the findings provided little support for the executive deficit hypothesis. A possible explanation in terms of slowed information processing speed is explored.","1476":"The results of 2 experiments support the contention that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show a relative loss of the semantic features that distinguish concepts from one another and that the representations of pairs of concepts consequently share a larger proportion of their associated features in AD than in normal aging. In Experiment 1, AD patients listed fewer features for a set of concepts than did healthy older adults and were more deficient at listing features if the features were distinctive to particular concepts than if they were shared by multiple concepts. In Experiment 2, AD patients showed online priming at levels of relatedness at which healthy older adults did not.","1477":"The authors assessed effects of extended abstinence on cognitive and motor function deficits previously observed in a group of alcoholic women (n = 43) initially tested after 15 weeks of sobriety. Alcoholic women were retested 1 and 4 years later, and control women were retested 3 years later. At Year 1, 14 of 23 returners had maintained sobriety, but they did not perform significantly better than relapsers; the group as a whole continued to show deficits relative to age norms. By Year 4, 13 of 14 returners had maintained sobriety for more than 30 months; as a group, these women had returned to normal levels on tests of memory and psychomotor speed but remained impaired in standing balance.","1478":"Tasks emphasizing 3 different aspects of selective attention-inhibition, visuospatial selective attention, and decision making-were administered to subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to healthy elderly control (HEC) subjects to determine which components of selective attention were impaired in AD subjects and whether selective attention could be dissociated into different components. The tasks were administered with easy versus hard levels of difficulty to assess proportional slowing as the key variable across tasks. The results indicated that the inhibitory and visual search tasks showed greater proportional slowing in subjects with AD than in HEC subjects, and that the task involving inhibition was significantly more affected in subjects with AD. Furthermore, there were no significant intertask correlations, and the results cannot be explained simply in terms of generalized cognitive slowing. These results provide evidence that inhibition is the most strikingly affected aspect of selective attention that is observed to be impaired in early stages of AD.","1479":"Thirty-four adults with severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and 34 matched control participants were asked to interpret videotaped conversational exchanges. Study participants were asked to judge the speakers' emotions, the speakers' beliefs (first-order theory of mind), what the speakers intended their conversational partners to believe (second-order theory of mind), and what they meant by remarks that were sincere or literally untrue (i.e., a lie or sarcastic retort). The TBI group had marked difficulty judging most facets of social information. They could recognize speaker beliefs only when this information was explicitly provided. In general, emotion recognition and first-order theory of mind judgments were not related to the ability to understand social (conversational) inference, whereas second-order theory of mind judgments were related to that ability.","1480":"To test the hypothesis that slowed information processing in traumatic brain injury is related to diffuse axonal injury (DAI), the authors compared 10 patients with predominant DAI (diffuse group) and minimal DAI (mixed injury group) on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, simple and choice reaction time, Trail Making Tests A and B, and the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test. The diffuse group was slower than the mixed injury and control groups on basic speed of processing tasks. This difference was not apparent on complex speeded tasks once basic speed of processing was controlled for. The diffuse group's slower speed of processing was not accounted for by differences in injury severity, age, or time postinjury. The diffuse group showed greater recovery over time.","1481":"Patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) were compared with age-matched control subjects on an associative recognition task. Subjects studied pairs of unrelated words and were later asked to distinguish between these same studied pairs (intact) and new pairs that contained either rearranged studied words (rearranged) or non-studied words (non-studied). Studied pairs were presented either once or 3 times. Repetition increased hits to intact pairs in both groups, but repetition increased false alarms to rearranged pairs only in patients. This latter pattern indicates that repetition increased familiarity of the rearranged pairs, but only the control subjects were able to counter this familiarity by recalling the originally studied pairs (a recall-to-reject process). AD impaired this recall-to-reject process, leading to more familiarity based false alarms. These data support the idea that recollection-based monitoring processes are impaired in mild AD.","1482":"Cognitive measures are used frequently in the assessment and diagnosis of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this meta-analytic review, the authors sought to examine the magnitude of differences between ADHD and healthy participants on several commonly used intellectual and neuropsychological measures. Effect sizes for overall intellectual ability (Full Scale IQ; FSIQ) were significantly different between ADHD and healthy participants (weighted d =.61). Effect sizes for FSIQ were significantly smaller than those for spelling and arithmetic achievement tests and marginally significantly smaller than those for continuous performance tests but were comparable to effect sizes for all other measures. These findings indicate that overall cognitive ability is significantly lower among persons with ADHD and that FSIQ may show as large a difference between ADHD and control participants as most other measures.","1483":"The aim of this study was to investigate magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) visual functions in nonmedicated patients with schizophrenia and in their unaffected siblings. Possible abnormalities in cortical integration of retinal receptive fields also were addressed. Twenty-two nonmedicated patients with schizophrenia, their unaffected siblings, and 20 age- and IQ-matched healthy control subjects received 4 vernier acuity tasks (blue-on-yellow, frequency-doubling, achromatic low and high contrast conditions) in which they were asked to detect the spatial alignment of dots and gratings. Results revealed that the patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings showed selective dysfunctions in the frequency-doubling and achromatic low contrast conditions, which were devoted to investigate M pathways. In the isoluminant blue-on-yellow and high contrast achromatic conditions, there were no significant differences between the experimental groups. These results suggest that the deficit of M pathway is an endophenotype of schizophrenia.","1484":"Individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT; n = 53, ages 55-91), healthy older adults (n = 75, ages 59-91), and younger adults (n = 24, ages 18-24) performed a word-primed picture-naming task. Word primes were neutral (ready), semantically or phonologically related, or unrelated to the correct picture name. AH groups produced equivalent unrelated-word interference and semantic priming effects in response latencies. However, analysis of errors revealed a DAT-related increase of phonological blocking. The results suggest that picture-naming errors in DAT are due, at least in part, to a breakdown in access to phonological representations of object names as a consequence of reduced inhibitory control over other highly active alternatives.","1485":"On the basis of their scores on composite measures of frontal and temporal lobe function, derived from neuropsychological testing, seniors were divided preexperimentally into 4 groups. Participants studied a list of unrelated words under full attention and recalled them while concurrently performing an animacy decision task to words, an odd-digit identification task to numbers, or no distracting task. Large interference effects on memory were produced by the animacy but not by the odd-digit distracting task, and this pattern was not influenced by level of frontal or temporal lobe function. Results show associative retrieval is largely disrupted by competition for common representations, and it is not affected by a reduction in general processing resources, attentional capacity, or competition for memory structures in the temporal lobe.","1486":"Three experiments compared groups of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy older and younger participants on visuospatial tracking and digit sequence recall, as single tasks and performed concurrently. In Experiment 1, tasks were performed concurrently with very low demand relative to span. Only the AD patients showed a dual task deficit. In Experiment 2, single task demand was manipulated on each task from below span to above span for each individual. All groups showed the same performance reductions with increasing demand. In Experiment 3, demand on 1 task was constant, whereas demand on the concurrent task was varied. AD patients showed a clear dual task deficit but were no more sensitive than control groups to varying demand. Results suggest an identifiable cognitive resource for dual task coordination within a multiple component working memory system.","1487":"A comprehensive, empirically based review of the published studies addressing neuropsychological performance in adults diagnosed with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was conducted to identify patterns of performance deficits. Findings from 33 published studies were submitted to a meta-analytic procedure producing sample-size-weighted mean effect sizes across test measures. Results suggest that neuropsychological deficits are expressed in adults with ADHD across multiple domains of functioning, with notable impairments in attention, behavioral inhibition, and memory, whereas normal performance is noted in simple reaction time. Theoretical and developmental considerations are discussed, including the role of behavioral inhibition and working memory impairment. Future directions for research based on these findings are highlighted, including further exploration of specific impairments and an emphasis on particular tests and testing conditions.","1488":"Recent studies suggest that individuals with schizophrenia show enhanced facilitation but similar interference in reaction times (RTs), compared with control participants, combined with increased error interference. This study examined the relationship between errors and RTs on the Stroop task among individuals with schizophrenia. The authors examined performance on a speeded Stroop task, designed to increase errors, in 29 individuals with schizophrenia and 29 nonpatient control participants. The authors also analyzed color-naming and word-reading estimates from process dissociation analyses. The findings suggest that a lack of increased RT interference among patients (compared with control participants) is not solely due to the increased number of errors they produce in the incongruent condition but is also influenced by a greater impact of the word even in the neutral condition.","1489":"Themes emerging from the collection of articles in the Special Section on Long-Term Spatial Memory include the notion of multiple spatial systems, the relation between spatial representations and episodic memory, the role of context, and the neural systems involved in space. The authors conclude that distinguishing between egocentric and allocentric spatial systems makes sense of both behavioral and neurobiological data. The special role of the hippocampal system in allocentric space, and as a consequence, in context, suggests how a spatial system might end up central to the ability to remember episodes.","1490":"Thirty patients who had undergone either a right or left unilateral temporal lobectomy (14 RTL; 16 LTL) and 16 control participants were tested on a computerized human analogue of the Morris Water Maze. The procedure was designed to compare allocentric and egocentric spatial memory. In the allocentric condition, participants searched for a target location on the screen, guided by object cues. Between trials, participants had to walk around the screen, which disrupted egocentric memory representation. In the egocentric condition, participants remained in the same position, but the object cues were shifted between searches to prevent them from using allocentric memory. Only the RTL group was impaired on the allocentric condition, and neither the LTL nor RTL group was impaired on additional tests of spatial working memory or spatial manipulation. The results support the notion that the right anterior temporal lobe stores long-term allocentric spatial memories.","1491":"Hippocampal activation was investigated, comparing allocentric and egocentric spatial memory. Healthy participants were immersed in a virtual reality circular arena, with pattern-rendered walls. In a viewpoint-independent task, they moved toward a pole, which was then removed. They were relocated to another position and had to move to the prior location of the pole. For viewpoint-dependent memory, the participants were not moved to a new starting point, but the patterns were rotated to prevent them from indicating the final position. Hippocampal and parahippocampal activation were found in the viewpoint-independent memory encoding phase. Viewpoint-dependent memory did not result in such activation. These results suggest differential activation of the hippocampal formation during allocentric encoding, in partial support of the spatial mapping hypothesis as applied to humans.","1492":"Behavioral studies have shown that spatial skills, such as mental rotation, are correlated with preferences for certain types of spatial information. To be more specific, better mental rotation is associated with a preference for survey (maplike) spatial information relative to route (landmark or wayfinding) information. Functional MRI was used to investigate how individual differences in spatial skills (mental rotation) interact with encoding information from these 2 spatial perspectives. Despite similarities in performance across individuals for route and survey learning, differences between route and survey encoding activation increased with increased mental rotation ability in anterior cingulate, middle frontal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. This correlation appeared to be due to decreasing activation during survey encoding and not activation changes during route learning. The results suggest that mental rotation skill contributes to survey or map learning but that alternative strategies can be used under the circumstances of this study to achieve equal performance.","1493":"Activations produced by the recall of episodic and semantic memories differing in spatial content and age were examined. Recall of recent episodic memories with differing spatial content activated the medial temporal lobes and the retrosplenial-posterior cingulate cortex-precuneus complex more than recall of recent semantic memories with similarly differing spatial content. Some of these differences related to the amount of spatial information recalled because spatially richer recent memories, regardless of whether they were episodic or semantic, activated the right posterior parahippocampal cortex, precuneus, and posterior parietal cortex more. This spatial effect was found to be independent of memory age for semantic memories, although some episodic-semantic memory differences, including one in the left hippocampus, were not age independent. Episodic-semantic memory recall activation differences are therefore probably a function of the amount recalled, memory age, and what is recalled, particularly with respect to spatial information.","1494":"Several strategies can be used to find a destination in the environment. Using a virtual environment, the authors identified 2 strategies dependent on 2 different memory systems. A spatial strategy involved the use of multiple landmarks available in the environment, and a response strategy involved right and left turns from a given start position. Although a probe trial provided an objective measure of the strategy used, classification that was based on verbal reports was used in small groups to avoid risks of misclassification. The authors first demonstrated that the spatial strategy led to a significant activity of the hippocampus, whereas the response strategy led to a sustained activity in the caudate nucleus. Then, the authors administered the task to 15 patients with lesions to the medial temporal lobe, showing an impaired ability using the spatial strategy. Imaging and neuropsychological results are discussed to shed light on the human navigation system.","1495":"Memory for object locations and for events (comprising the receipt of an object) was tested in a case of developmental amnesia with focal hippocampal damage. Tests used virtual reality environments and forced-choice recognition with foils chosen to equalize the performance of control participants across conditions. Memory for the objects received was unimpaired, but the context of their receipt was forgotten. Memory for short lists of object locations was unimpaired when tested from the same viewpoint as presentation but impaired when tested from a shifted viewpoint. Same-view performance was disrupted by changing the background scene. These results are consistent with Jon having preserved matching to fixed sensory-bound representations but impaired reconstructed or manipulable representations underlying shifted-viewpoint recognition and episodic recollection.","1496":"This article provides an introduction to the Special Section on Long-Term Spatial Memory in the journal Neuropsychology. It defines long-term spatial memory, explores how it has been considered historically, and provides brief descriptions of the principle cognitive mechanisms, with a guide to the terminology used in this field.","1497":"The authors tested functional hemispheric asymmetry through word dichotic listening and lateralized lexical decision tasks in tinnitus patients and controls stimulated by a continuous tinnitus-like noise to test the influence of a tinnitus-like external stimulation. A classic right-ear advantage was shown in the auditory task for all but right-ear tinnitus patients, who performed as equally badly when the stimuli were presented to the right and left ears. Concerning the visual task, all participants demonstrated the expected right visual field advantage for word stimuli. Moreover, those who submitted to external stimulation demonstrated normal asymmetric patterns. These data suggest a specific effect of tinnitus on central processing and provide evidence for a functional reorganization induced by this auditory phantom perception.","1498":"The role of semantic organization in verbal memory efficiency in schizophrenia was investigated. Patients and healthy controls were administered a free-recall task involving 1 nonsemantically organizable list, 1 list organizable in semantic categories with typical instances, and 1 list organizable in semantic categories with atypical instances. Reduced semantic organization was observed in patients. Regression analyses showed that the semantic clustering score in the atypical organizable list made a significant contribution to recall performance in patients. When semantic clustering was controlled, the effect of diagnosis on free recall was significant. These results suggest that depth of semantic organization is a crucial factor of verbal memory performance in schizophrenia. However, semantic organizational deficit does not account for the whole recall impairment.","1499":"Interhemispheric interaction in mathematically gifted (MG) adolescents, average-ability (AA) youth, and college students (CS) was examined by presenting hierarchical letter pairs in 3 viewing conditions: (a) unilaterally to the right hemisphere (RH), (b) unilaterally to the left hemisphere (LH), or (c) bilaterally, with 1 member of the pair presented to each hemisphere simultaneously. Participants made global-local, match-no-match judgments. For the AA and CS, the LH was faster for local matches and the RH for global matches. The MG showed no hemispheric differences. Also, AA and CS were slower on cooperative compared with unilateral trials, whereas the MG showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that enhanced interhemispheric interaction is a unique functional characteristic of the MG brain.","1500":"Apolipoprotein E (APOE), vitamin B12, and folate were examined in relation to free recall among 167 community-based older adults. Cognitive support at encoding and retrieval was also taken into account. Participants were classified as APOE e4 or non-epsilon4 allele carriers and as either low or normal vitamin B12 or folate status. A significant association was identified between low vitamin B12 and the epsilon4 genotype in respect to free recall, but only in circumstances of low cognitive support. This result remained after removing dementia cases that occurred up to 6 years after testing. A similar, but nonsignificant, trend was evident in relation to folate. The research is discussed with reference to vulnerability models and genetic influences on brain reserves.","1501":"Twenty-four severe closed-head injury (CHI) participants and 24 controls completed event-based prospective memory tasks concurrently with an ongoing working memory task. The event cue was either integrated with the ongoing working memory task (focal cue) or peripheral to it. Prospective remembering was poorer for the CHI group in both the focal- and peripheral-cue conditions. The groups did not differ on the ongoing task. The peripheral cue and the integrated focal cue also did not differ in ability to trigger prospective remembering. The results suggest that, even with highly salient event cues, severe CHI participants (&gt; 1 year postinjury) are more likely than controls to exhibit prospective memory failures. The data revealed a link between CHI participants' prospective memory failures and momentary lapses of intention.","1502":"The authors compared hemisphere-based and cognitive-domain-based hypotheses for visual-spatial deficits in children with stroke (n = 33) and children without stroke (n = 43). Children with unilateral left (n = 14) or right (n = 7) injury showed less efficient search for the visual field contralateral to their injury. Right-hemisphere injury was associated with deficient global-level processing and coordinate spatial judgments. Left-hemisphere injury resulted in relatively intact local versus global processing and categorical versus coordinate judgments. Bilateral injury (n = 12) resulted in disruption of visual search across visual fields and relative deficits in global-level processing and coordinate spatial judgments. Recovery of visual-spatial processing in children following childhood stroke is task specific. Certain visual-spatial functions typically mediated by the left hemisphere appear less vulnerable to disruption.","1503":"The corpus callosum has been proposed to contribute to attention by modulating resource allocation between the hemispheres and filtering interhemispheric signal transmission (M. T. Banich, 1998). The resource allocation hypothesis predicts that interhemispheric interactions become more advantageous with increasing resource demands. The selective filtering hypothesis predicts that interhemispheric interactions become less advantageous as filtering requirements increase. The authors tested both predictions by comparing within- and across-hemisphere letter matching under dual-task (Experiment 1) and selective attention conditions (Experiment 2). Task-specific resource demands (i.e., letter processing load) alter the bihemispheric advantage, but the general demand imposed by an unrelated secondary task does not. Filtering requirements influenced the advantage from interhemispheric interactions, providing new evidence for the role of the corpus callosum in selective attention.","1504":"National traumatic events can produce extremely vivid memories. Using a questionnaire administered during telephone interviews, the authors investigated emotional responses to, and memory for. the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy older adults in the initial weeks following the event and again 3-4 months later. There were several notable findings. First, patients with AD showed less memory than patients with MCI and older adults. Second, patients with AD, but not patients with MCI or older adults, appeared to retain more memory for personal versus factual information. Third, patients with AD and older adults did not differ in the intensity of their reported emotional responses to the attacks, whereas patients with MCI reported relatively less intense emotional responses. Last, distortions of memory for personal information were frequent for all participants but were more common in patients with AD.","1505":"We collected category fluency data from several moderate-to-large samples of participants at three different sites: the New York University Aging and Dementia Center, the Oregon Health Services Aging and Dementia Research Center, and the Einstein Aging Study at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. These data were analyzed by calculating the average relative frequency (e.g., typicality) of the category members generated by each participant. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients recalled fewer atypical members of common taxonomic categories than did the elderly control group. In addition, the probability of producing an item declined at a greater rate for AD patients than for the elderly control group over the duration of the task. According to sequential sampling models, this latter result implies that the rate at which AD patients search memory must be slower than the search rate of the elderly controls.","1506":"Executive functions depend on the ability to represent relations between objects and events, and the prefrontal cortex provides the neural substrate for this capacity. Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control participants were administered measures of working memory and reasoning that varied systematically in their relational complexity. AD patients showed impairment on reasoning measures that required the online integration of relations but performed as well as control participants on nonrelational items and items requiring the processing of only single relations. When AD patients were divided into subgroups based on their performance on relational reasoning measures, the subgroup that showed significant impairment on relational integration measures exhibited a neuropsychological profile consistent with prefrontal cortical dysfunction.","1507":"A meta-analysis of 31 studies with 1,791 participants was conducted to investigate the sensitivity of tests of verbal fluency to the presence of focal cortical lesions. Relative to healthy controls, participants with focal frontal injuries had large and comparable deficits on phonemic (r = .52) and semantic (r = .54) fluency. For frontal but not nonfrontal patients, phonemic fluency deficits qualified as differential deficits when compared with IQ and psychomotor speed; phonemic fluency was also more strongly and more specifically related to the presence of frontal lesions than the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test scores. In contrast, temporal damage was associated with a lesser deficit on phonemic fluency (r = .44) but a larger deficit on semantic fluency (r = .61).","1508":"In prior studies, it was observed that patients with schizophrenia show abnormally high knowledge corruption (i.e., high-confident errors expressed as a percentage of all high-confident responses were increased for schizophrenic patients relative to controls). The authors examined the conditions under which excessive knowledge corruption occurred using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm. Whereas knowledge corruption in schizophrenia was significantly greater for false-negative errors relative to controls, no group difference occurred for false-positive errors. The groups showed a comparable high degree of confidence for false-positive recognition of critical lure items. Similar to findings collected in elderly participants, patients, but not controls, showed a strong positive correlation between the number of recognized studied items and false-positive recognition of the critical lure.","1509":"In this study, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were tested to see if executive dysfunction impacts their implementation of expectancy biases in a priming task. Young adults, healthy older adults, and individuals with MCI made speed-related decisions to sequentially presented word pairs. The proportion of category related (e.g., apple-fruit) versus coordinate related (apple-pear) pairs was varied to create different expectancy biases. When the proportion of category pairs was high (80%), the control groups showed an expectancy bias: Significant inhibition was observed for coordinate pairs compared with category pairs. The MCI group also demonstrated an expectancy bias but with much larger costs for unexpected targets. The findings suggest that individuals with MCI are inordinately sensitive to expectancy violations, and these findings are discussed in terms of possible executive dysfunction.","1510":"The effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on phasic alerting and exogenous spatial orienting were examined within a single precuing task. Phasic alerting decreased with normal aging and was completely eliminated with AD. AD patients also demonstrated an increased spatial orienting effect, attributable to an increased benefit from spatial orienting that was associated with a decreased benefit from nonselective alerting. These results suggest that performance within the precuing paradigm reflects the product of an interaction between nonselective alerting processes and spatially selective orienting processes. The results also highlight the importance of simultaneously assessing alerting and orienting within the same task, because changes attributable to alerting may otherwise be attributed incorrectly to changes in 1 or more processes associated with spatial orienting.","1511":"In this experiment, a Stroop-like paradigm was used to investigate the ability to attend to visuospatial cues while ignoring distracting stimuli in the auditory or visual modality. In Part 1, the authors investigated whether linguistic cue words (i.e., RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN, and UP) would induce endogenous shifts of attention to visual targets. In Part 2, a relevant distractor stimulus was introduced in a different modality from the endogenous cues to investigate effects of interference. Twenty-five right-handed students served as participants. Auditory and visual linguistic cues were effective in inducing shifts of visual attention when cues were presented alone. Furthermore, introducing a distractor stimulus decreased the efficacy of these cues differently depending on modality, suggesting that language processing and visuospatial attention may share neuronal resources. Implications for unimodal and supramodal mechanisms of selective attention and relevant neuronal networks are discussed.","1512":"The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on working memory (WM) was studied in 144 children (79 with mild, 23 with moderate, and 42 with severe injuries) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 months and were tested at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postinjury. An n-back WM task for letter identity was administered with memory load ranging from 1- to 3-back and a 0-back condition. A TBI Severity x Quadratic Tune interaction showed that net percentage correct (correct detections of targets minus false alarms) was significantly lower in severe than in mild TBI groups. The Left Frontal Lesions x Age interaction approached significance. Mechanisms mediating late decline in WM and the effects of left frontal lesions are discussed.","1513":"Twenty-one pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and 21 matched healthy control (HC) subjects were assessed with 5 untimed tests and 5 timed tests from the computer-based NeuroCognitive Assessment Battery (R. K. Mahurin, 1993). Random effects regression showed no difference between CFS and healthy twins on any of the cognitive tests. Further, the twin groups did not differ from the HC group on any content-dependent measure. In contrast, both sets of twins performed worse than the HC group on all speed-dependent tests except Finger Tapping. Self-rated fatigue and dysphoric mood were only weakly correlated with cognitive performance. These data point toward a shared genetic trait related to information processing that is manifest in the CFS context. The findings have implications for differentiating genetic and acquired vulnerability in the symptomatic expression of the disorder.

Asymmetries in Heschl's gyrus, planum temporale, and planum parietale were measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Composite task asymmetries were positively correlated with asymmetry of the planum temporale only. There was also an association between the consistency of anatomical and behavioral asymmetries: Individuals who departed the most from the modal pattern of cortical asymmetry across regions also tended to show the greatest variability in asymmetry across tasks. Hence, individual differences in language laterality tasks may be affected by variation in asymmetry of posterior language structures. Additionally, when typical anatomical asymmetries fail to co-occur, there may be a less strictly regulated distribution of function across hemispheres.","1515":"Impaired facial expression recognition has been associated with features of major depression, which could underlie some of the difficulties in social interactions in these patients. Patients with major depressive disorder and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers judged the emotion of 100 facial stimuli displaying different intensities of sadness and happiness and neutral expressions presented for short (100 ms) and long (2,000 ms) durations. Compared with healthy volunteers, depressed patients demonstrated subtle impairments in discrimination accuracy and a predominant bias away from the identification as happy of mildly happy expressions. The authors suggest that, in depressed patients, the inability to accurately identify subtle changes in facial expression displayed by others in social situations may underlie the impaired interpersonal functioning.","1516":"Chronic alcohol abuse leads to cognitive deficits. The authors investigated whether a systematic increase of interference in a 2-back working memory paradigm would lead to cognitive deficits in alcoholic participants and compared their performance in such a task with that in an alternate-response task. Twenty-four nonamnesic and nondemented alcohol abuse (AA) patients and 12 patients with Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) were compared with a control group. AA patients were impaired in the alternate-response task but not in working memory interference resolution. KS patients performed worse than the AA patients and the controls in both tasks. The neurotoxic side effects of alcohol therefore lead to a specific deficit in alternating between response rules but not in working memory, independently of whether the working memory task involves interference resolution or not.","1517":"PCBs are known for their neurotoxic properties, especially on the developing brain. To increase insight into the neurotoxic effects of PCB exposure, the authors studied the effects of perinatal exposure to environmental levels of these compounds on different neuropsychological domains. In 9-year-old children of the Rotterdam PCB--dioxin cohort, higher prenatal PCB levels were associated with longer response times (RTs), more variation in RTs, and lower scores on the Tower of London (TOL; Shallice, 1982). A longer breast-feeding duration was associated with lower TOL scores and with better spatial organizational skills. There was some evidence of negative effects of lactational exposure to PCBs on scores on the TOL.","1518":"Hebrew and Arabic are Semitic languages with a similar morphological structure and orthographies that differ in visual complexity. Two experiments explored the interaction of the characteristics of orthography and hemispheric abilities on lateralized versions of a letter-matching task (Experiment 1) and a global-local task (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, native Hebrew readers and native Arabic readers fluent in Hebrew matched letters in the 2 orthographies. The results support the hypothesis that Arabic orthography is more difficult than Hebrew orthography for participants who can read both languages and that this difficulty has its strongest effects in the left visual field. In Experiment 2, native Arabic speakers performed a global-local letter detection task with Arabic letters with 2 types of inconsistent stimuli: different and similar. The results support the hypothesis that the right hemisphere of skilled Arabic readers cannot distinguish between similar Arabic letters, whereas the left hemisphere can.","1519":"Selection ability (selecting a response from several competing semantic and\/or lexical representations) was tested in 21 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 28 control participants to help clarify the nature of semantic impairments in AD. Selection demands were manipulated in 3 tasks (lexical fluency, comparison, and verb generation). In each, high-selection conditions required response selection from competing alternatives, whereas low-selection conditions had a reduced need for selection. Patients with AD were disproportionately impaired on the high-selection conditions of all tasks, even when this condition was easier. Selection deficits on verb generation were evident only relative to nonspeeded controls. Overall results indicate impaired semantic selection abilities in AD, which may contribute to poor performance on some semantic tasks.","1520":"This study examined whether individuals with substance dependence (ISDs) show impairments in working memory and whether there is a relationship between their impairments in decision making as measured by the gambling task (GT) paradigm and working memory as measured by a delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMS) task. Using the GT, 11% of healthy control participants and 61% of ISDs opted for choices with high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. For the ISDs and controls with equal GT impairments, the ISDs performed significantly lower than controls on the DNMS task. The nonimpaired ISDs on the GT also performed significantly worse than matched controls on the DNMS task. The DNMS task deficit in ISDs was across all delay times, suggesting the deficit may lie in the \"executive\" process of working memory, which supports earlier findings (E. M. Martin et al., 2003). The authors suggest that the prefrontal cortex hosts multiple distinct mechanisms of decision making and inhibitory control and that ISDs may be affected in any one or combination of them.","1521":"This study investigated the lateralizing value of neuropsychological testing in presurgical evaluation of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). This study differed from previous ones in that the cutoff values were determined to yield high positive predictive values (PPVs), multiple neuropsychological predictors were considered in combination, and patients with atypical language dominance or low intelligence were not excluded from the sample. The participants were 92 patients with MTLE (left, n = 47; right, n = 45) who showed good postoperative seizure control. With a stringent cutoff criterion, the multiple neuropsychological predictors considered in combination yielded a sensitivity of 15% and a PPV of 93%, and with a less stringent cutoff criterion, a sensitivity of 37% and a PPV of 83%.","1522":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of word stress location in neglect dyslexia. An assessment was made of stress assignment in reading Italian words in 13 patients with neglect dyslexia and 13 matched normal individuals. The correspondence in stress location between target and neglect errors was preserved in 9 patients. Moreover, the proportion of words with stress on the penultimate syllable was about 50% and that on the antepenultimate syllable was also about 50%. This pattern is significantly different from the distribution observed in the Italian lexicon, in which the majority of polysyllabic words are stressed on the penultimate syllable. This result cannot be expected from the application of a \"regularization\" strategy associated with the operation of a nonlexical reading pathway. Taken together, these findings lead to the conclusion that lexical stress is part of the lexical information preserved in neglect dyslexia.","1523":"Three experiments investigated the aging of implicit spatial and spatiotemporal context learning in 2 tasks. In contextual cuing, people learn to use repeated spatial configurations to facilitate search for a target, whereas in higher order serial learning, they learn to use subtle sequence regularities to respond more quickly and accurately to a series of events. Results reveal a dissociation; overall contextual cuing is spared in healthy aging, whereas higher order sequence learning is impaired in the same individuals. This finding suggests that these 2 forms of implicit learning rely on different neural substrates that age differently; the results are also consistent with recent evidence that fronto-striatal circuits are particularly susceptible to decline in health aging.","1524":"To elucidate the dynamic interactions of cortical and subcortical oculomotor systems, the authors investigated reflexive and strategic control over fixation and saccades in patients with chronic unilateral lesions that involved either frontal or parietal cortex. They measured the effects of indicating the location of the forthcoming target and removing the fixation stimulus on the latencies of eye movements toward a peripheral visual target in 12 patients with frontal eye field (FEF) lesions, 9 patients with lesions restricted to parietal cortex, and 12 neurologically healthy controls. They found that chronic damage to FEF cortex disrupts cortico-collicular interactions, resulting in hypoactivity in the contralesional superior colliculus and a loss of strategic control over the intrinsic collicular circuits that regulate fixation.","1525":"A variant of the list method directed forgetting procedure was used to examine the role of inhibition in memory performance following severe closed-head injury (CHI). Twenty-four participants with severe CHI and 24 controls studied picture and word stimuli in both forget and remember conditions. Memory testing for the to-be-forgotten and to-be-remembered items consisted of a free-recall test followed by a source-monitoring task. Despite poorer recall performance, the participants with CHI exhibited a directed forgetting effect similar to that in controls. Item recognition scores indicated that the inhibited items were not forgotten but rather were items whose accessibility had been lowered. These findings suggest that residual memory deficits in patients with severe CHI are unlikely to reflect inefficient retrieval inhibition.","1526":"This study examined verbal recognition memory in amnesic patients with frontal lesions (AF), nonamnesic patients with frontal lesions (NAF), and amnesic patients with medial temporal lesions (MT). To examine susceptibility to false alarms, the number of studied words drawn from various categories was varied. The AF and MT groups demonstrated reduced hits and increased false alarms. False alarms were especially elevated when item-specific recollection was strongest in control participants. The NAF group performed indistinguishably from control participants, but several patients showed excessive false alarms in the context of normal hit rates. These patients exhibited impaired monitoring and verification processes. The findings demonstrate that elevated false recognition is not characteristic of all frontal patients and may result from more than 1 underlying mechanism.","1527":"A meta-analysis of 27 primary studies was conducted to examine the relationship between neuropsychological functioning and driving ability for adults with dementia. When studies using a control group were included, the relationship between cognitive measures and on-road or non-road driving measures was significant for all reported domains; mean correlations ranged from.35 to.65. Caregiver reports of driving ability and cognitive variables were correlated significantly only on measures of mental status and visuospatial skills. When studies using a control group were excluded, moderate mean correlations were observed for visuospatial skills and on-road or non-road measures, and for mental status with non-road tests. Other effects were small or nonsignificant. Implications for basing driving recommendations on neuropsychological testing are discussed.","1528":"Statistical mediation modeling was used to test the hypothesis that poor use of a semantic organizational strategy contributes to verbal learning and memory deficits in adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comparison of 28 adults with ADHD and 34 healthy controls revealed lower performance by the ADHD group on tests of verbal learning and memory, sustained attention, and use of semantic organization during encoding. Mediation modeling indicated that state anxiety, but not semantic organization, significantly contributed to the prediction of both learning and delayed recall in the ADHD group. The pattern of findings suggests that decreased verbal learning and memory in adult ADHD is due in part to situational anxiety and not to poor use of organizational strategies during encoding.","1529":"Letter and semantic fluency tasks are often used in neuropsychological assessment and are sensitive to many conditions. Performance is assessed by correct responses and errors, including perseverations. Healthy young adults performed letter and semantic fluency tasks. One group performed these tasks in the conventional manner; 2 other groups performed them while maintaining memory loads. The memory loads consisted either of words from the same category as the fluency task or of words from a different category. The results showed little effect of memory loads on correct responses but significant effects of memory load on perseveration rates: Same-category loads resulted in higher rates, especially in letter fluency. The results are discussed in terms of frontal lobe function in verbal fluency.","1530":"Latent constructs involved in California Verbal Learning Test (D. C. Delis, J. H. Kramer, E. Kaplan, &amp; B. A. Ober, 1987) performance were examined using confirmatory factor analysis in 388 epilepsy surgery candidates. Eight factor models were compared. A single-factor model was examined, along with 7 models accommodating constructs of auditory attention, inaccurate recall, and delayed recall in different combinations. The retained model consisted of 3 correlated factors: Auditory Attention. Verbal Learning, and Inaccurate Recall. Validity of this factor structure was examined in a subsample of patients with left and right temporal lobe epilepsy. All 3 factors were related to seizure focus and magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal volume. Only Verbal Learning was related to hippocampal neuropathology, supporting the distinction between learning and attention in the factor structure.","1531":"Selective attention among offenders with psychopathy was investigated using 3 Stroop paradigms: a standard color-word (CW) Stroop, a picture-word (PW) Stroop, and a color-word Stroop in which the word and color were spatially separated (separated CW). Consistent with \"overselective\" attention, offenders with psychopathy displayed reduced Stroop interference on the separated CW and PW tasks relative to offenders who were not psychopathic. However, offenders with psychopathy displayed normal Stroop interference on the standard CW Stroop. Further, the reduced interference of offenders with psychopathy on the separated CW Stroop was accompanied by normal facilitation. These findings suggest a circumscribed attentional deficit in psychopathy that hinders the use of unattended information that is (a) not integrated with deliberately attended information and (b) not compatible with current goal-directed behavior.","1532":"Identifying high-functioning older individuals in preclinical phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may require more sensitive methods than the standard approach. The authors explored the utility of adjusting for premorbid intelligence to predict progressive cognitive decline or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in 42 highly intelligent older individuals. When scores were adjusted for baseline IQ, 9 participants had executive impairments, 11 had memory impairments, and 22 scored in the normal range. None were impaired according to standard age norms. Three and a half years later, 9 participants with IQ-adjusted memory impairment declined in naming, visuospatial functioning, and memory; 6 convened to MCI. Three participants with normal memory declined. Implications for using IQ-adjusted norms to predict preclinical AD are discussed.","1533":"This article describes the relationship between reading, phonological awareness abilities (PA), and intelligence in a group of 16 individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) and in a group of 16 typically developing children, matched for mental age. The individuals with WS were impaired in passage comprehension, in some areas of PA investigated (syllable deletion and rhyme detection), and in nonword reading accuracy, a measure of grapheme-phoneme conversion. This latter finding is relevant, considering that in Italy regular print-to-sound correspondence is the most practiced teaching routine in the early phases of learning to read.","1534":"This study addressed the role of the medial temporal lobe regions and, more specifically, the contribution of the human hippocampus in memory for body-centered (egocentric) and environment-centered (allocentric) spatial location. Twenty-one patients with unilateral atrophy of the hippocampus secondary to long-standing epilepsy (left, n = 7; right, n = 14) and 15 normal control participants underwent 3 tasks measuring recall of egocentric or allocentric spatial location. Patients with left hippocampal sclerosis were consistently impaired in the allocentric conditions of all 3 tasks but not in the egocentric conditions. Patients with right hippocampal sclerosis were impaired to a lesser extent and in only 2 of the 3 tasks. It was concluded that hippocampal structures are crucial for allocentric, but not egocentric, spatial memory.","1535":"A sample of 473 male patients with pedophilia (assessed by the patients' sexual history and penile response in the laboratory to standardized, erotic stimuli) or other problematic sexual interests or behaviors received brief neuropsychological assessments. Neuropsychological measures included a short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (D. Wechsler, 1981), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test--Revised (R. H. B. Benedict, D. Schretlen. L. Groninger. &amp; J. Brandt, 1998), the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test--Revised (R. H. B. Benedict, 1997), and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (S. M. Williams, 1986). Pedophilia showed significant negative correlations with IQ and immediate and delayed recall memory. Pedophilia was also related to non-right-handedness even after covarying age and IQ. These results suggest that pedophilia is linked to early neurodevelopmental perturbations.","1536":"Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) have difficulty understanding verbs. To investigate the neural basis for this deficit, the authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine patterns of neural activation during verb processing in 11 AD patients compared with 16 healthy seniors. Subjects judged the pleasantness of verbs, including MOTION verbs and COGNITION verbs. Healthy seniors and AD patients both activated posterolateral temporal and inferior frontal regions during judgments of verbs. These activations were relatively reduced and somewhat changed in their anatomic distribution in AD patients compared with healthy seniors, particularly for the subcategory of MOTION verbs, but AD patients showed minimal activation in association with COGNITION verbs. These findings imply that poor performance with verbs in AD is due in part to altered activation of the large-scale neural network that supports verb processing.","1537":"The effects of a fragile X disorder on executive function impairment were assessed in 144 extended families, which included individuals with fragile X premutation and full mutation and their relatives without fragile X. A modification of the maximum-likelihood estimators for pedigree data, as well as ordinal logistic regression, were used in data analysis. The most outstanding deficit, occurring especially in males, involved impaired capacity to use an intention to regulate purposeful behavior. This deficit occurred independently of general cognitive impairment but was related to depletion of fragile X mental retardation 1 gene protein product. The other executive function deficits were accounted for by the general cognitive impairment. Possible mechanisms of the effect of fragile X premutation on impairments of executive functioning are considered.","1538":"In this article the authors describe a patient (J.P.) whose category-specific naming deficit eluded the classical dichotomies between living versus nonliving items or visual versus functional attributes. At age 22, he had herpes simplex encephalitis followed by a left temporal lobectomy. J.P. was tested on measures of visual perception, category naming, fluency, and name-picture matching. He showed a severe impairment naming and identifying fruits, vegetables, and musical instruments. His performance with animals and birds was spared inconsistently, meaning that even the preserved categories were, at some point, affected. J.P.'s unusual deficit supports the hypothesis that semantic knowledge is organized in the brain on the basis of object properties, which can cut across the living-nonliving categorical distinction.","1539":"Knowledge obtained from longitudinal animal models was used to predict the course of verbal memory deficits in 19 concussed patients and 19 control patients who were given versions of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test--Revised at 2 hr, 48 hr, and 1 week postconcussion. The physiological literature suggests that concussed patients should exhibit a decline in performance from 2 hr to 48 hr postconcussion on a measure of complex memory strategies. Consistent with this hypothesis, mixed-factor analysis of covariance revealed that concussed patients used less semantic clustering strategies than control patients at 48 hr postconcussion, whereas minimal differences were found at 2 hr postinjury. Furthermore, a chi-square analysis showed that a significant number of concussed patients experienced a decline in the number of semantic clusters they used from 2 hr to 48 hr. No differences were found between the groups at the 1-week testing session.","1540":"Event-related magnetic fields were recorded using magnetoencephalography in children with (n=12) and without (n=11) dyslexia while they discriminated between pairs of syllables from a voice onset time series (\/ga\/-\/ka\/). Nonimpaired readers exhibited left-hemisphere predominance of activity after the resolution of the N1m, whereas children with dyslexia experienced a sharp peak of relative activation in right temporoparietal areas between 300 and 700 ms post-stimulus onset. Increased relative activation in right temporoparietal areas was correlated with reduced performance on phonological processing measures. Results are consistent with the notion that deficits in appreciating the sound structure of both written and spoken language are associated with abnormal neurophysiological activity in temporoparietal language areas in children with dyslexia.","1541":"The authors examined line bisection in 4 patients with resection of the corpus callosum and in 22 control participants. The control participants showed a leftward bias, especially with the left hand, implying right-hemispheric dominance in spatial attention. Two patients with anterior callosotomy showed similar biases, suggesting that the anterior callosum plays only a small role. A patient with complete callosotomy showed a strong right bias, regardless of hand use. A patient with posterior callosotomy showed the opposite pattern: a strong left bias, regardless of hand use. These data suggest that the posterior corpus callosum normally plays a role in line bisection and that the resection of the posterior corpus callosum produces consistent bias. The direction of the bias depends on which hemisphere assumes control.","1542":"Increased semantic priming effects (hyperpriming) are sometimes observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in normal aging. Whereas the processes underlying this phenomenon are now well understood in AD, the interpretation is much more woolly in normal aging. To explore semantic priming, the authors used a lexical decision task in which the influence of attention and cognitive slowing was controlled. To explore the semantic organization, the words had coordinate (tiger-lion) or attribute relations (zebra-stripes). Priming scores of 21 older and 20 young participants were equivalent in the 2 conditions. These results reflect the integrity of semantic memory with normal aging and call into question some investigations showing hyperpriming for older participants; this may instead be an artifact of a general slowing effect.","1543":"Previous visual laterality experiments have shown that identification is better when 2 copies of the same stimulus are presented--1 to each hemisphere--than when only a single copy is presented to 1 hemisphere. New experiments were conducted to vary whether the 2 stimuli on a bilaterally redundant trial were physically identical or identical in format in addition to leading to identical responses. Substantial bihemispheric gain was obtained even when the 2 stimuli were perceptually distinctive (e.g., letter trigrams differing in case and font or the same numeric quantity represented by digits and dots). Thus, much of the bihemispheric advantage involves relatively abstract aspects of information processing. However, when the formats were sufficiently distinctive, there were small effects on bihemispheric performance, suggesting some role for less abstract processes that are sensitive to physical characteristics.","1544":"Bilateral presentations of words, 1 in the left visual hemifield (LVF) and 1 in the right (RVF), are used widely in studies of hemispheric asymmetry. However, although words shown centrally (i.e., nonlaterally) produce perceptual interactions in which 1 word alters the perceived identity of the other, perceptual interactions between bilaterally presented words have never been reported. To investigate this issue, the authors used brief, bilateral displays of words (e.g., romp-ramp) presented simultaneously. An eye tracker and forced-choice task ensured appropriate presentation and testing. Report accuracy was greatest for RVF words. However, this was accompanied by perceptual interactions that occurred almost exclusively in responses to LVF words, indicating that RVF words often altered the perceived identity of LVF words but not vice versa.","1545":"This study investigates the effects of left versus right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) on Wechsler intelligence factors. In the left MTLE group, the Verbal Comprehension (VC) factor score was significantly lower than the Perceptual Organization (PO) factor score, whereas in the right MTLE group, the PO factor score was significantly lower than the VC factor score. The VC factor score was significantly lower for the left than the right MTLE group, whereas the PO factor score was significantly lower for the right than the left MTLE group. Thus, left versus right MTLE was associated with relative deficits in verbal versus nonverbal intelligence, respectively. These findings indicate that lateralized cognitive deficits in unilateral MTLE patients are not limited to the learning-memory domain but include more global intelligence functions.","1546":"Fifty children diagnosed with medulloblastoma completed 188 psychological evaluations using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (D. Wechsler, 1974, 1991) over a 7-year study period following 35-40 Gy postoperative craniospinal irradiation. Random coefficient models were used to predict the trend in the children's intellectual performance as a function of time since diagnosis, with both patient and treatment variables as parameters of this function. A quadratic model demonstrated a delay prior to decline in performance for older patients, whereas the younger patients showed an immediate loss of performance with a plateau at approximately 6 years postdiagnosis. A steeper decline was found for those with higher baseline performance. Clinicians may use the proposed predictive model to identify those patients who are at risk of significant intellectual decline.","1547":"Long-term memory impairment is often found in schizophrenia. The question remains whether this is caused by other cognitive deficits. One hundred eighteen first-episode patients were compared with 45 control participants on several memory tasks. The role of processing speed and central executive functions on memory performance was examined with regression analysis for all participants and for patients separately. Deficits were found in general verbal learning performance and retrieval in episodic memory and semantic memory. Processing speed reduced disease-related variance in all memory variables. Coordination, organization of information, and speed of processing were the best predictors for long-term memory deficits in patients. The amount of explained variance, however, is small, especially in general verbal learning performance.","1548":"The authors examined whether patients with schizophrenia learned sequential patterns in a probabilistic serial response time task in which pattern trials alternated with random ones. Patients showed faster and more accurate responses to pattern trials than to random trials, but controls showed greater sensitivity to patterns. The highest level of regularity learned in both groups was information about runs of 3 events. Pattern learning occurred largely outside of awareness, as participants could not describe patterns. Controls with higher memory spans learned the sequential pattern better than those with lower memory spans, suggesting that working memory influences implicit pattern learning. Pathology in motor sequencing systems and poor working memory may lead to deficits in learning sequence structure in schizophrenia.","1549":"Implicit sequence learning in the serial reaction task suffers from total sleep deprivation. The authors compared implicit-learning scores in a sleep-deprivation (SD) group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 6). Both groups were tested immediately after learning a 1st sequence; a delayed test was conducted on the next day (after a night without sleep in the SD group). Immediately after the delayed test a 2nd sequence was learned, followed by an immediate test and a delayed test toward the end of the experiment. In the SD group implicit-learning scores were reduced in both tests of the 2nd sequence, but in neither test of the 1st sequence. Thus, 1 night of total sleep deprivation impairs the acquisition of implicit sequence knowledge, but not its behavioral expression.","1550":"This study compared magnetic resonance imaging size differences in several brain regions and neurocognitive function in a group of male and female children with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with no comorbid learning disorders with a normal control group of children. The ADHD group demonstrated smaller total brain, superior prefrontal, and right superior prefrontal volumes, as well as significantly smaller areas for cerebellar lobules I-V and VIII-X, total corpus callosum area, and splenium. No group differences were observed for the inferior prefrontal, caudate, or cerebellar volumes, or for the area of cerebellar lobules VI-VII. In the ADHD group but not in the control group, greater right superior prefrontal volume predicted poorer performance on a test of sustained attention. Patterns of brain abnormality did not differ in male and female children with ADHD.","1551":"Aging of cerebral olfactory regions was studied in 5 younger and 6 older healthy adults, matched by odor discrimination and identification scores, with positron emission tomography during odor sensory stimulation, discrimination, and identification tasks. Sensory stimulation engaged bilateral piriform and orbitofrontal regions, but neither discrimination nor identification evoked added temporal or orbital activity. Discrimination involved the hippocampus, implicating its role in serial odor comparisons (olfactory working memory). Left inferior frontal activity during identification may reflect semantic associations. Older participants deactivated the left gyrus rectus\/medial orbital gyrus (GR\/MOG) during sensory stimulation but activated GR\/MOG during discrimination and identification. Adjusting for detection threshold eliminated GR\/MOG group differences during sensory stimulation. Diminished threshold may lead to reduced engagement of olfactory association areas.","1552":"Proactive interference (PI) occurs when previously learned information reduces the ability to acquire new, related information. Given that PI is modulated by the cholinergic system in rats (E. De Rosa &amp; M. E. Hasselmo, 2000) and that chronic alcohol dependence disrupts cholinergic function in rats and humans, associative properties of PI in patients with alcoholism were examined. It was hypothesized that normal PI contingencies would be disrupted in alcoholic participants. When tested with a paired-associate simultaneous discrimination paradigm, analogous to that used in the rat model, alcoholic participants showed significantly less PI than controls yet performed comparably on a control response reversal task. The absence of PI in alcoholic participants may reflect impaired configural binding of paired-associate stimuli while sparing the elemental ability to process each stimulus component.","1553":"This study addresses how the timing of a known biological insult affects the developmental progression of executive functions. The sample consisted of children exposed to elevated levels of phenylalanine, either postnatally, as in phenylketonuria (PKU; n = 46), or prenatally, as in maternal PKU (n = 15). Nonhyperphenylanemic siblings of children with PKU (n = 18) served as controls. Results indicated that elevated levels of phenylalanine are toxic to the neurological systems that manage executive functions and cognitive tempo. This toxicity is dose dependent, with higher levels of phenylalanine being more detrimental. Executive function difficulties noted in PKU are consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-inattentive type, whereas maternal PKU offspring had executive function difficulties consistent with ADHD-combined type.","1554":"Hemispheric asymmetries for processing rapid (timbral) and slow (nontimbral) amplitude fluctuations of complex tones were investigated in 32 right-handed nonmusicians. Two monaural matching-to-sample tests with contralateral white noise and attention directed to 1 ear were used, 1 with tones presenting slow fluctuations of amplitude and 1 with tones presenting rapid fluctuations of amplitude perceived as different timbres. Stimuli were generated by altering the amplitude envelope of a steady state complex tone. Dependent variables were reaction time and accuracy. The results suggest an important role for the right hemisphere in the perception of temporal variations of intensity of sounds both when these variations are rapid and perceived as timbral qualities and when they are slow and perceived as changes of loudness.","1555":"The hypothesis that music training can improve verbal memory was tested in children. The results showed that children with music training demonstrated better verbal but not visual memory than did their counterparts without such training. When these children were followed up after a year, those who had begun or continued music training demonstrated significant verbal memory improvement. Students who discontinued the training did not show any improvement. Contrary to the differences in verbal memory between the groups, their changes in visual memory were not significantly different. Consistent with previous findings for adults (A. S. Chan, Y. Ho, &amp; M. Cheung, 1998), the results suggest that music training systematically affects memory processing in accordance with possible neuroanatomical modifications in the left temporal lobe.","1556":"Does sentence generation and\/or stimulus emotionality enhance verbal memory in patients with neurological impairment? This question was addressed by testing 40 patients with unilateral stroke (20 with left-brain and 20 with right-brain damage) and 20 healthy control participants for recall and recognition of 48 target words. During encoding, emotional and nonemotional words were either presented in sentences (read condition) or used to form sentences (generate condition). Both word emotionality and generative processing improved memory performance in all groups. The authors suggest that a similar influence (i.e., cognitive activation) underlies both of these memory-enhancing effects, although the putative origins of the 2 effects are quite different. Neuropsychological underpinnings and clinical implications of these phenomena are discussed.","1557":"The effect of long-term heavy alcohol consumption on brain functions is still under debate. The authors investigated a sample of 17 Korsakoff amnesics, 23 alcoholics without Korsakoff's syndrome, and 21 controls with peripheral nerve diseases, matched for intelligence and education. Executive functions were examined for word fluency, the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, an alternate response task, and an \"n-back\" working memory task. Korsakoff amnesics, but not alcoholics, showed a marked memory impairment. They also scored lower in each of the executive tasks-the alcoholics only in the alternate response task. This task also correlated with the years of the alcohol dependency. First, the authors conclude that Korsakoff's syndrome is associated not only with a memory impairment but also with a global executive deficit. Second, the decline in the ability to alternate between different responses argues for a restricted neurotoxic effect of alcohol on some frontal lobe areas.","1558":"The main objective of this study was to use structural equation modeling (SEM) to clarify the relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological functioning in 160 adults with HIV infection. Participants completed questionnaires assessing cognitive complaints, symptoms of depression, and HIV-related medical symptoms. Neuropsychological tests included measures of attention, verbal fluency, psychomotor skills, learning, memory, and executive skills. SEM was used to test models of the relationships among cognitive complaints, mood, and medical symptoms with neuropsychological functioning. The model indicated that although depressed mood (beta = 0.32, p &lt; .01) and medical symptoms (beta = 0.31, p &lt; .01) influenced cognitive complaints, cognitive complaints were independently associated with poorer neuropsychological performance (beta = 0.39, p &lt; .01). Mood and medical symptoms were significantly correlated but were not significantly associated with neuropsychological skills.","1559":"Patients with schizophrenia display numerous memory impairments. Examination of autobiographical memory distribution across the life span can constrain theories of how schizophrenia affects memory. Previously, schizophrenic patients were shown to produce fewer memories from early adulthood than from childhood or the recent past (A. Feinstein, T. E. Goldberg, B. Nowlin, &amp; D. R. Weinberger, 1998), this temporal paucity corresponding with illness onset. The current study examined this issue further using a different (noncued) method. Age-matched schizophrenic patients (n = 21) and controls (n = 21) were to freely generate 50 episodes, after which they dated these memories. Patients generated fewer memories than did controls, especially from the recent decade. When the overall lower production of memories was controlled for, the groups displayed equivalent recency effects. It was concluded that patients' paucity of memories generated from the recent decade reflects encoding or acquisition problems, which may be associated with the illness period.","1560":"The hypothesis that control of idiosyncratic attention deployment and retrieval strategies would improve the reliability and magnitude of laterality effects obtained in an auditory word recognition task was investigated. Sixty participants completed a dichotic word recognition task under 1 of 3 conditions. In free recall, they reported the 2 words presented on each trial (1 to each ear). In focused attention, they reported only the word presented to a prespecified ear. In target detection, they indicated whether a target word was presented to either ear on each trial. Results showed that the target-detection condition produced the largest and most reliable laterality effects compared with the other 2 conditions. The mechanisms likely to be responsible for these findings are discussed.","1561":"Item response theory methods were used to derive psychometrically sophisticated measures of global cognition, memory, and executive function. Goals were that these measures (a) could be derived from commonly used neuropsychological tests, (b) would have linear measurement properties, and (c) would be psychometrically matched. Scale development was based on a sample of 400 older individuals with cognitive function ranging from normal to demented. Scales were reasonably matched with linear measurement over an ability range relevant to many important clinical applications. Cognitively normal, mild impairment, and dementia participant groups differed on baseline measures and rate of decline. Association of measures with quantitative structural magnetic resonance imaging variables followed expected patterns. This approach to scale development may have applications for other neuropsychological assessment problems.","1562":"This study examined motor control in 61 early and continuously treated patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and 69 control participants, aged 7 to 14 years. The pursuit task demanded concurrent planning and execution of unpredictable movements, whereas the tracking task required a highly automated circular movement that could be planned in advance. PKU patients showed significantly poorer motor control in both tasks compared with control participants. Deficits were particularly observed for younger patients (age &lt; 11 years). Differences between control participants and PKU patients were significantly greater in the pursuit task compared with the tracking task, indicating more serious deficits when a higher level of controlled processing is required. Correlations with historical phenylalanine levels indicated a later maturation of the level of control required by the pursuit task compared with the tracking task.","1563":"Lexical access and phonological decoding were tested in 100 normal adult readers and 21 adult dyslexic individuals. Within the dyslexic sample, 11 dysphonetic dyslexic and 10 dyseidetic dyslexic participants were classified on the basis of spelling patterns. In the 1st experiment, adult dyseidetic readers showed a marked deficit on the lexical-access decision task in comparison with adult dysphonetic readers. In the 2nd experiment, the phonological-decoding decision task did not separate the subtypes. A lexical-access deficit in adult dyseidetic dyslexia cannot be explained in terms of a developmental delay. A phonological-decoding deficit in adult dyseidetic dyslexia may be explained by increased involvement of the lexical procedure in phonological assembly under an analogy strategy.","1564":"Free recall and recollective experience were investigated in relation to low and high cognitive support at encoding and to neuropsychological measures of frontal lobe function (FLF) in 105 healthy adults divided into 3 age groups (young, young-old, old). Statistically significant main effects suggested free recall was inferior with increasing age and lower FLF. For recollective experience however, a significant interaction between age and FLF was modified by the provision of cognitive support at encoding. Recognition measures classified as familiar did not vary according to age, neuropsychological function, or encoding condition. The results suggest that the neural systems of the prefrontal cortex underlie age differences in recollective experience and that cognitive support modifies the influence of those systems in old age.","1565":"Neuropsychological, qualitative, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging findings were examined in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD dementia or mixed neuropsychiatric disorder, subjects characterized as mild\/ambiguous, and controls, all with known apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Neuropsychological tasks included an expanded Consortium to Establish a Registery for Alzheimer's Disease (J. T. Tschanz et al., 2000; K. A. Welsh, J. M. Hoffman, N. L. Earl, &amp; M. W. Hanson 1994) battery and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (M. F. Folstein, S. E. Folstein, &amp; P. R. McHugh, 1975). Periventricular white matter lesions were the most clinically salient, and generalized measures of cerebral atrophy were the most significant quantitative indicators. APOE genotype was unrelated to imaging or neuropsychological performance. Neuropsychological relationships with neuroimaging findings depend on the qualitative or quantitative method used.","1566":"It seems clear that, for whatever reasons, the dementia of the Alzheimer type patient group (as well as other patient groups) exhibits behavior that is different from the normal control group. G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) rightfully argue that the observed behavior (similarity judgments) does not tell us the source (cause) of the differences between the 2 groups. Rather, the focus of the study should be placed more on finding the ways the 2 groups are different. They also point out various methodological problems in some of the previous attempts to characterize the nature of the differences. Further methodological issues in G. Storms et al.'s study are examined.","1567":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. De Deyn (2003) offer a critique of multidimensional scaling studies purporting to reveal systematic semantic deficits in Alzheimer's disease and other syndromes which, in contrast to prior claims, demonstrates that patient performance is indiscriminable from random data. The argument is an indictment against the conclusions drawn by previous researchers; but a consideration of the materials used in these studies suggests that the problem may not lie in the method per se, but in poor stimulus design. In all of the similarity judgment tasks reviewed, stimulus items were differentiated solely on the basis of subtle conceptual distinctions of the sort known to be most vulnerable to semantic impairment. Thus, one would not expect systematic responding from semantically impaired patients to begin with. An alternative design is suggested.","1568":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstaeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) have provided an important critique of the use of multidimensional scaling (MDS) to evaluate semantic knowledge in Alzheimer's disease. If MDS is to be used with semantic proximity data (in spite of well-documented reasons for not doing so), at minimum, the issues raised in G. Storms et al. should be considered. A few criticisms of the target article are presented. Then, the manner in which key points from the article, along with a consideration of such factors affecting proximity elicitation as semantic domains, tasks, and the experimental context, could be applied to correct certain shortcomings in the literature are discussed.","1569":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) bring into focus at least 3 important issues. First, the performance of even simple tasks may be affected by several basic cognitive processes. Second, the statistical variance that these processes contribute to task performance may be different for a group of participants with neuropsychological deficits than for normal control particpants. Third, claims regarding the nature of semantic memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) reflect indeterminacy about the nature and assessment of semantic memory itself. Critically, their analysis suggests that the T. Shallice and E. K. Warrington (1979) criteria widely used to operationalize the semantic memory deficit in AD be carefully scrutinized and reevaluated.","1570":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) noted that the goodness-of-fit indices for scaling and clustering solutions of proximity data from populations with hypothesized semantic deficits tend to be reduced in comparison with control participants, and that this precludes an unambiguous interpretation of such data. However, this effect is not necessarily as inconsistent with the proposal of semantic degradation in these groups, or as consistent with explanations in terms of access or attentional problems, as is suggested by G. Storms et al. Also, although performance on word fluency tasks is certainly constrained by the ability to access stored information, there are ways in which this confounding influence may be controlled for in the study of semantic deficits.","1571":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) argued that multidimensional scaling studies are ill-suited for investigating semantic deficits in individuals diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) because such individuals show great inter- and intraindividual variability in their proximity judgments. Discussed in this commentary are (a) the possible role of attentional set in producing inconsistent performance across trials, (b) the implications of attentional factors on the structure versus process debate, and (c) the inevitable semantic degradation following severe progression of the disease. A framework is presented for considering nonlinear performance differences as a function of attentional demands of the task, vulnerability of the semantic representation, and progression of the disease.","1572":"G. Storms, T. Dirikx, J. Saerens, S. Verstraeten, and P. P. De Deyn (2003) criticized the use of scaling techniques, in proposing \"semantic storage deficits\" in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenic patients in some studies, arguing that most reported multidimensionalscaling (MDS) models for patients were not adequately fit and did not differ from models generated by random data. The studies cited by G. Storms et al. were reexamined and all available data relevant to their claim were compared. A more complete review revealed somewhat different conclusions; it showed that many of the MDS models seem to meet the criteria of adequate fit, and it does not seem to support the notion that patients' performance is close to random. Suggestions are made to improve the validity of scaling analysis in neuropsychological studies.","1573":"In the past decade, several studies have used scaling and clustering techniques to document semantic storage deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in schizophrenia. In this article the authors argued that many of the conclusions drawn from these studies are unjustified by the data. They reviewed the methodology used in these studies and presented data from simulation studies to further investigate the validity of their conclusions. The authors elaborate on the criteria needed to exclude alternative accounts of the data and present empirical data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and normal control participants to demonstrate that analyses of the patients' proximity data do not provide unambiguous evidence for a generalized semantic storage deficit.","1574":"Working memory (WM) deficits are common in HIV-seropositive (HIV+) individuals and can be amplified by manipulating a variety of task parameters, such as increasing memory load or information complexity. The authors investigated the role of timing in HIV-associated WM defects by varying the amount of time required to maintain information online while holding memory load and information complexity constant. The authors studied 50 HIV+ and 35 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) polydrug abusers abstinent at testing and well-matched on demographic variables. The HIV- group outperformed the HIV+ group across all stimulus-response time delays. HIV-associated WM defects are not critically dependent on the amount of time stimulus representations must be maintained and might be attributed to impaired encoding or retrieval of stimulus representations.","1575":"The authors investigated the role of the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia in the inhibition of ongoing responses. Seventeen patients with frontal lesions (FG), 20 patients with lesions outside the frontal cortex (NFG), 8 patients with lesions to the basal ganglia (BG), and 20 orthopedic controls (OG) performed the stop-signal task that allows the estimation of the time it takes to inhibit an ongoing reaction (stop signal reaction time [SSRT]). The FG and the BG showed significantly longer SSRTs than the OG. Within the FG, patients with right and bilateral lesions showed significantly longer SSRTs than patients with left lesions. Results provide evidence for a role of the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia in the inhibition of ongoing responses.","1576":"It is widely accepted that patients with frontal lesions have problems inhibiting automatic response tendencies. Whereas inhibition deficits of overlearned responses have been extensively investigated using interference tasks like the Stroop task (J. R. Stroop, 1935), it is controversial whether patients with frontal brain lesions also have problems inhibiting imitative responses. Using an interference paradigm, the present study investigated imitative response tendencies in patients with frontal lesions. In addition, it tested whether patients deficient in the inhibition of imitative responses correspondingly have problems inhibiting overlearned responses. It was found that the group with frontal lesions displayed significantly stronger imitative response tendencies than the group with nonfrontal lesions. Furthermore, it was shown that the inhibition of imitative responses is functionally unrelated to Stroop interference.","1577":"The author conducted 2 meta-analyses on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The 1st compared participants with frontal lobe damage to those with posterior brain damage, whereas the 2nd compared participants with left and right frontal damage. Effect sizes based on the difference between groups were calculated for WCST variables and a composite measure. Effect sizes for these variables, except nonperseverative errors, indicated significantly poorer performance for participants with frontal damage. There were no significant differences for the left versus right comparisons. Moderator analyses using the composite measure for the frontal versus nonfrontal analyses indicated that the largest effect size was for dorsolateral damage. Though this study indicates that the WCST is sensitive to frontal lobe damage, caveats are discussed.","1578":"Young people with Tourette's syndrome (TS) alone, TS plus attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (+ADHD), or TS plus obsessive-compulsive disorder (+OCD) were compared with a healthy control group on a set of measures of executive functioning, memory, and learning. The TS-alone group was impaired on one executive measure involving inhibition and strategy generation but did not differ significantly from the healthy control group on other measures. The TS+ADHD group showed impairment on several executive measures. There was no evidence of impairment in implicit aspects of memory and learning for any of the TS groups. The findings are discussed in terms of the frontostriatal hypothesis of TS and the contribution of comorbid symptomatology.","1579":"This study examined the performance of 60 heterosexual men, 60 gay men, 60 heterosexual women, and 60 lesbians on 3 tests of verbal fluency known to show gender differences: letter, category, and synonym fluency. Gay men and lesbians showed opposite-sex shifts in their profile of scores. For letter fluency, gay men outperformed all other groups; lesbians showed the lowest scores. For category fluency, gay men and heterosexual women jointly outperformed lesbians and heterosexual men. Finally, gay men outperformed all other groups on synonym fluency, whereas lesbians and heterosexual men performed similarly. A difference between heterosexual men and women was demonstrated on category and synonym fluency only. The findings implicate within-sex differences in the functioning of the prefrontal and temporal cortices.","1580":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) impair working memory (WM). It is unclear, however, whether the deficits seen early in the course of these diseases are similar. To address this issue, the authors compared the performance of 22 patients with mild AD, 20 patients with early PD and without dementia, and 112 control participants on tests of inhibition, short-term memory, and 2 commonly administered tests of WM. The results suggest that although mild AD and early PD both impair WM, the deficits may be related to the interruption of different processes that contribute to WM performance. Early PD disrupted inhibitory processes, whereas mild AD did not. The WM deficits seen in patients with AD may be secondary to deficits in other cognitive capacities, including semantic memory.","1581":"Two experiments examining effects of eye movements on episodic memory retrieval are reported. Thirty seconds of horizontal saccadic eye movements (but not smooth pursuit or vertical eye movements) preceding testing resulted in selective enhancement of episodic memory retrieval for laboratory (Experiment 1) and everyday (Experiment 2) events. Eye movements had no effects on implicit memory. Eye movements were also associated with more conservative response biases relative to a no eye movement condition. Episodic memory improvement induced by bilateral eye movements is hypothesized to reflect enhanced interhemispheric interaction, which is associated with superior episodic memory (S. D. Christman &amp; R. E. Propper, 2001). Implications for neuropsychological mechanisms underlying eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (F. Shapiro, 1989, 2001), a therapeutic technique for posttraumatic stress disorder, are discussed.","1582":"The authors measured simple reaction time (RT) to visual stimuli, presented either singly to 1 or the other visual field or in bilaterally presented pairs, to 2 women with callosal agenesis. The stimuli were either white against a black background or gray against an equiluminant yellow background. RTs to bilateral pairs were decreased beyond predictions based on a simple race between independent unilateral processes, implying interhemispheric neural summation. This effect was enhanced under equiluminance in the participant M.M. whose anterior commissure was within normal limits, but not in the participant J.P. whose anterior commissure was enlarged. The anterior commissure may act, relative to its size, to inhibit cortical activation to bilateral pairs, which then acts to decrease subcortical neural summation.","1583":"This study examined the acquisition and transfer of a fine motor skill, namely the rotary pursuit, in 99 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 100 normal controls (NCs). To identify optimal learning strategies, the authors had participants practice the rotary pursuit under constant, blocked, random, or no training conditions. Transfer was assessed using speeds that were different from those practiced during acquisition. AD patients and NCs receiving constant practice outperformed their peers in the blocked and random conditions during acquisition. Whereas all 3 types of practice facilitated transfer in the NCs, AD patients only benefited from constant practice. The inability of the AD patients to benefit from variable practice suggests that these individuals may have difficulty accessing and\/or forming motor schemas.","1584":"Event-related potentials elicited by semantically associated and unassociated word pairs embedded in congruous and semantically anomalous spoken sentences were recorded from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy older and young controls as a means of examining the nature, time course, and relation between word and sentence context effects. All groups demonstrated lexical priming in nonsensical sentences, but it was earlier in the young (200-600 ms) than in the older controls (600-800 ms), and even later in the probable AD patients (800-1,000 ms). Moreover, processing in both the elderly and AD groups benefited disproportionately from a meaningful sentence context. The results do not accord well with either a strictly structural or a strictly functional account of the semantic impairments in AD.","1585":"Evidence from developmental, lesion, and neuroimaging studies indicates that the prefrontal cortex plays a major role in executive abilities, including inhibitory control. Proficient executive performance, however, relies not only on the integrity of the prefrontal cortex but also on its interactions with other brain regions. In the current study, the authors focused on the effect that early damage to the white matter tracts interconnecting prefrontal and other brain regions has on inhibitory control. Data were collected from 13 children with bilateral spastic cerebral palsy and from a control group of 20 children with no history of neurologic compromise. Converging evidence from 3 separate paradigms is presented that strongly suggests these children experience impairments in inhibitory control. Findings are discussed within the context of current cognitive and neuroanatomical models of inhibition.","1586":"Repetition priming in a word-stem completion task was examined in a group of control subjects and in a group of experimental subjects under conditions of acute tryptophan depletion (T-) and tryptophan augmentation (T+). Experimental subjects ingested amino acid compounds that depleted or loaded the body with tryptophan, and word-stem completion priming performance was measured. Results indicate differential effects of T- and T+ manipulations on word-stem completion priming. In the control group, both specific-visual and amodal priming were observed. Conversely, in the T+ condition, specific-visual priming, but no amodal priming, was observed, whereas in the T- condition, amodal priming, but no specific-visual priming, was observed. The authors conclude that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) plays a critical role in repetition priming by helping to modulate which neural systems contribute to priming effects.","1587":"Normal adults tend to bisect horizontal lines to the left of the objective middle, especially when using the left hand. This bias has been attributed to the dominance of the right hemisphere in spatial attention. The authors investigated the effect of hand use and line position in visual line bisection in right-handed children and adults, classified into 4 different age groups: 10-12, 13-15, 18-21, and 24-53 years (N = 98). All 4 groups showed the characteristic leftward bias when using the left hand. When using the right hand, the youngest group showed a rightward bias, whereas the other 3 groups all showed a leftward bias. This suggests a shift from contralateral to right-hemispheric control during puberty and may reflect maturation of the corpus callosum.","1588":"This study explored recognition memory performance for novel versus familiar words in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and normal controls (NCs), using an adaptation of E. Tulving and N. Kroll's (1995) procedure. Results showed that both groups exhibited more hits and more false alarms for familiar than for novel words. The groups did not differ in the recognition of familiar words, reflecting preserved familiarity processes in AD. However, AD patients made more false alarms than NCs in the recognition of novel words, reflecting impairment of recollection processes in AD. A positron emission tomography analysis of clinico-metabolic correlations in AD patients showed a correlation between recognition of novel words and right hippocampal activity, whereas recognition of familiar words was more related to metabolic activity in the left posterior orbitofrontal cortex.","1589":"Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with a general impairment of procedures and with an impairment of syntactic procedures in particular. The present study investigated comprehension processes in PD using event-related brain potentials (ERPs). PD patients and controls listened to sentences that were either correct or syntactically or semantically incorrect. The language-related ERP component correlated with semantic processes (N400) was present in both groups. In the syntactic domain, early automatic processes (early negativity) appeared normal in PD, whereas late integrational processes (P600) were modulated by this disease. The present findings suggest that the basal ganglia primarily do not support early automatic syntactic processes during comprehension but rather support processes of syntactic integration.","1590":"The effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia on short-term, delayed, and working memory were examined in healthy adults. A hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp was used to maintain arterialized blood glucose at either 4.5 (euglycemia) or 2.5 (hypoglycemia) mmol\/L on 2 separate occasions in 16 healthy volunteers. Tests of immediate and delayed verbal memory, immediate and delayed visual memory, and working memory were administered during each experimental condition. All memory systems were impaired during acute hypoglycemia, with working memory and delayed memory being particularly susceptible. These findings are informative concerning the metabolic basis of adequate memory function and are of practical importance to people with insulin-treated diabetes, in whom hypoglycemia is common.","1591":"Sixteen patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 15 older controls (OCs), and 109 younger controls (YCs) were compared in 2 category-learning tasks. Participants attempted to assign colored geometric figures to 1 of 2 categories. In rule-based tasks, category membership was defined by an explicit rule that was easy to verbalize, whereas in information-integration tasks, there was no salient verbal rule and accuracy was maximized only if information from 3 stimulus components was integrated at some predecisional stage. The YCs performed the best on both tasks. The PD patients were highly impaired compared with the OCs, in the rule-based categorization task but were not different from the OCs in the information-integration task. These results support the hypothesis that learning in these 2 tasks is mediated by functionally separate systems.","1592":"This study examined the status of recollection in amnesia when recollection is supported by perceptual rather than conceptual processes. Two experiments investigated the size congruency effect-the advantage in recognition of patterns presented in the same size, rather than in different sizes-at study and test. In Experiment 1, the authors used a remember-know paradigm in nonamnesic individuals and demonstrated that the size congruency effect was due to enhanced recollection. In Experiment 2, the authors examined whether amnesic patients would show a size congruency effect when their overall level of performance was matched to that of controls. Amnesic patients failed to show a size congruency effect. These findings provide evidence for a disproportionate disruption in recollection compared with familiarity in amnesia, even when recollection is supported by perceptual processes.","1593":"The authors investigated the impact of semantic knowledge on visual object analysis by assessing the performance of patients with semantic dementia on a different-views object matching test and on 2 object decision tests differing, for example, in whether the nonreal items were nonsense objects or chimeras of 2 real objects. On average, the patients scored normally on both the object matching and the object decision test including nonsense objects but were impaired on the object decision test including chimeras; this latter was also the only visual object test that correlated significantly with degree of semantic impairment. These findings demonstrate that object decision is not a single task or ability and that it is not necessarily independent of conceptual knowledge.","1594":"Simultaneous measurement of blood flow velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral arteries was achieved by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in 36 right-handed volunteers who were instructed to identify the emotion conveyed by prosody or semantics of a number of sentences. The tasks were performed under 2 levels of interference: neutral versus discordant affective value of the modality that had to be ignored. A multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant bilateral increase in BFV during the discordant conditions reflecting increased attentional demand. A significant left-hemispheric lateralization of BFV was observed as emotional semantics were labeled. When attention was shifted to affective prosody, the lateralization effect disappeared as a result of a marked increase in right-hemispheric BFV.","1595":"This study examined the nature of errors in prose recall made in dementia compared with normal aging. Responses by 48 young adults, 47 nondemented older adults, and 70 people with very mild or mild Alzheimer's disease to the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale were examined in a propositional analysis. Compared with young adults, healthy older adults showed good immediate recall but deficits in retention over a delay. Demented individuals made errors of omission, not commission, at immediate recall. These errors probably reflect difficulty with attentional control rather than memory per se. In terms of clinical implications, veridical scoring of the Logical Memory subtest provides more sensitive detection of very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type than the current standard criteria for scoring.","1596":"The effect of manipulation and distracting noise on immediate serial recall was measured in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), neurologically healthy elderly individuals, and young adults. In Experiment 1, the authors compared serial word recall with word recall in alphabetical order. Alphabetical recall requires the active manipulation of the contents of working memory. Findings indicated that DAT patients were severely impaired in the alphabetical recall task, whereas the performance of neurologically healthy elderly participants was comparable with the performance of young adult participants. In Experiment 2, the authors investigated the effect of different irrelevant auditory backgrounds on immediate digit recall. In this task, both elderly participants and DAT patients performed similarly to the group of young adult participants, indicating comparable efficacy to resist auditory distraction.","1597":"This study investigated the effects of seizure laterality and language dominance on material-specific memory in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Left TLE (LTLE) patients with left-hemisphere language dominance (LHLD) showed significantly higher nonverbal than verbal memory capacity, whereas right TLE patients with LHLD showed significantly better verbal than nonverbal memory capacity. LTLE patients with non-left-hemisphere language dominance (NLHLD) showed significantly better verbal memory capacity compared with LTLE patients with LHLD. Thus, selective verbal or nonverbal memory deficits that are dependent on side of seizure onset were apparent in patients with LHLD but not in patients with NLHLD. Relative sparing of verbal memory capacity in LTLE patients with NLHLD may reflect interhemispheric reorganization of verbal memory function.","1598":"Social and emotional competence were evaluated using self-report and behavioral measures in adults with attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and controls. Adults with ADHD viewed themselves as less socially competent but more sensitive toward violations of social norms than controls. Films depicting emotional interactions were used to assess linguistic properties of free recall and perceived emotional intensity. Although adults with ADHD used more words to describe the scenes, they used fewer emotion-related words, despite rating the emotions depicted as more intense than did controls. In contrast, no group differences for words depicting social or cognitive processes were observed. Overall, adults with ADHD appear more aware of their problems in social versus emotional skills. Findings may have implications for improving the psychosocial functioning of these adults.","1599":"Face recognition is thought to rely on configural visual processing. Where face recognition impairments have been identified, qualitatively delayed or anomalous configural processing has also been found. A group of women with Turner syndrome (TS) with monosomy for a single maternal X chromosome (45, Xm) showed an impairment in face recognition skills compared with normally developing women. However, normal configural face-processing abilities were apparent. The ability to recognize facial expressions of emotion, particularly fear, was also impaired in this TS subgroup. Face recognition and fear recognition accuracy were significantly correlated in the female control group but not in women with TS. The authors therefore suggest that anomalies in amygdala function may be a neurological feature of TS of this karyotype.","1600":"Intellectually challenged adults, with and without Down's syndrome (DS), pointed to drawings of animals following the dichotic presentation of animal names. Although there were no reliable ear differences between the 2 groups, there was tremendous between-persons variability within the group of participants with DS. Moreover, left-ear advantages in persons with DS were associated with more speech production errors when participants either read or repeated a string of 1 syllable words. This was not true for control participants. The relationship between ear advantage and speech errors in persons with DS could reflect their unique pattern of cerebral specialization and brain development.","1601":"This study examined the performance of heterosexual and homosexual men and women on 2 tests of spatial processing, mental rotation (MR) and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO). The sample comprised 60 heterosexual men, 60 heterosexual women, 60 homosexual men, and 60 homosexual women. There were significant main effects of gender (men achieving higher scores overall) and Gender x Sexual Orientation interactions. Decomposing these interactions revealed large differences between the male groups in favor of heterosexual men on JLO and MR performance. There was a modest difference between the female groups on MR total correct scores in favor of homosexual women but no differences in MR percentage correct. The evidence suggests possible variations in the parietal cortex between homosexual and heterosexual persons.","1602":"Whether the format of a recognition memory task influences the contribution of recollection and familiarity to performance is a matter of debate. The authors investigated this issue by comparing the performance of 64 young (mean age = 21.7 years; mean education = 14.5 years) and 62 older participants (mean age = 64.4 years; mean education = 14.2 years) on a yes-no and a forced-choice recognition task for unfamiliar faces using the remember-know-guess procedure. Familiarity contributed more to forced-choice than to yes-no performance. Moreover, older participants, who showed a decrease in recollection together with an increase in familiarity, performed better on the forced-choice task than on the yes-no task, whereas younger participants showed the opposite pattern.","1603":"The cognitive and language performance of a group of 26 preterm-birth preschool and early school-age children with slight to moderate risk for perinatal hypoxia was compared with the performance of a preterm-birth comparison group of 26 children. Despite the relatively small discrepancy in degree of risk, the cognitive performance of the 2 groups diverged significantly. When data for children with known perinatal arterial pH were combined, a curvilinear (quadratic) regression model provided the best fit. Increasing acidosis was linearly related to decreases in cognitive skills, with the bend in the curve occurring well within the normal range of pH values. Hence, in the preterm infant, even minor risk for birth hypoxia may result in discernible deviation from the expected developmental trajectory.","1604":"It has been suggested that in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), difficulties in the manipulation of information, which result in problems in executive tasks, are related to a reduction of working memory capacity (J. D. E. Gabrieli, J. Singh, G. T. Stebbins, &amp; C. G. Goetz, 1996). The present study selectively varied the manipulation demand irrespective of the maintenance requirement. In a group of 14 PD patients, performance declined overproportionally with the increasing task demand and was significantly correlated with a measure of working memory capacity. These results suggest that the complexity of working memory processing may decisively contribute to the exhaustion of resources in PD patients. Increasing complexity may either affect their manipulation ability directly or impede the management of inhibitory control requirements inherent to the task.","1605":"Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals completed 12 semantic, 10 letter, and 2 proper name fluency categories. Bilinguals produced fewer exemplars than monolinguals on all category types, but the difference between groups was larger (and more consistent) on semantic categories. Bilinguals and monolinguals produced the same number of errors across all category types. The authors discuss 2 accounts of the similarities and differences between groups and the interaction with category type, including (a) cross-language interference and (b) relatively weak connections in the bilingual lexical system because of reduced use of words specific to each language. Surprisingly, bilinguals' fluency scores did not improve when they used words in both languages. This result suggests that voluntary language switching incurs a processing cost.","1606":"Electrophysiological and hemodynamic studies have suggested that structures in the vicinity of the anterior cingulate cortex are involved in performance monitoring, particularly in detection of errors. Bidirectional interactions between the frontomedian system involved in performance monitoring and the lateral prefrontal cortex as well as the orbitofrontal cortex have been proposed, but few studies have directly addressed this issue. The authors used a speeded flankers task to investigate error-related event-related potentials in 3 patient groups with different focal cortical lesions. Whereas bilateral frontopolar lesions involving the orbitofrontal cortex as well as temporal lesions did not alter the error-related negativity (ERN), lesions of the lateral frontal cortex resulted in an abolition of the ERN and in a reduction of the error positivity.","1607":"Preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions based on errorless learning principles in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided by Clare et al. (1999, 2000, 2001). The present study extends these findings in a controlled trial. Twelve participants meeting criteria for probable AD, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores of 18 or above, were trained in face-name associations using an errorless learning paradigm. Training produced a significant group improvement in recall of trained, but not control, items. Gains were largely maintained 6 months later, in the absence of practice. There were differences in individual response to intervention. Results did not differ according to medication status, and the intervention had no adverse effects on self-reported well-being, but participants who were more aware of their memory difficulties achieved better outcomes.","1608":"The authors report the case of a woman with a right basal ganglia lesion and severe mental-rotation impairments. She had no difficulty recognizing rotated objects and had intact left-right orientation in egocentric space but was unable to map the left and right sides of external objects to her egocentric reference frame. This study indicates that the right basal ganglia may be critical components in a cortico-subcortical network involved in mental rotation. We speculate that the role of these structures is to select and maintain an appropriate motor program for performing smooth and accurate rotation. The results also have important implications for theories of object recognition by demonstrating that recognition of rotated objects can be achieved without mental rotation.","1609":"Longitudinal neuropsychological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) were investigated in 53 children with severe TBI, 56 children with moderate TBI, and 80 children with orthopedic injuries only. Neuropsychological functioning was assessed at baseline, at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, and at an extended follow-up (a mean of 4 years postinjury). Mixed model analyses revealed persistent neuropsychological sequelae of TBI that generally did not vary as a function of time postinjury. Some recovery occurred during the first year postinjury, but recovery reached a plateau after that time, and deficits were still apparent at the extended follow-up. Further recovery was uncommon after the first year postinjury. Family factors did not moderate neuropsychological outcomes, despite their demonstrated influence on behavior and academic achievement after childhood TBI.","1610":"Patients with focal frontal or nonfrontal lesions were compared with control participants on 4 reaction time (RT) tasks varying in levels of complexity based on a feature-integration model of detection. Superior medial lesions affected simple RT speed. Increasing the demands of feature detection did not differentially affect speed of correct responses among the groups. Frontal structures appear to play little role in correct integration of features during detection. The analysis of error types within the complex task revealed a frontal lobe hemispheric distinction between sensitivity and bias: right dorsolateral-decreased sensitivity; left dorsolateral-altered response bias. The frontal lobes, particularly right dorsolateral, were required to inhibit an incorrect response. There are at least 3 functionally and anatomically separable anterior attentional processes.","1611":"Thirty boys and 30 girls who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) were evaluated within 1 year post injury with the California Verbal Learning Test-children's Version (CVLT-C; D. C. Delis, J. H. Kramer, E. Kaplan, &amp; B. A. Ober, 1994). Boys had statistically significantly lower performance on the CVLT-C than girls in the absence of statistically significant group differences on various demographic and neurological variables. Although the effect size for this difference was modest (eta2 = .09), gender accounted for a statistically significant amount of the variance (5%) in CVLT-C scores in addition to effects of injury severity and age. It is concluded that male gender is associated with an increased risk for retrieval deficits after pediatric TBI, possibly because of reduced speed or efficiency of information processing.","1612":"Memory performance was examined in patients with schizophrenia to determine whether subgroups conforming to cortical and subcortical dementias could be identified and, if so, whether subgroups differed on clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological measures. A cluster analysis of California Verbal Learning Test performance classified patients into 3 subgroups. Two groups exhibited memory deficits consistent with the cortical-subcortical distinction, whereas 1 group was unimpaired. Cortical patients tended to be male, and they had earlier illness onset, reduced temporal lobe gray matter, and hypometabolism. Subcortical patients had ventricular enlargement and more negative symptoms. Unimpaired patients had fewer negative symptoms and dorsal medial prefrontal hypermetabolism. The authors conclude that categorizing patients on the basis of memory deficits may yield neurobiologically meaningful disease subtypes.","1613":"Memory for famous individuals was assessed by the use of a recognition test in which participants first made familiarity judgments, followed by forced-choice decisions to specific probes for identity. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or excisions, 12 left hemisphere and 12 right hemisphere, and 18 control participants identified famous figures across 3 decades (1970s-1990s). Only patients with right TLE were impaired at familiarity judgments of faces; this deficit was evident only for the most recent decades. Both groups of patients, however, were impaired at naming famous faces and at providing semantic information about famous people. These findings suggest the integrity of temporal structures in both hemispheres is critical for retrieval of detailed semantic information about famous individuals.","1614":"Two individuals with callosal agenesis (J.P. and M.M.) and 10 neurologically normal participants were tested on tasks requiring interhemispheric visual integration. M.M., whose anterior commissure was within normal limits, was much worse at matching colors and letters between visual fields than within visual fields, whereas J.P., whose anterior commissure was greatly enlarged, showed no evidence of interhemispheric disconnection. This suggests that in some cases of callosal agenesis, probably a minority, an enlarged anterior commissure may compensate for the lack of the corpus callosum. Neither acallosal participant showed interhemispheric disconnection on tasks requiring integration of location and orientation, however, suggesting that the anterior commissure plays no role in such tasks. These tasks may depend on subcortical commissures, such as the intertectal commissure.","1615":"The purpose of this study was to examine adult correlates of rule-derived arithmetic deficiency. The authors collected neuropsychological, handedness, gender, and psychosocial data of adults with stringently defined arithmetic deficiency (AD; N = 45), reading deficiency (N = 45), and dual deficiency (N = 45). The authors did not match groups on IQ score and did not restrict analyses to right-handed men. The results indicated that AD in adults is associated with nonverbal reasoning and constructional problems. Otherwise, there was no association between AD and dysphoric complaints as defined by Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory elevations. The authors also found overall intelligence was lower in adults with AD, and gender distribution differed markedly from the reading and dual deficient groups. Potential gender bias in remediation referral patterns was identified.","1616":"Numerous studies purport to show that cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery is associated with persistent postoperative cognitive decline. In J. R. Keith et al. (2002), the authors argued that reports of post-CPB cognitive declines have often been quantified using data analysis methods that were based on tenuous assumptions and overlooked problems associated with familywise Type I errors. Four peers who are recognized for their expertise in neuropsychological outcomes research evaluated the arguments developed in the J. R. Keith et al. article, critiqued the study presented in that article, and offered suggestions for how to investigate whether cognitive decline occurs reliably after CPB. In this reply article, the authors respond to the open-peer commentaries made regarding the J. R. Keith et al. study.","1617":"The article by J. R. Keith et al. (2002) raises several issues that are frequently pertinent when neuropsychological tools are used as outcomes measures. These issues include whether the main interest is the mean change on a neuropsychological measure, the number of people who show a significant change on that measure, or both. Also at issue is whether the outcome of interest is either cognitive change or cognitive impairment. A corollary is determining when the failure to produce a practice effect is of clinical significance. Finally, it may be time to move beyond asking whether coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) influences neuropsychological outcome. Rather, the pertinent question may now be, under what conditions and for which people does CABG have the least neuropsychological impact?","1618":"There have been significant advances in the study of cognitive change in recent years, evolving from traditional group-level parametric methods to new techniques such as the reliable change index (RCI) and the standardized regression-based (SRB) change score. In the very interesting study of cognitive change following cardiopulmonary bypass, Keith et al. (2002) opted for a more traditional group-level analysis of change (the mixed factor analysis of variance). They cited several limitations of the individual-level analytic techniques such as the RCI. In this commentary, the author attempts to address these specific concerns as well as some of the more general difficulties presented by the analysis of cognitive change. Advantages and disadvantages of the RCI and SRB methods are discussed.","1619":"A study by J. R. Keith et al. (2002) purported to find postoperative changes in attention in a sample of patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Detecting differential patterns of neuropsychological change following treatment presents formidable methodological and statistical challenges. This commentary examines the findings of J. R. Keith et al. with regard to (a) the feasibility of randomizing research participants into treatment and control groups, (b) the handling of missing data, (c) the selection of statistical techniques to measure change, and (d) the measurement of differential neuropsychological deficit. Alternative strategies are discussed.","1620":"J. R. Keith et al. (2002) examined the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery on cognition and suggest that the use of parametric, inferential statistics may have advantages over incidence reports. This commentary addresses several issues that arise when conducting outcomes studies within the context of evidence-based medicine. \"Consumer friendly\" research within the context of evidence-based medicine must carefully attend to the selection of appropriate and relevant reference groups and recognize that clinicians practice and record outcomes as individual rather than as group events. Traditional null hypothesis significance testing and inferential statistics are useful in establishing the reliability of group differences but do not provide the statistical indexes and base-rate information that clinicians can easily use in their treatment of individual patients. Data analysis and presentation of results using methods from clinical epidemiology can make neuropsychological outcomes research consumer friendly and help bridge the all too frequent schism between academic research and clinical practice.","1621":"Cognitive decline after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery has been a concern since the advent of CPB procedures. A primary focus of many studies on this topic has been to quantify the incidence of post-CPB cognitive impairment. However, studies that have used traditional parametric statistics have generally failed to confirm that long-lasting (&gt; or = 1 month) cognitive declines occur reliably after CPB surgery. For the present study, the authors used a split-plot analysis of variance model that revealed preoperative memory impairments in the CPB patients and new postoperative impairments of attention. The authors discuss the assumptions of, and problems associated with, analysis methods that are often used to quantify the incidence of cognitive impairment following CPB surgery.","1622":"The authors examined the contribution of working memory performance to subjective cognitive complaints in HIV infection beyond the influence of depressive symptoms. Thirty-six adults with HIV infection were administered neuropsychological (NP) tests of working memory, complex psychomotor efficiency, verbal learning, delayed recall, and questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms and cognitive complaints. Working memory performance, depression scores, and complex psychomotor efficiency were most strongly associated with self-reported cognitive complaints, whereas verbal learning scores and simple psychomotor efficiency showed more modest associations. Regression analyses revealed working memory performance to be the strongest NP predictor of self-reported cognitive complaints, comparable with depression scores in the amount of variance explained. These results suggest that working memory performance may be well suited to reflect how patients function in their everyday environment.","1623":"Previous studies have shown that far space can be remapped as near when reached by a stick that artificially prolongs the participants' personal space. In the present study, the authors asked whether a similar remapping occurs when far space is reached not by using a tool but by locomotion. Neglect patients showed more severe neglect in far than in near space in bisection tasks executed from different distances either by pointing to a target line with a projection light pen or by walking across the line. A kinematic study of the walking performance of one of those neglect patients showed that, contrary to the prediction of remapping during locomotion, the walking trajectories were rectilinear. The authors interpreted these results as evidence that in their patients-at least for short, linear trajectories-no remapping of space took place during locomotion. The location of far objects was coded at the beginning of the movement, and the error in the bisection computation was generated within the 1st representation that was activated.","1624":"Seven patients with semantic dementia were asked to recall and recognize 10-word lists of object-name vocabulary preselected as either still \"known\" (correct picture naming and word-picture matching) or now \"unknown\" (incorrect picture naming and word-picture matching) to each individual patient. The patients showed a significant advantage for known words in immediate free recall after several learning trials and also in delayed recall and recognition. The majority of errors of commission for known words were semantic, whereas phonological errors, especially blends of target words, were produced in the unknown condition. These findings support claims that (a) multiple inputs from semantic and perceptual systems support episodic memory and (b) success in verbal and nonverbal episodic memory tasks is differentially dependent on semantic and perceptual information.","1625":"n-back letter and fractal tasks were administered to 11 participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging to test process specificity theories of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function and assess task validity. Tasks were matched on accuracy, but fractal n-back responses were slower and more conservative. Maintenance (1-back minus 0-back) activated inferior parietal and dorsolateral PFC, with additional activation in right ventrolateral PFC during letter n-back and left lingual gyrus during fractal n-back. Maintenance plus manipulation (2-back minus 0-back) activated inferior parietal, Broca's area, insula, and dorsolateral and ventral PFC, with greater right dorsolateral PFC activation for letter n-back. Manipulation only (2-back minus 1-back) produced additional and equivalent dorsolateral PFC and anterior cingulate activation in both tasks. Results support fractal n-back validity and indicate substantial overlap in working memory functions of dorsal and ventral PFC.","1626":"Awareness of deficit was examined in 24 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their spouses (for a total of 48 participants) using performance prediction-postdiction and questionnaire discrepancy (QD) paradigms. Participants estimated their own memory performances as well the performances of spouses and of a fictional, memory-disordered patient observed on videotape. Patients overpredicted self-performances, but the extent of overestimation decreased for postdictions. Patients and caregivers accurately estimated caregiver performances but overestimated performances of the fictional patient. QD data revealed that patients underestimated their difficulties performing daily functioning tasks as compared with caregiver reports. Awareness of deficit is a complex ability, involving dissociable cognitive processes. AD patients may display intact immediate awareness of memory dysfunction but fail to incorporate incidents of memory failure into generalized self-belief systems.","1627":"Twenty-two patients with early dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and 31 controls were administered tests of person-specific semantics (Experiment 1). DAT patients were impaired on all test components. In Experiment 2, 31 DAT patients, 28 questionable DAT (QDAT) patients, and 42 controls were administered the Graded Naming Test (GNT) and the newly designed Graded Faces Test (GFT), matched for difficulty with the GNT. DAT patients were impaired throughout but showed an advantage for naming objects over faces. The QDAT patients were impaired on the GFT only. Of the 7 QDAT patients who evolved to DAT within 1-2 years, 6 showed initial impairment on the GFT, whereas 17 of the nonconverters scored normally on the GFT. Results suggest greater and earlier vulnerability of person knowledge than general semantic knowledge in DAT.","1628":"The Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT; C. Golden, 1978) was examined in 59 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in 51 demographically comparable normal control (NC) participants. AD patients produced significantly larger Stroop interference effects than NC participants, and level of dementia severity significantly influenced SCWT performance. Principal-components analyses demonstrated a dissociation in the factor structure of the Stroop trials between NC participants and AD patients, suggesting that disruption of semantic knowledge and speeded verbal processing in AD may be a major contributor to impairment on the incongruent trial. Results of clinicopathologic correlations in an autopsy-confirmed AD subgroup further suggest the invocation of a broad network of integrated cortical regions and executive and language processes underlying successful SCWT performance.","1629":"The concept identification and concept formation aspects of abstract reasoning were examined in 90 nonmentally retarded individuals with autism and 107 normal controls. It was hypothesized that pronounced deficits would be found on concept formation tests, whereas performance on concept identification tests would be relatively intact. There was a significant difference between individuals with autism and individuals from a matched control group on all abstract reasoning tasks, but, with the exception of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (R. K. Heaton et al., 1993), differences on concept identification tests were not clinically significant. Factor analyses showed that concept formation and concept identification tasks loaded on separate factors in the autism group but not in the control group. Stepwise discriminant function analyses revealed that 2 tests of concept formation correctly classified 78.4% of cases, whereas concept identification tasks did not pass the tolerance test.","1630":"The present study was designed to evaluate whether the complexity of Arabic orthography increases its perceptual load, thus slowing word identification. Adolescent Arabic speakers who mastered Hebrew as a second language completed oral and visual versions of the Trail Making Test (TMT; J. E. Parington &amp; R. G. Lieter, 1949) in both languages. Oral TMT required declaiming consecutive numbers or alternation between numbers and letters. Visual TMT required connecting Arabic or Indian numbers and alternation between letters and numbers. Performance in Hebrew and Arabic oral TMT did not differ. Performance was significantly slower in Arabic visual TMT. These results indicate that Arabic speakers process Arabic orthography (1st language) slower than Hebrew orthography (2nd language) and suggest that this is due to the complexity of Arabic orthography.","1631":"This study used a dual-task interference paradigm to test the hypothesis that different subcomponents of working memory differentially contribute to performance on letter fluency and category fluency tasks. College students (N = 96) performed each type of verbal fluency task in isolation and concurrently with I of 3 secondary tasks. The secondary tasks were chosen for their putative involvement in different working memory subcomponents. Two subsystems of working memory, the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad, were identified as important contributors to fluency performance, especially to performance on letter fluency and category fluency tasks, respectively. Moreover, the results also suggest that the executive function, mental set shifting, may be deployed to perform both letter fluency and category fluency tasks.","1632":"Comprehending language in context requires inferencing, particularly for the establishment of local coherence. In the neurolinguistic literature, an inference deficit after right hemisphere brain damage has been postulated, but clinical observation and imaging data suggest that left-frontal lesions might also result in inference deficits. In the present experiment, 25 nonaphasic patients performed a coherence judgment task requiring them to indicate a pragmatic connection between 2 successively presented sentences. Patients with left-temporal or right-frontal lesions performed the task well. In contrast, patients with left- and bifrontal lesions exhibited the most severe deficit. Both error rates and response times were elevated for coherent trials as compared with incoherent trials. These results confirm that the left-frontal lobe contributes to inference processes.","1633":"Twenty-five early-onset relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients (12 women and 13 men) with mild disability were compared with 25 matched controls in a dichotic listening (DL) test under nonforced and forced attentional-shift conditions. Patients showed left ear impairment and no left ear advantage in the forced-left condition. Four corpus callosum (CC) regions were measured in patients on a midsaggital magnetic resonance imaging scan. The right ear score was negatively correlated whereas the left ear score was positively correlated with CC regions (significant only for the nonforced condition). Moreover, in men, the correlations with DL scores were linked mainly to the splenium and posterior isthmus, and in women, they were stronger for anterior isthmus and posterior body. An inverse correlation between months of disease evolution and CC area was found only in women.","1634":"The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene is associated with alterations in brain function and is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in components of visuospatial attention with ApoE-epsilon4, aging, and AD are described. Healthy middle-aged adults without dementia who have the ApoE-epsilon4 gene show deficits in spatial attention and working memory that are qualitatively similar to those seen in clinically diagnosed AD patients. The findings support an association between ApoE polymorphism and specific components of visuospatial attention. Molecular mechanisms that may mediate the ApoE-attention link by modulating cholinergic neurotransmission to the posterior parietal cortex are discussed. Studies of attention and brain function in ApoE-epsilon4 carriers without dementia can advance knowledge of the genetics of visual attention, may enhance understanding of the preclinical phase of AD, and may lead to better methods for early AD detection.","1635":"This commentary discusses divergent findings in 2 articles published in this issue of Neuropsychology. The studies used negative priming (NP) to probe the associations between basal ganglia function and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and tested different predictions about NP in PD. Different NP tasks were used, and although the subject samples appeared to have similar clinical features, results were quite different. This commentary, written jointly by the authors of the 2 studies (J. V. Filoteo, L. M. Rilling, &amp; D. L. Strayer, 2002; S. A. Wylie &amp; J. C. Stout, 2002), describes a process by which their disparate results may be used to facilitate the design of new studies that may determine how specific features of NP tasks lead to different findings in PD. The results are a more systematic account of how task features, such as specific response demands, interact with the response selection processes that are implemented by the basal ganglia.","1636":"In the ignored repetition paradigm, negative priming (NP) is defined as the increase in response time that occurs when the current target stimulus served as a distractor stimulus in the previous trial. In this study, 25 Parkinson's disease (PD) participants and 17 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were tested using a touchscreen version of the ignored repetition task that allowed response time to be partitioned into response initiation and response execution segments. In both groups, NP effects were stronger in the response execution than in the response initiation segments. The most striking result was that the PD group showed larger NP effects overall than the HC group. In PD, clinical ratings of bradykinesia, but not tremor, were related to larger NP effects. Results indicate that in PD, disruption of dopamine neuromodulation diminishes response efficiency when action must be directed toward previously ignored information.","1637":"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal controls (NCs) performed a negative priming task. NCs displayed the normal pattern of negative priming in that relative to a control condition they were slower to identify a target within a stimulus array when it had been a distractor in the previous array. PD patients did not display any evidence of negative priming. In contrast, both PD patients and NCs displayed statistically the same level of spatial priming and response repetition cost. Regression analyses indicated that although symptom severity, symptom characteristics, and global cognitive functioning were not reliable predictors of negative priming or spatial priming in PD patients, greater symptom severity and poorer global cognitive functioning were associated with less response repetition cost. The possible role of the striatum in negative priming, spatial priming, and response repetition cost is discussed.","1638":"Three experiments investigated interhemispheric interactions in number comparison using the interhemispheric Stroop-like paradigm (E. Ratinckx, M. Brysbaert, &amp; B. Reynvoet, 2001). In all experiments, a target was presented in I visual field simultaneously with a distractor in the other visual field. In Experiment 1, both target and distractor were of the same modality (Arabic digits), whereas in Experiment 2, target and distractor were of different modalities (Arabic digits and word numerals). In Experiment 3, the interhemispheric Stroop-like task of Experiment 1 was combined with intrahemispheric conditions to evaluate the strength of the interhemispheric interactions. Overall, the results point to strong interhemispheric integration during semantic access and response preparation with very weak lateralization of the semantic number system.","1639":"The authors examined the associations of diabetes mellitus with cognitive performance in a population-based sample of nondemented and nondepressed very old persons. Diabetic participants (n = 31) were compared with nondiabetic controls (n = 307), adjusting for age, educational level, and related vascular diseases and signs. Results showed that diabetic persons performed significantly worse on tests of verbal fluency and episodic memory but that the effects on both types of abilities were less pronounced in tasks involving higher degrees of semantic structure. Follow-up analyses further revealed that preclinical dementia and impending death accounted for much of the observed associations. The results suggest that cognitive deficits among very old diabetics are most likely detected by tasks that draw less on semantic structures and that the most robust effects may be found in letter fluency performance.","1640":"Patients with frontal lobe lesions and control participants were assessed on 2 tests of semantic knowledge. In the triadic comparison task, participants were shown all possible triplets of 12 animal names and judged which 2 of each triplet were most alike. In the ordered similarity task, participants rank ordered animals in terms of their similarity to a target animal. For both tasks, semantic structure--derived from multidimensional scaling techniques--revealed similar representations in patients with frontal lobe lesions and control participants. Additional pathfinder analyses also produced networks that did not differ between groups. These patients exhibited intact semantic knowledge despite deficits on tests of free recall and verbal fluency that involved the same semantic category and exemplars. Thus, intact representation of semantic knowledge in frontal patients stands in contrast to their marked deficits in strategic retrieval of semantic knowledge.","1641":"Memory encoding and retrieval strategies were assessed in patients with behavior-executive variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD), language variant FTD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using verbal and visuospatial supraspan learning tests. FTD patients obtained higher free recall, cued recall, and recognition scores than AD patients. Comparison of free recall scores with cued recall and recognition scores was similar in the 3 dementia groups. Groups did not differ in semantic clustering strategies during learning, but serial-order recall was more common in FTD patients. These data do not support the idea that FTD patients' poor memory is due to a selective retrieval disorder, though FTD patients may fail to implement sophisticated organizational strategies during learning. FTD patients' retained capacity for encoding new information into long-term declarative memory is likely due to relatively spared medial temporal lobe involvement.","1642":"Delayed alternation tasks are frequently used as probes of frontal lobe functioning. To clarify the neural substrates of delayed alternation performance in humans, the authors measured regional cerebral blood flow with H2(15)O positron emission tomography in healthy subjects as they performed delayed spatial and object alternation. Consistent with the monkey lesion literature, increased dorsolateral prefrontal activity emerged during delayed spatial alternation but not delayed object alternation, whereas orbitofrontal activations emerged in both alternation tasks. The possible cognitive processes contributing to the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal involvement in delayed alternation are discussed. Additional activations localized to several nonfrontal regions suggest caution in interpreting alternation deficits in patients as strictly reflecting frontal lobe impairment.","1643":"This study tests the hypothesis that sentence comprehension difficulty in Parkinson's disease (PD) is related in part to altered information processing speed that plays a crucial role in grammatical processing. The authors measured information processing speed in 32 PD patients without dementia using a lexical list-priming paradigm in which the interstimulus interval (ISI) between the prime and the target varied. Sentence comprehension accuracy was also assessed in 22 of these patients. Sentence comprehension accuracy for object-relative center-embedded sentences was impaired in a subgroup of PD patients. This subgroup of PD patients primed at an abnormally long ISI. Similarly, only PD patients who primed at a long ISI had greater difficulty understanding sentences with an object-relative clause than a subject-relative clause. Findings suggest that slowed information processing speed contributes to sentence comprehension difficulty in PD.","1644":"False recognition of semantic associates can be reduced when older adults also study pictures representing each associate. D. L. Schacter, L. Israel, and C. Racine (1999) attributed this reduction to the operation of a distinctiveness heuristic: a response mode in which participants demand access to detailed recollections to support a positive recognition decision. The authors examined patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and older adults with this paradigm. Half of the participants studied pictures and auditory words; the other half studied visual and auditory words. Older adults who studied pictures were able to reduce their false alarms compared with those who studied words only. AD patients who studied pictures were unable to reduce their false alarms compared with those who studied words only and, in fact, exhibited trends toward greater false recognition. Implications for understanding semantic memory in AD patients are discussed.","1645":"The current study investigated executive function measures emphasizing Alpha Span (ASp) to understand relationships among executive and nonexecutive tasks. Nondemented older participants (N = 417) received a comprehensive cognitive battery. Age and vocabulary adjusted correlations revealed associations among ASp, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Revised (D. Wechsler, 1981) Digit Span subtests, and fluency tasks. Principal-components analysis with varimax rotation revealed a 4 component solution (86.4% of the variance) with executive variables contributing to all loadings. Calculated component indices were submitted to a regression analysis predicting ASp performance. After accounting for age (6.3% of the variance), Component 3 reflecting brief attention-mental manipulation accounted for 13.4% of ASp variance; Component 1, verbal language ability, 11.5%; Component 2, sustained attention-mental tracking, 1.9%; and Component 4, visuoperceptual spatial organization-planning, 0.9%. Results stress the importance of considering executive and nonexecutive aspects of cognition when conceptualizing executive functioning.","1646":"There are a wide variety of neuropsychological deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), among which are disorders of visual perception and spatial cognition. The present study investigated the ability of 20 mildly to moderately deteriorated patients with AD (and 174 age- and education-matched controls) on tasks that required them to visually identify, provide the canonical orientation of, and mentally rotate common objects. Some 85% of the AD patients performed poorly on all tasks. The authors were able to identify a small number of individual patients whose pattern of performance represented double dissociations between recognizing objects and knowing their canonical orientation. These findings are interpreted in the context of previous findings, especially as to whether information relating to an object's orientation and identity is independently coded.","1647":"Previously, Y. Jiang, P. Greenwood, and R. Parasuraman (1999) reported that priming of rotating three-dimensional visual objects is age sensitive. The current study investigated whether there is also an age-related difference in priming with simple two-dimensional (2-D) moving stimuli (i.e., whether a prime stimulus moving in a particular direction causes a subsequent ambiguous target stimulus to be seen moving in the same direction as the prime). In 2 experiments, younger and older adults judged the directions of moving sine-wave gratings. Groups differed neither in determining the direction of a single 2-D movement nor in detecting motion reversals in successively moving gratings. However, the older group showed a significant reduction in the extent of 2-D motion priming. The decrement in older adults for visual motion priming may reflect age-related changes in temporal processing in human visual cortex.","1648":"Attempts to identify cognitive markers of a preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have yielded inconsistent findings. The problem may stem in part from methodologies that are insensitive to potential subgroups within the at-risk, preclinical AD population (PCAD). The present study investigated the utility of asymmetric cognitive profiles in identifying individuals at risk for AD. Twenty elderly adults who were later diagnosed with AD (PCAD) and 20 matched control participants were compared on measures of cognitive asymmetry derived from difference scores on tests of verbal and visuospatial ability. Although both groups performed similarly on the individual tests, comparisons using difference scores revealed significantly larger discrepancies between naming and visuoconstruction skills in the PCAD group. The PCAD group also had a higher frequency of asymmetric cognitive profiles relative to a normative group.","1649":"The authors found splenial lesions to be associated with left ear suppression in dichotic listening of consonant-vowel syllables. This was found in both a rapid presentation dichotic monitoring task and a standard dichotic listening task, ruling out attentional limitations in the processing of high stimulus loads as a confounding factor. Moreover, directed attention to the left ear did not improve left ear target detection in the patients, independent of callosal lesion location. The authors' data may indicate that auditory callosal fibers pass through the splenium more posterior than previously thought. However, further studies should investigate whether callosal fibers between primary and secondary auditory cortices, or between higher level multimodal cortices, are vital for the detection of left ear targets in dichotic listening.","1650":"Explicit memory appears to be supported by medical temporal lobe structures, whereas separate neocortical regions may mediate perceptual and conceptual implicit memory. Children and adults with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and matched controls were administered experimental verbal memory tests. Performance on implicit tests--word identification and word generation--was contrasted with explicit recognition and recall. Encoding conditions emphasized either conceptual or perceptual aspects of study words and were crossed with presentation modality. The priming performance of participants with TLE did not differ from controls, but participants with TLE did show deficits on recognition and recall measures. Thus, intact left temporal cortex does not appear to be necessary for normal implicit memory performance, even when conceptual processing is emphasized at study or test.","1651":"Previous research has demonstrated broad neurobehavioral abnormalities in bipolar affective disorder (cf. G. Cassens, L. Wolfe, &amp; M. Zola, 1990). However, there have been no comparisons of neuropsychological function across patients with manic, depressed, or mixed subtypes. In the present study, 37 manic, 24 mixed-episode, and 25 depressed bipolar I inpatients and 34 control subjects were administered a brief battery of neuropsychological tests. The multivariate and univariate effects of participant group on the neuropsychological measures were uniformly significant (p &lt; .05). Planned contrasts revealed that the bipolar participants performed worse than the controls, and few differences existed between the 3 patient groups. Additionally, the bipolar groups were impaired on 50% of the test battery. These abnormalities were unlikely attributable to differences in psychiatric symptomatology, medical illness, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, or medication status. Findings imply that acute mood disturbance during bipolar disorder yields significant neurobehavioral dysfunction.","1652":"Neuropsychological deficits, most notable in executive, visuospatial, and functions of gait and balance, are detectable in alcoholic men even after a month of sobriety. Less well established are the severity and profile of persisting deficits in alcoholic women. The authors used an extensive test battery to examine cognitive and motor functions in 43 alcoholic women who were sober, on average, for 3.6 months. Functions most severely affected in alcoholic women involved visuospatial and verbal and nonverbal working memory processes as well as gait and balance. Areas of relative sparing were executive functions, declarative memory, and upper-limb strength and speed. The authors found that lifetime alcohol consumption was related to impairment severity on Block Design (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, D. Wechsler, 1981) and verbal and nonverbal working memory, suggesting a dose effect of alcohol abuse. The alcohol-related deficits in working memory, visuospatial, and balance implicate disruption of prefrontal, superior parietal, and cerebellar brain systems.","1653":"Established culture-invariant measures are needed for cross-cultural assessment of verbal and visuospatial speed of processing and working memory across the life span. In this study, 32 younger and 32 older adults from China and from the United States were administered numerically based and spatially based measures of speed of processing and working memory. Chinese superiority on the numerically based tasks was found for younger adults. Age and increasing task demands diminished this cultural effect, as predicted by the framework proposed by D. C. Park, R. Nisbett, and T. Hedden (1999). However, the visuospatial measures of both working memory and speed of processing did not differ cross-culturally for either age group. The authors concluded that these visuospatial measures provide culture-invariant estimates of cognitive processes in East Asian and Western cultures, but that numerically based tasks show evidence of cultural and linguistic biases in performance levels.","1654":"Attention, learning, memory, and estimated intellectual potential were examined in 26 Vietnam veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in 21 Vietnam veterans without mental disorders. Results revealed PTSD-associated cognitive deficits on tasks of sustained attention, working memory, initial learning, and estimated premorbid intelligence but not on measures of focus of attention, shift of attention, or memory savings. Cognitive task performances adjusted for estimated native intelligence remained negatively correlated with PTSD severity. An intellectual measure adjusted for cognitive task performances was negatively correlated with PTSD severity, even after the authors statistically controlled the level of combat exposure. Results suggested that although intellectual resources may constitute a vulnerability-protective factor for PTSD development, PTSD was associated with cognitive impairment independent of intellectual functioning.","1655":"Sixty-three adjudicated adolescents, aged 14-17 years, were followed for 2 years to examine the neuropsychological characteristics of subgroups of delinquents. Nonrecidivistic subjects (n = 29) and late recidivistic subjects (n = 22) differed from early recidivistic subjects (n = 12) on intelligence, self-control functioning, and memory. Late recidivistic subjects, compared with not recidivistic subjects, showed a lower verbal IQ. The differences remained when controlling for the level of substance abuse. This study suggests that neuropsychological assessment may help in differentiating delinquent adolescents, although more research is needed to unravel the mediating influences of substance abuse and early neuropsychological and academic problems.","1656":"To support categorical representation in the brain for grammatical class, it is necessary to show that noun-verb differences are attributable to parts of speech and not to covarying semantic factors. Prior visual-half field investigations of noun-verb processing have confounded grammatical class with imageability. The current study included numerous tests of differential noun-verb processing across visual fields for stimuli equated for imageability. Task (lexical decision, pronunciation) and list context (blocked vs. mixed lists) variables were examined in 168 right-handed participants. There was no reliable reduction of the right visual field advantage for moderately imageable nouns as compared with verbs. If there are qualitative hemisphere differences in single-word noun and verb recognition, these may be attributable to semantic dimensions that tend to covary with grammatical class.","1657":"Forty-three children (ages 7.0-14.5 years old) with and without attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combined type had thresholds for detection of a 500-Hz pure tone estimated with and without a noise masker in the contralateral ear. The ear receiving the signal in the masked condition was varied randomly. A single-interval maximum-likelihood method estimated thresholds and false-alarm rate. Whereas the increase in threshold in children with ADHD in the presence of contralateral masking was comparable with controls, the increase in false-alarm rate was significantly greater. This dissociation between changes in sensitivity and response bias in the presence of masking noise supports suggestions that children with ADHD have difficulty inhibiting maladaptive responses and indicates that this deficit is quantifiable using psychoacoustic methods.","1658":"Longitudinal behavior and achievement outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) were investigated in 53 children with severe TBI, 56 children with moderate TBI, and 80 children with orthopedic injuries not involving brain insult. Measures of preinjury child and family status and of postinjury achievement skills were administered shortly after injury. Assessments were repeated 3 times across a mean follow-up interval of 4 years. Results from mixed model analysis revealed persisting sequelae of TBI. Recovery of math skills was observed in the severe TBI group but only for children from less stressed families. Social disadvantage in children with TBI predicted more adverse behavioral sequelae and less favorable changes in some outcome measures. The findings suggest that pediatric TBI has long-term effects on behavior and achievement but that postinjury progress is influenced by the family environment.","1659":"This study suggests that perceptually based implicit learning may either be preserved following a severe closed-head injury (CHI) or recover within the 1st year. Nineteen severe CHI patients and 19 controls searched visual matrices and indicated the quadrant location of a target. Participants were exposed to the following covariation pattern: AAAABAAA. For Covariation A blocks, the matrices systematically co-occurred with a unique location of the target. This relationship was altered for the B block. Despite CHI participants' overall slower response times (RTs), both groups demonstrated the expected decline in RTs across the first 4 Covariation A blocks followed by an increase when the covariation changed. Both groups also exhibited retention of their learning after a 20-min delay. Explicit knowledge tests indicated that participants lacked awareness for the covariation.","1660":"Emotional competence and deficits that may disrupt interpersonal interactions were evaluated in 28 adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 28 demographically equivalent controls. Participants completed tasks assessing affect recognition and experienced emotional intensity. Adults with ADHD performed worse in affect recognition than did adults without the disorder; however, the impairment was unrelated to gross perceptual processes, fundamental abilities in facial recognition, or attentional aspects of affect perception. Moreover, intensity of experienced emotion moderated affect recognition: Among controls, experienced emotion facilitated affect recognition. Among adults with ADHD, who reported significantly greater intensity, experienced emotion was inversely related to affect recognition. Results are consistent with theories of ADHD as a deficit in behavioral inhibition; yet, results may merely reflect a constellation of deficits associated with the disorder.","1661":"Previous studies of associative encoding that used explicit retrieval tasks have shown both age- and dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT)-related declines, but such results may be biased by group differences in explicit retrieval. In the present experiment, the authors assessed implicit associative encoding for 25 younger adults (ages 18-25), 73 healthy older adults (ages 59-91), and 65 adults with DAT (ages 59-91) during a speeded word-naming task using an episodic priming measure. Episodic priming refers to the facilitation in responding to a target word after repetition of both words in a prime-target pair, in comparison with simple repetition of the target word with a new prime on each presentation. In contrast with other studies of implicit associative encoding that did not use an implicit episodic priming measure, the present study found both age- and DAT-related declines in associative encoding under conditions of massed learning trials.","1662":"Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently demonstrate impairments of information-processing speed (IPS) on measures such as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; D. M. A. Gronwall, 1977). The authors have previously shown that their new PASAT scoring method (mean dyad score) is better correlated in comparison with more traditional PASAT scoring method(s), with magnetic resonance imaging measurement of the total area (mm2) of white-matter sclerotic lesions (P. J. Snyder &amp; J. C. Cappelleri, 2001). The present study reports that the mean dyad score discriminated 20 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients from 15 secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients noticeably better than did the standard scoring method(s). Mean dyad scores &lt; 4.13 classified patients as having SPMS with 73% accuracy (sensitivity), whereas scores &gt; or = 4.13 classified patients as having RRMS with 80% accuracy (specificity).","1663":"The dependence of episodic memories on interhemispheric processing was tested. In Experiment 1, positive familial sinistrality (FS+; e.g., presence of left-handed relatives) was associated with superior episodic memory and inferior implicit memory in comparison with negative familial sinistrality (i.e., FS-). This reflected a greater degree of interhemispheric interaction in FS+ participants, which was hypothesized as facilitating episodic memory. In Experiment 2, the authors directly manipulated inter- versus intrahemispheric processing using tests of episodic (recognition) and semantic (lexical decision) memory in which letter strings were presented twice within trial blocks. Semantic memory was superior when the 2nd presentation went to the same hemisphere as the 1st. Episodic memory, however, was superior when the 2nd presentation of a stimulus went to the opposite hemisphere. Results support an interhemispheric processing basis for episodic memories.","1664":"The relative contributions of the right- and left-temporal lobes in rapid recognition of faces and letters were studied in patients with anterior right- or left-temporal lobe excisions and a matched control group. On the basis of findings in patients with unilateral and bilateral brain damage, it was hypothesized that left hemisphere damage would not change the reaction time of letters analyzed by the right hemisphere and that right hemisphere damage would not change the reaction time of faces analyzed by the left hemisphere. The hypothesis was supported for letters but not for faces. Patients in the right-temporal group, particularly those with large hippocampal removals, were slow to recognize faces in both visual fields. Two possible explanations for the findings with faces are explored: One holds that right hemisphere mechanisms are involved even when a face is presented to the left hemisphere for rapid recognition; the other holds that specialized encoding is carried out by the right hemisphere during learning, with the encoded template then being used by each hemisphere independently.","1665":"The authors describe a densely amnesic man who has acquired explicit semantic knowledge of famous names and vocabulary words that entered popular culture after the onset of his amnesia. This new semantic knowledge was temporally graded and existed over and above the implicit memory he demonstrated in reading speed and accuracy, familiarity ratings, and his ability to make correct guesses on unfamiliar items. However, his postmorbid knowledge was limited to verbal labels denoting famous people and words; he possessed virtually no explicit knowledge of the meaning of these words or the identities of these individuals, although there was some evidence that some of this information had been acquired at an implicit level. Findings are discussed in the context of a neural network model (J. L. McClelland, B. L. McNaughton, &amp; R. C. O'Reilly, 1995) of semantic acquisition.","1666":"Evidence from studies of nonmnemonic automatic cognitive processes provides reason to expect that schizophrenia is associated with exaggerated automatic memory (implicit memory), or automatic hypermnesia. Participants with schizophrenia (n = 22) and control participants (n = 26) were compared on word stem completion (WSC) and list discrimination (LD) tasks administered using the process dissociation procedure. Unadjusted, extended measurement model and dual-process signal-detection methods were used to estimate recollection and automatic memory indices. Schizophrenia was associated with automatic hypermnesia on the WSC task and impaired recollection on both tasks. Thought disorder was associated with even greater automatic hypermnesia. The absence of automatic hypermnesia on the LD task was interpreted with reference to the neuropsychological bases of context and content memory.","1667":"Lesion studies have demonstrated that frequency memory, or memory for the frequency of occurrence, is associated with prefrontal and not temporal lobe lesions. This study examined neural activation during performance on a frequency-memory-judgment task and a recognition-memory task, both using words. Relative to a control task, the authors observed peaks of activation during frequency-memory performance in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 45) and other areas typically associated with working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Recognition performance was associated with activation in the same left ventrolateral prefrontal location as was observed with frequency memory. When comparing activation during frequency memory with activation during recognition memory, the authors found a suppression of activation in the hippocampus bilaterally during frequency memory. This study supports a neuroanatomical distinction between frequency and recognition memory.","1668":"To investigate planning in traumatically brain injured children, the authors gave the Porteus Maze Test (PMT; S. D. Porteus, 1959) to 276 pediatric patients who had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at least 3 years previously. Sensitivity of the PMT to TBI severity, age at test, and volume of focal brain lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging was also studied. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (L. M. Dunn &amp; L. M. Dunn, 1981) was also administered as a control measure. Results indicated that the PMT was highly sensitive to TBI severity and to volume of circumscribed prefrontal lesions. In contrast to the PMT data, receptive vocabulary was related to injury severity but not to discrete prefrontal lesions. Implications for mechanisms of cognitive deficit after TBI in children are discussed.","1669":"The effect of comorbid reading or arithmetic learning disabilities (LDs) on neuropsychological function in attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was studied. Participants were young males diagnosed with ADHD, with and without LD, and non-ADHD, non-LD male controls of similar age. LD was defined by combined regression-based and low-achievement classifications. Analyses adjusted for the effect of psychiatric comorbidity, age, and socioeconomic status on neuropsychological function. Children who had both ADHD and LD were significantly more impaired on both executive and nonexecutive functions than ADHD children without LD. Neuropsychological performance was most impaired in ADHD with combined arithmetic and reading disability. These data indicate that comorbid LD, especially arithmetic disability, significantly increases the severity of executive function impairment in ADHD.","1670":"This cross-sectional study examined modal attention asymmetries in patients with schizophrenia (n = 47) and bipolar disorder (n = 42), as contrasted to a matched-sample comparison group of normal participants (n = 89). A test of continuous auditory and visual attention was the primary measure. The data were analyzed from 2 experimental conditions: simple modal responses (auditory and visual) and modal switching responses (ipsimodal and cross-modal switching). In the simple modal condition, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated a visual over auditory asymmetry; patients with bipolar disorder showed no differences. In modal switching conditions, however, patients with bipolar disorder displayed a significant auditory over visual asymmetry. No main effect was detected between medications and attention functioning. Results are discussed in light of differentiating these 2 populations on the basis of modal specificity of attention functioning.","1671":"The clinical utility of current face recognition tests has been questioned. To evaluate if a new paradigm may measure this type of memory more accurately, the authors created a novel test to examine face learning (previously uninvestigated) and short- and long-term retention. For this initial investigation of test sensitivity to hemisphere of dysfunction, patients with surgical resection from a temporal lobe and healthy subjects were tested. Recognition was evaluated on 3 trials: after a single exposure, after 4 exposures (for learning), and after a 24-hr delay interval. Patients with a right resection performed significantly worse than healthy controls and patients with left resection. There was no difference between patients with a left resection and controls. Classification of individual patients to side of resection based on test results showed higher sensitivity (82%) than published for other tests and maintained good specificity (79%).","1672":"The authors previously reported that normal subjects are better at discriminating happy from neutral faces when the happy face is located to the viewer's right of the neutral face; conversely, discrimination of sad from neutral faces is better when the sad face is shown to the left, supporting a role for the left hemisphere in processing positive valence and for the right hemisphere in processing negative valence. Here, the authors extend this same task to subjects with unilateral cerebral damage (31 right, 28 left). Subjects with right damage performed worse when discriminating sad faces shown on the left, consistent with the prior findings. However, subjects with either left or right damage actually performed superior to normal controls when discriminating happy faces shown on the left. The authors suggest that perception of negative valence relies preferentially on the right hemisphere, whereas perception of positive valence relies on both left and right hemispheres.","1673":"The present study investigated handedness of 109 Korean patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 120 normal control participants. Left TLE was associated with a significantly raised incidence of left-handers relative to normal controls. More important for the present purpose, right TLE was associated with a significantly raised incidence of strong right-handers relative to normal controls. This finding indicates that certain early damage to the right brain causes a mild hypofunction of the left hand in natural weak right-handers, which in turn causes the patient to switch to strong right-handedness. To the authors' knowledge, this finding provides the 1st empirical evidence supporting the pathological right-handedness hypothesis. Prior failure to find evidence of pathological right-handedness may reflect the low base rate of natural left-handers rather than true absence of pathological right-handers.","1674":"Controlled and automatic aspects of semantic-associative functioning in schizophrenia were investigated by evaluating performance on animal word list generation (WLG). Responses from control (n = 47) and patient (n = 38) participants were subjected to multidimensional scaling (MDS), cluster analysis (CA), and indices on the basis of number of shared attributes (SA) between consecutive responses. Patient MDS results accounted for less variance and contained more error than control data. CA results yielded fewer and less clear animal-response subgroups among patients yet demonstrated intact associations among strongly related exemplars. The SA indices revealed better clustering and more effective switching among response clusters in controls than patients. Results suggest that animal WLG in schizophrenia is compromised both by aberrant automatic semantic-associative network activation and by controlled processes such as search, access, and selection. This pattern is consistent with prominent frontotemporal pathology evident in the disorder.","1675":"Neuropsychological profile differences between empirically derived clinical subtypes of schizophrenia were examined. Two hundred five patients and 209 demographically matched controls were administered a neuropsychological battery examining 8 domains. Subtypes included negative, disorganized, paranoid, Schneiderian, and mild. All subtypes displayed a neuropsychological profile of generalized impairment with greater deficits in learning, memory, and attention. Results were suggestive of diffuse cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia with more severe deficits in learning and memory relative to executive skills. This pattern of greater learning and memory impairment was pronounced for disorganized patients. In contrast, paranoid patients outperformed disorganized and negative patients in several domains. These findings reflect bilateral frontal-temporal dysfunction, particularly in disorganized and negative patients. Subtype differences highlight the importance of conceptualizing schizophrenia as a multifocal disorder.","1676":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients often exhibit deficits on conceptual implicit memory tests such as category exemplar generation and word association. However, these tests rely on word production abilities, which are known to be disrupted by AD. The current study assessed conceptual implicit memory performance in AD patients and elderly control participants using a conceptual priming task that did not require word production (i.e., semantic decision). Memory performance was also examined using a category exemplar generation test (i.e., a conceptual priming task that required word production) and a recognition memory test. AD patients exhibited deficits on the semantic decision task, the category exemplar generation task, and the recognition memory task. The results indicate that the conceptual memory deficits observed in AD patients cannot be attributed completely to word production difficulties.","1677":"The frontal lobes show early signs of structural and functional change in the course of adult aging. The 1st study of the current article examined whether midlife aging influences open-ended planning, a skill that is particularly sensitive to frontal lobe damage. There were no midlife declines in the ability to carry out variants of the T. Shallice and P. Burgess (1991) Six Elements and Multiple Errands Tests. Younger adults were more likely to break individual task rules. In a 2nd experiment, middle-aged adults performed worse than young adults did on laboratory executive tests sensitive to frontal lobe damage-Self-Ordered Pointing and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (N. M. Fristoe, T. A. Salthouse, &amp; J. L. Woodard, 1997). In spite of changes in novel executive test performance, real-world executive skills appear to be spared in midlife aging.","1678":"The present study investigated methodological differences between the clinical version of the Stroop Color and Word Test and the computerized single-trial version. Three experiments show that different presentations of the Stroop task can produce different levels of interference. The 1st experiment examined the effect of blocking; the 2nd experiment examined different control conditions. Greater interference in the blocked clinical version appears to result from lower response times (RTs) in the neutral condition, not from greater RTs in the incongruent condition. Experiment 3 examined the impact of shifting attention across locations while responding to Stroop stimuli. The present set of findings sheds light on the inconsistency in the clinical literature and demonstrates that the method and selection of neutral stimuli (that provide the baseline by which interference is measured) are critical because they clearly can change performance.","1679":"Thirty-seven nonalcoholic individuals (22 women, 15 men), ages 26-76, and 36 abstinent alcoholic individuals (11 women, 25 men), ages 31-74, participated in a cued-detection task that assessed right hemisphere (RH) functioning associated with aging and alcoholism. Young controls were less reliant on cues following RH activation, which is consistent with the view that the RH has an advantage because it has the ability to attend to a broader spatial array than does the left hemisphere (LH). This RH advantage was not obtained in older controls or alcoholic participants. The pattern of results for the older nonalcoholic participants indicated that they neither benefited from valid cues following LH activation nor exhibited enhanced processing on invalid cue trials following RH activation. The results for the alcoholic participants were consistent with RH functional decline, but did not support the view that alcoholism and aging have synergistic effects.","1680":"To examine the relationship between recall and recognition memory in amnesia, the authors conducted 2 experiments in which recognition memory was equated between patients with amnesia and control participants. It was then determined whether recall was also similar across groups. In Experiment 1, recognition was equated by providing amnesic patients with additional study exposures; in Experiment 2, recognition was equated by testing controls following a longer delay. These different methods of equating recognition across groups led to divergent results because amnesic patients' recall performance was lower than controls' recall performance in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. These findings are accounted for by considering the differential contribution of recollection and familiarity to the performance of amnesic patients and controls in the 2 experiments.","1681":"Object-naming impairment is common among temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, but other aspects of semantic memory have received limited attention in this population. This study examined object-naming ability and depth of semantic knowledge in healthy controls (n = 29) and patients with early onset TLE (n = 21). After administration of the Boston Naming Test (BNT), the authors asked participants to provide detailed definitions of 6 BNT objects. The TLE group demonstrated a significant deficit relative to controls in both object-naming ability and semantic knowledge for the target objects, even after controlling for IQ. In a multiple regression analysis that included other neuropsychological test scores as independent variables, the semantic knowledge score was the only significant predictor of patients' object-naming performance. Thus, at the group level, early onset TLE patients have a semantic knowledge deficit that contributes to dysnomia.","1682":"Theories of cognitive functioning in anxiety propose decreased processing efficiency associated with worry but have paid scant attention to possible neural mechanisms. This study examined interhemispheric processing in individuals differing in self-reported worry under high- and low-evaluative conditions. Measures of interhemispheric processing were letter-matching tasks, with matches occurring either within or across hemispheres and requiring either a physical identity (A-A) or a name identity match (A-a). Results indicated that the across-hemisphere advantage (AHA) for the more difficult name identity task was exaggerated under high-evaluative conditions, indicating that interhemispheric processing was especially beneficial under the processing load of evaluation stress. Regardless of task condition, high worriers displayed a reduced AHA compared with low worriers, reflecting ineffective coordination of interhemispheric resources in worriers.","1683":"The authors examined the differential effects of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)--a condition associated with elevated risk for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia--on the cognitive development of the two sexes. The authors also attempted to establish whether the severity of respiratory distress is linked to cognitive outcome. Findings revealed an appreciable female advantage in cognitive recovery from RDS, yet the association between severity of RDS and outcome did not reach conventional statistical significance level. The sex effect on intelligence test performance was significantly greater for nonverbal subtests than for verbal ones. These results augment earlier findings of sex differences in cognitive recovery from perinatal intracranial hemorrhage. The current investigation also extends these results to a population of children at neonatal hypoxic risk for whom early brain injury was excluded on the basis of neonatal cranial ultrasound findings.","1684":"Clinical investigations have found that lesions of the right cerebral hemisphere can disrupt face perception. Much less is known about the determinants of facial discrimination in healthy adults, although age-related differences in many cognitive abilities have been shown to correlate with simple processing speed and variation in regional brain volumes. In this study, 174 healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 92 were asked to match pictures of unfamiliar faces. After their performance was regressed on age, sex, education, and perceptual comparison speed, adding terms for frontal lobe volume, nonfrontal volume, and ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) derived from magnetic resonance imaging improved the model and accounted for 35% of the variance in facial discrimination. VBR and processing speed alone accounted for nearly 34% of the variance. These findings suggest that both normal atrophic brain changes and decreases in processing speed contribute to individual differences in facial discrimination.","1685":"The anteromedial temporal lobe has been found to participate in processing emotion, but there are unresolved discrepancies in the literature. To address this issue, the authors investigated recognition of emotion from faces and from prosody in 26 participants with unilateral temporal lobectomy (15 left, 11 right) and in 50 brain-damaged controls. Participants with right, but not left, temporal lobectomy did significantly worse in recognizing fear from facial expressions. There were no group differences in recognizing emotional prosody. Neither IQ nor basic perceptual function accounted for task performance; however, there was a moderate negative correlation between extent of amygdala damage and overall performance. Consistent with some prior studies, these findings support a role for the right anteromedial temporal lobe (including amygdala) in recognizing emotion from faces but caution in drawing conclusions from small group samples.","1686":"Studies requiring identification of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) nonwords have suggested that attention is distributed more slowly or sequentially across the letters when they are presented to the right hemisphere than to the left hemisphere. Two experiments investigated whether hemispheric differences in processing strategy would be reduced with reductions of hemispheric differences in accuracy. The magnitude of visual field differences in accuracy was controlled by manipulating exposure duration, and the effect was observed on visual field differences in processing strategy. For both CVC identification (Experiment 1) and identification of nonletter symbols (Experiment 2), hemispheric strategy differences were independent of differences in accuracy. Both quantitative and qualitative hemispheric differences in processing visual displays appear to depend on the nature of the stimuli and the nature of the processes they invoke.","1687":"The validity and origin of category effects in the anomia demonstrated by individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) remains controversial. Twenty DAT subjects were tested with picture naming and semantic association judgment tests. Picture and word stimuli were drawn from biological, nonbiological, and actions-verbs categories, all of equal difficulty and previously normed on elderly controls. DAT subjects made significantly more naming and semantic judgment errors in the biological category than in the nonbiological category. They were relatively more accurate in naming and making judgments for actions-verbs when presented as words or as 5-s animations. When line drawings of actions were shown for naming, performance deteriorated significantly. Converging results from these 2 tasks provide strong evidence for a semantic memory impairment preferentially affecting biological items to a greater extent than nonbiological items or action verbs in DAT.","1688":"This research examined 2 components of visual orienting in medicated schizophrenia patients: the validity effect and the inhibition of return (IOR). In the 1st experiment, patients showed the expected asymmetry in orienting attention, that is, larger validity effect in the right visual field than in the left. However, this asymmetry was due to a deficit in facilitatory processes rather than a disengagement deficit. In addition, patients showed a deficit in IOR. In the 2nd experiment, a 2nd central cue for summoning attention, explicitly, back to the center was used. In this experiment, normal IOR in schizophrenia patients was found. Because it was shown that schizophrenia patients do not have a disengagement deficit, IOR possibly could not be observed because of the increased facilitation in that location. It was proposed that the abnormality in visual attention in schizophrenia is due to a deficit in inhibitory processes.","1689":"Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 104) were compared with a control group (n = 64) on time estimation and reproduction tasks. Results were unaffected by ADHD subtype or gender. The ADHD group provided larger time estimations than the control group, particularly at long intervals. This became nonsignificant after controlling for IQ. The ADHD group made shorter reproductions than did the control group (15- and 60-s intervals) and greater reproduction errors (12-, 45-, 60-s durations). These differences remained after controlling for IQ and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, depression, and anxiety. Only the level of anxiety contributed to errors (at 12-s duration) beyond the level of ADHD. Results extended findings on time perception in ADHD children to adults and ruled out comorbidity as the basis of the errors.","1690":"Motor abnormalities occur in schizophrenia (SZ) and may arise from striatal dysfunction. This study examined whether the pattern of performance on simple and complex motor abilities in SZ was similar to that of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Quantitative tests of speeded movement and motor and cognitive sequencing were used to assess 25 SZ, 16 PD, and 84 normal controls (NCs). Sequencing performance was also examined with motor rigidity taken into account. Compared with the NC group, the SZ and PD groups were impaired on measures of motor rigidity and motor sequencing. With rigidity accounted for, the SZ group was significantly more impaired than the PD group on motor sequencing; cognitive and motor processes contributed to the motor deficit. Cognitive sequencing performance predicted motor sequencing performance in PD but not SZ. Although both SZ and PD resulted in significant motor and cognitive sequencing deficits, the pattern and correlates of these deficits differ, suggesting that the affected neural systems underlying motor deficits in SZ are different from those involved in PD.","1691":"Thirty-five prepubertal children, 17 boys and 18 girls, between the ages of 8 and 11 years, were studied to examine electrophysiological and cognitive sex differences during a face-recognition-memory (FRM) task and a facial-affect-identification task (FAIT). All participants were prepubertal, as determined by J. M. Tanner's (1962) staging and endocrine evaluation. Sex-dependent event-related potential (ERP) amplitude asymmetries were found during FRM. Boys displayed greater right versus left ERP amplitude to auditory tone probes during the task, whereas girls displayed the opposite pattern. In addition, positive correlations were obtained between ERP amplitude during FRM and FAIT accuracy scores for boys, but not for girls. Results suggest that girls and boys may use different neuronal systems in the processing of faces and facial affect. Findings are consistent with developmental theories regarding sex differences in visuospatial processing.","1692":"The present study examined the role of the left frontal cortex in strategic aspects of semantic processing. Participants were tested in a semantic priming task involving the meaning access of ambiguous and unambiguous words. Patients with left or bilateral frontal lesions failed to develop semantic facilitation of context-appropriate homograph meanings relative to age-matched controls and patients with right frontal lesions who produced more facilitation than controls. When the ambiguous words, however, were replaced by unambiguous words, patients with left frontal lesions improved to normal levels of semantic priming. This pattern of results seems difficult to explain in terms of a problem to access semantic information per se or to use contextual cues. The findings are, however, consistent with a deficit in selecting context-appropriate meanings in the presence of competing meanings.","1693":"Two studies tested the specificity of the neurocognitive profile of women with fragile X syndrome (FXS). First, women with an FXS full mutation were compared with women with a premutation and women without FXS who grew up in FXS families. Women with FXS had a significantly lower IQ than the other groups, and analyses of subtest profiles showed they had a relative weakness on Arithmetic and strength on Picture Completion. Women with FXS performed worse than the other groups on executive function, spatial ability, and visual memory. Next, women with FXS were compared with women without FXS matched on age and IQ. A similar IQ profile was found, but women with FXS were worse than controls only on executive function. The authors also examined which neurocognitive indices were related to the underlying biology of the disorder. Overall, the results indicated that executive rather than visuospatial deficits were primary in the neurocognitive profile of FXS.","1694":"Studies have shown lower false recognition of semantically related lure words in patients with global amnesia than in matched controls. This pattern has been interpreted as suggesting that medial temporal and diencephalic structures that are damaged in amnesia and that contribute to veridical memory also contribute to false recognition. It has been argued that whereas controls form and retain a well-organized representation of the semantic gist of studied items, patients with amnesia can retain only a degraded gist representation. However, these studies are subject to an alternative interpretation involving greater source confusions in controls. The authors used a categorized-pictures paradigm to test recognition under conditions in which source confusions were unlikely to occur. Relative to controls, patients with amnesia showed reduced false recognition of categorically related pictorial lures, thereby supporting the notion of degraded gist representations in amnesia.","1695":"Five groups of participants (young, healthy old, healthy old-old, very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type [DAT], and mild DAT) studied 12-item lists of words that converged on a critical nonpresented word (cold) semantically (chill, frost, warm, ice), phonologically (code, told, fold, old), or in a hybrid list of both (chill, told, warm, old). The results indicate that (a) veridical recall decreased with age and dementia; (b) recall of the nonpresented items increased with age and remained fairly stable across dementia; and (c) false recall varied by list type, with hybrid lists producing superadditive effects. For hybrid lists, individuals with DAT were 3 times more likely to recall the critical nonpresented word than a studied word. When false memory was considered as a proportion of veridical memory, there was an increase in relative false memory as a function of age and dementia. Results are discussed in terms of age- and dementia-related changes in attention and memory.","1696":"Latent inhibition (LI), poorer performance on a learning task to a previously irrelevant stimulus than to a novel stimulus, was produced in 4 experiments, using a within-subject design and a response time (RT) measure. LI was reduced by decreasing the number of stimulus preexposures, omitting the masking task, changing the context from the preexposure to the test phase, and introducing a delay between the 2 phases. Together, these effects indicate that the within-subject RT-based LI reflects the same processes as those that govern between-subject LI with correct response as the dependent measure. The new procedure provides an advantageous method for assessing attentional dysfunction related to the processing of irrelevant stimuli, particularly in pathological groups, such as patients with schizophrenia.","1697":"Previous research has found that patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) show lower levels of false recognition of semantic associates than do healthy older adults. To investigate whether this finding is attributable to semantic impairments in patients with AD, the authors examined false recognition of perceptually related novel objects with little semantic content in patients with AD and healthy older adults. By using corrected recognition scores to control for unrelated false alarms, it was found that patients with AD showed lower levels of both true and false recognition of novel objects than did older adults. These results suggest that the previous difference in false recognition of semantic associates observed between patients with AD and older adults is not entirely attributable to semantic memory deficits in patients with AD but may also involve poorly developed gist information in these patients.","1698":"The prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the mediation of executive processes that facilitate learning and memory. The authors hypothesized that children with prefrontal dysfunction related to phenylketonuria (PKU) would experience deficits in learning and memory because of impaired strategy use. They evaluated 23 children with PKU and 23 controls by using the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C). General executive abilities were tested using the Stroop Color and Word Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and phonemic and category fluency. Children with PKU, especially older children, showed poorer learning across trials and less use of semantic clustering on the CVLT-C but intact retention of previously encoded information. With the exception of phonemic fluency, deficits were not observed in general executive control. Results are discussed within the context of abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and white matter of the brain.","1699":"Young adults with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N = 105) were compared with a control group (N = 64) on 14 measures of executive function and olfactory identification using a 2 (group) X 2 (sex) design. The ADHD group performed significantly worse on 11 measures. No Group X Sex interaction was found on any measures. No differences were found in the ADHD group as a function of ADHD subtype or comorbid oppositional defiant disorder. Comorbid depression influenced the results of only 1 test (Digit Symbol). After IQ was controlled for, some group differences in verbal working memory, attention, and odor identification were no longer significant, whereas those in inhibition, interference control, nonverbal working memory, and other facets of attention remained so. Executive function deficits found in childhood ADHD exist in young adults with ADHD and are largely not influenced by comorbidity but may be partly a function of low intelligence.","1700":"The efficacy of attention rehabilitation after an acquired brain injury was examined meta-analytically. Thirty studies with a total of 359 participants met the authors' selection criteria. Studies were categorized according to whether training efficacy was evaluated by comparing pre- and posttraining scores only or included a control condition as well. Performance improved significantly (using the d+ statistic) after training in pre-post only studies but not in pre-post with control studies. Further analyses showed that specific-skills training significantly improved performance of tasks requiring attention but that the cognitive-retraining methods included in the meta-analysis did not significantly affect outcomes. These findings demonstrate that acquired deficits of attention are treatable using specific-skills training. Implications of these results for rehabilitation theory and future research are discussed.","1701":"Children with congenital hydrocephalus, children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and normal controls were evaluated with measures of focused attention (Visual Orienting and Detection Task), sustained attention (continuous performance test), and attention shifting (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Components from these tasks have been linked to attention systems mediated by anterior or posterior brain networks. Children with congenital hydrocephalus showed an inability to focus and shift attention, which specifically implicated impairment of the disengage and move components of the posterior brain attention system. Children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder displayed the expected performance patterns on measures of focused attention once their difficulties with sustained attention were taken into account. However, they showed problems with shifting and sustaining attention, which are commonly associated with the anterior brain attention system.","1702":"Material-specific memory refers to the ability to learn and recall new episodic information on the basis of the nature of the stimulus material (e.g., verbal vs. nonverbal-visuospatial). Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from a sample of patients with traumatic brain injury to compare 3 models of memory functioning: material-specific, material-specific plus general, and general (non-material-specific). The models were examined separately for acquisition, delayed free recall, and retention aspects of memory. Results suggest that, at least in a population with traumatic brain injury, the acquisition of new information takes place in a material-specific memory fashion, delayed free recall involves both material-specific and general (non-material-specific) memory components, but retention relies primarily on general (non-material-specific) memory processes.","1703":"Sex differences favoring women have been found in a number of studies of episodic memory. This study examined sex differences in verbal, nonverbal, and visuospatial episodic memory tasks. Results showed that although women performed at a higher level on a composite verbal and nonverbal episodic memory score, men performed at a higher level on a composite score of episodic memory tasks requiring visuospatial processing. Thus, men can use their superior visuospatial abilities to excel in highly visuospatial episodic memory tasks, whereas women seem to excel in episodic memory tasks in which a verbalization of the material is possible.","1704":"Staging of visuospatial and semantic deficits in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) was examined. The authors hypothesized that semantic ability would be more impaired in these patients, reflecting predominant temporal pathology early in the disease. However, in the 1st study (n = 26), 3 patients (11.5%) had marked visual but no semantic impairment. This finding was extended in a 2nd study with a 2nd patient sample (n = 21) and more specific tasks. Two patients (9.5%) again had visual but no semantic impairment. These studies confirm that, in patients with DAT presenting with relatively focal deficits, visual deficits sometimes occur before semantic problems. The findings are discussed with regard to the cognitive demands and neuroanatomical underpinning of the tests used and point to the necessity of using cognitively specific tests to enable accurate analysis of deficits in the context of the neuroanatomical basis of impairment.","1705":"Two types of action control derived from the model of action phases (H. Heckhausen &amp; P. M. Gollwitzer, 1987) were analyzed in patients with frontal lesions, patients with nonfrontal lesions, and university students. In Study 1, reflective action control in terms of goal selection was assessed, and impaired deliberation was found in patients with frontal lesions. Study 2 assessed reflexive action control in terms of automatic action initiation as a result of forming implementation intentions (P. M. Gollwitzer, 1999). All participants sped up their responses to critical stimuli by forming implementation intentions. Moreover, lesion patients with weak performances on the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task did worse than patients with strong TOH performances in Study 1 but better than control participants in Study 2. Findings are interpreted as a functional dissociation between conscious reflective action control and automatic reflexive action control.","1706":"To address the controversy of whether an intact procedural memory system alone can support the learning of the recursive strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle, the authors tested 2 amnesic patients, H.M. and P.N. Contrary to the report of N. J. Cohen, H. Eichenbaum, B. S. Deacedo, and S. Corkin (1985), both patients failed to master the recursive strategy under the active-interaction condition. In contrast, normal control participants were able to master the strategy under identical testing conditions. The failure of H.M. and P.N. could not be attributed to the differences between the original and current testing conditions. In addition, neither patient showed frontal lobe dysfunction or impairment in procedural memory. Together with evidence provided by theoretical analyses of this puzzle as well as studies on normal participants, the authors conclude that declarative memory plays a vital role in the acquisition of the recursive strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle.","1707":"Control participants and hypoxic participants with bilateral hippocampal damage were tested for short-term memory (STM) for presentation duration of a single object, STM for a single object, STM for spatial distance information, and time estimation. Delays of 1, 4, 8, 12, or 16 s were used for all the STM and time estimation tests. Results indicated that relative to controls, hypoxic participants were significantly impaired for STM for duration and distance information at the long but not short delays. Similarly, time estimation was accurate only to 8 s for hypoxic participants, but STM for a single object was only mildly affected. Results suggest that the hippocampus may be required for the processing of spatial and temporal STM information.","1708":"Left and right temporal lobectomy patients and normal controls were tested in a memory task for which the to-be-remembered items were simple actions involving small objects. Participants either performed the actions, perceived the experimenter performing the actions, or imagined themselves performing the actions. The patients were deficient relative to the controls at remembering the actions and at remembering whether the actions were performed, perceived, or imagined. These results are interpreted as suggesting that the temporal lobes are involved in memory for the source as well as the content of past experiences.","1709":"To test the claim that lesions of left anterior and middle temporal cortical structures specifically impair processing of nouns but not verbs, 56 left-hemisphere-language-dominant patients who had undergone anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) completed tasks assessing confrontation naming of pictured objects and actions, generation of synonyms for nouns and verbs, and semantic lexical judgments about nouns and verbs. Compared with right ATL patients, left ATL patients were impaired across different tasks that assessed naming and comprehension of high-imageability as well as low-imageability nouns. These groups did not differ, however, in verb naming or comprehension on most tasks. Results are consistent with the hypothesized specialization of left temporal lobe structures for processing nouns and suggest that naming problems commonly seen after left ATL extend beyond difficulties with retrieving object names and may be related to subtle disturbances in comprehension of the meanings underlying nominal word forms.","1710":"Two patients (E.P. and G.T.) were previously described with damage to amygdala and anterior temporal cortex (S.B. Hamann et al., 1996). Both rated emotions in facial expressions normally (the rating task) when the data analysis followed a method that had revealed an impairment in the well-studied patient S.M. The present study reports findings for a 3rd patient (G.P.) with the rating task and reexamines the data for E.P. and G.T. All 3 patients were also given a labeling task in which they selected, from a list of 6 words, which word they thought best described the emotion expressed by a face. All 3 patients were unmistakably impaired on both tasks. However, the impairment exhibited by these patients is different from S.M.'s impairment. The difference may depend on the etiology (congenital vs. adult-onset lesion) or the site of the damage (relatively selective amygdala damage vs. damage to amygdala as well as anterior temporal cortex).","1711":"The dissociability of working memory for name identity (verbal information), visual objects, and spatial location was explored in 3 experiments. Consistent with previous results, the 3 working memory systems were dissociable in younger adults. Both younger and older adults showed involvement of name identity in an object identity task, and older adults showed this involvement in a spatial memory task. Results were interpreted as showing that the systems are generally separable but that involvement of 1 with another is possible and more likely in older adults. A 4th, correlational study showed that there is generalized decline in working memory systems in old age, with the age differences in memory mediated to a moderate extent by age-related differences in speed of processing. It was speculated that the specific, possibly strategic changes are independent of and take place against a backdrop of generalized loss of nervous system integrity.","1712":"Olfaction is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was hypothesized that AD would reduce olfactory-evoked perfusion in mesial temporal olfactory (piriform) cortex, where neuropathology begins. Seven AD patients and 8 elderly controls (ECs) underwent olfactory threshold and identification tests and olfactory stimulation during positron emission tomography. Odor identification was impaired in AD, but threshold was not. Olfactory stimulation in ECs activated right and left piriform areas and right anterior ventral temporal cortex. AD patients had less activation in right piriform and anterior ventral temporal cortex but not in the left piriform area. Although orbital cortex did not activate in ECs, there was a significant between-groups difference in this area. Right piriform activation correlated with odor identification. Impaired odor identification likely reflects sensory cortex dysfunction rather than cognitive impairment. Given olfactory bulb projections to the mesial temporal lobe, olfactory stimulation during functional imaging might detect early dysfunction in this region.","1713":"The development of a quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG)-based procedure for use in the assessment of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was examined through a series of studies investigating test reliability and validation issues. This process, involving a spectral analysis of the electrophysiological power output from a single, midline, central location (the vertex), was conducted in 469 participants, 6 to 20 years of age, classified as ADHD, inattentive type; ADHD, combined type; or control. The results indicated that the QEEG scanning procedure was reliable (r = .96), was consistent with the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (S. B. McCarney, 1995) and the Test of Variables of Attention (L. M. Greenberg, 1994; chi-square, p &lt; .01), and differentiated participants with ADHD from a nonclinical control group (p &lt; .001). The sensitivity of the QEEG-derived attentional index was 90%; the specificity was 94%.","1714":"Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been associated with working memory problems. Schizophrenic patients (n = 24) and controls (n = 29) participated in simple short-term memory tasks, recalling a list of letters from the first to last item in the order of presentation. The authors hypothesized that deficient sequential representations would increase movement errors (e.g., ABCD being recalled as ABDC) or intrusion errors (e.g., ABCD being recalled as ABCX), whereas simple trace decay would lead to omission errors (e.g., ABCD being recalled as ABC_). Patients made disproportionately more omissions toward the end of 6-item lists. There were no group differences in movements or intrusions as a function of serial position. Schizophrenic patients' limited short-term memory span may be due to greater forgetting during recall and not to a selective deficit in the mechanisms responsible for maintaining serial order information.","1715":"Brain activation was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging during mathematical problem solving in 7 young healthy participants. Problems were selected from the Necessary Arithmetic Operations Test (NAOT; R. B. Ekstrom, J. W. French, H. H. Harman, &amp; D. Dermen, 1976). Participants solved 3 types of problems: 2-operation problems requiring mathematical reasoning and text processing, 1-operation problems requiring text processing but minimal mathematical reasoning, and 0-operation problems requiring minimal text processing and controlling sensorimotor demands of the NAOT problems. Two-operation problems yielded major activations in bilateral frontal regions similar to those found in other problem-solving tasks, indicating that the processes mediated by these regions subserve many forms of reasoning. Findings suggest a dissociation in mathematical problem solving between reasoning, mediated by frontal cortex, and text processing, mediated by temporal cortex.","1716":"Previous studies have documented poor recognition memory for faces in patients with semantic dementia. Preserved face recognition memory was found in this study, however, so long as atrophy was confined predominantly to the left temporal lobe. Patients with structural damage to the right temporal lobe were typically impaired, with the status of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus (including the perirhinal cortex) on the right being critical. Two single-case studies of patients with predominantly left temporal lobe pathology confirmed good recognition memory for famous faces, even if semantic knowledge about the celebrities depicted was severely degraded. An effect of semantic knowledge on recognition memory became apparent only when perceptually different photographs of the famous people were used at study and test. These results support the view that new episodic learning typically draws on information from both perceptual and semantic systems.","1717":"Preattentive and attentive visual processing was examined in patients with hemispatial neglect, hemispatial neglect with hemianopia, and control participants. In the preattentive search task, targets possessed a unique feature that was not shared by distractors. In the attentive search task, targets lacked a feature that was present in the distractors. Preattentive search was normal in 3 neglect patients with cortical lesions but not in 2 neglect patients with hemianopia. A 4th neglect patient without hemianopia with a subcortical infarct abnormally used serial search mechanisms in the preattentive task. Neglect patients were characteristically impaired in the contralesional field in the attentive search task. This study demonstrates preserved explicit detection of visual features in cases of hemispatial neglect.","1718":"Intraindividual variability in latency and accuracy of cognitive performance across both trials and occasions was examined in 3 groups of older adults: healthy adults, adults with arthritis, and adults diagnosed with mild dementia. Participants completed 2 reaction-time and 2 episodic-memory tasks on 4 occasions. Results indicated that intraindividual variability in latency was greater in individuals diagnosed with mild dementia than in adults who were neurologically intact, regardless of their health status. Individual differences in variability were stable over time and across cognitive domains. Intraindividual variability was also related to level of performance and was uniquely predictive of neurological status, independent of level of performance. Results suggest that intraindividual variability may be a behavioral indicator of compromised neurological mechanisms.","1719":"A Stroop-analog task with faces and words was developed to investigate intrahemispheric and interhemispheric Stroop effects (SEs). Lateralized faces and words were used in an attempt to invoke right- and left-hemispheric specialization, respectively. A prototypical male face, female face, and baby face and the corresponding words man, woman, and baby were presented as congruent or incongruent face-word pairs either to the same visual field (i.e., unilateral presentations) or to separate visual fields (i.e., bilateral presentations). Bidirectional SEs were found. Word distractors interfered with the identification of face targets, and, somewhat surprisingly, an even greater SE was obtained when words were the target and faces were ignored. Laterality effects were most pronounced for bilateral trials, whereby the SE was larger for right-hemisphere than for left-hemisphere target presentations, irrespective of type of target. This finding suggests that the left hemisphere is generally better shielded than the right from interhemispheric interference effects.","1720":"This study examines the ability of amnesic patients to recover newly formed associations implicitly after a single study trial. Fifteen amnesic patients with various etiologies studied pairs by forming a sentence containing both words. At test, all participants saw 40 intact pairs, 40 rearranged pairs, and 40 new words. All pairs appeared side by side both at study and at test. For the implicit lexical-decision task, 40 nonwords were intermixed with the other pairs, and participants indicated whether both items were words. For the explicit speeded-recognition test, participants were asked to indicate whether both words had appeared at study. Despite being severely impaired on the explicit test, amnesic patients performed like healthy controls on the implicit test, with faster and more accurate responses to intact pairs than to recombined pairs. Contrary to existing theories, the results suggest that amnesic patients can form and retain new associations.","1721":"The relation between attention available at encoding and automatic and consciously controlled aspects of memory was investigated using the process-dissociation procedure. Twenty-four severely closed-head injured (CHI) participants (&gt; 1 year postinjury) and 24 matched controls studied word lists in full- and divided-attention conditions. Recall cued with word stems was tested. In contrast to consciously controlled memory, the CHI group did not perform more poorly than the controls in estimates of automatic memory. Furthermore, for both groups, the divided-attention manipulation reduced the controlled estimates of memory, whereas automatic influences remained invariant. These results suggest that automatic memory processes may remain partially immune to the deleterious effects of severe CHI or show recovery by 1 year postinjury. They also indicate that automatic memory processes do not require additional attentional resources following severe CHI.","1722":"Neuropsychological studies have documented frontal dysfunction in patients with a history of exposure to organic solvents. The deficits typically observed in these patients appear to be related to working memory (WM). This study used [15O] water positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the pattern of neural activation during verbal working memory in patients with a history of exposure to solvents. Six individuals with solvent exposure were compared with 6 age- and education-matched controls. On the 2 WM tasks examined with PET, with equivalent task performance, participants with solvent exposure demonstrated frontal peaks that were atypical for the tasks, whereas the posterior peaks were typical for the tasks. The results support frontal dysfunction and compensatory use within anterior regions of the WM system in patients with solvent exposure.","1723":"The authors investigated classical eyeblink conditioning in a relatively rare patient, B.R., with extensive cerebellar cortical atrophy and marked sparing of the dentate nucleus. Patient B.R.'s ability to acquire and extinguish simple associations (delay and trace conditioning tasks) as well as her ability to acquire more complex associations (temporal and simple discrimination tasks) were examined. There are 2 primary findings from this study. First, B.R. showed normal acquisition and extinction in delay and trace conditioning. Second, she demonstrated a complete inability to learn associative discriminations, even in the case of a simple 2-tone discrimination within the context of a delay paradigm. The latter finding was unexpected because of the sparing of her deep cerebellar nuclei. These data suggest that the cerebellar cortex, or pathways traversing cerebellar cortex, play an important role in classical eyeblink discrimination learning.","1724":"Amygdala damage can result in impairments in evaluating facial expressions largely specific to fear. In contrast, right-hemisphere cortical lesions result in a more global deficit in facial emotion evaluation. This study addressed these 2 contrasting findings by investigating amygdala and adjacent cortical contributions to the evaluation of facial emotion in 12 patients with right and 11 patients with left unilateral anteromedial temporal lobectomy (RTL and LTL, respectively) and 23 normal controls. RTL but not LTL patients revealed impaired intensity ratings that included but were not exclusive to fear, with the most severe deficits confined to expressions related to affective states of withdrawal-avoidance. This suggests that affective hemispheric specializations in cortical function may extend to subcortical limbic regions. In addition, the right amygdala and adjacent cortex may be part of a neural circuit representing facial expressions of withdrawal.","1725":"J. Sergent (1991) claimed that split-brained people are highly accurate in judging which is the larger of 2 circles in opposite visual hemifields but are relatively poor at judging whether circles in the 2 hemifields are of the same size. The discrepancy could be due, at least in part, to an artifact. A split-brained man, L.B., was markedly worse than normals at judging which was the larger of 2 circles or the longer of 2 horizontal lines in opposite hemifields, and his performance could be largely accounted for without assuming any interhemispheric transfer. L.B. also judged whether a single flashed line extended further into the left or right hemifield and, as in a previous study (M. C. Corballis, 1995), was strongly biased to respond \"right longer.\" This bias was not observed in the judgments about the circles or the separated lines, suggesting that it is not due to a compression of perceived space in the left hemifield.","1726":"The purpose of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes of Haemophilus influenzae Type b meningitis in a cohort of school-age survivors. Findings from an initial assessment at mean age 10 years revealed neuropsychological, achievement, and behavioral sequelae in the children with neurologic complications during the acute-phase illness (H. Taylor, C. Schatschneider, &amp; D. Rich, 1992). Here, the cohort was reassessed 1 and 2 years after the initial evaluation to investigate age-related influences on disease sequelae. After excluding children with hearing loss, the sample was divided into 2 groups: an affected group of 39 children with acute-phase neurologic complications and an unaffected group of 73 children without these complications. Growth-curve modeling showed poorer outcomes at the final assessment and less rapid improvement at follow-up for the affected group. Later age at assessment and later age at illness were associated with larger group differences in some outcomes. Results suggest that children with diffuse early brain insults are at risk for later-emerging sequelae.","1727":"The nociferous cortex hypothesis predicts that electrophysiological normalization to distal extratemporal brain regions following anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) will result in improvements in executive functioning. The present study examined the effects of seizure laterality and seizure control on executive function change. The authors administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Trails B, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test to 174 temporal lobe epilepsy patients who underwent ATL. No significant changes were found on the WCST or Trails B tests, regardless of surgery side or seizure-free status. However, verbal fluency significantly improved in seizure-free patients. Findings were consistent with the nociferous cortex hypothesis suggesting selective executive function improvement following ATL. These findings are discussed in terms of recent research demonstrating extrahippocampal metabolic normalization following surgery.","1728":"Standard neuropsychological tests administered in a constrained and artificial laboratory environment are often insensitive to the real-life deficits faced by patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Revised Strategy Application Test (R-SAT) creates an unstructured environment in the laboratory in which environmental cues and internal habits oppose the most efficient strategy, thus mimicking the real-life situations that are problematic for patients with TBI. In this study, R-SAT performance was related both to severity of TBI (i.e., depth of coma) sustained 2-3 years earlier and to quality of life outcome as assessed by the Sickness Impact Profile. This relationship held after accounting for variance attributable to TBI-related slowing and inattention. These findings support the validity of the R-SAT and suggest that behavioral correlates of quality of life outcome in TBI can be assessed in the laboratory with unstructured tasks.","1729":"The authors used a task-switching paradigm to investigate set shifting ability in schizophrenia. This paradigm included 2 choice reaction time (RT) tasks: up-down and right-left. Switching tasks were associated with costs (i.e., longer RT in task-switch trials than in task-repetition trials); patients responded more slowly than controls and suffered greater switching costs, were as efficient as controls in engaging in an upcoming task set, and were faster than controls in disengaging from the previous task set. There were indications that patients quickly forgot what each keypress indicated, making it necessary for them to acquire response meaning information anew in each trial. To test this notion, the authors subsequently tested normal participants in conditions in which response meaning information needed to be acquired anew in each trial. These participants produced a pattern of switching costs resembling that of patients. Results suggest that set switching difficulties in schizophrenia, as exhibited in the present paradigm, reflect poor memory for task context information.","1730":"Word-list learning was studied in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal control (NC) participants by means of the selective-reminding procedure of H. Buschke and P. A. Fuld (1974) in 3 learning conditions using semantically unrelated items; semantically related items, whose implicit categorical structure had to be spontaneously guessed; and semantically related items, whose explicit categorical structure was known in advance. The PD patients displayed poor learning in all 3 conditions. To identify the functional locus of the PD patients' deficits, the authors performed a stochastic Markov chain analysis, which allowed individual measurements of encoding, retrieval, and category clustering abilities. PD patients were never significantly impaired in encoding word engrams; their impairment was confined to automatic and intentional retrieval and to the ability to benefit from explicit semantic clues.","1731":"Four experiments examined new associative learning in amnesia by contrasting the performance of 2 amnesic participants-1 (C.C.) with basal forebrain damage and the other (R.H.) with medial temporal lobe damage--and 3 controls. Both amnesic individuals were severely impaired on explicit memory measures but showed intact perceptual priming. On the new associations measures, only C.C., not R.H., exhibited learning by producing correct targets (HIJACKER) in the absence of perceptual cues for them (e.g., STAFF shot ???). When the perceptual cue (e.g., MEDICINE cured _I_C_P) was provided, both C.C. and R.H. showed learning. Transfer to information containing conceptually related targets (e.g., TERRORIST or BELCH) was reliably observed only in C.C. This finding was replicated with further reduction in perceptual overlap across original (LIGHTNING torched JUNGLE) and transfer (LIGHTNING burned WILDERNESS) sentences. Together, these findings delineate the role of experimental conditions, severity of amnesia, and different neuroanatomical structures in mediating new verbal learning in amnesia.","1732":"Visuoconstructional ability was assessed by asking patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), ischaemic vascular dementia (IVD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) and a normal control group (NC) to copy a modification of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (M-ROCF). The drawings of the NC group were superior to all dementia participants. AD patients generally outperformed IVD and PD patients; however, there were few differences between IVD and PD groups. Nonetheless, the drawings of IVD and PD patients were very fragmented and contained numerous perseverations and omissions. Despite these errors, patients with IVD and PD obtained higher delayed recognition memory scores than AD patients. Correlational analyses among dementia patients between neuropsychological tests and the copy of the M-ROCF found that accurate figure copy was most consistently correlated with tests of working memory, that is, tests requiring patients to monitor their behavior and sustain a complex mental set while performing mental manipulations. By contrast, no relationship between executive function tests related to measures of response selection\/inhibition or other domains of neuropsychological functioning was found.","1733":"Heterogeneity of executive tasks has made it difficult to determine whether there are age-related declines in executive functioning. To address this issue, 112 individuals, 20-79 years old, took the California Trail Making Test (CTMT) and the California Stroop Test (CST), subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scale (D. C. Delis, E. Kaplan, &amp; J. H. Kramer, in press) that include measurement of component skills embedded in the executive function tasks. Multiple regression analyses revealed that after controlling for component skills, age had a significant effect on the executive requirement of the CST, namely speed on the interference condition. Age did not affect switching performance on the letter-number condition of the CTMT. Additional analyses revealed that age was significantly associated with commission of certain types of errors. This study confirms the importance of partialing out components in the assessment of multidimensional cognitive tasks, particularly when making age comparisons. It also emphasizes specificity over generalizability when examining the impact of age on cognition.","1734":"Visual search, characterized by eye fixation patterns, was examined in 8 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 8 cognitively intact, age-matched individuals, and 8 young control participants as they searched for a number among a nonlinear array of letters on a large computer screen. Among the 3 groups, target detection accuracy differed and detection time increased linearly. There were more fixations, and fixation duration was significantly longer in the AD patients than in the other 2 groups. These factors contributed to the lengthening of target detection time. This qualitative difference in the architecture of visual search between AD and aging may reflect a specific deficit in the disengagement of visual spatial attention, a prolongation of saccade initiation, or inefficiency in planning a search strategy.","1735":"Short, unfamiliar melodies were presented to young and older adults and to Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in an implicit and an explicit memory task. The explicit task was yes-no recognition, and the implicit task was pleasantness ratings, in which memory was shown by higher ratings for old versus new melodies (the mere exposure effect). Young adults showed retention of the melodies in both tasks. Older adults showed little explicit memory but did show the mere exposure effect. The AD patients showed neither. The authors considered and rejected several artifactual reasons for this null effect in the context of the many studies that have shown implicit memory among AD patients. As the previous studies have almost always used the visual modality for presentation, they speculate that auditory presentation, especially of nonverbal material, may be compromised in AD because of neural degeneration in auditory areas in the temporal lobes.","1736":"Lexical-semantic function was investigated in 10 participants with lesions of the dominant nonthalamic subcortical (NS) region and a matched normal control group. Participants performed speeded lexical decisions on the 3rd member of auditorily presented word triplets. The 4 critical triplet conditions were concordant (coin-bank-money), discordant (river-bank-money), neutral (day-bank-money), and unrelated (river-day-money). When the interstimulus interval (ISI) between the words in the triplets was 100 ms, patients with NS lesions obtained priming that indicated nonselective lexical access; at 1,250-ms ISI, however, there was no significant priming effect. This pattern of results is consistent with the view that patients with NS lesions can automatically access lexical-semantic information but may be unable to sustain lexical activation through controlled or attentional forms of processing.","1737":"A battery of tests was administered to 17 patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and 17 normal controls to investigate the effect of prenatal androgen exposure on cerebral lateralization and cognitive performance. Individuals were compared on measures of hand preference, verbal and performance IQ, and temporal processing asymmetry. A higher incidence of left-handedness was found among CAH participants. CAH individuals exhibited higher performance IQs as opposed to verbal IQs. Temporal processing asymmetries were investigated using an auditory gap detection task. Measures of reaction time and response error revealed a right-ear, therefore left-hemisphere, advantage for gap detection. This right-ear advantage did not differ between CAH individuals and controls. Results partially support the hypothesis that prenatal androgen exposure causes a shift in cerebral lateralization toward right-hemisphere dominance.","1738":"Brain areas active in generating usual (typical) or unusual (atypical) noun-verb relations were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Seven adults generated the 1st verb to come to mind (usual verb) in response to novel and repeated nouns (priming test) and then generated either an unusual verb or the 1st verb to come to mind in response to novel nouns (unusual test). The left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC) and right cerebellum were more active when generating usual verbs to novel nouns than to repeated nouns. When participants generated unusual verbs, there was no increased activation in LIPC, but there was increased activity in the right middle and superior frontal gyri, left middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellum. Results support theories that the right hemisphere is involved in the processing of distant associations that may be useful in creative thought and problem solving.","1739":"To evaluate the functional neuroanatomies underlying letter and category fluency, 18 normal controls were studied with oxygen-15 water regional cerebral blood flow positron emission tomography. Three counterbalanced conditions each consisted of 6 trials (45 s each): letter fluency (generating words when cued with a particular letter), semantic fluency (generating words when cued with a particular category), and a control condition (generating days of the week and months of the year). Relative to the control, participants activated similar brain regions during both fluency tasks, including the anterior cingulate, left prefrontal regions, thalamus, and cerebellum; reductions were found in parietal and temporal regions. In a direct comparison of the 2 fluency tasks, inferior frontal cortex and temporoparietal cortex (hypothesized to participate in a phonologic loop for accessing word pronunciation) were activated more during letter than semantic fluency, whereas left temporal cortex (associated with access to semantic storage) was activated more during semantic than letter fluency. This study identifies subtle differences in the neural networks underlying letter and semantic fluency that may underlie the dissociation of these abilities in patients.","1740":"The authors used magnetic resonance imaging to measure gray and white matter volumes in cerebellar hemispheres and 4 vermian regions in 61 normal control (NC) men aged 23-72 years, 25 men with uncomplicated alcoholism (ALC), and 8 men and 1 woman with alcoholic Korsakoff s syndrome (KS). NC and ALC took quantitative gait and balance tests. Gray but not white matter volume declined with normal age in both hemispheres and anterior-superior vermis. ALC had gray but not white matter cerebellar hemisphere volume deficits, whereas KS had deficits in both tissue types. ALC and KS had gray and white matter volume deficits in anterior superior but not posterior inferior vermis. ALC had a 1 SD ataxia deficit, significantly and selectively correlated with white matter volume in anterior superior vermis. Regional distribution but not severity of cerebellar volume deficits is similar in alcoholic individuals whether or not complicated by KS and relates to ataxia.","1741":"The aims of this study were to examine and compare perceptual and conceptual implicit memory (CIM) in Huntington's disease (HD) and to characterize the relationship between tests of frontal lobe functioning and CIM. Sixteen HD patients and 16 normal controls completed structurally parallel tests of perceptual implicit memory and CIM (i.e., rhyme and category exemplar generation), tests of explicit memory, and verbal fluency. HD patients showed intact implicit memory for both rhyme and category exemplars, despite evidence of frontal dysfunction on other tests. An unexpected finding was that patients showed a deficit in cued rhyme generation that correlated with severity of neurological impairment. The authors replicated findings in controls of a correlation between letter fluency and CIM but found no relationship in patients. Frontal dysfunction in HD may lessen the influence of generative strategies on tests of CIM without compromising performance.","1742":"Attentional problems are a common sequelae of closed-head injury (CHI). Research in the area of selective attention has pointed to the role of inhibitory mechanisms in the suppression of irrelevant information. In the current study, a negative priming paradigm was used to assess the inhibitory mechanisms of individuals suffering from a severe CHI. Twenty participants with severe CHIs (greater than 1 year postinjury) and 20 matched controls completed a negative priming task, as well as several other standardized tests of cognitive functioning. Within the negative priming task, 2 conditions were used to elicit information regarding facilitation by attended and ignored information and 1 condition was used to elicit inhibition of ignored information, as compared with a neutral control condition. Despite poorer performances on several tests of attention, there were no significant differences in the amount of inhibition displayed by the CHI participants as compared with the controls. Findings suggest that inhibitory processing deficits may not underlie the selective attention difficulties commonly seen following a severe CHI.","1743":"Groups of normal old and young adults made episodic memory feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgments and took 2 types of episodic memory tests (cued recall and recognition). Neuropsychological tests of executive and memory functions thought to respectively involve the frontal and medial temporal structures were also administered. Age differences were observed on the episodic memory measures and on all neuropsychological tests. Compared with young adults, older adults performed at chance level on FOK accuracy judgments. Partial correlations indicated that a composite measure of frontal functioning and FOK accuracy were closely related. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the composite frontal functioning score accounted for a large proportion of the age-related variance in FOK accuracy. This finding supports the idea that the age-related decline in episodic memory FOK accuracy is mainly the result of executive or frontal limitations associated with aging.","1744":"Location precues were used to manipulate the spatial scale of attention in visual search for a target in an array of letters in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and in age-matched older controls. Cue size varied in the amount of spatial precision conferred. Scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, decreased overall arousal and broadened spatial attention after a precise precue (small and valid) to target location for DAT patients but not for controls, suggesting a selective effect for attentional impairment induced by cholinergic blockade. In contrast, physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, did not alter the distribution of spatial attention relative to no-drug baseline testing for patients. Results support a differential role for cholinergic mechanisms in the modulation of the spatial scale of visual attention.","1745":"The authors examined false recognition of semantic associates in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), older adults, and young adults using a paradigm that provided rates of false recognition after single and multiple exposures to word lists. Using corrected false recognition scores to control for unrelated false alarms, the authors found that (a) the level of false recognition after a single list exposure was lower in AD patients than in controls; (b) across 5 trials, false recognition increased in AD patients, decreased in young adults, and showed a fluctuating pattern in older adults; and (c) all groups showed an increase in true recognition over the 5 trials. Analyses suggested that AD patients built up semantic gist across trials, whereas both control groups were able to use increased item-specific recollection and more conservative response criteria to suppress gist-based false alarms.","1746":"Content and contextual memory for remote public figures and events was assessed with a modified version of the Presidents Test in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Contributions of executive functioning, semantic memory, and explicit anterograde memory to remote memory abilities were also examined. The AD group had temporally extensive deficits in content and contextual remote memory not accountable for by dementia severity. The PD group did not differ from the control group in remote memory, despite anterograde memory impairment. These results support the position that different component processes characterize remote memory, various mnemonic and nonmnemonic cognitive processes contribute to remote memory performance, and anterograde and remote memory processes are dissociable and differentially disrupted by neurodegenerative disease.","1747":"This investigation examined how hemispheric asymmetry and interhemispheric processing contribute to attentional biases toward emotional information. Participants (n = 88) named the color of lateralized squares presented concurrently with neutral, positive, or threatening words. A left-hemisphere advantage in color naming was reduced when distractors were emotional, suggesting right-hemisphere priming by emotional stimuli. Furthermore, the advantage of dividing the word and color across visual fields was increased for emotion words when they were frequently presented, indicating a strategic use of interhemispheric division of labor to reduce the distracting effect of emotional words. Finally, participants with high levels of anxious apprehension were most likely to make use of this interhemispheric processing strategy, supporting a processing efficiency theory of cognitive function in anxiety.","1748":"Cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) could be explained by a central executive (CE) deficit in A. D. Baddeley's (1986) working memory model. To test this hypothesis, verbal, spatial, and double span tasks were given to 12 medicated PD patients and control participants, with varying recall delays. The double span task was assigned to explore the coordinating and integrating function of the CE, and lengthening the recall delay was expected to implicate more attentional resources. PD patients had lower spans relative to controls in all tasks. However, the more specific implication of the CE was difficult to prove. One reason could be that PD patients were on dopaminergic treatment when tested. To control this effect, 12 PD patients on and off medication were studied in a second experiment using the same tasks. PD patients off medication had lower spans only in the double task; this result underlines the role of dopamine on working memory processes.","1749":"Contrary findings notwithstanding, the prevailing notion is that recognition memory is little affected by Parkinson's disease (PD). Both a power analysis and a meta-analysis were conducted to help clarify the degree of recognition memory deficit associated with PD. The power analysis confirmed that, in general, memory studies of PD participants have been underpowered. This analysis indicated the need to pool study results in a subsequent meta-analysis, the main finding of which was that recognition memory deficits do occur with PD. The largest deficit occurs in PD participants with dementia. Nevertheless, deficits also occur in PD participants without dementia on medication, but nondopaminergic central nervous system abnormalities are more likely to underlie this deficit than PD medication itself. Future development of a theory of cognitive dysfunction in PD should take into account these recognition memory deficits, which may increase with disease progression.","1750":"Cerebral white matter of asymptomatic people frequently exhibits circumscribed areas of hyperintensity on magnetic resonance (MR) images and hypodensity on computed tomography scans. However, behavioral implications of this phenomenon remain unclear. In this meta-analysis, the authors examine cumulative evidence regarding the cognitive sequelae of white matter abnormalities in adults without dementia. The influence of potential moderator variables, such as neuroimaging technique, location of the lesions, rating scale, and demographic characteristics of the sample on the association between the burden of white matter hyperintensities and cognitive performance was also examined. Results indicate that white matter abnormalities observed on MR images are associated with attenuated performance on tasks of processing speed, immediate and delayed memory, executive functions, and indices of global cognitive functioning. There was no significant link between the white matter hyperintensities and psychometric indices of intelligence or fine motor performance.","1751":"Item response theory (IRT) methods were used to develop a neuropsychological test battery with matched English and Spanish language forms. Candidate items for 12 scales measuring core neuropsychological abilities were generated and administered to 200 community-dwelling elderly participants tested in Spanish and 208 tested in English. IRT methods were used to eliminate linguistically biased items and refine scales to assess broad ability ranges. Reasonably good psychometric matching of scales was achieved within and across English and Spanish language forms. All scales were sensitive to cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), with highly similar relationships between scale scores and MMSE across English and Spanish groups. The outcome supports the use of IRT methods in cross-cultural and multilingual test development and indicates that this strategy has potential for future neuropsychological test development.","1752":"Structural equation modeling (specifically, analysis of moment structures; J. L. Arbuckle, 1996) was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model of components of attention (A. F. Mirsky, B. J. Anthony, C. C. Duncan, M. B. Aheam, &amp; S. G. Kellam, 1991) to neuropsychological test data from 2 samples. One sample consisted of psychiatrically normal persons with and without sleep-disordered breathing, and the other sample consisted of the adults studied by A. F. Mirsky et al. (1991), who gave rise to this model. That sample included psychiatric patients as well as normals. An exploratory data reduction procedure, principal-components analysis, suggested that attention might be conceptualized as composed of 4 independent elements or components: focus-execute, sustain, shift, and encode. Neither the proposed orthogonal model nor a model permitting correlated factors adequately fit either data set, suggesting that these 4 attention constructs are as yet not clearly validated in the measures used to assess them.","1753":"IQ decrements following cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are most apparent years after treatment. The authors examined a developmental model for delayed deficits by evaluating the relationship between processing speed, working memory, and IQ in long-term survivors of childhood ALL (n = 27) compared with demographically matched controls (n = 27). The ALL group treated with CRT showed deficits in IQ, working memory, and processing speed relative to controls. Differences in IQ between the CRT group and controls were mediated by differences in working memory. Processing speed did not fully account for the working memory deficit in the CRT group. Participants with ALL treated only with chemotherapy showed similar working memory and processing speed as matched controls. Data suggest that deficits in processing speed and working memory following CRT may underlie declines in IQ.","1754":"Chronic alcoholism is associated with cognitive and motor deficits, and there is evidence for reversibility with sobriety. Alcoholic men were examined after 1 month of sobriety and 2 to 12 months later with cognitive and motor tests and magnetic resonance imaging. In this naturalistic study, 20 alcoholic participants had abstained and 22 had resumed drinking at retesting. Abstainers sustained greater improvement than relapsers on tests of delayed recall of drawings, visuospatial function, attention, gait, and balance. Shrinkage in 3rd ventricle volume across all participants significantly correlated with improvement in nonverbal short-term memory. Additional brain structure-function relationships, most involving short-term memory, were observed when analyses were restricted to alcoholic men who had maintained complete abstinence, were light relapsers for at least 3 months, or had consumed no more than 10 drinks prior to follow-up testing. Thus, alcoholic men who maintain abstinence can show substantial functional improvement that is related to improvement in brain structure condition.","1755":"The diagnostic accuracy of 4 approaches to interpreting neuropsychological test results are evaluated in 672 cognitively normal and 407 cognitively impaired persons using the Mayo Cognitive Factor Scales (G. E. Smith et al., 1994). The interpretation approaches studied are absolute scores, difference scores, profile variability, and change scores at 1- to 2-year test-retest intervals. All dependent measures were \"highly significant\" when diagnostic groups were compared on null hypothesis significance testing analyses. In contrast, varied accuracy rates were obtained when each measure's ability to correctly classify individuals was evaluated relative to overall diagnostic accuracy. Odds ratios were also highly varied and ranged from &lt; or = 1.0 (i.e., chance) to 34.9. The clinical usefulness of absolute scores and difference scores in data interpretation is supported. Neither profile variability measures nor measures of change over time were diagnostically useful.","1756":"There is evidence that nonverbal memory problems in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are mediated by impaired strategic processing. Although many studies have found verbal memory to be normal in OCD, these studies did not use tests designed to stress organizational strategies. This study examined verbal and nonverbal memory performance in 33 OCD patients and 30 normal control participants with the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test and the California Verbal Learning Test. OCD patients were impaired on verbal and nonverbal measures of organizational strategy and free recall. Multiple regression modeling indicated that free recall problems in OCD were mediated by impaired organizational strategies used during learning trials. Therefore, verbal and nonverbal episodic memory deficits in OCD are affected by impaired strategic processing. Results are consistent with neurobiological models proposing frontal-striatal system dysfunction in OCD.","1757":"L. J. Fuentes, A. B. Vivas, and G. W. Humphreys (1999b) showed that stimulus processing is affected when stimuli are presented to locations subject to inhibition of return. They argued that activated representations of stimuli presented at inhibited locations are disconnected from their associated responses through an \"inhibitory tagging\" mechanism occurring in inhibition of return. In the present research, the authors asked whether such a mechanism is affected in people with schizophrenia. Healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia performed a Stroop task in an inhibition of return paradigm. Healthy adults showed a reduction in the Stroop interference when stimuli were presented at inhibited locations, a result that agrees with the inhibitory tagging mechanism hypothesis and replicates previous findings. However, patients with schizophrenia did not show such a reduction, a result suggesting that they have a deficit in inhibitory processing occurring in inhibition of return.","1758":"Little is known about the impact of feedback on the reaction times (RTs) of brain-damaged (BD) patients. The authors therefore investigated the effect of positive and negative feedback on these patients, using a 4-choice RT task. Participants were 107 BD patients with different etiologies and 50 orthopedic (OG) control patients. Patients were assigned to 3 groups in which performance-independent negative, positive, and no feedback were given. Statistical analysis showed that negative feedback led to significantly shorter RTs in BD patients. Even BD patients with high depression scores were affected by negative feedback. In contrast, negative feedback had no impact on the RTs of the OG controls, and positive feedback had no influence on the RTs of any group. These results raise some interesting questions about motivational processes in BD patients.","1759":"Verbal pragmatic aspects of discourse production were examined in 16 right brain-damaged (RBD), 16 left brain-damaged (LBD), and 16 normal control right-handed adults. The facilitation effect of emotional content, valence hypothesis, and relationship between pragmatics and emotion were evaluated. Participants produced monologues while recollecting emotional and nonemotional experiences. Transcribed monologues were rated for appropriateness on 6 pragmatic features: conciseness, lexical selection, quantity, relevancy, specificity, and topic maintenance. Overall, brain-damaged groups were rated as significantly less appropriate than normals. Consistent with the facilitation effect, emotional content enhanced pragmatic performance of LBD aphasic participants yet suppressed performance of RBD participants. Contrary to the valence hypothesis, RBD participants were more impaired for positive emotions and LBD participants for negative emotions. Pragmatic appropriateness was not strongly correlated with a measure of emotional intensity.","1760":"The Trail Making Test (TMT; R. M. Reitan, 1958, 1992) is extensively used in research in neuropsychology and in aging, in part because it has been postulated to reflect executive processes, such as planning and switching. However, neurocognitive and individual-difference-based analyses of this test are complicated because of different spatial arrangements of targets, the use of letters only in Version B, and potential order effects when Version A is administered prior to Version B. The present article examines a variant of a TMT (called the Connections Test) that attempts to remedy these deficiencies. A structural equation model suggested that there were no direct effects of age on either the nonalternating or alternating versions of the Connections Test (analogous to TMT Versions A and B, respectively); rather, all age-related effects were mediated through effects on perceptual speed. Moreover, although the nonalternating and alternating versions were strongly related to one another, only the latter had significant independent relations with measures of higher order cognition.","1761":"In the present study, the authors examined age effects in memory for nonverbal material. A picture fragment completion task was used to test explicit and implicit memory in a younger and an older group. Explicit memory was indexed by free recall of pictures, whereas implicit memory was indexed by perceptual learning (priming). Both free recall and perceptual learning performance were found to be impaired in the older group. A measure of executive functioning was found to be predictive of both explicit and implicit memory.","1762":"Emotional arousal is associated with enhanced memory in neurologically intact individuals, but it is unknown whether this effect is obtained in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study compared emotional memory and emotional reactions in patients with early AD and in older controls. Participants viewed emotionally arousing (both pleasant and unpleasant) and neutral photographs while cognitive and electrophysiological reactions were assessed. Memory was tested by free recall and recognition. Emotional reactions were normal in the AD group, but the emotional memory effect (enhanced memory for emotional vs. neutral stimuli) was impaired. Recall results indicated that this effect was normal for pleasant stimuli but abnormal for unpleasant stimuli. These results suggest that the neural basis for the emotional memory effect may be disrupted in AD. Findings are discussed in terms of the role of the amygdala in mediating emotional memory.","1763":"The level of testosterone exposure in early brain development may influence the direction or degree of cerebral language lateralization. Possible links between individual differences in testosterone levels and patterns of speech representation were investigated in 180 healthy young adults (97 left handed, 83 right handed) using the Fused Dichotic Words Test (T. Halwes, 1991). Among left-handed participants, significantly higher testosterone concentrations were observed in individuals with a left-ear advantage on dichotic listening than in individuals with a right-ear advantage. Among right-handed participants, the pattern of group differences in testosterone tended to be reversed, resulting in a statistically significant interaction. Results extend prior findings by S. D. Moffat and E. Hampson (1996a) and raise the possibility that higher testosterone is associated with patterns of brain organization in which speech and praxic functions are lateralized to the same hemisphere.","1764":"Three cases of callosal agenesis (a 39-year-old woman and her 11- and 12-year-old daughters) were tested on their ability to integrate visual information between the visual hemifields. They were all able to name colors and digits in either hemifield with high accuracy and were able to decide whether letters or digits in opposite hemifields were the same or different. They had greater difficulty deciding whether colors in opposite hemifields were the same or different. When shown 6-letter words made up of pairs of 3-letter words that straddled the midline (e.g., MANAGE, ROTATE), they responded to them as whole words and never as 3-letter words, suggesting perceptual continuity across the midline, at least for verbal material. The most likely interpretation is that the integration of form, but not color, is achieved through the intact anterior commissure in these participants.","1765":"Three experiments were designed to examine whether task complexity determines the degree to which a division of processing across the hemispheres (i.e., across-hemisphere processing) underlies performance when within- and across-hemisphere processing are equally possible. When task complexity was relatively low, performance in a midline condition that allowed for either within- or across-hemispheric processing resembled within-hemisphere performance (Experiments 1 and 2). However, when task complexity was high, performance in a midline condition (Experiments 1 and 2) and a lateralized condition, which also allowed for either within- or across-hemisphere processing (Experiment 3), resembled across-hemisphere performance. Results complement and extend prior work (e.g., M. T. Banich &amp; A. Belger, 1990) by indicating that the degree to which interhemispheric cooperation underlies performance changes with the complexity of the task being performed. This finding suggests that the hemispheres dynamically couple or uncouple their processing as a function of task complexity.","1766":"This study examined the relationships between regional brain volumes and semantic, phonological, and nonverbal fluency in 32 participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Object but not animal semantic fluency correlated with frontal and temporal gray matter volumes. Phonological fluency was not significantly associated with any brain volume examined. Nonverbal fluency was selectively associated with bilateral frontal gray matter volumes. Hippocampal volumes, although markedly reduced in these patients, were not related to any of the fluency measures. Results lend evidence to the importance of the frontal lobes in the directed generation of nonverbal and verbal exemplars by AD patients. Furthermore, both left- and right-hemisphere regions contribute to the generation of verbal and nonverbal exemplars.","1767":"Competing visual stimuli lead to slower responses to targets. This response competition must be resolved before correct responses are executed. Neuroimaging suggests that response competition monitoring may be subserved by an integrated neural network including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In this study, 1 patient with a parietal lesion (Patient J.S.) and 1 with an ACC lesion (Patient G.M.) were presented with 2 flanker tasks; 1 required verbal identification of color targets, and the other required an opposite response to targets (e.g., see red and say \"green\"); a control group was also tested. For controls, perceptually incongruent flankers interfered with the ability to inhibit prepotent responses to targets. Patient J.S. performed in a similar manner, even when flankers appeared in the neglected field. Patient G.M. demonstrated reduced interference effects for contralesional flankers. Results are discussed in terms of goal-directed selective attention and response competition monitoring.","1768":"Damage to the hippocampus and medial temporal (MT) structures can lead to anterograde amnesia and may also impair latent learning, in which prior exposure to cues affects their subsequent associability. Normally, latent learning may reflect both representational and attentional mechanisms. Prior work has suggested that individuals with MT amnesia have specific deficits in representational processing; thus, latent learning that invokes primarily representational mechanisms might be especially impaired in MT amnesia. The current results provide preliminary confirmation of this prediction. In Experiment 1, a latent learning paradigm expected to invoke representational mechanisms was impaired in individuals with MT amnesia, whereas in Experiment 2, a paradigm expected to invoke other attentional mechanisms was spared in individuals with MT amnesia. This suggests the representational and attentional components of latent learning are dissociable and differentially affected in anterograde amnesia.","1769":"The authors examined the relationships between gestational maturity, perinatal hypoxic risk, and intellectual outcome in early school-age children. The sample was composed of 48 children whose arterial pH obtained within 3 hr after delivery was between 7.3 (the lower end of the normal range) and 7.1 (the lower end of the moderately acidotic range). Gestational maturity did not account for a significant proportion of variance in outcome, whereas arterial pH was found to be significantly related to subsequent intellectual performance. The observed relationship between peripartum arterial pH and cognitive performance is especially noteworthy because the arterial pH range was restricted. The authors conclude that a \"dose-response\" relationship can be observed between arterial pH and intellectual outcome at early school age, even when the lower end of the acidotic range is truncated above the pH level that is thought to reflect severe asphyxia neonatorum.","1770":"The impact of verbal and visuospatial ability on sex differences in episodic memory was investigated. One hundred men and 100 women, 2040 years old, participated in a series of verbal and visuospatial tasks. Episodic memory was assessed in tasks that, to a greater or lesser extent, were verbal or visuospatial in nature. Results showed that women excelled in verbal production tasks and that men performed at a superior level on a mental rotation task. In addition, women tended to perform at a higher level than men on most episodic memory tasks. Taken together, the results demonstrated that (a) women perform at a higher level than men on most verbal episodic memory tasks and on some episodic memory tasks with a visuospatial component, and (b) women's higher performance on episodic memory tasks cannot fully be explained by their superior performance on verbal production tasks.","1771":"Mild head trauma is often complicated by a persistent set of symptoms known as postconcussion syndrome (PCS). Past research has suggested that an expectancy-guided, retrospective-recall bias may account for much of the variance in PCS symptom reporting. The present study examined the influence of symptom expectations on mild head trauma symptom reports among participants in contact sports. Head-injured athletes reported symptom rates that did not differ from those of uninjured athletes but consistently underestimated the preinjury incidence of symptoms. Athletes with no head trauma history overestimated the expected degree of pre- to postinjury change in symptom status. Results suggest that individuals with mild head injury tend to overestimate postconcussion symptom change in a manner consistent with their symptom expectations. A cognitive-behavioral model that explains the persistence of PCS is proposed.","1772":"Individuals with specific reading disability (SRD) may exhibit visual psychophysical abnormalities that include prolonged visual persistence, decreased luminance contrast sensitivity, lower flicker fusion thresholds, abnormal metacontrast masking, and lower motion detection sensitivity. These abnormalities could result from impairment of the magnocellular division of the visual afferent pathway to the cortex. The authors predicted that an impairment of this pathway would also cause abnormalities in ability to localize visual stimuli. This prediction was tested in 2 experiments. Results of both experiments showed that adults who reported a history of SRD and who currently had lower reading performance were less able than non-SRD participants to report the locations of small visual stimuli that were briefly flashed at positions similar to the ends of lines of text.","1773":"The striatum is thought to play an essential role in the acquisition of a wide range of motor, perceptual, and cognitive skills, but neuroimaging has not yet demonstrated striatal activation during nonmotor skill learning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed while participants learned probabilistic classification, a cognitive task known to rely on procedural memory early in learning and declarative memory later in learning. Multiple brain regions were active during probabilistic classification compared with a perceptual-motor control task, including bilateral frontal cortices, occipital cortex, and the right caudate nucleus in the striatum. The left hippocampus was less active bilaterally during probabilistic classification than during the control task, and the time course of this hippocampal deactivation paralleled the expected involvement of medial temporal structures based on behavioral studies of amnesic patients. Findings provide initial evidence for the role of frontostriatal systems in normal cognitive skill learning.","1774":"Although memory deficits are associated with major depressive disorder, few studies have identified which patient characteristics predict impairment. Because recurrent depression appears related to more severe cerebral dysfunction, the present study tested whether recurrent depressed individuals have worse memory function than first-episode depressed individuals. Two groups of young-adult, nonpsychotic, depressed inpatients (20 single episode [SE] and 46 recurrent episode [RE]) were administered the California Verbal Learning Test within a broader battery of neuropsychological tests. The groups were equivalent in age, education, estimated IQ, severity of depression, and demographic composition. The RE group demonstrated memory deficits relative to both the SE group and published norms, but no other significant difference was found across the battery. Data indicate that abnormal memory performance is associated with recurrent depression, whereas memory deficits are not prominent in first-episode depressed individuals.","1775":"Recent research has shown that depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with deficits on cognitively demanding tasks. One explanation for this relationship is that depressed MS patients may have reduced working memory capacity. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis. Depressed MS patients were compared with nondepressed MS patients and nondepressed healthy controls on a task of working memory capacity (reading span) and a short-term memory task not taxing working memory capacity (word span). In support of the capacity-reduction model, compared with the nondepressed groups, depressed MS patients performed significantly worse on reading span (p&lt;.001) but not on word span. Additionally, reading span was significantly correlated with capacity-demanding tasks shown to be impaired in depressed MS patients in previous reports. Results suggest that depressed MS patients are characterized by limited working memory capacity and that the central executive component of the working memory system may be most affected.","1776":"A group of young participants were compared with 2 groups of older participants (young-old, 65-74 years and old-old, 75 years or over) on a range of frontal lobe tasks. They were also assessed on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a test of digit cancellation (DC), the AH4 test of fluid intelligence, and the National Adult Reading Test (NART)-a measure of crystalized intelligence. Reliable age differences on all frontal measures except word fluency (FAS) were found. However, age effects were radically attenuated when either DSST speed or Alice Heim 4 (AH4) performance was used as a covariate. In contrast, DC and NART attenuated age-related variance to a much lesser degree. The authors conclude that a large proportion of age-related variance on measures of frontal lobe function may be attributed to a more general factor characterized jointly by DSST and AH4 performance.","1777":"In a population-based study of persons between 75 and 96 years of age, normal old adults (n = 296), patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 45), and patients with concomitant AD and depression (AD-D; n = 9) were compared on free recall and recognition of slowly and rapidly presented words and digit span. With the exception of forward digit span, the normal old group outperformed the 2 AD groups across all tasks. In free recall, only the normal old group performed better as task pacing decreased; however, all groups benefited from more study time in recognition. This suggests that both AD and AD-D patients have deficits in the ability to use more study time for remembering. Of most importance, the 2 AD groups were indistinguishable for all task variables. This lack of comorbidity effects is discussed relative to the view that depression, much like many other individual-difference variables that affect memory performance in normal aging, may be overshadowed by the influence of the neurodegenerative process in AD.","1778":"Two characteristics of word-list generation performance are forming clusters (i.e., contiguous words from the same subcategory) and switching among them. Patients with frontal lobe pathology show reduced switching on letter-cued word generation tasks, and clustering has been associated with temporal lobe functioning. Letter-cued word generation was examined in 72 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 41 healthy participants of equivalent age and education. As predicted, the patients showed reduced switching but normal clustering. In addition, switching but not clustering correlated inversely with disease severity, as measured by both movement and mental status scales. Furthermore, 5-year longitudinal analysis revealed a monotonic decrease in switching over time, whereas clustering performance remained stable. Control participants performed uniformly over time on both measures. These results are consistent with a progressive reduction in cognitive flexibility attributed to disruption of frontal-subcortical circuits secondary to neostriatal pathology in HD.","1779":"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy control participants performed 2 conceptual repetition priming tasks, word-associate production and category-exemplar production. Both tasks had identical study-phases of reading target words aloud, had the most common responses as target items, and required production of a single response. Patients with AD showed normal priming on word-associate production but impaired priming on category-exemplar production. This dissociation in AD suggests that conceptual priming is not a unitary form of memory but rather is mediated by separable memory systems.","1780":"Four experiments explored the effects of specific language characteristics on hemispheric functioning in reading nonwords using a lateralized trigram identification task. Previous research using nonsense consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) trigrams has shown that total error scores reveal a right visual field (RVF) advantage in Hebrew, Japanese, and English. Qualitative error patterns have shown that the right hemisphere uses a sequential strategy, whereas the left hemisphere uses a more parallel strategy in English but shows the opposite pattern in Hebrew. Experiment 1 tested whether this is due to the test language or to the native language of the participants. Results showed that native language had a stronger effect on hemispheric strategies than test language. Experiment 2 showed that latency to target letters in the CVCs revealed the same asymmetry as qualitative errors for Hebrew speakers but not for English speakers and that exposure duration of the stimuli affected misses differentially according to letter position. Experiment 3 used number trigrams to equate reading conventions in the 2 languages. Qualitative error scores still revealed opposing asymmetry patterns. Experiments 1-3 used vertical presentations. Experiment 4 used horizontal presentation, which eliminated sequential processing in both hemispheres in Hebrew speakers, whereas English speakers still showed sequential processing in both hemispheres. Comparison of the 2 presentations suggests that stimulus arrangement affected qualitative errors in the left visual field but not the RVF for English speakers and in both visual fields for Hebrew speakers. It is suggested that these differences result from orthographic and morphological differences between the languages: Reading Hebrew requires attention to be deployed to all the constituents of the stimulus in parallel, whereas reading English allows sequential processing of the letters in both hemispheres. Implications of cross-language studies for models of hemispheric function are discussed.","1781":"Cognitive mechanisms of semantic priming in individuals with intact cerebral hemispheres were studied using the visual half-field method and lexical-decision tasks. In Experiment 1, unidirectionally associated word pairs were presented in a forward direction (e.g., BEAVER-TAIL) to isolate priming attributable to automatic activation or expectancy-based processing. Forward priming was restricted to the right visual field-left hemisphere, and it occurred only when expectancy-based processing was encouraged in the instructions. Experiments 2 and 3 found backward priming (e.g., TAIL-BEAVER) only in the left visual field, indicating that the right hemisphere contributes to retrospective semantic matching of the target back to the prime. The results suggest that the 2 hemispheres have different roles in controlled processing of semantic relations.","1782":"Recent visual laterality studies have included trials in which critical stimulus information is presented simultaneously in both visual half-fields and, thereby, simultaneously to both cerebral hemispheres. To investigate interhemispheric interaction, researchers compare performance on bilateral redundant trials with performance on unilateral trials in which a single copy of the target is presented to one hemisphere or the other. The authors used the identification of nonword letter trigrams to examine the relationship between unilateral and bilateral performance when the 2 types of trials were equated for the number of locations stimulated (Experiment 1) and the number of redundant copies of the target (Experiment 2). Results suggest that when the number of stimulated locations is held constant, each of 2 copies of a target stimulus can be processed with the same efficiency and the same strategy as it would have been had it been the only copy.","1783":"Source memory, in comparison with item memory, is more sensitive to frontal lesions and may require more strategic processing. Divided attention was used to restrict attentional resources and strategic processing on memory tasks. Participants encoded and retrieved items (i.e., words) and source (i.e., voice or spatial location) while concurrently performing a finger-tapping (FT) or visual reaction-time (VRT) task. Memory accuracy costs under divided attention were greater for retrieval of source than item and were greater with VRT than FT. Similarly, costs to the secondary task were greater when concurrently retrieving source as opposed to item and were greater for VRT than FT. Effects were stronger when spatial location was used as the source task. Findings support the idea that processing source information requires more attentional resources and effort than processing item information. Furthermore, concurrent performance of VRT produced greater interference with a task that was more dependent on intact frontal functioning and better simulated the performance of patients with frontal dysfunction.","1784":"Two laboratory measures of competitive information processing were studied in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and normal control participants to assess the effects of priming and interfering information on response latency or speed. In the visuospatial priming (VSP) task, key press latency is facilitated or inhibited, depending on the spatial location of a priming cue. In the Stroop task, participants name the ink color of printed words that have an interfering semantic value. OCD participants displayed significantly slowed baseline response latency and increased facilitory priming scores in the VSP task, with no significant difference in VSP inhibition compared with control participants. Higher interference cost in the Stroop task was also observed in OCD participants. Clinical associations between VSP and Stroop performance and specific OCD symptoms were examined. Increased VSP facilitation was most pronounced in OCD participants who reported a history of violent images, tics, \"just right\" obsessions, or checking compulsions.","1785":"Because it is theorized that depression results in reduced available attentional capacity that, in turn, can explain the impaired performance on capacity-demanding tasks in depressed individuals, the authors predicted that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with depressed mood would have difficulty with these types of tasks. Twenty depressed mood MS participants were compared with 41 nondepressed mood MS participants and 8 nondepressed mood controls on 5 attentional capacity-demanding clinical memory and attentional tasks and 3 tasks with minimal capacity demands. Depressed mood MS patients performed significantly worse than both nondepressed mood groups on the 3 speeded capacity-demanding attentional measures but not on any of the tasks requiring few capacity demands, supporting the authors' predictions. The possibility that the impaired performance of depressed mood MS patients on speeded attentional tasks was mediated by reduced verbal working memory capacity, impaired deployment of executive strategies that access working memory capacity, or psychomotor slowing is explored.","1786":"Spectral analysis of the electrophysiological output at a single, midline prefrontal location (the vertex) was conducted in 482 individuals, ages 6-30 years old, to test the hypothesis that cortical slowing in the prefrontal region can serve as a basis for differentiating patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from nonclinical control groups. Participants were classified into 3 groups (ADHD, inattentive; ADHD, combined; and control) on the basis of the results of a standardized clinical interview, behavioral rating scales, and a continuous performance test. Quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) findings indicated significant maturational effects in cortical arousal in the prefrontal cortex as well as evidence of cortical slowing in both ADHD groups, regardless of age or sex. Sensitivity of the QEEG-derived attentional index was 86%; specificity was 98%. These findings constituted a positive initial test of a QEEG-based neurometric test for use in the assessment of ADHD.","1787":"De novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients identified presence or absence of a unique shape presented with homogeneous distractors. Response time (RT) was examined as a function of prior experience with target and\/or distractor assessing latent inhibition (LI; slower RTs to a target that was formerly a distractor against a background of distractors that were formerly targets as compared with a novel target with distractors that were formerly targets) and novel pop-out effects. PD patients were slower than controls in detecting test-phase targets compared with preexposure-phase targets. Female PD patients with right-side motor symptoms had elevated LI compared with female controls and female PD patients with left-side symptoms. Male PD patients with right-side symptoms did not exhibit LI. Results are discussed in terms of the dopamine hypothesis and the reciprocal relationship between PD and schizophrenia.","1788":"In 2 dichotic listening experiments, 96 normal right-handed adults attended selectively to the left and right ear and divided their attention equally between both ears. Participants listened for specified targets and reported the ear of entry. The material consisted of pairs of consonant-vowel syllables in Experiment 1 and pairs of rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant words in Experiment 2. Both experiments yielded a right-ear advantage for detection and for localization. Attention instructions had no effect on detection. However, focusing attention on 1 ear increased the number of targets attributed to that ear while decreasing the number of targets attributed to the opposite ear. The dissociation between detection and localization indicates that volitional shifts of attention influence late (response selection) processes rather than early (stimulus identification) processes. Selective-listening effects can be accounted for by a 2-stage model in which a fixed input asymmetry is modulated by a biased selection of responses.","1789":"Two divided visual field priming experiments were designed to determine the nature of lexical retrieval in the cerebral hemispheres by studying the facilitation of semantic features of unambiguous nouns. Unambiguous nouns have a single meaning, yet semantic features associated with these nouns may vary in the degree to which they are compatible with this single meaning (e.g., LAMB-WOOL as compared with LAMB-CHOPS). Results suggest that the left hemisphere selects both strongly and weakly associated semantic features that are compatible with the dominant representation of the noun. Dominance compatibility, rather than association strength, seems to be the more important factor for deciding what features are maintained in the left hemisphere. In contrast, the right hemisphere maintains more varied information, including features that are less compatible with the dominant representation (Experiment 1) and context information (Experiment 2).","1790":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) impair performance on semantic memory tasks, but researchers disagree on whether AD and HD cause these impairments in the same manner. According to one view, AD disrupts the storage of semantic memories, whereas HD disrupts the retrieval of semantic memories. Dissenters argue that AD, like HD, disrupts retrieval. In this study, participants generated category exemplars (e.g., kinds of fruits) for 1 min, and response latencies were examined. Relative to healthy controls, the 12 AD patients produced a larger proportion of responses earlier in the recall period, consistent with the view that AD patients quickly exhaust their limited supply of items in storage. By contrast, the 12 HD patients produced a larger proportion of their responses late in the recall period, consistent with the view that HD slows retrieval.","1791":"Over 15 months of longitudinal assessment, a patient with semantic dementia, D.M., improved on tests of naming and category fluency for a specific set of items (Experiment 1). The authors attribute this to his home drill with the names of these concepts plus pictures and descriptions of them. In Experiment 2, D.M. produced significantly more exemplars on category fluency for semantic categories that he had been practicing at home than for nonpracticed categories, an effect that cannot be attributed to an inherent difference between the 2 sets because the fluency performance of control participants revealed no significant difference between the 2 sets. In Experiment 3, D.M. rehearsed some of his previously nonpracticed categories daily for a period of 2 weeks: His fluency scores on the experimental categories improved substantially, but they declined once he ceased the daily drill. The results are discussed with respect to current views of long-term memory, particularly new word learning and forgetting, and to current techniques for facilitating word finding in aphasia.","1792":"Patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) are reported to show mild, but reliable, difficulties reading aloud and spelling to dictation exception words, which have unusual or unpredictable correspondence between their spelling and pronunciation (e.g., touch). To understand the cognitive dysfunction responsible for these impairments, 21 patients and 27 age-and education-matched controls completed specially designed tests of single-word oral reading and spelling to dictation. AD patients performed slightly below controls on all tasks and showed mildly exaggerated regularity effects (i.e., the difference in response accuracy between words with regular spellings minus exception words) in reading and spelling. Qualitative analyses, however, did not demonstrate response patterns consistent with impairment in central lexical orthographic processing. The authors conclude that the mild alexia and agraphia in AD reflect semantic deficits and nonlinguistic impairments rather than a specific disturbance in lexical orthographic processing.","1793":"Implicit and explicit memory were examined in individuals with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) under conditions of full and divided attention. Participants included 12 individuals with severe TBI and 12 matched controls. In Experiment 1, participants carried out an implicit test of word-stem completion and an explicit test of cued recall. Results demonstrated that TBI participants exhibited impaired explicit memory but preserved implicit memory. In Experiment 2, a significant reduction in the explicit memory performance of both TBI and control participants, as well as a significant decrease in the implicit memory performance of TBI participants, was achieved by reducing attentional resources at encoding. These results indicated that performance on an implicit task of word-stem completion may require the availability of additional attentional resources that are not preserved after severe TBI.","1794":"Fifteen patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 26 matched older controls engaged in a lexical-decision task with a list of words and nonwords while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Two repetition conditions were embedded in the list: words repeated at relatively long lags or words repeated shortly after a brief masked presentation. Although older controls displayed behavioral and ERP repetition priming for words repeated at long lags, consistent with previous studies, AD patients displayed neither. In contrast, both controls and AD patients displayed an ERP repetition priming effect for words repeated shortly after a brief masked presentation. ERP priming effects for masked and unmasked repetition differed in older controls, and additionally, the ERP masked priming effect differed between controls and AD patients. Results are discussed in the context of studies that have examined memory performance in brain-damaged populations using an impaired-intact dichotomy.","1795":"Controlled processing, response inhibition, and set adoption were examined in 51 HIV-1 infected participants and 21 uninfected controls who were administered a vocal reaction time (RT) version of the Stroop task (Stroop-RT; J. R. Stroop, 1935) as well as the traditional 100 item paper-and-pencil version. Response set expectancies on the Stroop-RT were manipulated by presenting 50% of trials in homogenous blocks and randomly varying the stimulus type during the remaining trials. As hypothesized, HIV seropositive (HIV+) participants were significantly slower than HIV seronegative controls on both versions of the Stroop. Significant interference effects were apparent on the paper-and-pencil version of the Stroop, but were not as prominent on the Stroop-RT. The HIV+ participants did profit from the blocking manipulation on the Stroop-RT, suggesting that set adoption is retained in HIV infection. These data suggest that HIV infection may result in deficient response inhibition, possibly secondary to frontostriatal dysfunction and dopaminergic alterations.","1796":"This study partly supports the hypothesis that frontal lobe lesions cause impairment of metamemory. Fifty-nine patients with a focal brain lesion and 21 non-brain-damaged patients memorized a 4 X 4 matrix of 16 faces in 6 consecutive trials and predicted the number of locations of faces they would be able to remember before each retrieval. When age-related impairment of learning was adjusted, the patients with right posterior lesions were inferior to the controls and to the patients with right frontal lesions on the total number of correctly placed faces. The patients with right frontal lesions were less accurate than the patients with right posterior lesions or the controls in the prediction of retrieval. The inaccuracy of retrieval prediction in the face test was associated with that in a word-list learning task.","1797":"Writing hand preference is a prominent functional asymmetry, but biomechanical factors may also contribute to any kinematic differences in the quality of handwriting movements performed by either hand. Eighteen dextral participants used a noninking pen with their right or left hand to write cursive letter ls, inverted ls, and their mirror images (to control for biomechanical differences) on a graphics tablet. Kinematic analysis of the scaling, consistency, efficiency, and shape of writing stroke trajectories revealed functional asymmetries between hands. The right hand was faster and produced more efficient strokes, which were of more consistent length, duration, and peak velocity. Differences between hands do not simply reflect biomechanical factors; therefore, the documentation of any functional asymmetries may allow their subsequent use as markers of underlying pathology in conditions such as schizophrenia.","1798":"Automatic and effortful memory processes were evaluated in a 2-session, within-subjects design involving an alcohol challenge and a no-alcohol condition. Free recall of a 90-word list measured effortful processing. Estimation of word frequency from the same list measured automatic processing. Acute intoxication was hypothesized to diminish effortful but not automatic memory processes. Healthy, male volunteers (n = 36) completed the 2 conditions 1 week apart. Presentation frequency influenced both free recall and frequency estimation, with both measures increasing as presentation frequency increased. Free recall was significantly lower in the alcohol than in the no-alcohol condition, but frequency estimation was not differentially affected. The data showed that an alcohol challenge dissociated automatic and effortful memory processes in volunteers. The authors discuss potential neurobiological substrates that may account for alcohol's selective disruption of effortful, verbal, episodic memory processing.","1799":"Right and left hemisphere hypotheses have been proposed to account for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. To examine these hypotheses, perception of global-local patterns was studied in 22 patients with schizophrenia and 28 normal comparison participants. The patients with schizophrenia showed an abnormally exaggerated global processing advantage when attention was divided between global and local levels but not when participants were instructed to attend to either the local or global level. This finding suggested a local processing (left hemisphere) deficit, which was overcome through strategic attentional allocation (instructional set). When the stimulus visual angle was reduced from 9 degrees to 3 degrees, the normal participants showed a shift from a local to a global processing advantage, but the patients did not. This finding suggested a more subtle deficit in strategic attentional processes that develop through exposure to stimulus context.","1800":"Two experiments assessed inhibitory mechanisms associated with the posterior and anterior attention networks in schizophrenia. Experiment 1 assessed the inhibition of return effect of the posterior network. Both healthy adults and schizophrenic adults showed inhibition of return, suggesting that this inhibitory mechanism of visual orienting is preserved in schizophrenia. Experiment 2 assessed semantic inhibition, which supposedly taps the anterior network, in a lexical-decision task. Healthy adults showed semantic inhibition effects in both visual fields. Schizophrenic adults showed semantic inhibition effects when targets were presented to the left visual field, involving the right hemisphere. However, semantic facilitation rather than inhibition was observed when targets were presented to the right visual field, involving the left hemisphere. These results reflect left hemisphere dysfunction associated with deficits in attentional control in schizophrenia.","1801":"Redundant-targets effects (RTE) for visual search were investigated in 2 commissurotomy patients (L.B., N.G.). L.B., who showed no evidence of visual interhemispheric transfer, exhibited a paradoxical enhancement of the redundancy gain in the bilateral compared with the within-hemifield redundant-targets conditions, whereas N.G., who showed evidence of interhemispheric transfer of visual information, exhibited no enhancement of the bilateral redundancy gain. When only uncrossed responses were considered, both bilateral and within-field RTE were evident only when attentional demands were high. Bilateral redundant targets led to stronger gains, some indicative of coactivation, in the slower response hand. The authors suggest that the enhancement of the bilateral RTE comes about by neural coactivation, which is especially pronounced when the slower hemisphere elicits the response.","1802":"The authors investigated selective attention in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), using a well-known visual search procedure. In simple feature search, the deficit observed in AD patients represented a baseline shift in the median hit reaction time (RT). On the conjoined feature search task, the median hit RT for AD patients increased disproportionately with increasing array size, indicating an additional cognitive impairment on this task. Of particular importance, the cognitive deficit observed in conjunction search was more profound than that predicted on the basis of previous reports of global cognitive slowing in AD. There was some evidence that the performance of AD patients improved more than the performance of controls over the duration of the experimental test session. Patients also had more difficulty in detecting targets on the right side of hemispace and in more peripheral locations.","1803":"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and normal controls (NCs) were administered a series of visual attention tasks. The dimensional integration task required integration of information from 2 stimulus dimensions. The selective attention task required selective attention to 1 stimulus dimension while ignoring the other stimulus dimension. Both integral- and separable-dimension stimuli were examined. A series of quantitative models of attentional processing was applied to each participant's data. The results suggest that (a) PD patients were not impaired in integrating information from 2 stimulus dimensions, (b) PD patients were impaired in selective attention, (c) selective attention deficits in PD patients were not due to perceptual interference, and (d) PD patients were affected by manipulations of stimulus integrality and separability in much the same way as were NCs.","1804":"This study investigated the extent to which amnesic patients use fluency of perceptual identification as a cue for recognition. Perceptual fluency was measured by having participants gradually unmask words before making recognition judgments. In Experiment 1, familiarity was the only possible basis for recognition because no words had been presented in the study phase. In Experiment 2, recollection provided an alternative basis for recognition because words had appeared in the study phase. Amnesic patients were as likely as normal controls to use perceptual fluency as a cue for recognition in Experiment 1 but were more likely than controls to do so in Experiment 2. For both groups, perceptual fluency affected judgments for studied and unstudied items to the same extent in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that amnesic patients do use perceptual fluency cues, but reliance on perceptual fluency does not necessarily elevate recognition accuracy.","1805":"Twenty-seven research participants with dementia of the Alzheimer type were studied with the California Verbal Learning Test (D. C. Delis, J. H. Kramer, E. Kaplan, &amp; B. A. Ober, 1987) and standardized volume measures of the mesial temporal cortical gray matter, neocortical gray matter, thalamus, and caudate nuclei, from magnetic resonance imaging. A pattern of atrophic brain changes in the mesial temporal lobes (MTL) and the thalamus, with relatively less severe atrophy in the neocortical gray matter, was associated with poorer learning of the word list. Similar patterns of brain atrophy were observed for measures of delayed recall and recognition hits. However, for delayed recall, neither contribution was statistically significant, and for recognition hits, MTL was only at the trend level for significance. These results provide evidence that the verbal memory deficit of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated not only with the mesial temporal limbic cortex, thought to be the site of earliest and most severe pathology in AD, but also with damage in the thalamus.","1806":"Twelve neurologically normal participants (4 men and 8 women) performed semantic, phonological, and orthographic working memory tasks and a control task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Divergent regions of the posterior left hemisphere used for decoding and storage of information emerged in each working memory versus control task comparison. These regions were consistent with previous literature on processing mechanisms for semantic, phonological, and orthographic information. Further, working memory versus control task differences extended into the left frontal lobe, including premotor cortex, and even into subcortical structures. Findings were consistent with R. C. Martin and C. Romani's (1994) contention that different forms of verbal working memory exist and further suggest that a reconceptualization of premotor cortex functions is needed.","1807":"To clarify the involvement of prefrontal cortex in episodic memory, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures of recognition were examined in patients with dorsolateral prefrontal lesions. In controls, recognition accuracy and the ERP old-new effect declined with increasing retention intervals. Although frontal patients showed a higher false-alarm rate to new words, their hit rate to old words and ERP old-new effect were intact, suggesting that recognition processes were not fundamentally altered by prefrontal damage. The opposite behavioral pattern was observed in patients with hippocampal lesions: a normal false-alarm rate and a precipitous decline in hit rate at long lags. The intact ERP effect and the change in response bias during recognition suggest that frontal patients exhibited a deficit in strategic processing or postretrieval monitoring, in contrast to the more purely mnemonic deficit shown by hippocampal patients.","1808":"Concept formation and shifting abilities of 17 frontal lesion (FL) and 8 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were assessed with the California Card Sorting Test. FL patients demonstrated a significantly greater number of perseverative responses and deficits in strategy planning, strategy initiation, and concept formation and did not benefit from abstract cues in comparison with their matched normal control (NC) participants. PD patients also demonstrated an increased number of perseverative responses under selected conditions in comparison with their matched NCs, but their ability to explain their sorts, to extract and express the sorting principles, and to sort with the help of abstract and concrete cues depended on their general cognitive status.","1809":"This investigation examined whether manipulating participants' attention toward the left or right visual field would have consequences for mood state. Based on the premise that right parietal activity is related to the arousal dimension of emotion, it was predicted that activating the right parietal region asymmetrically would differentially affect aspects of mood related to arousal. Half of the participants in the experiment completed a leftward-biased attentional orienting task, and half completed a mirror-image rightward-biased task. Consistent with predictions, participants in the left-biased group showed greater changes in self-reported arousal. Results support the notion of bidirectional causal relations between mood and perceptual asymmetries.","1810":"Normative data were presented that defined the upper and lower standards for deciding if cognitive abilities show reliable change over 2 or more testing occasions when retesting occurs at 1- to 2-year intervals. The Mayo Cognitive Factor Scores (MCFS; G. E. Smith et al., 1994) were analyzed because they permit the quantitation of overall functioning in 5 clinically important cognitive domains: established verbal knowledge, nonverbal reasoning, attention and concentration, new learning, and delayed memory. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of both group-level and individual-level data analyses derived from a respectably sized sample of normal persons who have been tested 3 or more times at clinically common test-retest intervals.","1811":"Younger and older adults responded to an asterisk presented to either the left or right visual field, with delay interval between onset of a fixation cross and onset of the asterisk varied. At delay intervals longer than 3 s, reaction time was faster when the same visual field was stimulated on 2 successive trials than when different visual fields were stimulated. This prefield effect was larger in the left visual field (right hemisphere), consistent with hypotheses of hemispheric asymmetry for arousal and vigilance. For older adults, these results were obtained only when participants responded with the left hand, suggesting that some aspects of hemispheric asymmetry for attention-related processing or the efficiency of interhemispheric transfer may change in an age-related fashion.","1812":"To examine the neuropsychology of prospective remembering, older adults were divided preexperimentally into 4 groups on the basis of their scores on 2 composite measures: one assessing frontal lobe function and the other assessing medial temporal lobe function. The groups reflected the factorial combination of high and low functioning for each neuropsychological system, and they were tested on an event-based laboratory prospective memory task. High-functioning frontal participants showed better prospective remembering than low-functioning frontal participants. There was no significant difference in prospective memory performance attributable to medial temporal functioning. The results support the theoretical notion that frontal lobe processes play a key role in prospective remembering. Discussion focuses on the particular components of prospective memory performance that frontal lobes might mediate.","1813":"To evaluate the effect of age at various conditioned stimulus (CS)-unconditioned stimulus (US) intervals, 144 young, middle-aged, and older adults were tested on eyeblink classical conditioning at CS-US intervals of 500, 1,000, or 1,500 ms. Reaction time, response timing, motor learning, declarative memory, and attention were assessed to identify correlates of conditioning at various CS-US intervals. Previously reported middle-aged and older adults were impaired at a 400-ms CS-US interval, but the addition of 100 ms to the CS-US interval in this study enabled equal conditioning in middle-aged and young adults. At a 1,000-ms CS-US interval, older adults remained significantly impaired. It was only at the 1,500-ms CS-US interval that conditioning was equal for the 3 age groups. Measures of reaction time, timing, and motor learning were not correlated systematically with conditioning. Whereas the results of age differences at various CS-US intervals were clear and striking, patterns of relationships among neuropsychological and conditioning variables were not consistent in indicating sources of age differences.","1814":"This study examined recovery over the first year following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children 6-12 years of age. Forty-two children with severe TBI and 52 with moderate TBI were compared to 58 children with orthopedic injuries. The children and their families were evaluated at a baseline assessment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Findings documented cognitive, achievement, and behavioral sequelae of TBI, with only limited evidence for recovery over the first year postinjury. Outcomes were predicted by preinjury factors, TBI severity, and measures of the postinjury family environment. Some of the sequelae of severe TBI were more marked in the context of higher compared with lower levels of family burden or dysfunction. The findings confirm the need to consider environmental contributions to outcomes of TBI in children.","1815":"A broad range of neuropsychological function was compared in samples of young adult unipolar depressed inpatients with and without psychotic features. Consistent with expectations, the psychotic depressive group demonstrated a broad range of deficit and had more impaired performances than the nonpsychotic group. Relevance of these data for hypotheses concerning psychotic depression as a unique diagnostic entity is discussed. In the context of previous research, the current findings suggest that accounting for individual differences in depression may clarify discrepancies between earlier studies of neuropsychological function in depression, and our understanding of the mechanisms by which depression influences cognition may be refined.","1816":"The authors administered the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery to schizophrenic groups with (n = 54) and without (n = 217) coexisting alcoholism, nonschizophrenic groups with alcoholism (n = 231), and a patient comparison group (n = 145) to determine the extent of additive cognitive impairment in schizophrenia associated with alcoholism and to compare cognitive function in alcoholism and schizophrenia. The additive effects of alcoholism on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia were subtle but were consistently identifiable. Cognitive dysfunction in alcoholism was less severe than in schizophrenia with or without alcoholism. The magnitude of additive effects of alcoholism on cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia was age related with a significant interaction between age and presence or absence of alcoholism on a global index of cognitive dysfunction.","1817":"Recent studies of memory in schizophrenia have shown that explicit but not implicit memory performance is impaired. The hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with a failure of consciously but not unconsciously (automatic) controlled influence of memory on performance was tested using a procedure providing uncontaminated estimates of consciously controlled and automatic memory processes (i.e., the process-dissociation procedure in a stem completion task). Performance of 35 patients with schizophrenia was compared with that of 35 normal participants. Consciously controlled use but not automatic influences of memory was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. Consciously controlled use of memory was negatively and significantly correlated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia differentially affects 2 types of memory processes: It impairs consciously controlled use of memory but spares automatic influences. Positive symptoms could reflect the lack of control from higher level conscious processes.","1818":"Odor sensitivity and identification were examined in normal aging and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aims were to investigate AD as associated with lower odor sensitivity, odor identification as a function of retrieval support, and the relationship between global cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Exam [MMSE]; M. F. Folstein, S. E. Folstein, &amp; P. R. McHugh, 1975) and olfactory performance. Results indicated intact odor sensitivity but deficient odor identification in AD. Both groups benefited from cues in identification, and the size of the gains was equally large in AD patients and controls. The finding of no selective benefit from retrieval support in AD suggests that a degradation of olfactory knowledge contributes to the odor identification deficits in these patients. MMSE and identification were positively related, whereas MMSE and olfactory sensitivity were unrelated. These findings suggest that the AD-related olfactory impairment stems from lesions in cortical rather than peripheral structures.","1819":"The mere exposure effect was examined in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Twenty patients and 20 elderly controls judged the physical characteristics of faces. Implicit memory was tested later by presenting pairs of faces (old and new) and asking participants which faces they liked better. Patients and controls exhibited above chance preference for previously exposed faces. Experiment 2 evaluated whether the preserved implicit memory of patients was mediated by explicit memory. Patients and controls again judged faces but then later chose which faces they had seen before. Patients exhibited impaired recognition memory compared to controls. These findings suggest that a mere exposure effect for unfamiliar faces is present in mild to moderate AD. The results are discussed in terms of perceptual and conceptual priming and relatively spared occipital lobe functioning in early AD.","1820":"The authors compared age-matched groups of patients with the frontal and temporal lobe variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; dementia of frontal type [DFT] and semantic dementia), early Alzheimer's disease (AD), and normal controls (n = 9 per group) on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. A distinct profile emerged for each group: Those with AD showed a severe deficit in episodic memory with more subtle, but significant, impairments in semantic memory and visuospatial skills; patients with semantic dementia showed the previously documented picture of isolated, but profound, semantic memory breakdown with anomia and surface dyslexia but were indistinguishable from the AD group on a test of story recall; and the DFT group were the least impaired and showed mild deficits in episodic memory and verbal fluency but normal semantic memory. The frontal and temporal presentations of FTD are clearly separable from each other and from early AD.","1821":"There are many conflicting results concerning the effects of age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on word-stem completion priming. To examine potential sources of this variability, the authors examined the influences on such priming of age, cognitive status, and encoding in a large sample of young, old, and AD individuals. At study, words were processed aloud by reading, reading and rating likeability, or generating from definition. Old participants had less priming than young participants and more priming than AD patients. For the healthy old participants, priming decreased with advancing age and with cognitive loss following generation only. For AD patients, priming decreased as dementia severity increased; patients with the mildest dementia did not differ from healthy old participants. Thus, age, cognitive status, and encoding differentially influenced the magnitude of priming in healthy aging and AD.","1822":"Prefrontal cortex and cerebellum have both been implicated in temporal processing tasks although the exact contribution of each system remains unclear. To investigate this issue, control participants and patients with either prefrontal or cerebellar lesions were tested on temporal and nontemporal perceptual tasks under 2 levels of attentional load. Each trial involved a comparison between a standard tone and a subsequent comparison tone that varied in frequency, duration, or both. When participants had to make concurrent judgments on both dimensions, patients with frontal lobe lesions were significantly impaired on both tasks whereas the variability of cerebellar patients increased in the duration task only. This dissociation suggests that deficits on temporal processing tasks observed in frontal patients can be related to the attention demands of such tasks; cerebellar patients have a more specific problem related to timing.","1823":"Change in visual confrontation naming was examined following left (speech dominant) anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) as a function of surgical technique and patient characteristics. Two hundred seventeen patients with intractable left temporal lobe epilepsy were selected according to standard criteria across 8 centers, and combined into 4 surgical approaches to ATL: (a) tailored resections with intraoperative mapping of eloquent cortex, (b) tailored resections with extraoperative mapping, (c) standard resections with sparing of superior temporal gyrus, and (d) standard resections including excision of superior temporal gyrus. Changes in visual confrontation naming were examined with an index of reliable change derived from an independent sample of 90 nonsurgical patients with complex partial seizures. Results showed significant decline in visual confrontation naming following left ATL, regardless of surgical technique. Across surgical approaches, the risk for decline in visual confrontation naming was associated with a later age of seizure onset and more extensive resection of lateral temporal neocortex.","1824":"The ability to acquire a motor and cognitive skill was investigated in 26 patients with schizophrenia and 26 normal participants using repeated testing on the Tower of Toronto puzzle. Seven patients with defective performance were retested using additional trials and immediate feedback designed to facilitate problem solving. A component analysis of performance was used based on J. R. Anderson's (1987) model of cognitive skill learning. Patients exhibited a performance deficit on both motor and cognitive skills. However, their acquisition rate was similar to that of normal participants on most parameters, indicating that skill learning suffered little or no impairment. Performance deficit was accounted for by poor problem-solving ability, explicit memory, and general intellectual capacities. It was remediable in some, but not all, patients. Remediation failure was also related to severe defects of cognitive functions.","1825":"Children with arrested, shunted, and no hydrocephalus were compared on verbal and nonverbal memory tasks assessing multiple components of memory. A gradient of severity was hypothesized, with the shunted hydrocephalus group expected to exhibit the most significant memory impairments and the arrested group expected to perform more poorly than children with no hydrocephalus. Etiologies of prematurity, spina bifida, and aqueductal stenosis were represented by 157 participants. Results supported the hypothesis; the shunted hydrocephalus group performed poorer on all memory measures. Differences for the arrested group were less frequently statistically significant relative to children with no hydrocephalus. Irrespective of etiology, the shunted hydrocephalus group exhibited a pattern of performance suggestive of encoding and retrieval deficits on both verbal and nonverbal tasks, showing a pervasive disturbance of memory processes.","1826":"This retrospective study investigated whether there is evidence of a 3rd reading mechanism in a transparent orthography such as Italian, where (nearly) all words can be read through the sublexical route but stress cannot always be assigned by orthography-to-phonology rules. The presence and frequency of stress errors in lexically stressed words in 16 aphasic patients with impaired reading comprehension of those same words was checked. Nine patients were reexamined months later. Notwithstanding impaired reading comprehension, none of the patients made stress errors at first examination. At follow-up, all patients showed improvement of reading comprehension and only 2 patients still had better preserved oral reading. The authors concluded that even in transparent orthographies such as Italian, the noninteractive dual-route model is inadequate for explaining all patterns of reading performances. In nonprogressive aphasias, reading comprehension can recover in a larger number of patients, reducing the amplitude of the dissociation between reading aloud and reading comprehension and reducing the number of patients showing this dissociation.","1827":"Patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) were compared to normal controls and patients with early vascular dementia (VaD) on their naming errors using the Boston Naming Test (H. Goodglass &amp; E. Kaplan, 1983). All naming errors were classified into three general error categories: visuoperceptual, semantic, and phonemic. Semantic errors were further classified into coordinate errors (responses that belong to the same semantic category as the target words), superordinate errors (responses that belong to a broader semantic category than the target word), and functional-circumlocutory errors (circumlocutions and responses that functionally describe the target word). The findings indicated that AD participants display more overall naming errors than VaD participants, although the pattern of general errors was similar between the patient groups. However, the qualitative difference between the patient groups was observed within the semantic errors because the AD group made more superordinate errors.","1828":"An important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that differentiates it from normal aging is the deterioration of semantic memory. The purpose of this study was to determine if the poor performance of AD patients on tasks that require them to use semantic memory is related to their inability to identify specific semantic relations. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the reaction times and error rates of AD patients to those of the normal elderly and normal young in a sentence verification task. We found that AD patients were significantly slower and less accurate than the normal elderly and the young on aspects of the task that required the knowledge of specific semantic relationships. In a 2nd experiment, young normal participants performed the same task with a concurrent memory load. The results from Experiment 2 indicate that the performance of AD patients in this task cannot be attributed to a diminished working memory capacity.","1829":"The factors contributing to the working memory deficit observed in older adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease on the Self-Ordered Pointing Task were examined in 2 experiments. A detailed analysis of the error data revealed that errors tended to be clustered toward the end of a trial and that this effect was somewhat independent of set size. This pattern was proposed to result from a monitoring deficit where individuals failed to maintain an integrated representation of how far they had proceeded in the trial, an interpretation consistent with animal work by M. Petrides (1995).","1830":"This article reports dissociations between verbal span and the recency portion of the serial position curve in immediate free recall, in 2 neuropsychological case studies and in 3 experiments with normal participants. Patient A. N. presented with an impaired serial verbal span while showing an intact recency effect. The opposite pattern was observed in patient G. C., who despite a poor recency showed normal span in verbal serial recall tasks. Experiments 1 and 2 showed a recency effect with visually and auditory presented lists and written recall was resistant to the effects of articulatory suppression and of irrelevant speech, but was disrupted by the suffix effect. Experiment 3 showed that in contrast with recency, memory span was affected by articulatory suppression and irrelevant speech during presentation but not by a suffix. These findings are not consistent with the idea that span and recency measure aspects of the same memory system. Moreover, in clinical practice, they should not be used as equivalent alternatives.","1831":"Contractions of the left hand and of the left side of the lower third of the face induce negative emotional states whereas right-sided contractions induce positive states. Contractions also have mood-congruent influences on perception. This article reports that contractions affect behavior as well. Persistence in attempting to solve insoluble problems is greater following right-sided contractions than following left-sided contractions. This effect is unrelated to dominance of the contracted muscles because right-handed individuals tend to be left-face dominant. Results support the hypothesis that unilateral contractions activate the contralateral cerebral hemispheres and arouse the hemispheres' respective functions with regard to emotion and behavior.","1832":"A man who had undergone forebrain commissurotomy (L.B.) and a man with agenesis of the corpus callosum (R.B.) judged whether pairs of spatially separated lights were successive or simultaneous. Stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) were 0, 17, 33, 50, 67, 83, 117, and 150 ms. When the lights were in opposite visual fields, the SOA at which the discrimination first reached a level significantly above chance was 150 ms for L.B., 67 ms for R.B., and 33 ms for \"normal\" participants. Results parallel evidence from reaction time studies in which estimates of interhemispheric transfer time for callosal agenesis patients lie between those of normal controls and those with surgical section of the forebrain commissures. L.B. also showed a left-visual-field deficit in the discrimination, though it was less marked than his deficit with bilateral presentations.","1833":"This study identified the brain activations associated with auditory vigilance tasks, using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We created auditory continuous performance tests (CPTs) in which a demanding task (working memory task) was made more difficult than a simple vigilance task by increasing working memory and interference filtering demands. Two cohorts of normal male controls performed significantly worse on the working memory CPT than on the vigilance task. Compared to the vigilance task, performance of the working memory task produced significant signal change in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, precentral cortex, temporal lobe, including insula and hippocampus, parietal-occipital cortex, cingulate, thalamus, and superior colliculus. Performance and degree of activation was associated with an estimate of IQ. Further research should clarify the contributions of working memory and interference filtering to the activated network.","1834":"Functional neuroanatomical correlates subserving maintenance rehearsal relative to a reading control task were investigated with positron emission tomography imaging of cerebral blood flow in 6 healthy older participants and 6 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rehearsal and reading rates and number of unique words rehearsed did not differ significantly for the 2 groups. The right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was activated in both groups during rehearsal, highlighting this region's role in short-term maintenance of verbal information. A shift in cortical processing resources to more anterior brain regions with increased rehearsal list length was seen, likely reflecting greater demands on frontal cortex as cognitive load grows. Whereas controls showed unilateral right frontal activation during rehearsal, AD patients demonstrated bilateral frontal activation, possibly reflecting compensatory recruitment of neural resources.","1835":"Glucose enhances memory in a variety of individuals, including people with Alzheimer's disease. By 35 years of age, adults with Down's syndrome (DS) develop the characteristic plaques and tangles found in Alzheimer's disease, despite findings indicating that not all older DS individuals meet criteria for dementia. To examine the possibility that glucose enhances memory in adults with DS (mean age = 35 years, range = 19-55 years), adults with DS were given a battery of tests specifically designed for individuals with DS in glucose and control conditions. No participant met criteria for dementia, regardless of age. Glucose enhanced performance on tests requiring both long-term memory and auditory processing. In addition, increased age was associated with poorer performance on the majority of tests in the control condition, indicating that cognitive decline with aging may be more prevalent in DS than previously believed.","1836":"This study constitutes a multitask appraisal of cerebral hemisphere specialization with 13 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for handedness. Tasks included dichotic listening, finger tapping with concurrent loads, two tachistoscopic visual half-field tests, and a free-vision face test. Overall, MZ twins showed similar performance asymmetries on most tasks. Different asymmetries, however, were observed on the finger tapping with anagram load and visual half-field with chair stimuli. In these instances, asymmetries for left- and right-handed MZ twins were more similar to patterns reported in the literature for left- and right-handed singletons, respectively, than for opposite-handed co-twins.","1837":"The goal of this study of 66 twins was to determine whether motor and cognitive functions assessed in early and middle childhood are vulnerable to perinatal hypoxic risk. In an earlier study of 76 infant and toddler twins (S. Raz, F. Shah, &amp; C. Sander, 1996), the authors found that intrapair discrepancy on the Mental Developmental Index, but not on the Psychomotor Developmental Index, of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development was associated with discordance for perinatal hypoxic risk. The twins at lower risk outperformed their higher risk co-twins. In the present study the authors sought to establish in a new sample of preschool and school-age twins whether gaps in performance persist into early and middle childhood. Although the disparity in hypoxic risk between the co-twins was typically moderate, significant intrapair differences were observed on the measure of motor performance. Among the motor abilities examined, skills involving visually guided ballistic arm movements appeared to be the most vulnerable to perinatal risk.","1838":"Emotional perception was examined in stroke patients across 3 communication channels: facial, prosodic, and lexical. Hemispheric specialization for emotion was tested via right-hemisphere (RH) and valence hypotheses, and relationships among channels were determined. Participants were 11 right-brain-damaged (RBD), 10 left-brain-damaged (LBD), and 15 demographically matched normal control (NC) adults. Experimental measures, with analogous psychometric properties, were identification and discrimination tasks, including a range of positive and negative emotions. Nonemotional control tasks were used for each channel. For identification, RBDs were significantly impaired relative to LBDs and NCs across channels and valences, supporting the RH hypothesis. No group differences emerged for discrimination. Findings were not influenced by demographic, clinical, or control variables. Correlations among the channels were more prominent for normal than for brain-damaged groups.","1839":"The neurocognitive literature on test performance in schizophrenia is reviewed quantitatively. The authors report 22 mean effect sizes from 204 studies to index schizophrenia versus control differences in global and selective verbal memory, nonverbal memory, bilateral and unilateral motor performance, visual and auditory attention, general intelligence, spatial ability, executive function, language, and interhemispheric tactile-transfer test performance. Moderate to large raw effect sizes (d &gt; .60) were obtained for all 22 neurocognitive test variables, and none of the associated confidence intervals included zero. The results indicate that schizophrenia is characterized by a broadly based cognitive impairment, with varying degrees of deficit in all ability domains measured by standard clinical tests.","1840":"The Stroop task, considered by many to be a paradigmatic measure of selective attention, has often been employed to investigate attention deficits in schizophrenia. Card and single-trial versions of this task have yielded different results. In this study both card and single-trial versions were administered to healthy controls (n = 24) and patients with schizophrenia (n = 55). No differences in reaction time (RT) interference were found on either version. On the single-trial version, patients showed greater RT facilitation and error rate interference, evidence for a deficit in selective attention. Methodologic and analytic issues that account for the mixed results from earlier card Stroop studies are addressed. It is concluded that single-trial versions provide greater sensitivity to selective attention pathology in schizophrenia.","1841":"Schizophrenia affects prefrontal and temporal-limbic networks. These regions were examined by contrasting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during executive (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test [WCST]), and declarative memory tasks (Paired Associate Recognition Test [PART]). The tasks, and a resting baseline, were administered to 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls during 10 min positron emission tomography 15O-water measures of rCBF. Patients were worse on both tasks. Controls activated inferior frontal, occipitotemporal, and temporal pole regions for both tasks. Similar results were obtained for controls matched to level of patient performance. Patients showed no activation of hypothesized regions during the WCST and activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the PART. On the PART, occipitotemporal activation correlated with better performance for controls only. Better WCST performance correlated with CBF increase in prefrontal regions for controls and in the parahippocampal gyrus for patients. Results suggest that schizophrenia may involve a breakdown in the integration of a frontotemporal network that is responsive to executive and declarative memory demands in healthy individuals.","1842":"Because interaction of the cerebral hemispheres has been found to aid task performance under demanding conditions, the present study examined how this effect is moderated by computational complexity, the degree of lateralization for a task, and individual differences in asymmetric hemispheric activation (AHA). Computational complexity was manipulated across tasks either by increasing the number of inputs to be processed or by increasing the number of steps to a decision. Comparison of within- and across-hemisphere trials indicated that the size of the between-hemisphere advantage increased as a function of task complexity, except for a highly lateralized rhyme decision task that can only be performed by the left hemisphere. Measures of individual differences in AHA revealed that when task demands and an individual's AHA both load on the same hemisphere, the ability to divide the processing between the hemispheres is limited. Thus, interhemispheric division of processing improves performance at higher levels of computational complexity only when the required operations can be divided between the hemispheres.","1843":"Category-specific deficits for living things have been explained variously as an artifact due to differences in the familiarity of concepts in different categories (E. Funnell &amp; J. Sheridan, 1992) or as the result of an underlying impairment to sensory knowledge (E. K. Warrington &amp; T. Shallice, 1984). Efforts to test these hypotheses empirically have been hindered by the shortcomings of currently available stimulus materials. A new set of stimuli are described that the authors developed to overcome the limitations of existing sets. The set consists of color photographs, matched across categories for familiarity and visual complexity. This set was used to test the semantic knowledge of a classic patient, J.B.R. (E. K. Warrington &amp; T. Shallice, 1984). The results suggest that J.B.R.'s deficit for living things cannot be explained in terms of familiarity effects and that the most severely affected categories are those whose identification is most dependent on sensory information.","1844":"Are inhibition and habituation, processes that contribute to selective attention, impaired by aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD)? Younger adults, older adults, and adults with AD read lists of letters presented either alone or paired with distractor letters. Slower reading times for lists containing distractors relative to lists without distractors indexed concurrent interference (distraction). Slower reading times for lists in which distractors subsequently became targets relative to lists in which distractors and targets were unrelated indexed negative priming (inhibition). Faster reading times when distractors were constant in identity or location rather than random indexed repeated distractor effects (habituation). Distraction increased with aging and AD, whereas inhibition and habituation showed no age- or AD-related decline, suggesting that inhibition and habituation still function to aid attentional selection in older adults and adults with AD.","1845":"Picture-naming priming was examined across different study-test transformations to explore the nature of memory representations of objects supporting implicit memory processes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although severely impaired in explicit memory for pictures and words, AD patients demonstrated normal priming across perceptual transformations in picture orientation (Experiment 1) and picture size (Experiment 2) and across symbolic transformations from words to pictures (Experiment 3). In addition, the priming across alterations in picture size was invariant. This demonstrates that AD patients have preserved implicit memory for high-level, abstract representations of objects.","1846":"Previous studies using the process dissociation and the remember-know procedures led to conflicting conclusions regarding the effects of anterograde amnesia on recollection and familiarity. We argue that these apparent contradictions arose because different models were used to interpret the results and because differences in false-alarm rates between groups biased the estimates provided by those models. A reanalysis of those studies with a dual-process signal-detection model that incorporates response bias revealed that amnesia led to a pronounced reduction in recollection and smaller but consistent reduction in familiarity. To test the assumptions of the model and to further assess recognition deficits in amnesics, we examined receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) in amnesics and controls. The ROCs of the controls were curved and asymmetrical, whereas those of the amnesics were curved and symmetrical. The results supported the predictions of the model and indicated that amnesia was associated with deficits in both recollection and familiarity.","1847":"The nature, pattern, and degree of neuropsychological change following anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) were examined as a function of the presence or absence of the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Fifty-four patients exhibited the syndrome of MTLE, while 34 patients were without the syndrome (non-MTLE). The test-retest performance of a group of 40 epilepsy patients who did not undergo surgery was used to derive regression-based estimates of test-retest change. Overall, the MTLE group did not show significant cognitive decline following ATL. In contrast, the left non-MTLE group showed significant declines on verbal memory, confrontation naming, and verbal conceptual ability. Further, verbal memory was the most substantial area of decline, and was independent of seizure outcome. Clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","1848":"The aim of this study was to explore the factorial structure of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and to identify the dimensions of deficit in schizophrenia. WCST scores in patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychosis (n = 292), 1st degree relatives of schizophrenic patients (n = 91), and normal controls (n = 141) were subjected to a principal factor analysis followed by orthogonal rotation. This led to 3 factors, perseveration, failure to maintain set, and idiosyncratic sorting. The detected factor structure was found to be invariant across the schizophrenic and control subsamples. Moreover, it replicated previous findings from 2 smaller samples. Only perseverations and, to a lesser degree, idiosyncratic sorting appeared to differentiate schizophrenic patients from comparisons. Only perseveration had good sensitivity and specificity, as well as the most robust significant correlations with estimates of IQ, attention, and other measures of executive functioning. Thus, perseveration appears to be the most diagnostically useful and characteristic WCST feature of schizophrenia.","1849":"Working memory and its contribution to performance on strategic memory tests in schizophrenia were studied. Patients (n = 18) and control participants (n = 15), all men, received tests of immediate memory (forward digit span), working memory (listening, computation, and backward digit span), and long-term strategic (free recall, temporal order, and self-ordered pointing) and nonstrategic (recognition) memory. Schizophrenia patients performed worse on all tests. Education, verbal intelligence, and immediate memory capacity did not account for deficits in working memory in schizophrenia patients. Reduced working memory capacity accounted for group differences in strategic memory but not in recognition memory. Working memory impairment may be central to the profile of impaired cognitive performance in schizophrenia and is consistent with hypothesized frontal lobe dysfunction associated with this disease. Additional medial-temporal dysfunction may account for the recognition memory deficit.","1850":"The effect of frontal lobe lesions on the accuracy of prediction of recall in a word list learning task was studied. Fifty-nine patients with a focal brain lesion and 21 non-brain-damaged control patients memorized a word list by selective reminding and predicted before each recall trial the number of words they would be able to recall. The patients with left frontal lesions, who were inferior to the patients with right frontal lesions and the control patients in word list recall, overpredicted their recall more than the other brain-damaged patients or the control patients, especially on the 1st trial. The patients with right frontal lesions were less accurate in the prediction of recall than the patients with right posterior lesions or the control patients.","1851":"This study examines the hypothesis that patients with frontal lobe lesions are impaired on tests of letter but not category fluency. This hypothesis was proposed by Moscovitch (1994), based on a series of cognitive studies with young, normal participants. A group of patients with lateral prefrontal lesions and age-matched controls were tested on 2 tests of verbal fluency, the FAS task and a category fluency task that used semantic categories as cues (e.g., animals). Patients with frontal lobe lesions generated fewer items than controls on both letter and category fluency. This effect did not interact with the type of fluency test, suggesting that the frontal lobes are more generally involved in verbal fluency. Moreover, this pattern of findings, along with previous results of impaired free recall and remote retrieval in this patient group, suggests that patients with frontal lobe lesions do not efficiently organize and develop retrieval strategies.","1852":"Although the basal ganglia have been shown to be critical for the expression of emotion in prosody and facial expressions, it is unclear whether they are also critical for recognition of emotions. Selective pathology of parts of the basal ganglia is a hallmark of individuals with Parkinson's disease, and such patients have been examined in several studies of emotion. We examined 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (11 men, 7 women) and 13 age-, education-, gender ratio-, and IQ-matched normal controls on their ability to recognize emotions signaled by facial expressions. Parkinson's patients performed entirely normally on a quantitative task of recognizing emotional facial expressions. The findings do not support the notion that the sectors of basal ganglia that are dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease are essential for recognizing emotion in facial expressions.","1853":"A new analytical procedure, single common factor analysis, was carried out on the data from a relatively large sample of normals (n = 101) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 180) to examine the extent to which there were independent effects of disease status on different neuropsychological variables. This technique uses structural equation methods to determine what all of the variables have in common, and then controls this common factor when examining the relationship between diagnostic group and each individual test variable. To the extent that AD represents the sum of independent breakdowns of different information processing domains, then there should be sets of variables that have weak or nonexistent links to the other variables. However, the results revealed that a large proportion of the AD-related effects on test scores was shared and was not independent of the AD-related effects on other variables.","1854":"Previous studies of covert orienting in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have investigated exogenous and endogenous processes separately. We aimed to investigate how the 2 modes of orienting interact to control attention in healthy older participants and patients with AD. The covert orienting of visual attention task (COVAT) with abrupt onset cues was used in all experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, predictive information was added to cues to initiate an endogenous orienting response. Results showed that healthy older participants were able to use endogenous processes to inhibit exogenous orienting. In contrast, patients with AD were unable to inhibit exogenous orienting to cues even when targets rarely appeared there. Experiment 3 investigated inhibition of return (IOR) in patients with AD. Both healthy older controls and patients with AD showed a normal IOR, suggesting that exogenous orienting processes are relatively unaffected by the normal aging process or in patients with AD. A model of covert orienting in which exogenous and endogenous orienting processes interact to control attentional behaviors is discussed.","1855":"Semantic memory impairment was investigated in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a threshold oral word reading task to assess priming of different lexical relationships. Healthy elderly controls showed significant priming for associatively related nouns (tempest-teapot) and also for nouns semantically related either because both designate basic-level exemplars of a common superordinate category (cousin-nephew) or because the target names the superordinate category of the prime (daughter-relative). AD patients, in contrast, showed preserved priming of lexical associates but impaired priming of certain semantic relationships. They showed no priming between words designating coordinate exemplars within a category, despite preserved priming of the superordinate category label. Findings are consistent with the view that at least part of the semantic deficit in AD is due to disruption of semantic knowledge that affects relationships among basic-level concepts, more than the relationships between these concepts and their corresponding superordinate category of membership.","1856":"The mental rotation required in the Road Map Test of Direction Sense (the \"Road Map Test\"; J. Money, 1976; J. Money, D. Alexander, &amp; H. T. Walker, 1965) has been thought to be impaired as a function of age, but not dementia. However, spatial rotation in dementia has not been investigated in reference to spatial coordinate systems. Patients with dementia (Alzheimer's and ischemic vascular dementias) and elderly control participants were administered the Road Map Test. The authors analyzed whether the geocentric or egocentric coordinate system determined rotation of Road Map Test turns and predicted impairment in dementia patients. They found equivalent impairment in both types of dementia, greater angulation effect in the geocentric system in patients relative to normal controls, and no egocentric effect. Results also suggest early emergence of spatial rotation deficit in dementia. Spatial rotation is most often associated with working memory, which predicts the correlations found.","1857":"Although clinical evidence of spatial attention deficits, such as neglect and extinction, is typically associated with lesions of the right temporal-parietal junction, recent evidence has suggested an important role for the superior parietal lobe. Two groups of patients, selected for lesions at the temporal-parietal junction including the superior temporal gyrus (TPJ group), or for lesions involving the parietal but not the superior temporal region (PAR group), performed cued-target detection tasks in 2 experiments. An extinction-like response time pattern was found for the TPJ but not the PAR group. In addition, both groups were able to use expectancy information, in the form of cue predictiveness, suggesting that separate mechanisms mediate exogenous and endogenous processes during attention shifts.","1858":"Font-specificity in visual word-stem completion priming was examined in patients with global amnesia and Patient M.S., who had a right-occipital lobectomy. Word-stems appeared in the same or different font as study words. Amnesic patients showed normal font-specific priming (greater priming for words studied in the same than different font as test), despite impaired word-stem cued recall. Patient M.S. failed to exhibit font-specific priming, despite preserved declarative memory. Therefore, perceptual specificity in visual priming depends on visual processes mediated by the right-occipital lobe rather than medial temporal and diencephalic regions involved in declarative memory.","1859":"Three-dimensional motion analyses were performed on trajectories of repetitive \"slicing\" gestures by 4 participants with left-hemisphere lesions and limb apraxia, 6 participants with right-hemisphere lesions, and 7 neurologically intact participants. Left hemispheric lesioned participants with apraxia, but not right hemispheric lesioned participants showed impaired coupling of spatial and temporal aspects of wrist trajectories and deficits in interjoint coordination. Both groups of brain-lesioned participants differed from control participants in the 3-D plane of the wrist motion. The deficits of some right hemispheric lesioned participants in controlling the plane of wrist motion may be a consequence of left hemispatial neglect with rightward deviations. In contrast, the deficits of apraxic participants in controlling wrist trajectories and coordinating joint motions seem to reflect a deficit in these participants for the movement plan.","1860":"Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is associated with behavioral and cognitive deficits. However, the majority of children born to alcohol-abusing women do not meet the formal criteria for FAS and it is not known if the cognitive abilities of these children differ from those of children with FAS. Using a set of neuropsychological tests, 3 groups were compared: (a) children with FAS, (b) children without FAS who were born to alcohol-abusing women (the PEA group), and (c) normal controls. The results indicated that, relative to controls, both the FAS and the PEA groups were impaired on tests of language, verbal learning and memory, academic skills, fine-motor speed, and visual-motor integration. These data suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure is related to a consistent pattern of neuropsychological deficits and the degree of these deficits may be independent of the presence of physical features associated with FAS.","1861":"A neuropsychological model of visual-motor integration skill was proposed and tested in 50 children with Tourette syndrome (TS) and 23 unaffected control children matched for age. Children with TS performed significantly worse than control children on the Beery Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) Test. Consistent with the proposed model, visuoperceptual and fine-motor coordination subprocesses were significant predictors of VMI scores. However, the subprocesses did not fully account for the diagnostic group difference on the VMI. These results suggest that the integration of visual inputs and organized motor output is a specific area of neuropsychological weakness among individuals with TS.","1862":"Attention and memory performances were studied in Persian Gulf War veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD showed relative performance deficiencies on tasks of sustained attention, mental manipulation, initial acquisition of information, and retroactive interference. Their performances were also characterized by errors of commission and intrusion. The tendency toward response disinhibition and intrusion on cognitive tasks was correlated positively with reexperiencing symptoms and negatively with avoidance-numbing symptoms. These cognitive deficit patterns are consistent with models of PTSD that emphasize the role of hyperarousal and implicate dysfunction of frontal-subcortical systems. Results suggest that intrusion of traumatic memories in PTSD may not be limited to trauma-related cognitions but instead reflects a more general pattern of disinhibition.","1863":"Deficits of motivation are recognized as a significant clinical problem following brain injury, and a neuropsychological model is postulated linking such deficits with cognitive deficits of a frontal type. However, few, if any, quantitative assessment measures exist; most descriptions in the literature are qualitative, and this has limited the scope and robustness of research into the problem. The authors in the present research have developed new tools for assessing patients' level of motivation in therapy (percent participation index) and their behavioral responsiveness to experimental incentive (the card-arranging reward responsivity objective test). Relationships among poor motivation, reward responsiveness, frontal lobe function, and mood were explored in a sample of 54 patients with nonfocal vascular or traumatic brain injury; the results were consistent with the neuropsychological model. Preliminary reliability and validation data on the new measures are reported.","1864":"To examine putative brain substrates of cognitive functions differentially affected by age the authors measured the volume of cortical regions and performance on tests of executive functions, working memory, explicit memory, and priming in healthy adults (18-77 years old). The results indicate that shrinkage of the prefrontal cortex mediates age-related increases in perseveration. The volume of visual processing areas predicted performance on nonverbal working memory tasks. Contrary to the hypotheses, in the examined age range, the volume of limbic structures was unrelated to any of the cognitive functions; verbal working memory, verbal explicit memory, and verbal priming were independent of cortical volumes. Nevertheless, among the participants aged above 60, reduction in the volume of limbic structures predicted declines in explicit memory. Chronological age adversely influenced all cognitive indices, although its effects on priming were only indirect, mediated by declines in verbal working memory.","1865":"Cerebral asymmetries in lexical ambiguity resolution were studied. In 2 experiments, targets related to the dominant and subordinate meanings of ambiguous word primes were presented for lexical decision after a 750-ms stimulus onset asynchrony. Experiment 1 compared presentation of target words to the left visual field\/right-hemisphere (LVF\/RH), to the right visual field\/left-hemisphere (RVF\/LH), or after redundant bilateral visual field (BVF) presentation. Experiment 2 examined unilateral priming in the absence of a BVF condition. On unilateral trials, priming was observed for dominant meanings in both the LVF\/RH and RVF\/LH, whereas subordinate priming was obtained only in the RVF\/LH. These results suggest a possible role of hemispheric interaction in the availability of ambiguous word meanings. BVF performance evidenced a bilateral redundancy gain and priming that resembled that obtained on RVF\/LH trials. Additional BVF analyses were not consistent with a strict race model interpretation and appear to implicate hemispheric cooperation in the bihemisperic processing of lexical information.","1866":"The effects of repetition and spacing of repetitions on amnesic patients' implicit task performance was studied. Amnesic patients and control participants performed a perceptual identification task, a word-stem completion task, and a category exemplar production task after the presentation of target words repeated within a list. Repetition proved to have no effect on perceptual identification or on word-stem completion, but it did play a role in category exemplar production. As expected, the amnesic patients demonstrated normal performance on the perceptual identification and word-stem completion tasks. However, on category exemplar production, the amnesic patients' performance was significantly below that of the control participants, and the 2 groups differentially responded to repetition. The normal control participants' spontaneous ability to analyze semantic features of words led to unconscious priming of the category and its links to the exemplars after only one presentation of a word. Amnesic patients, on the other hand, seemed to rely more on the fluency produced by multiple presentations.","1867":"Following medial temporal damage, mature humans are impaired in retaining new information over long delays but not short delays. The question of whether a similar dissociation occurs in children was addressed by testing children (ages 7-16) with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and controls on short- and long-term memory tasks, including a spatial delayed response task (SDR). Early-onset TLE did not affect performance on short delays on SDR, but it did impair performance at the longest delay (60 s), similar to adults with unilateral medial temporal damage. In addition, early-onset TLE affected performance on pattern recall, spatial span, and verbal span with rehearsal interference. No differences were found on story recall or on a response inhibition task.","1868":"Perceptual repetition priming was examined in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and normal control (NC) participants using a task involving the discrimination of geometric designs that had either a continuous (\"closed\") or discontinuous (\"open\") perimeter. With the open stimuli, the groups displayed significant and equivalent levels of priming after immediate repetition of the stimuli, whereas only the NC group primed significantly over a delay of three intervening items. Neither group demonstrated significant priming with the closed stimuli. Results indicate that under some conditions DAT patients can exhibit normal repetition priming with stimuli that do not have preexisting representations but that (due possibly to a deficiency in the level of steady-state cortical activation) this priming dissipates more rapidly in DAT patients than in NC participants.","1869":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with semantic memory difficulty and AD patients with relatively preserved semantic memory named pictures and judged the category membership of words and pictures of natural kinds and manufactured artifacts that varied in their representativeness. Only semantically impaired patients were insensitive to representativeness in their category judgments. AD subgroup judgments did not differ for natural kinds compared to manufactured artifacts nor for words compared to pictures. AD subgroup differences could not be explained by dementia severity, memory, reading, and visuoperception. The similarity process for relating coordinate members of a taxonomic category contributes to the normal appreciation of word and picture meaning, and this process is compromised in AD patients with semantic difficulty.","1870":"A battery of visuospatial perception tests was administered to 27 mild probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients; 21 were reassessed after 8 months. At the first evaluation, AD patients were impaired only in an object-naming task. After 8 months, the performance in the subtests of object perception was unchanged, while there was a significant decline in the total score of the items tapping space perception. A significant worsening was also observed in the Rey's figure copy score and was correlated with the decrease in the spatial perception score. This study confirms that an impairment in visual perceptual tests requiring access to semantic and lexical knowledge is present in the earliest phase of AD, whereas visuospatial and constructional impairments became evident only later. This pattern of progression may represent the clinical correlate of increasing pathological involvement of posterior associative cortex.","1871":"The authors sought to determine whether errors of action committed by patients with closed head injury (CHI) would conform to predictions derived from frontal lobe theories. In Study 1, 30 CHI patients and 18 normal controls performed routine activities, such as wrapping a present, under conditions of graded complexity. CHI patients committed more errors even on the simplest condition; but, except for a higher proportion of omitted actions, their error profile was very similar to that of controls. Study 2 involved a subset of patients whose performance in Study 1 was within normal limits. When these high functioning patients were asked to perform the routine tasks under still more taxing conditions, they, too, committed errors in excess of the control group. Accounts based on frontal mechanisms have a difficult time explaining the overall pattern of findings. An alternative based on limited-capacity resources is suggested.","1872":"This study investigated the role of the basal ganglia in timing operations. Nondemented, medicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and controls were tested on 2 motor-timing tasks (paced finger tapping at a 300- or 600-ms target interval), 2 time perception tasks (duration perception wherein the interval between the standard tone pair was 300 or 600 ms), and 2 tasks that controlled for the auditory processing (frequency perception) demands of the time perception task and the movement rate (rapid tapping) in the motor-timing task. Using A.M. Wing and A.B. Kristofferson's (1973) model, the total variability in motor timing was partitioned into a clock component, which reflects central timekeeping operations, and a motor delay component, which estimates random variability due to response implementation processes. The PD group was impaired at both target intervals of the time perception and motor-timing tasks. Impaired motor timing was due to elevated clock but not motor delay variability. The findings implicate the basal ganglia and its thalamocortical connections in timing operations.","1873":"Research on the effect of Parkinson's disease (PD) on verbal fluency has produced conflicting results. In this study, 88 PD patients with no dementia, 11 PD patients with questionable mental status, 15 PD patients with dementia, and 46 elders free from mental disorder were administered a variety of semantic, letter, and name fluency tasks. The results revealed that, contrary to popular assumption, semantic fluency was not always superior to letter fluency. Rather, verbal fluency was influenced by the nature of the individual categories. Interestingly, the relative difficulty of many categories was fairly stable across groups. The results also indicated that the individual fluency tasks were differentially sensitive to the mental status of the PD patients. Overall, the findings suggest that closer attention to the nature of the tested categories may help clarify the inconsistent effects of PD on verbal fluency.","1874":"One hundred fifty-one healthy older persons were administered the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) on 2 occasions, an average of 1.30 years apart. Means for age and education were 69.63 years (SD = 6.46) and 14.91 years (SD = 2.54), respectively. Stability coefficients ranged from .24 on number of perseverations to .76 for both List A total recall and long-delay free recall. Only 5 CVLT scores demonstrated a significant change on retest, and the overall magnitude of improvement was small. To assist clinicians in the process of detecting significant change on retest, the authors provide standard error of difference values and 90% confidence intervals for 22 CVLT scores.","1875":"Whereas verbal learning has received considerable attention by cognitive neuropsychology, spatial object learning has been more resistant to study. The paucity of visual learning data has hampered attempts to clarify if visual learning has unique features with specialized neural substrates. In schizophrenia, severe verbal learning impairment has been established, but lack of comparable visual learning measures has thwarted the dissociation of verbal and visual abilities. The Visual Object Learning Test (VOLT) was developed to examine aspects of visual-spatial learning and memory in a manner analogous to available verbal tests. Studies were performed to establish normative performance characteristics, convergent and divergent validity, and the sensitivity of the VOLT to detection of individual differences in normal (through sex and age) and pathologic variability (through persons with schizophrenia). The results indicated excellent internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and sensitivity to the effects of aging and pathology. Persons with schizophrenia were impaired in both learning and retention. The authors conclude that memory impairment in schizophrenia may not be specific to verbal learning.","1876":"The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and extent of neuropsychological abnormalities among HIV-infected individuals and to examine the interrelationships between measures of cognitive functions and the factors that predict neuropsychological abnormalities. The study focused on cross-sectional data gathered in a multidisciplinary research clinic form 200 HIV-infected (HIV +) men and women recruited from primary medical care settings. Composite scores representing six cognitive domains were derived from the neuropsychological test data. Scores of memory, fluency, spatial, and frontal functions could be predicted by independent assessment of participants' verbal and psychomotor speed abilities. Basic verbal ability itself was predicted by education, race, and handedness, whereas speed was predicted by age, CD4+ cell counts, and a lifetime history of major depression. This model of effects is consistent with the hypothesis that psychomotor slowing is central to mild cognitive disorder in HIV infection and that such changes are associated with markers of the severity of systemic infection.","1877":"The authors examined the neural and cognitive bases for sex differences in verbal memory in 57 patients who underwent left anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for the treatment of intractable seizures. On the California Verbal Learning Test (D. C. Delis, J. H. Kramer, E. Kaplan, &amp; B. A. Ober, 1987), women recalled more words than men both before and after surgery, regardless of the extent of hippocampal damage. Extent of hippocampal sclerosis was related to memory loss in both men and women. Women's superiority in verbal memory appears to result in part from their use of an efficient encoding strategy. Women were more likely than men to use semantic clustering both before and after ATL, and sex differences in word recall were attenuated after scores were adjusted for semantic clustering. There was no effect of ATL on semantic clustering. Taken together, these results suggest that sex differences in verbal memory are not due to differences in the integrity of the left hippocampus.","1878":"Although sex differences in verbal learning and memory have been reported in adults, much less is known about when these sex differences emerge and how they develop. In this study, 401 boys and 410 girls between the ages of 5 and 16 years were administered the California Verbal Learning Test--Children's Version. Sex differences were found at all age levels. Girls performed better than boys on all of the immediate and delayed recall trials and on the delayed recognition trial. Girls were also more likely than boys to use a semantic clustering strategy and displayed more effective long-term memory mechanisms. Boys made more intrusion errors and displayed greater vulnerability to interference between the 2 test lists. Because boys had higher mean scores on Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised Vocabulary, the observed female superiority in verbal learning could not be attributed to sex differences in overall word knowledge.","1879":"Male and female left- and right-handers participated in 3 experiments designed to investigate 3 components of performance asymmetry in lateralized tasks. Experiment 1 used a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) identification task measuring quantitative differences in hemispheric abilities and hemispheric control and qualitative differences in hemispheric strategies. The quantitative data revealed that left-handers have a smaller performance asymmetry than do right-handers and that both groups have the same degree of increased accuracy when stimuli are presented bilaterally. Handedness affected the qualitative measures of men, not of women. Experiment 2 used nominal and physical letter-matching tasks with bilateral presentations and measured the flexibility of callosal function. The results suggest that left-handers have less flexible interhemispheric communication than do right-handers and show no effect of gender. Experiment 3 used a chair identification task indexing hemispheric arousal bias. Left-handers tended to have more aroused right than left hemispheres, whereas the distribution of right-handers was centered around 0 arousal bias. Intertask analyses revealed a relationship between arousal bias and metacontrol, where individuals with more aroused right hemispheres tended to use a right-hemisphere strategy in the bilateral condition of the CVC experiment. Intercorrelations between measures from the experiments revealed only a limited relationship between metacontrol patterns in the CVC task and a measure of callosal flexibility in the physical letter-matching task. The results are discussed in the context of the relationships between dimensions of hemispheric asymmetry.","1880":"On the basis of prior studies of handedness, it was predicted that variations from modal asymmetry scores on cognitive tasks, in either direction from the mean, would be associated with an elevated incidence of classic markers of developmental instability (minor physical anomalies and fluctuating anatomic asymmetries). University students (N = 146) were administered 4 tasks that typically reveal functional asymmetries: the fused rhymed words dichotic listening task, the line bisection task, the chimeric faces task, and the cartoon faces task. A composite measure of developmental instability was computed from minor physical anomalies and fluctuating asymmetries. Participants with greater evidence of developmental instability had more atypical lateralization scores, deviating more from the sample mean, in either direction. Directional asymmetries were unrelated to developmental instability. These results suggest that developmental instability influences variation in the lateralization of cognitive skills as well as handedness.","1881":"Twenty closed-head-injured (CHI) patients and 28 control participants were tested on recall and recognition of words. In addition, memory for modality (i.e., visual vs. auditory) of word presentation was measured directly (i.e., recognition) and indirectly (i.e, by its influence on word and modality recognition). As predicted, the CHI patients were impaired relative to controls on all of the direct memory tasks; that is, word recall, word recognition, and modality judgment. However, the CHI and control groups did not differ significantly on the magnitude of the modality effect (i.e., facilitation due to correspondence of modality in learning and test). The findings are interpreted in the theoretical framework that distinguishes between item (i.e., words) and source (i.e., modality) memory and between direct and indirect measures of memory.","1882":"Previous studies have consistently demonstrated impairments in conceptual reasoning and set-shifting abilities in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Other executive functions have been less frequently examined. We compared 44 MS patients and 48 demographically matched controls on a temporal-ordering and semantic-encoding task and on a test of planning (Tower of Hanoi). Compared with controls, MS patients experienced deficient semantic encoding and planning but unimpaired temporal-order memory. For both tasks, post hoc analyses indicated that chronic-progressive MS patients contributed most to the group differences. A combination of poor planning and slowed information-processing speed was hypothesized to have contributed to MS patients' impaired Tower of Hanoi performance. Further research is needed to explore the possible relationship between semantic-encoding and planning deficits in MS and social and occupational disabilities.","1883":"Perseverative behavior has not been extensively studied in patients with dementia. In this study, perseverative behavior was elicited with the dementia version of the Graphical Sequence Test. A control group and participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (IVD) were studied. A factor analysis revealed a 3-factor model consisting of perseverations related to semantic knowledge, motor functioning, and a third, intermediary factor. IVD participants made more total perseverations than did AD participants. Perseverations made by AD participants were correlated with deficits on tests of semantic knowledge, whereas the perseverations made by IVD participants were correlated with motor and frontal systems tests. Results are consistent with the view that perseverative behavior is hierarchically arranged in terms of specific levels of cognitive complexity and the overall pattern of cognitive deficits associated with each type of dementia.","1884":"This study compared 32 patients with ischemic vascular dementia (IVD) to 32 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) on select language and verbal memory tests. The IVD and AD patients were individually matched on the basis of age, dementia severity, years of education, and gender. The IVD patients had poorer verbal fluency, but better free recall, fewer recal intrusions, and better recognition memory than the AD patients. Relationships between the neuropsychological measures and radiological indexes of cortical and subcortical pathology were also examined. Number of infarcts, white-matter lucency, and ventricular enlargement correlated with some of the neuropsychological measures; cortical atrophy correlated with most of the measures. The findings suggest that neuropsychological deficits in IVD may be related to dysfunction of frontal-subcortical circuits, although an associated degenerative cortical process may also be involved.","1885":"Schizophrenic individuals (n = 31), including paranoid and nonparanoid diagnostic subgroups, and normal controls (n = 20) participated in a semantic priming experiment involving a single-choice lexical decision task. For the automatic priming blocks, a 260-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was used; for the controlled priming blocks, 1,000-ms SOA was used. The paranoid subgroup showed significantly less priming than did the control group. The nonparanoid subgroup showed a decrease in priming compared with the control group that approached significance. There was an increased priming effect for the controlled compared with the automatic priming condition; this difference was not modulated by participant group. Nonsignificant semantic priming (equal to 0) occurred only for schizophrenic subgroups and only in automatic priming conditions.","1886":"Two lexical-decision tasks with 500-ms stimulus-onset asynchrony were conducted with 34 schizophrenic patients. This group consisted of 24 schizophrenic patients with thought disorder (TD) and 10 schizophrenic patients without thought disorder (NTD), 14 psychiatric controls (depressive illness), 20 hospitalized controls, and 20 normal controls. One lexical-decision task with semantic relations (related vs. unrelated, Experiment 1) and 1 task with syntactic relations (congruent vs. incongruent; Experiment 2) were used to evaluate processing of different lexical information. In Experiment 1, although all control groups and NTD schizophrenic patients showed semantic priming, TD schizophrenic patients did not. In Experiment 2, all groups showed a significant syntactic effect. These findings provide evidence for an abnormality in semantic processing and the preservation of syntactic processing in TD schizophrenic patients, thus suggesting a deficit in the processing of semantic information under certain conditions when compared with normal syntactic processing.","1887":"The authors examined whether 2 nondeclarative tasks, simple eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) and rotary pursuit (RP), would interfere with each other when performed simultaneously. In Experiment 1,100 participants were assigned to 1 of 5 groups: paired EBCC\/RP, unpaired EBCC\/RP, paired EBCC as a single task, unpaired EBCC as a single task, and RP as a single task. Participants in the paired EBCC\/RP group showed significantly greater acquisition of conditioned responses than did participants in the unpaired EBCC\/RP group, and the unconditioned eyeblink response was similar in both groups. Comparisons of the paired EBCC\/RP and paired EBCC-as-a-single-task groups indicated no differences in trials to criterion, but on some measures the single-task group conditioned better. Controls introduced in Experiment 2 did not change this pattern. Results provide some evidence for the lack of interference between EBCC and RP.","1888":"As neuropsychological mechanisms for attention have been hypothesized to be located in the right hemisphere of the brain, several investigators have begun to conceptualize attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related attentional deficits as involving right-hemispheric abnormalities. The authors evaluated and compared adult patients diagnosed with ADHD with a non-ADHD group of patients using a chronometric visual-spatial attention task that is sensitive to hemispheric differences in efficiency of information processing. Reaction times across different cuing conditions, cue-target delays, and visual fields were assessed. When participants' attention was misdirected with cues in the right visual field and attention had to be switched to a target on the left visual field, there was a longer delay among ADHD adults than non-ADHD adults, specifically when the interval between the cue and target was 800 ms as compared with 100 ms. This specific pattern of dysfunction was interpreted as a difficulty with maintaining attention possibly associated with anterior attention mechanisms in the right hemisphere.","1889":"The consensus of evidence published since 1924 suggests that parents report attention deficits, hyperactivity, or conduct disorder after pediatric head injury rather than postconcussion syndrome. In this study, the symptoms reported by children after mild (n = 38) and moderate-severe (n = 27) head trauma were compared to those reported after orthopedic injury (n = 47) and to adults matched for injury severity and chronicity by using a structured interview based on diagnostic criteria for postconcussion syndrome. Pediatric head trauma caused significantly more subjective symptoms after 6 weeks than orthopedic injury. These symptoms were related to head injury severity and the child's anxiety level. When assessed in a similar manner, children report postconcussion syndrome similar to that seen in adults.","1890":"This study identified and characterized a group of schizophrenic patients without neuropsychological (NP) impairment. A comprehensive NP battery was administered to 171 schizophrenic outpatients and 63 normal comparison participants. Each participant's NP status was classified through blind clinical ratings by 2 experienced neuropsychologists; 27% of the schizophrenics were classified as NP normal. The NP-normal and NP-impaired schizophrenics were similar in terms of most demographic, psychiatric, and functional characteristics, except that NP-normal patients had less negative and extrapyramidal symptoms, were on less anticholinergic medication, socialized more frequently, and were less likely to have had a recent psychiatric hospitalization. The existence of NP-normal schizophrenics suggests that the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia may be distinct from that causing some of its core psychiatric features.","1891":"Adult age differences in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) measures were examined before and after statistical control of age-related differences in measures of feedback usage, working memory, and perceptual-comparison speed. The proportion of age-related variance associated with a summary measure of WCST performance was greatly reduced after controlling for measures of feedback usage, working memory, and perceptual-comparison speed. Furthermore, the age-related variance associated with the feedback-usage measure was reduced after controlling for working memory and perceptual-comparison speed measures. These results are consistent with the idea that age-related performance differences in the WCST are partially mediated by adult age differences in feedback usage and that age differences in feedback usage are mediated by age differences in working memory, which are in turn-mediated by age-related reductions in processing speed, indexed by measures of perceptual-comparison speed.","1892":"Groups of healthy, community-dwelling younger and older adults performed a Stroop task in which color and word could be congruent or incongruent and spatially integrated or separated. During the task, continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. The magnitude of the Stroop interference effect and task-related EEG activation was greater for older than younger adults when stimuli were integrated. This effect was significant over medial and lateral frontal and parietal, but not occipital, regions. In comparison, interference and EEG activation did not differ for younger and older adults when stimuli were separated. These findings support the hypothesis that the anterior attention system is more sensitive to the effects of increasing age than the posterior attention system.","1893":"The present study examined whether cognitive variables measured at baseline could predict incident cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD) after a 3-year follow-up period. Twenty-six incident AD adults and 179 very old (M = 83.5 years) adults without dementia participated in a population-based study. Cognitive performance was indexed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and multiple indices of memory and visuospatial and verbal performance. A logistic regression analysis that controlled for age, gender, and education indicated that MMSE scores were reliable indicators of who would develop AD. In addition, recall of organizable words, recognition of faces, and letter fluency were reliable predictors of subsequent dementia status after differences in MMSE performance were partialed out. Thus, although the MMSE is useful in predicting dementia, there is an additional advantage of assessing specific indices of cognitive functioning. Further, supportive episodic memory tasks may be more salient predictors of incident AD than tasks that offer less supportive encoding or retrieval conditions.","1894":"The underlying mechanisms for impaired output on letter (F, A, and S) and category (e.g., animal) word list generation (WLG) tasks in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (IVD) were investigated. Normal control (NC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants were also studied. IVD and NC participants performed better on category than letter WLG tasks, whereas the opposite was observed among AD participants. IVD participants produced fewer responses than AD participants on letter WLG tasks, but there was no difference between AD and IVD participants on the \"animal\" WLG task. AD participants scored lower than IVD and NC participants on animal WLG indexes measuring semantic knowledge. There were few differences between IVD and NC participants. The reduced output on the animal WLG task for IVD participants is consistent with search-retrieval deficits. The reduced output of AD participants may be caused by degraded semantic knowledge.","1895":"Participants made judgments about the relative salience of category exemplars (e.g., fruit: apple or grape) or parts (e.g., plane: wings or seats). Mildly affected Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were as accurate but slower than normal controls, and their response times increased more for related (e.g., apple, grape, or fig) than unrelated (e.g., apple, gym, bandit) choices as the number of alternatives was increased from 2 to 3. Performance (accuracy and response times) of moderate-severely affected patients was poorer still, but number of distractors and relatedness did not interact. In combination with previous findings (e.g., M. K. Johnson, A. M. Hermann, &amp; J. L. Bonilla, 1995), these results suggest that the reflective processes necessary for deciding among competing alternatives show disruption early in the disease process. Such processing deficits would compound any difficulties arising from a degrading semantic structure.","1896":"Recognition and source memory were explored in healthy older adults, adults diagnosed with very mild dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), and adults diagnosed with mild DAT. Two sentence-completion tasks were used. In Task 1, half of the sentences were completed (clozed) by the participant, and half by the experimenter. In Task 2, half were participant clozed, and half were participant read (already clozed). Recognition of the cloze words and accuracy of categorizing them as participant generated or experimenter generated (Task 1) and participant generated or participant read (Task 2) were measured (source discrimination). Contrary to previous reports, the DAT groups showed the generation effect, that is, better recognition for participant-generated words than experimenter-generated words (Task 1) or read words (Task 2). Source discrimination was disproportionately impaired in the DAT groups.","1897":"Conditional associative learning (CAL), a measure validated in studies of frontal lesions, was used to evaluate the hypothesis that age-related cognitive decline is related to frontal dysfunction. Older adults and focal frontal participants showed impaired CAL performance, but the deficit was greater in the latter group, where it was specific to participants with dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) lesions. The deficits were attributable to strategic rather than basic associative processes. Error scores described ways in which past information failed to guide behavior, and they were related to lesion location. Congruence between older adults and DLPFC participants on a measure of defective inhibition suggests that age-related decline in inhibitory processes is due to DLPFC dysfunction.","1898":"To assess the nature and magnitude of memory impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS), the authors analyzed quantitatively 36 studies comparing the memory performance of MS participants to healthy controls. The authors studied (a) the pattern of impairment across short-term memory (STM), working memory (WM), and long-term memory (LTM); (b) the moderating influence of retrieval support on LTM impairment; (c) the covariation of WM and LTM impairment; and (d) the moderating influence of clinical characteristics of the MS sample on memory impairment. The analyses revealed significant impairment across all memory domains and failed to support a retrieval-based account of LTM dysfunction in MS patients. In addition, robust associations were found between clinical features of MS and memory impairment. The findings suggest a more global pattern of memory deficits in MS than has been previously believed, with deficits clearly associated with neurological disability and disease course.","1899":"Forgetting rates were examined in patients with diencephalic, temporal lobe, or frontal lesions. No significant differences were found in short-term forgetting of verbal and nonverbal material; in recognition memory for pictures, words, or designs over delays between 1 min and 20 or 30 min; or on a measure of explicit cued recall for words, calculated in terms of the process dissociation procedure. Significantly faster forgetting was found in the diencephalic and the temporal lobe groups in the free recall of pictures of objects, although there was no difference between these 2 groups. It is concluded that the major deficit in amnesic patients' memory processes is in the initial acquisition of information but that there is a subtler deficit in retention over specific delays, detectable only on measures of free recall.","1900":"Little is known about the neuropsychology of false recognition. D.L. Schacter, M. Verfaellie, and D. Pradere (1996) induced false recognition in amnesic patients and normal controls by exposing them to numerous semantic associates of a nonstudied word and found that amnesics showed significantly reduced levels of false recognition. To determine whether this outcome is specific to the semantic domain, the authors examined false recognition after exposure to lists of conceptually and perceptually related words. In the control group, conceptual false recognition was associated with \"remember\" responses and perceptual false recognition was associated with \"know\" responses. Amnesic patients showed reduced levels of conceptual and perceptual false recognition that were approximately equally divided between remember and know responses.","1901":"This study examines differential attention deficits in 19 temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, 15 generalized seizure patients (GSP), and 19 schizophrenic patients, compared to 20 normal controls. All participants were tested on a variable foreperiod reaction time (RT) task and continuous performance test (CPT). Temporal lobe epilepsy patients and schizophrenic patients show crossover deficits on the RT task requiring a conscious, effortful, preparatory motor set; while GSP show impairments on the CPT requiring vigilant, self-directed attention to external stimuli. The results suggest separate cortical and subcortical brain systems in the respective attentional deficits and in the etiologies of TLE, GSP, and schizophrenic disorders.","1902":"Automatic process development was investigated in a closed head injury (CHI) population. Ten severe CHI participants (&gt; 1 year postinjury) and 10 matched controls completed consistent mapping (CM) and varied mapping (VM) semantic-category memory search tasks. In VM search, despite a similar pattern of serial memory search, the CHI participants responded slower than controls and exhibited slower memory search rates throughout practice (1,800 trials). In CM search, after extensive practice (1,800 trials) both groups showed the performance characteristics indicative of automatic process development, that is, near-zero slopes and large reductions in response times. However, the CHI participants were slower to automatize the task. These results indicate that for memory-based search tasks the effects of a CHI may slow down the speed with which automatic processes develop but that CHI participants can acquire and use automatic processes in task performance.","1903":"The functional recovery of 47 right-brain-damaged stroke patients was studied over a 2-year period. The researchers hypothesized that sustained attention capacity should predict the degree of motor and functional recovery over this period because of a proposed privileged role of sustained attention in learning-based recovery of function. As predicted, significant correlations were found between sustained attention capacity at 2 months and functional status (including the Barthel Index) at 2 years. This relationship was shown to exist independently of 2-month functional status. Furthermore, compared with a left-brain-damaged group of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) patients, the right-brain CVA group did not recover functional ability as well over the 2-year period. This increasing difference in functional status over a 2-year period was mirrored by an emerging difference in sustained attention capacity, in favor of the left-brain CVA group.","1904":"Association learning and recognition memory were examined in 8 male alcoholic Korsakoff patients (mean age 58), and in the following 4 groups of 10 men: non-Korsakoff alcoholics (mean age 59), nonalcoholic controls (mean age 64), younger alcoholics (mean age 36), and nonalcoholic controls (mean age 37). The tasks were modeled after those used for testing memory functioning in nonhuman primates. Association learning, defined as the ability to distinguish rewarded from equally familiar nonrewarded visual stimuli, was impaired in Korsakoff patients. Korsakoff patients also were impaired on recognition memory-the ability to discriminate familiar from novel items. Results support the view of loss of multiple memory functions in alcoholic amnesia. An effect of aging was indicated by differences in performance levels between younger and older groups of non-Korsakoff participants, although the latter were superior to the Korsakoff patients.","1905":"Skill learning in early-stage Huntington's disease (HD) patients was compared with that of normal controls on 2 perceptual-motor tasks, rotary pursuit and mirror tracing. HD patients demonstrated a dissociation between impaired rotary-pursuit and intact mirror-tracing skill learning. These results suggest that different forms of perceptual-motor skill learning are mediated by separable neural circuits. A striatal memory system may be essential for sequence or open-loop skill learning but not for skills that involve the closed-loop learning of novel visual-response mappings. It is hypothesized that working memory deficits in HD resulting from frontostriatal damage may account broadly for intact and impaired long-term learning and memory in HD patients.","1906":"Previous researchers have claimed that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) learn new motor skills normally, although many AD patients cannot perform the tasks and must be eliminated from the analysis. Excluding them assumes that they have a deficit of motor performance (competence to perform the task), but not of motor learning (ability to improve performance). The present study administered 4 motor tasks to 20 AD patients and 20 controls. The results showed that the ability to complete 1 task (performance) did not predict the rate of improvement (learning) on another task, which indicates that AD patients do indeed have a performance deficit and not a general deficit of motor skill learning. Dementia ratings predicted the ability to perform tasks but not the ability to learn them. It is concluded that it is defensible to claim that AD patients learn a motor skill normally, even if some of the patients are unable to perform the task.","1907":"The proposition that cortically based perceptual representation systems (PRSs) are responsible for some implicit priming phenomena was examined by using event-related potentials (ERPs) in repetition and masked word priming. Experiment 1 used an explicit recognition task, in which repeated words replicated previous ERP repetition priming effects, whereas masked repetition priming revealed a new ERP effect with a posterior topography. Experiment 2 demonstrated ERP and behavioral priming in a lexical decision task for repetition and masked repetition priming. Topographical mapping of ERP repetition priming effects involved both early and late effects over the right and left anterior regions, whereas masked priming produced only an early ERP effect posteriorly. These results suggest differences between early and late ERP priming effects in terms of explicit recollection. Moreover, a posterior PRS may not be involved in some longer term implicit repetition priming effects.","1908":"The purpose of this study was to determine if normal participants and a patient with prosopanomia can be perceptually primed for proper names. To this end, 2 experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, normative data were collected on 4 proper-name priming tasks. The variables of levels of processing at encoding and age were manipulated. Robust priming results were obtained that were not influenced by either of these variables. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that prosopanomic patient N.G. demonstrated normal repetition priming, despite her marked impairment in deliberate retrieval of person and city names. These results are interpreted in terms of a dissociation between explicit and implicit memory for proper names and suggest that the deficit in prosopanomia only involves deliberate access to the name; access to presemantic representations of the visual word form remains intact.","1909":"Functional and anatomical relationships between working and declarative memory were investigated by contrasting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) change during standard working (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST) and declarative memory (Paired Associate Recognition Test, PART) tasks using identical stimulus-response modalities. The tasks and a resting baseline were administered to 30 participants (16 men, 14 women) during successive 10-min positron emission tomography 15O-water measures of rCBF. For both tasks, rCBF increased over baseline in inferior frontal and occipitotemporal regions, with more consistent dorsolateral prefrontal activation for WCST than PART. Additional orbitofrontal increases and dorsomedial decreases were seen for the PART. Activation patterns diverged when performance was considered. For the WCST, high performers activated dorsolateral and inferior frontal regions, whereas top PART performers activated only the occipitotemporal region. These results suggest operation of a frontotemporal network subserving both types of memory function that becomes more focal as performance increases.","1910":"This study evaluated whether deficits in memory for temporal order in patients with frontal lobe lesions result from impaired automatic encoding of temporal information or are secondary to deficits in effortful processes, such as the use of organizational strategies and control of interference. Patients with lesions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and control participants were tested on temporal order reconstruction of semantically related and unrelated word lists learned under intentional or incidental conditions. Memory for temporal order in patients with frontal lobe lesions was sensitive to semantic relatedness but not to intention to learn. Tests of item free recall and recognition using similar encoding manipulations indicated that order performance in these patients was dissociable from item memory. Results indicate that automatic processing of temporal information is intact in patients with frontal lobe lesions but that strategic processing of this information is impaired.","1911":"This study used tests of content memory (item recognition of words and abstract designs), context memory (order recognition of verbal and nonverbal items), and working memory (recognition at a short retention interval) to examine patterns of performance in 27 schizophrenic patients, 52 chronic alcoholic patients, and 66 healthy control participants. When performance was age- and IQ-adjusted the schizophrenia group was significantly impaired in item and order recognition of verbal and nonverbal material; the alcoholic group was impaired only in order recognition for both material types. Item- and order-recognition deficits in the schizophrenia group were greatest at the shortest retention intervals, a pattern previously observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting a prominence of a working memory deficit in schizophrenia.","1912":"Patients with defined frontal lobe lesions were assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on whether they showed a behaviorally assessed dysexecutive syndrome or were behaviorally normal. All participants were tested on dual-task performance and on 2 tasks assumed to measure frontal lobe function, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and verbal fluency. The dysexecutive group differed significantly from the nondysexecutive in showing impaired capacity for dual-task coordination, but there were no significant differences on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and verbal fluency. Results are interpreted in terms of a multicomponent central executive, whose function is linked to, but not coterminous with, the operation of the frontal lobes.","1913":"Procedural learning deficits are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but contradictory results have been reported in rotary pursuit learning. This article compared rotary pursuit learning in 2 nondemented PD groups and 2 normal control (NC) groups, using a between-subjects group design in which 3 rotation speeds were presented either randomly or in blocks. The pattern of learning differed between the randomized and the blocked conditions in the NC, but not in the PD groups. Learning was impaired in the PD group in the random condition only. Memory, visuospatial, or executive skills were not associated with the PD group's poorer learning in the randomized context. Results show that procedural learning deficits are not universal with basal ganglia abnormalities but rather depend on the specific cognitive requirements of the learning context.","1914":"The authors hypothesized that the pathophysiology of early Parkinson's disease (PD) may selectively target structures that support visual working memory for spatial relations but leave structures that support working memory for featural characteristics of objects relatively intact. Fifteen PD and 15 normal control participants took a visual delayed-response test with a spatial condition and a (nonspatial) object condition, equating the perceptual difficulty of the tests for each participant. The stimuli were irregular polygons presented at different locations on a computer screen. Results revealed a selective impairment of spatial delayed response in PD, indicating a disruption of spatial working memory unconfounded by sensory processing difficulties. The selectivity of this deficit may reflect the circumscribed nature of pathophysiological change affecting the caudate nucleus in early PD.","1915":"This study was designed to explore in a Taiwanese sample the factor structure of an aphasia test battery composed of parts of several standardized aphasia tests. A secondary goal was to assess effects of normal aging on the obtained factors. The sample was 120 healthy Taiwanese adults, ranging in age from 30 to 78 years. Principal-components analysis of the aphasia test battery revealed 5 factors: verbal comprehension, effortful writing, word production, automatized writing, and visuomotor coordination skills. Because the latter 2 factors have common psychological features, they can be combined and reinterpreted as a factor on the mechanics of writing. Further data analysis with factor scores shows that aging unfavorably influences verbal comprehension, effortful writing processing, and word production functions.","1916":"The phenomonology of Tourette's syndrome (TS) not only includes tics but also apparent deficits in attention. These attentional deficits in TS likely involve anomalies in frontal-striatal circuits. In this study, performance of 22 boys with TS and 22 age-matched boys without TS was compared on a continuous performance test (CPT) of attention. TS children demonstrated a normal capacity for discriminating targets from nontargets during the task, but showed significantly slower reaction times than controls. Severity of complex vocal tics was predictive of reaction time performance. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and include the presence of attentional difficulties in TS, interference associated with tic suppression, a conservative strategy taken by TS children, and a general impairment of motor performance.","1917":"Although verbal fluency is a frequently used neuropsychological test, little is known about the underlying cognitive processes. The authors proposed that 2 important components of fluency performance are clustering (i.e., the production of words within semantic or phonemic subcategories) and switching (i.e., the ability to shift between clusters). In Experiment 1, correlational data from 54 older and 41 younger adults indicated that both components were highly correlated with the number of words generated on semantic fluency, whereas switching was more highly correlated than clustering with the number of words generated on phonemic fluency. On semantic fluency, younger participants generated more words and switched more frequently than older participants; on phonemic fluency, older participants produced larger clusters than younger participants. In Experiment 2, among 22 young adults, divided attention decreased the number of words generated and decreased switching on phonemic fluency only. Overall, findings suggest that clustering and switching are dissociable fluency components and that switching is related to frontal-lobe functioning.","1918":"use of an odor learning test and the California Verbal Learning Test in young and elderly adults enabled comparison of age-related effects on recall and recognition memory. Assessment of odor identification further enabled study of which odor function (recall, identification, recognition) is most affected by aging, the odor functions' interrelationships, and predictors of odor recall. Results suggested that both recall and recognition were significantly affected by aging and that the odor-recall decline cannot simply be referred to poor identification. Very similar age-related effect sizes were found for the 3 types of odor functions. Finally, the combined ability to encode, store, and retrieve odors appears to predict overall recall performance (including its identification component) better than do identification and recognition.","1919":"The purposes of this study were to extend the literature on lateralization of perception of emotional verbal stimuli in normal individuals, including a test of both the right hemisphere and valence models, and to investigate predictions from these models regarding lateralization of memory for emotional verbal stimuli in normal individuals, an area that, to our knowledge, has not been investigated. Seventy-nine undergraduates were presented lateralized positive, negative, and neutral English words and nonwords. Participants were then asked to freely recall the presented words and, after a 20-min delay, to recognize the words. Recognition memory data provided strong support for the valence model. In addition, free-recall and perception data provided partial support for this model. The literature on the lateralization of processing emotional verbal and nonverbal material is discussed.","1920":"The authors examined whether perception of emotional stimuli is normal in amnesia and whether emotional arousal has the same enhancing effect on memory in amnesic patients as it has in healthy controls. Forty standardized color pictures were presented while participants rated each picture according to emotional intensity (arousal) and pleasantness (valence). An immediate free-recall test was given for the pictures, followed by a yes-no recognition test. Arousal and valence ratings were highly similar among the amnesic patients and controls. Emotional arousal (regardless of valence) enhanced both recall and recognition of the pictures, and this enhancement was proportional for amnesic patients and controls. Results suggest that emotional perception and the enhancing effect of emotional arousal on memory are intact in amnesia.","1921":"The 11-year longitudinal study of a right-handed male patient, L. C., who suffered from a severe amnesic syndrome following a softening in the right thalamus, is reported. Memory impairment involving retrograde and long-term anterograde memory, both verbal and spatial, persisted without modification. Investigation revealed some residual implicit learning ability. Positron emission tomography studies in the resting state displayed a bilateral hypometabolism of the mesial frontal lobes. Evidence suggests that a lesion confined to the thalamus may not on its own account for severe amnesia; that involvement of other structures is necessary for severe amnesia to appear; and that a functional investigation should always be included in cases of small thalamic lesions before drawing conclusions about the structures responsible for a given deficit.","1922":"Several computational models suggest that the hippocampal complex plays a key role in the establishment of new memories, but over time the storage of such memories becomes independent of this region. In support of such models, the authors demonstrate that patients with semantic dementia, who have relative sparing of the hippocampal complex, show a pattern of preserved recent memories and impaired distant memories. In a group study that used the Autobiographical Memory Interview, amnesic patients with Alzheimer's disease showed the more typical temporally graded loss (poor recall of recent memories), whereas patients with semantic dementia showed the reverse pattern. In a single-case study, using the Galton-Crovitz test, a patient with semantic dementia was significantly better at producing autobiographical memories from the most recent 5 years. By contrast, controls provided similarly detailed memories across all time periods back to childhood.","1923":"The authors investigated the relationship between performance on neuropsychological tests, which were sensitive to medial-temporal and frontal lobe function, and implicit and explicit stem completion in a group of healthy elderly participants (mean age = 77.3 years). Several stem-completion conditions varying in the size of the search space and the specificity of the cues were included. Across conditions, performance on a frontal lobe sensitive test (word fluency) and on medial-temporal tests (California Verbal Learning Test; delayed recall) correlated with explicit stem completion. The correlations between frontal and medial-temporal test performance and implicit stem completion were weaker. However, a relationship was observed between frontal lobe functioning and stem completion when (a) the search space was large and the cues were constrained and (b) when the search space was limited and the cues were relatively unconstrained. Therefore, the role of the frontal lobes in implicit stem completion seems to be to detect bias resulting from prior study, and this involvement can only be revealed when the interaction between the size of the search space and the retrieval cues (a) makes bias detection necessary and (b) allows it to play a role. The stronger involvement of the frontal lobes in explicit stem completion likely reflects strategic retrieval processes, and the medial-temporal lobe involvement may be related to verification processes.","1924":"To examine the status of conceptual memory processes in amnesia, a conceptual memory task with implicit or explicit task instructions was given to amnesic and control groups. After studying a list of category exemplars, participants saw category labels and were asked to generate as many exemplars as possible (an implicit memory task) or to generate exemplars that had been in the prior study list (an explicit memory task). After incidental deep or shallow encoding of exemplars, amnesic patients showed normal implicit memory performance (priming), a normal levels-of-processing effect on priming, and impaired explicit memory performance. After intentional encoding of exemplars, amnesic patients showed impaired implicit and explicit memory performance. Results suggest that although amnesic patients can show impairments on implicit and explicit conceptual memory tasks, their deficit does not generalize to all conceptual memory tasks.","1925":"Unilateral spatial neglect declines when participants reach to grip the center of long metal rods compared with when they point to the perceived center, suggesting that visuomotor control systems are less affected by neglect than other representational systems (I. H. Robertson, D. Nico, &amp; B. Hood, 1995). In this study, 16 participants with unilateral left neglect actually picked up rods, and we predicted short-term improvements in neglect because of induced conflict between a phenomenally symmetrical visual world on the one hand and a proprioceptively conveyed rightward-biased world on the other. With participants serving as their own controls, significant short-term improvements in neglect were found on 2 out of 4 neglect tasks after participants experienced proprioceptive feedback discrepant from the judgments they made on the basis of visual information alone.","1926":"Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) perform deficiently on Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM), in contrast to their relatively good performance on many other problem-solving tasks. The question is raised as to whether a visuospatial deficit may account for poor RCPM performance in PD. The authors analyzed RCPM results in 50 nondemented participants with PD and 39 age-matched healthy control participants. The PD group made significantly more errors than the control group on all RCPM subtests, including the subtest that mainly assessed visuospatial function (RCPM-A). For the PD group, the composite score of other visuospatial tests, but not the composite scores of tests of executive function or verbal memory, significantly predicted performance on the RCPM-A. Visuospatial impairment in PD may arise from dysfunction of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit that also includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and, importantly, the posterior parietal lobes.","1927":"Does spatial attention follow a full preattentive analysis of the visual field, or can attention select from ungrouped regions of the visual field? We addressed this question by testing an apperceptive agnosic patient, J. W., in tasks involving both spatial selection and preattentive grouping. Results suggest that J.W. had intact spatial attention: He was faster to detect targets appearing at cued location relative to targets appearing at uncued locations. However, his preattentive processes were severely disrupted. Gestalt grouping and symmetry perception, both thought to involve preattentive processes, were impaired in J. W. Also, he could not use gestalt grouping cues to guide spatial attention. These results suggest that spatial attention is not completely dependent on preattentive grouping processes. We argue that preattentive grouping processes and spatial attention may mutually constrain one another in guiding the attentional selection of visual stimuli but that these 2 processes are isolated from one another.","1928":"Covert orienting of visuospatial attention in response to peripherally presented cues was assessed in healthy younger and older adults and those with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) during a simple detection task. The results yield both an age-related increase (Experiments 1 and 2) and a DAT-related increase (Experiment 2) in the facilitatory effect of a single peripheral cue on detection. By contrast, equivalent inhibition of return (i.e., a slowing of target detection at previously cued locations) was observed for all 3 groups when a 2nd cue was presented at central fixation. Results suggest that both healthy older adults and individuals with DAT experience changes in the posterior attention system thought to subserve visuospatial attention. Results also suggest limitations on the generality of inhibitory deficits in healthy aging and DAT.","1929":"It was hypothesized that slowed visual search in healthy adult aging arises from reduced ability to adjust the size of the attentional focus. A novel, cued-visual search task manipulated the scale of spatial attention in a complex field in healthy elderly individuals and patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Precues indicated with varying validity the size and location of the area to be searched. Location precues exerted the strongest effects on conjunction search and the weakest effects on feature search. As the size of valid location cues decreased, conjunction search was facilitated. These effects declined progressively with advanced age and the onset of DAT. As the size of invalid cues increased, conjunction search was first facilitated, then slowed, but neither age nor DAT altered this effect. These results indicate that both Alzheimer's disease and, to a lesser degree, advanced aging, reduce control of the spatial focus of attention."},"articletitle":{"0":"Facial emotion recognition in Parkinson's disease: The role of executive and affective domains.","1":"How well do online, self-administered measures correspond to in-lab assessments?
