Adding the amino acid, a bio-derived additive, contributed to higher external specific surface area and more active sites, featuring a simple, environment-friendly and feasible strategy to regulate the growth of nanosheets. Herein, in the reaction of furfural alcohol with ethanol, the performance of silico-phospho-aluminum nanosheets is significantly improved compared with typical silicon phosphorus aluminum catalyst SAPO-34. The yield of ethyl levulinate with the use of silico-phospho-aluminum nanosheets was 7.8 times higher than that of SAPO-34, and meanwhile the amount of undesirable byproduct diethyl ether was decreased by two orders of magnitude and negligibly produced compared with SAPO-34. Moreover, replacing part of aluminum isopropoxide with aluminum sulfate as aluminum source can introduce sulfate in situ in the process of catalyst synthesis and increase the amount of acid sites on the catalyst.","9":"Lignin is an abundant natural polymer obtained from lignocellulosic biomass and rich in aromatic substructures. When efficiently depolymerized, it has great potential in the production of value-added chemicals. Fast pyrolysis is a promising depolymerization method, but current studies focus mainly on small quantities of lignin. To determine the potential for upscaling, we evaluated the systems used in the most relevant unit operations of fast pyrolysis of lignin. Fluidized-bed reactors have the most potential. It would be beneficial to combine them with the following: slug injectors for feeding, hot particle filters, cyclones, and fractional condensation for product separation and recovery.

Screening and optimization experiments were performed using an automated microfluidic platform, which enabled a drastic reduction in the material consumption compared to conventional laboratory practices. A suitable catalytic system was identified from a library of Ru II -diamino precatalysts. In situ precatalyst activation was studied with 1 H\/ 31 P NMR, and the reaction was scaled up to multigram quantities in a batch autoclave. These reactions were monitored using an automated liquid-phase sampling system. Ultimately, our automation-assisted approach provided multigram quantities of the target enantiopure alcohol product in less than a week of total experimental time.","13":"A solvent-free method for the synthesis of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) by iodoquaternization of alkenes with N-heteroarenes is reported.

Demonstrated by 50 examples, the generated QAS is proved to be able to produce valuable chemicals, such as biological protease inhibitors, anti-cancer agents and organic fluorescent materials.","14":"The selective upconversion of 5-hydroxymethyfurfural (HMF), a biomass derived platform molecule to value added chemicals can ease the burden on petroleum based fine chemical synthesis. The active contribution of renewable energy sources along with low cost, environment friendly and simple reaction systems must be adopted for better sustainability. In this context, photocatalytic selective hydrogenation of HMF to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) is achieved over P25 Titania nanoparticles without chemical squander. Simultaneously the photo-oxidation of p-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MeOBA) to p-methoxybenzaldehyde (MeOBaL) similar to biomass-derived vanillin is carried out abolishing the need of additional redox reagents. This system put forwards the competent employment of photogenerated excitons for the valorization of lignocellulosic biomass to fine chemicals which is an urgent requirement for sustainable chemical synthesis.","15":"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 has attracted enormous interest as a sustainable and renewable source of energy. In the past decade, numerous bulk-type semiconductors have been developed, but the existing designs suffer many limitations, namely rapid recombination of charge carriers and weak light absorption ability. Herein, we report a bottom-up approach to design atomically thin sulfur-doped Bi2WO6 perovskite nanosheets (S-BWO) with improved reduction ability, extended visible light absorption, prolonged lifetime of charge carriers, enhanced adsorption of CO2, and reduced work function. Compared with pristine Bi2WO6 (P-BWO), S-BWO nanosheets have exhibited a 3-fold improvement in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 under simulated sunlight irradiation. Experimental studies and DFT calculations reveal the synergistic roles of atomically thin nanosheets and S atoms in promoting photocatalytic efficiency.","16":"Despite the potential of hydrogen (H2) storage in liquid organic carriers to achieve carbon neutrality, the energy required for H 2 release and the cost of catalyst recycling have hindered its large-scale adoption. In response, we report a photo flow reactor packed with rhodium (Rh)\/titania (TiO2) photocatalyst for the continuous and selective acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline to H 2 gas and quinoline under visible light irradiation at room temperature. The tradeoff between the reactor pressure drop and its photocatalytic surface area is resolved by selective in-situ photodeposition of Rh in the photo flow reactor post-packing on the outer surface of the TiO2 microparticles available to photon flux, thereby reducing the optimal Rh loading by 10 times compared to a batch reactor, while facilitating catalyst reuse and regeneration. An example of using quinoline as a hydrogen acceptor to lower the energy of the hydrogen production step is demonstrated via the Water-Gas Shift reaction.","17":"Supercapacitors (SCs) can effectively allevSupercapacitors (SCs) can effectively alleviate problems such as energy shortage and serious greenhouse effect. The properties of electrode materials directly affect the performance of SCs. Rare earth (RE) is known as \"modern industrial vitamins\" , and their functional materials have been listed as key strategic materials. In the past few years, the number of scientific reports on RE-based nanomaterials for SCs increases rapidly, in which it is confirmed that adding RE elements or compounds to the host electrode materials with various nanostructured morphologies can greatly enhance their electrochemical performance. Although RE-based nanomaterials have made rapid progress in SCs, there is very few works on a comprehensive survey of this field. In view of this, a comprehensive overview of RE-based nanomaterials for SCs is provided here, including the preparation methods, nanostructure engineering, compounds and composites along with their capacitance performances. The structure-activity relationships are discussed and highlinghted. Meanwhile, the future challenges and perspectives are also pointed out. This work can not only provide guidance for the further development of SCs, but also arouse great interest in RE-based nanomaterials in other research fields such as electrocatalysis, photovoltaic cells and lithium batteries.","18":null,"19":"Invited for this month's cover is the Working Group Sustainable Chemistry of the European Society of Applied Biocatalysis (ESAB).

Herein, a one-step preparation of 2-HOL using 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as a substrate was reported for the first time. Several Au-based catalysts supported on different metal-oxide were prepared to explore the relationships between carriers and catalytic activity. The results showed that the highest 2-HOL yield of 65.8% was obtained at complete HMF conversion over the 5%Au\/ZrO2 catalyst. The 5%Au\/ZrO2 catalyst exhibited excellent durability after five consecutive recycling runs, while confirming its remarkable ring-opening hydrogenolysis on other biomass-derived furanics, furfural, and the total yield of 1-pentanol and 2-pentanol was 67.4%. The distinguished ring-opening hydrogenolysis performance of the Au\/ZrO2 catalyst originates from a synergistic effect between the interfacial Au-O-Zr oxygen vacancies induced Lewis acidic sites (activating C-OH\/C=O bonds) and metallic Au (activating H2). This work provides a possibility for producing 2-HOL from HMF with a high yield, expanding the sustainable application of lignocellulosic biomass.","23":"The oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is highly attractive as FDCA is considered as substitute for the petrochemically derived terephthalic acid. There are only few reports on the direct use of unrefined HMF solutions from biomass resources and the influence of remaining constituents on the catalytic processes. In this work, the oxidation of HMF in a solution as obtained from hydrolysis and dehydration of saccharides in chicory roots was investigated without intermediate purification steps. The amount of base added to the solution was critical to increase the FDCA yield. Catalyst deactivation occurred and was attributed to poisoning by amino acids from the bio-source. A strong influence of amino acids on the catalytic activity was found for all supported Au, Pt, Pd and Ru catalysts. A supported AuPd(2:1)\/C alloy catalyst exhibited both superior catalytic activity and higher stability against deactivation by the critical amino acids.","24":"2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is one of the promising renewable plastic monomers enabling to address several environmental issues, instead of petroleum-based terephthalic acid (TPA). In this study, we developed the integrative process for the co-production of FDCA and furfural as well as activated carbon and evaluated the economic feasibility and environmental sustainability for the proposed process. In the proposed process, there are major four catalytic conversion reactions: (1) hydrolysis of biomass to its derivatives (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), (2) dehydration of hemicellulose to furfural, (3) dehydration of cellulose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and (4) successive oxidation of HMF to FDCA. Particularly, a heat exchanger network coupled with a heat pump was established to minimize the utility consumption, thereby reducing 72% of the heating requirement. Our technoeconomic analysis revealed that the minimum selling price of FDCA was $1,380\/ton, which is comparable to that of petroleum-based TPA ($1,445\/ton). Uncertainty analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation method was employed to quantify the risk associated with the unforeseen market condition. From the life-cycle assessment, we observed that the proposed process is more environmentally sustainable compared to conventional TPA production in terms of climate change and fossil depletion metrics.","25":null,"26":null,"27":"2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is currently considered one of the most relevant bio-sourced building blocks, representing a fully sustainable competitor for terephthalic acid as well as the main component in green polymers such as poly(ethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF). The oxidation of biobased 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents the most straightforward approach to obtain FDCA, thus attracting the attention of both academia and industries, as testified by Avantium with the creation of a new plant expected to produce 5000 tons per year. Several approaches allow the oxidation of HMF to FDCA. Metal-mediated homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, metal-free catalysis, electrochemical approaches, light-mediated procedure, as well as biocatalytic processes, share the target to achieve FDCA in high yield and mild conditions.

The majority of them enter environment through landfilling or discarding after turning into wastes, causing severe carbon loss and imposing high risk to ecosystem and human health. Currently, physical recycling serves as the primary method to reuse plastic waste, but this method is limited to thermoplastic recycling. The quality of recycled plastics gradually deteriorates because of the undesirable degradation in the recycling process. Under such background, catalytic upcycling, which can upgrade various plastic wastes into value-added products under mild conditions, has attracted recent attention as a promising strategy to treat plastic wastes. This review highlights recent advances in the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts and useful strategies for upcycling plastics into liquid hydrocarbons, arene compounds, carbon materials, hydrogen and other value-added chemicals. The functions of catalysts and the reaction mechanisms are discussed.

The development of this technology is, however, limited by the uncontrolled selectivity, resulting from the highly reactive nature of H2O2 and the thermodynamically favored deep oxidation to form CO2. This study demonstrates that formic acid can be produced with a high selectivity (up to 80.3% at 313 K) from the Fenton-type oxidation of guaiacol and several other lignin derivatives over a bimetallic Fe-Cu catalyst supported on a ZSM-5 zeolite. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations unveil that the micropores of the zeolite support, which contains active metal sites, prefer to adsorb C2-C4 intermediates over formic acid because of its stronger dispersive interaction with larger guest molecules. This confinement effect significantly suppresses the secondary oxidation of formic acid, accounting for the uniquely high formic acid selectivity over Fe-Cu\/ZSM-5.","31":"This work elaborates the effect of dynamic irradiation on light-driven molecular water oxidation to counteract catalyst deactivation. It highlights the importance of overall reaction engineering to overcome limiting factors in artificial photosynthesis reactions. Systematic investigation of a homogenous three component ruthenium-based water oxidation system revealed significant potential to enhance the overall catalytic efficiency by synchronizing the timescales of photoreaction and mass transport in a capillary flow reactor. The overall activity could be improved by a factor of more than 10 with respect to the turnover number and a factor of 31 referring to the external energy efficiency by controlling the local availability of photons.

An abundance of many functional groups of the same type, such as primary or secondary hydroxy groups in carbohydrates, however, limits the synthetic usefulness if similar reactivities cannot be differentiated. Therefore, selective defunctionalization of highly functionalized biobased starting materials to differentially functionalized compounds can provide a sustainable access to chiral synthons, even in case of products with fewer functional groups. Selective defunctionalization reactions, without affecting other functional groups of the same type, are of fundamental interest for biocatalytic reactions. Controlled biocatalytic defunctionalizations of biobased raw materials are attractive for obtaining valuable platform chemicals and building blocks. The biocatalytic removal of functional groups, an important feature of natural metabolic pathways, can also be utilized in a systemic strategy for sustainable metabolite synthesis.","38":"5-hydroxymethylfufural (HMF) is an intriguing platform molecule that can be obtained from biomasses and that can lead to the production of a wide range of products, intermediates or monomers. The presence of different moieties in HMF (hydroxyl, aldehyde, furan ring) allows to carry out different transformations such as selective oxidations and hydrogenations, reductive aminations, etherifications, decarbonylations, and acetalyzations. This is a great chance in a biorefinery perspective but requires the development of active and highly selective catalysts. In this view, homogeneous catalysis can lead to efficient conversion of HMF at mild reaction conditions.

Under this perspective, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents a key molecule deriving from biomass characterized by remarkable potential as platform-chemical. In this work, for the first time, the hydrogenation of HMF in ethanol can be selectively addressed towards 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) or 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF) by properly tuning the reaction conditions in the presence of the same commercial catalyst (Ru\/C), reaching the highest yields of 80 and 93 mol%, respectively. These diols represent not only interesting monomers but strategic precursors for two scarcely investigated ethoxylated bio-fuels, 2,5-bis(ethoxymethyl)furan (BEMF) and 2,5-bis(ethoxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BEMTHF). Therefore, the etherification with ethanol of pure BHMF and BHMTHF and of crude BHMF, as obtained from hydrogenation step, substrate scarcely investigated in the literature, was performed with several commercial heterogeneous acid catalysts. Among them, the zeolite HZSM-5 (Si\/Al = 25) was the most promising system, achieving the highest BEMF yield of 74 mol%. In particular, for the first time, the synthesis of the fully hydrogenated diether BEMTHF was thoroughly studied and a novel cascade process for the tailored conversion of HMF to the diethyl ethers BEMF and BEMTHF was proposed.","42":"Metal-ion batteries emerged as promising candidates for energy storage system due to their unlimited resources and competitive price-performance ratio.

Two dimensional (2D) materials are widely explored for the purpose because of their unique physical and chemical properties, abundant active sites, and easy fabrication. Here, we present a new family of 2D M 4 B 6 X 6 and investigate their physical and chemical properties for their potential applications into electrocatalysis based on first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that 2D M 4 B 6 X 6 (M = Cr, Mo, and W; X = O and F) are stable dynamically, thermodynamically, and mechanically, and show intriguing electronic and catalytic properties. Importantly, we find that M 4 B 6 O 6 shows the intrinsic OER activity. Our results demonstrate that: (1) the adsorbate-escape mechanism dominates the OER of Cr 4 B 6 O 6 , leading to a low overpotential of 0.631 V; (2) the partial oxidization on the surfaces of M 4 B 6 F 6 can improve the catalytic performance dramatically; and (3) the surface reconstruction greatly promotes the OER performance of M 4 B 6 X 6 . Our findings illustrate that the surface reconstruction is critical to the OER activity, which may provide new strategy on the design of 2D materials for electrocatalysis, and offer theoretical insight into the catalytic mechanism.","44":"It is estimated that all fossil fuels will be depleted by 2060 if we continue to use them at the present rate. Therefore, there is an unmet need for an alternative source of energy with high calorific value. In this regard, hydrogen is considered the best alternative renewable fuel which could be used in practical conditions. Accordingly, researchers are looking for an ideal hydrogen storage system under ambient conditions for feasible applications. In many respects, carbon-based sorbents have emerged as the best possible hydrogen storage media. These carbon-based sorbents are cost-effective, eco-friendly, and readily available. In this review article, the present status of carbon-based materials in promoting solid-state hydrogen storage technologies at the operating temperature and pressure is reported. Experimental studies have shown that some carbon-based materials such as mesoporous graphene and doped carbon nanotubes may have hydrogen storage uptake of 3-7 wt%, while some theoretical studies have predicted up to 13.79 wt% of hydrogen uptake at ambient conditions.

Owing to their finely modified electronic and geometric properties, carbon-based nanocatalysts have shown great capability to regulate their catalytic activity and stability. Their well-defined and uniform structures also provide both the opportunity to explore intrinsic reaction mechanisms and the site-requirement for valorization of renewable platform molecules to advanced fuels and chemicals. This Review highlights the progress achieved in carbon-based nanocatalysts, mainly by using effective regulation approaches such as heteroatom anchoring, bimetallic synergistic effects, and carbon encapsulation to enhance catalyst performance and stability, and their applications in renewable platform molecule transformations.

Cyclic organosulfide, i.e. , lenthionine, as a natural material that can provide excellent ratio of effective atoms (S) and non-efficient atoms (C, H and others), has a high theoretical specific capacity of 853.6 mAh g -1 . However, the multiphase transformation causes rapid capacity decay and hysteresis of charge\/discharge voltage plateaus. To overcome these issues, a receptor, i.e. , phenyl disulfide (PDS), is introduced to truncate subsequent transformations directly from the source and change the reaction path, inhibits the capacity decay, and improves the cycling stability. After 500 cycles, the capacity retention is 81.1% with PDS, which is in sharp contrast to that (35.6%) of the control cell.

Mono (Ni@C, Co@C) and bimetallic (NiCo@C) nanoparticles with different Ni\/Co ratios partially covered by a thin carbon layer were prepared and characterized. Results showed that a NiCo catalyst, (molar ratio Ni\/Co=1, ( Ni 0.5 Co 0.5 @C ), displays excellent activity and selectivity for performing the hydrogenative ring-rearrangement of HMF into HCPN (&gt;90% yield). The high selectivity of the catalyst can be attributed to the formation of NiCo alloy structures as hydrogenating sites that limits competitive reactions such the hydrogenation of furan ring and the over-reduction of the formed HPCN. The subsequent reductive amination of HPCN with aqueous ammonia was successfully performed giving the target cyclopentylaminoalcohol in 97 % yield.

Despite the optoelectronic properties of both tetramers being nearly identical, the two tetramers exhibited very different molecular geometries. The twisted spirobifluorene NPDI tetramer (sbfNPDI4) was found to have an extended and flexible geometry, while the planar pyrene NPDI tetramer (pyrNPDI4) exhibited a highly congested and conformationally locked geometry. Organic photovoltaic devices were constructed to demonstrate the use of both new compounds as electron acceptor materials, where slightly higher power conversion efficiencies were achieved with pyrNPDI4 than sbfNPDI4.

Aqueous processing of such materials, although desirable to reduce costs and improve sustainability, remains challenging due to the Li+ \/H+ exchange upon contact with water, resulting in a pH increase and corrosion of the aluminum current collector. Herein, an example was given for tuning the properties of aqueous LiNi0.83 Co0.12 Mn0.05 O2 electrode pastes using a lithium polyacrylate-based binder to find the \"sweet spot\" for processing parameters and electrochemical performance. Polyacrylic acid was partially neutralized to balance high initial capacity, good cycling stability, and the prevention of aluminum corrosion. Optimized LiOH\/polyacrylic acid ratios in water were identified, showing comparable cycling performance to electrodes processed with polyvinylidene difluoride requiring toxic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent.

Herein, a non-noble Ni-Mn bifunctional catalyst supported on activated carbon (Ni-Mn\/AC) was developed by an incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalyst was found to be economic and efficient for the selective hydrodeoxygenation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) to 2, 5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF). The optimal Ni-Mn\/AC (Ni\/Mn = 3) catalyst achieved 98.5% of 2,5-DMF yield with 100% conversion of 5-HMF under mild reaction conditions of 180 oC, 2.0 MPa H2 for 4 h. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited outstanding reusability and could be recycled eight times without loss of activity. The addition of Mn not only enhanced the reactivity of 5-HMF, but also resulted in the dominant reaction pathway shift from the hydrogenation of the C=O bond to the hydrogenolysis of C-OH bond, which was attributed to the synergy of highly dispersed Ni metallic nanoparticles and moderate Lewis acid sites from MnOx as revealed by detailed characterizations.","66":"Direct seawater electrolysis utilizes natural seawater as the electrolyte. Hydroxide ions generated from the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode induce the precipitation of inorganic compounds, which block the active sites of the catalysts, leading to high cell voltage. To mitigate inorganic scaling, herein, an optimized interface between a porous electrode and a bipolar membrane (BPM, as a separator) was suggested in zero-gap seawater electrolyzers. Despite the formation of inorganic deposits at the front side (facing bulk seawater) of the porous cathode due to the water reduction reaction, the back side facing the cation exchange layer of the BPM remained free from thick inorganic deposits. This was ascribed to the locally acidic environment generated by proton flux from water dissociation at the BPM, enabling stable hydrogen production via the proton reduction at low overpotential. This asymmetric hydrogen evolution reaction at the porous cathode led to a considerably lower cell voltage and higher stability than that achieved with the mesh electrode. Moreover, precipitation at the front side of the porous cathode was further mitigated through acidification of the seawater by introducing an open area of the BPM that was not in contact with the porous cathode, allowing free protons that were not involved in the electron transfer reaction to diffuse out into the bulk seawater. These findings may provide critical guidance for the investigation of interfacial phenomena for the complete mitigation of inorganic scaling in the direct electrolytic splitting of seawater.","67":"5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the most valuable biomass platform molecules, enabling the construction of a plethora of high value-added furanic compounds.

This Review presents recent examples of the different approaches to link the hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties into the hydrophobic furan (and tetrahydrofuran) ring, giving a variety of biobased surfactants that have been classified here according to the charge of the head polar group. Moreover, strategies for the synthesis of different non-furanic structures surfactant molecules (such as levulinic acid, cyclopentanols, and aromatics) derived from HMF are described.

Here, a series of COFs (([OMe]x -TzDa (TzDa is composed only by monomerics Tz and Da, OMe represents the incorporation of monomeric Dm)) with different ratios of OMe and OH were designed and synthesized. The photochemical behavior of [OMe]x -TzDa changed significantly due to the synergistic effect of aggregation induced emission (AIE), intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) effects. [OMe]2 -TzDa, which contained a ratio of 2\/1 of OMe\/OH, showed the strongest fluorescence emission in water and the best linear relationship for the detection of pH. Furthermore, [OMe]2 -TzDa was used to monitor HCl and NH3 gases and showed a color change, visible to the naked eye. Therefore, a \"confidential pigment\" was successfully made.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone has received widespread attention in the research of PEMs owing to its tertiary amine basic groups and exceptional hydrophilic properties. This review focuses on the application status of polyvinylpyrrolidone-based PEMs in PEMFC, vanadium redox flow battery, and alkaline water electrolysis, and describes in detail the key scientific problems in these fields, providing constructive suggestions and guidance for the application of polyvinylpyrrolidone-based PEMs in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.","71":"In the last two decades, several PET-degrading enzymes from already known microorganisms or metagenomic sources have been discovered to face the growing environmental concern of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accumulation. However, there is a limited number of high-throughput screening protocols for PET-hydrolyzing activity that avoid the use of surrogate substrates. Herein, a microplate fluorescence screening assay was described. It was based on the coupled activity of ketoreductases (KREDs) and diaphorase to release resorufin in the presence of the products of PET degradation. Six KREDs were identified in a commercial panel that were able to use the PET building block, ethylene glycol, as substrate. The most efficient KRED, KRED61, was combined with the diaphorase from Clostridium kluyveri to monitor the PET degradation reaction catalyzed by the thermostable variant of the cutinase-type polyesterase from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190. The PET degradation products were measured both fluorimetrically and by HPLC, with excellent correlation between both methods.","72":null,"73":"Thermosetting polymeric materials have advantageous properties and are therefore used in numerous applications.

A two-step procedure to produce a thermoset comprising of Kraft lignin (KL) and the cross-linker adipic acid (AdA) was developed. The cross-linking was activated by means of an acetylating agent comprising isopropenyl acetate (IPA) to form a cross-linking mixture (CLM). The cross-linking was confirmed by FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and the esterification reactions were further studied using model compounds. When the KL lignin was mixed with the CLM, partial esterification occurred to yield a homogeneous viscous liquid that could easily be poured into a mold, as the first step in the procedure. Without any additions, the mold was heated and the material transformed into a thermoset by reaction of the two carboxylic acid-derivatives of AdA and KL in the second step.","74":"The conversion of biomass into a great variety of valuable chemicals, polymers, and fuels gives a sustainable alternative for the insufficiency of non-renewable fossil fuel resources and reduces environmental pollution. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), converted from sustainable carbohydrates, is a significant building block chemical, and the selective oxidation of HMF into 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) presents an ongoing challenge.

This study concerns the effects of morphological control on a Cu\/Cu2 O-based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The as-synthesized spherical Cu\/Cu2 O photocatalyst exhibits higher activity than the octahedral one under visible light irradiation. The difference in photocatalytic performance between these two catalysts could be attributed to the following two factors: (1) The multifaceted structure of spherical Cu\/Cu2 O favors charge separation; (2) octahedral Cu\/Cu2 O only contains more positively charged (111) facets, which are unfavorable for CO2 photoreduction. The results further highlight the importance of utilizing crystal facet engineering to further improve the performance of CO2 reduction photocatalysts.","79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":null,"86":"Due to their high activity and favorable stability in acidic electrolytes, Ir and Ru oxides are primary catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. For a future large-scale application, core-shell nanoparticles are an appealing route to minimize the demand for these precious oxides. Here, we employ first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) and ab initio thermodynamics to assess the feasibility of encapsulating a cheap rutile-structured TiO2 core with coherent, monolayer-thin IrO2 or RuO2 films. Resulting from a strong directional dependence of adhesion and strain, a wetting tendency is only obtained for some low-index facets under typical gas-phase synthesis conditions. Thermodynamic stability in particular of lattice-matched RuO2 films is instead indicated for more oxidizing conditions.

The method afforded amides in good to excellent yields under transition-metal-free and activation-reagent-free conditions, in sharp contrast to early methodologies on amide synthesis based on transition-metal catalysis. The method offered a greener and transition metal-free protocol applicable to pharmaceuticals preparations. Phenolic compounds were also found to be suitable acylation substrates with potassium thiosulfide KHS as the only byproduct. Moreover, this approach was applied to amide synthesis of valuable bio-active molecules such as moclobemide, melatonin, and a fungicide.

The reasons for the unparalleled Cu performance in CO2 RR are insufficiently understood. Here, the electrode-electrolyte interface was highlighted as a dynamic physical-chemical system and determinant of catalytic events. Exploiting the intrinsic surface-enhanced Raman effect of previously characterized Cu foam electrodes, operando Raman experiments were used to interrogate structures and molecular interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface at subcatalytic and catalytic potentials. Formation of a copper carbonate hydroxide (CuCarHyd) was detected, which resembles the mineral malachite. Its carbonate ions could be directly converted to CO at low overpotential. These and further experiments suggested a basic mode of CO2 \/carbonate reduction at Cu electrodes interfaces that contrasted previous mechanistic models: the starting point in carbon reduction was not CO2 but carbonate ions bound to the metallic Cu electrode in form of CuCarHyd structures. It was hypothesized that Cu oxides residues could enhance CO2 RR indirectly by supporting formation of CuCarHyd motifs. The presence of CuCarHyd patches at catalytic potentials might result from alkalization in conjunction with local electrical potential gradients, enabling the formation of metastable CuCarHyd motifs over a large range of potentials.","90":"5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), one of the most important platform molecules in biorefinery, can be directly obtained from a vast diversity of biomass materials. Owing to the reactive functional groups (-CHO and -CH2 OH) in the structure, this versatile building block undertakes several transformations to provide a wealth of high value-added products. Among numerous well-established paradigms, the catalytic hydrogenation of 5-HMF towards 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF) is of great interest because this downstream diol can be exploited in a wide range of industrial applications. Not surprisingly, incessant endeavors from both academia and industry to upgrade this catalytic process have been established over the years. The main aim of this Review was to provide a comprehensive overview on the development of heterogeneous metal catalysts for the 5-HMF-to-BHMTHF transformation. Herein, the rational design and utility of hydrogenating catalysts were elaborated in many aspects including metal types (Ni, Co, Pd, Ru, Pt, and bimetals), solid supports, preparation method, recyclability, operating conditions, and reaction regime (batch and continuous flow).

Density functional theory is used to systematically screen for stability, activity, and selectivity of transition metal dopants in PdH. The transition metal elements Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, and Re are doped into PdH(111) surface with six different doping configurations: single, dimer, triangle, parallelogram, island, and overlayer. We find that several dopants, such as Ti and Nb, have excellent predicted catalytic activity and CO2 selectivity compared to the pure PdH hydride. In addition, they display good stability due to their negative doping formation energy. The improved performance can be assigned to reaction intermediates forming two bonds consisting of one C-Metal and one O-Metal bond on the PdH surface, which break the scaling relations of intermediates, and thus have stronger HOCO* binding facilitating CO2 activation.","93":"Industrial ammonia production without CO2 emission and with low energy consumption is one of the technological grand challenges of this age. Current Haber-Bosch ammonia mass production processes work with a thermally activated iron catalyst needing high pressure. The need for large volumes of hydrogen gas and the continuous operation mode render electrification of Haber-Bosch plants difficult to achieve. Electrochemical solutions at low pressure and temperature are faced with the problematic inertness of the nitrogen molecule on electrodes. Direct reduction of N2 to ammonia is only possible with very reactive chemicals such as lithium metal, the regeneration of which is energy intensive. Here, the attractiveness of an oxidative route for N2 activation was presented. N2 conversion to NOx in a plasma reactor followed by reduction with H2 on a heterogeneous catalyst at low pressure could be an energy-efficient option for small-scale distributed ammonia production with renewable electricity and without intrinsic CO2 footprint.","94":"Pyrolysis is one of the most widely utilized protocols for the preparation of nanoconfined metal species for heterogeneous catalysis, but it still suffers from the uncontrollable composition evolution process with undesired metal sintering and porous structure collapse.

Over W4 C2 \/AC, the mechanism for the hydrogenation of both -H2 OH and -CHO groups in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was theoretically studied in tetrahydrofuran at GGA-PBE\/DNP level. 5-Methylfurfural was the major product from only hydrodehydration of the -CH2 OH group, whereas 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran was the minor product from the hydrogenation of both -CH2 OH and -CHO groups. The rate-determining steps were concerned with the -C(H)2 -H bond formation for the hydrodehydration of -CH2 OH group, and the -(OH)(H)-H bond formation for the hydrogenation of -CHO group. Kinetically, W-sites promoted the hydrodehydration of -CH2 OH group and inhibited the hydrogenation of -CHO group. This stemmed from the strong Lewis acidity of W-sites, which easily accepted the lone-pair electrons of the oxygen atom in the -C(OH)(H)- group, making -C(OH)(H)-H bond formation hard, and hampering the hydrogenation of the -CHO group.","96":null,"97":null,"98":null,"99":"As highlighted by the recent roadmaps from the European Union and the United States, water electrolysis is the most valuable high-intensity technology for producing green hydrogen.

A promising approach is liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), since these are safe, available on a large scale, and compatible with existing refueling infrastructure. Usually, LOHC dehydrogenation is carried out in batch-type reactors by transition metals and their complexes and suffers from slow H2 release kinetics and\/or inability to reach high energy density by weight, owing to low conversion or the need to dilute the reaction mixture. In this study, a continuous flow reactor is used in combination with a heterogenized iridium pincer complex, which enables a tremendous increase in LOHC dehydrogenation rates.

Herein, operando attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics provided temporal changes in Mw during lignin depolymerization with high resolution. More specifically, ex-situ SEC-derived Mw and polydispersity data of kraft lignin subjected to aqueous phase reforming conditions could be well correlated with ATR-IR spectra of the reaction mixture as a function of time.

Considering the widespread importance of C-N bonds, the development of greener and more convenient ways to form C-N bonds, especially in late-stage synthesis, has become one of the hottest research goals in synthetic chemistry. Copper-catalyzed radical reactions involving N-centered radicals have emerged as a sustainable and promising approach to build C-N bonds.

The recycling of thermosetting plastics in waste plastics is a huge challenge since they are difficult to remold like thermoplastic plastics due to their high crosslinking density. Here, a new strategy was developed to achieve multicycling of anhydride-cured epoxy thermosets. The process consisted of mild and high-efficiency alcoholysis catalyzed by potassium phosphate\/low-boiling alcohol system, and subsequent fast hydrolysis to obtain degradation products rich of carboxyl groups. The degradation products were reused as curing agent to prepare new anhydride-cured epoxy thermosets without sacrifice of high strength and stability. Moreover, the new epoxy thermosets could still be repeatedly recycled using the same protocol. The insolubility of potassium phosphate in ethanol at room temperature made the separation and reuse of the catalyst more convenient. The use of low-boiling alcohol not only allowed high-efficiency degradation but also enabled easy separation from the degradation products. The excellent degradation performance was attributed to the improved swelling of the thermoset and the increased solubility of potassium phosphate induced by small amounts of water in the alcohol. This research provides a recycling method that can reintegrate thermoset waste plastics into remodeling ones under the background of circular economy.","269":"Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors (SCs), have lately played an important role in energy storage and conversion systems due to their specific characteristics such as high strength, durability, and environmental friendliness.

Carbonaceous materials with unique surface, chemical, electrochemical, and electronic characteristics have become attractive for energy storage research, but they cannot meet the rising need for high specific energy and specific power. Besides, heteroatom-doped carbon materials have shown pseudocapacitance characteristics and improved specific energy, specific power, and conductivity.

Paradoxically, these solvents are found to be equally able to wet hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The solvents are amphiphilic and can adapt to any interfacial environment, owing to their inherent heterogeneous (nonionic\/ionic) molecular structure. Ab initio molecular dynamics indicates that these structures enable the formation of a strong adlayer on the surface of hydrophilic surfaces like oxidized steel which promotes solvent decomposition akin to hydrolysis from surface oxides and hydroxides. This decomposition passivates the surface, making it effectively hydrophobic, and the decomposed solvent promotes leaching of the iron into the bulk fluid. This study links the wetting behavior to the observed corrosion of the steels by decomposition of solvent at steel interfaces. The overall affect is strongly dependent on the chemical composition of the solvent in that amines are stable, whereas imines and alcohols are not.

On BDD, the electrohydrodimerization was the dominant process independent of the applied potential. An increase in the initial HMF concentration led to suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and DHMF formation, resulting in higher BHH faradaic efficiencies.

When P4 with thiophene-pyrene pendant was used as hole transport layer, all device parameters, except open-circuit voltage, were significantly improved in comparison with P0 and P1 (conjugated with t-butyl pyrene derivatives). Since P4 had more electrically conductive thiophene units than benzene units with fewer alkyl groups, the supramolecular assembly of P4 was found to be more favorable in electronic devices.

Currently, however, the number of known efficient catalysts for such a reaction is limited. The present work demonstrates that copper-based electrodes exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for the NH3 oxidation to NO2 - and NO3 - in alkaline solutions. Systematic investigation of the effects of pH and potential on the kinetics of the reaction using voltammetric analysis andin situ Raman spectroscopy suggest that ammonia electrooxidation on copper occurrs via two primary catalytic mechanisms. In the first pathway, NH3 is converted to NO2 - via a homogeneous electrocatalytic process mediated by redox transformations of aqueous [Cu(OH)4 ]-\/2- species, which dissolve from the electrode. The second pathway is the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of NH3 on the electrode surface favoring the formation of NO3 - . By virtue of its nature, the homogeneous-mediated pathway enables higher selectivity and was less affected by electrode poisoning with the strongly adsorbed \"N\" intermediates that have plagued the electrocatalytic ammonia oxidation field. Thus, the selectivity of the Cu-catalyzed NH3 oxidation towards either nitrite or nitrate can be achieved through balancing the kinetics of the two mechanisms by adjusting the pH of the electrolyte medium and potential.","355":"The performance of rechargeable magnesium batteries is strongly dependent on the choice of electrolyte. The desolvation of multivalent cations usually goes along with high energy barriers, which can have a crucial impact on the plating reaction. This can lead to significantly higher overpotentials for magnesium deposition compared to magnesium dissolution. In this work we combine experimental measurements with DFT calculations and continuum modelling to analyze Mg deposition in various solvents. Jointly, these methods provide a better understanding of the electrode reactions and especially the magnesium deposition mechanism. Thereby, a kinetic model for electrochemical reactions at metal electrodes is developed, which explicitly couples desolvation to electron transfer and, furthermore, qualitatively takes into account effects of the electrochemical double layer. The influence of different solvents on the battery performance is studied for the state-of-the-art magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate electrolyte salt. It becomes apparent that not necessarily a whole solvent molecule must be stripped from the solvated magnesium cation before the first reduction step can take place. For Mg reduction it seems to be sufficient to have one coordination site available, so that the magnesium cation is able to get closer to the electrode surface. Thereby, the initial desolvation of the magnesium cation determines the deposition reaction for mono-, tri- and tetraglyme, whereas the influence of the desolvation on the plating reaction is minor for diglyme and tetrahydrofuran. Overall, we can give a clear recommendation for diglyme to be applied as solvent in magnesium electrolytes.","356":null,"357":null,"358":"The advancement and modernization of industries have provided numerous benefits to human life including diversification of manufacturing a wide range of products made from plastic materials, thereby leading to the generation of huge quantities of plastic waste.

Considering the high selectivity of Au-based materials to inhibit competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and high activity of transition metals such as Fe and Mo toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), it was proposed that Au-based alloy materials could act as efficient catalysts for N2 fixation based on density functional theory simulations. Only on Mo3 Au(111) surface the adsorption of N2 is stronger than H atom. Thermodynamics combined with kinetics studies were performed to investigate the influence of composition and ratio of Au-based alloys on NRR and HER. The binding energy and reorganization energy affected performance for the initial N2 activation and hydrogenation process.

In this study palladium nanoparticles (PdNP) supported inside hollow graphitised carbon nanofibers (GNF), designated as PdNP@GNF, opposed this trend. PdNP@GNF exhibited continuously increasing activity over 30000 reaction cycles when used as an electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Experiments revealed a switch between two different ORR mechanisms and a change from 2e- to 4e- pathway in the pH range of 3.5-6. This phenomenon was shown by density functional theory (DFT) calculations to be related to the protonation of the nitrogen atoms and carboxylic acid groups on the corroles indicated by the pKa values of the protonation sites in the vicinity of the ORR active sites.

It is concluded that the inferior C-C bond cleavability with Pd electrodes, as compared with Pt electrodes, is due to the inefficiency of deprotonation, and the massive generation of CO2 as well as other C1\/C2 side products is partially caused by the consumption of OH- at the anodes, as a lower pH reduces the amount of carboxylates and favors the C-C bond scission.

However, even in the case of larger particles, introducing a suitable number of anion vacancies enabled KMnHCF to exhibit comparable electrode performance. Electrochemical tests and density functional theory calculations indicated that anion vacancies contribute to the enhancement of K+ ion diffusion, which realizes good electrochemical performance. Structural design, including crystal vacancies and particle size, is the key to their high performance as a positive electrode.","714":"Current industrial production of HNO3 relies on the Ostwald process via catalytic oxidation of NH3 , which is responsible for the vast bulk of CO2 emission. An attractive alternative route to HNO3 is direct N2 oxidation to aqueous HNO3 , which avoids the NH3 intermediate. Herein, we for the first time report a non-thermal plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation process characteristic of a large gas-liquid contact based on the water falling film dielectric barrier discharge, wherein HNO3 is produced directly from ambient air and H2 O at atmospheric pressure and room temperature without the presence of any catalytic material.

In contrast, induction heating of magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) generates heat at the surface of the catalyst where the reaction occurs, reducing waste heat via dissipation. However, the synthesis of magnetic NPs with optimal heat generation requires interfacial ligands, such as oleic acid, which act as heat sinks. Surface treatments using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) or pyridine are used to remove these ligands before applications in hydrophilic media. In this study, Fe3 O4 NPs are surface treated to study the effect of induction heating on the catalytic oxidation of 1-octanol. Whereas TMAOH was unsuccessful in removing oleic acid, pyridine treatment resulted in a roughly 2.5-fold increase in heat generation and product yield.

To guarantee that CCU processes have environmental advantages over conventional production processes, thorough and systematic environmental impact analyses must be performed. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a robust methodology that can be used to fulfil this aim. In this context, this article aims to review the life-cycle environmental impacts of several CCU processes, focusing on the production of methanol, methane, dimethyl ether, dimethyl carbonate, propane and propene. A systematic literature review is used to collect relevant published evidence of the environmental impacts and potential benefits. An analysis of such information shows that CCU generally provides a reduction of environmental impacts, notably global warming\/climate change, compared to conventional manufacturing processes of the same product. To achieve such environmental improvements, renewable energy must be used, particularly to produce hydrogen from water electrolysis. Importantly, different methodological choices are identified that are being used in the LCA studies, making results not comparable.

In the classical \"bottom-up\" approach to synthesize stable nanomaterials by chemical reduction, stabilizing additives such as polymers or organic surfactants must be present to cap the nanoparticle to prevent material bulk aggregation. In recent years, biological systems have emerged as green alternatives to support the uncoated inorganic components. One key advantage of biological templates is their inherent ability to produce nanostructures with controllable composition, facet, size and morphology under ecologically friendly synthetic conditions, which are difficult to achieve with traditional inorganic synthesis. In addition, through genetic engineering or bioconjugation, bio-templates can provide numerous possibilities for surface functionalization to incorporate specific binding sites for the target metals. Therefore, in bio-templated systems, the electrocatalytic performance of the formed nanocatalyst can be tuned by precisely controlling the material surface chemistry. With controlled improvements in size, morphology, facet exposure, surface area and electron conductivity, bio-inspired nanomaterials often exhibit enhanced catalytic activity towards electrode reactions.

This critical review summarizes recent developments from our groups, along with the state-of-the-art in the valorization of technical lignins, with the focus on biorefinery lignins. A beneficial synergistic effect of lignin and cellulose mixtures used in different applications (wood adhesives, carbon fiber and nanofibers, thermoplastics) has been demonstrated. This phenomenon causes crude biorefinery lignins, which contain a significant amount of residual crystalline cellulose, to perform superior to high-purity lignins in certain applications. Where previously specific applications required high-purity and\/or functionalized lignins with narrow molecular weight distributions, simple green processes for upgrading crude biorefinery lignin are suggested here as an alternative. These approaches can be easily combined with lignin micro-\/nanoparticles (LMNP) production. The processes should also be cost-efficient compared to traditional lignin modifications. Biorefinery processes allow much greater flexibility in optimizing the lignin characteristics desirable for specific applications than traditional pulping processes. Such lignin engineering, at the same time, requires an efficient strategy capable of handling large datasets to find correlations between process variables, lignin structures and properties and finally their performance in different applications.","737":"In this study, a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 production system is developed by employing porphyrins as photocatalysts. Palladium and platinum tetracarboxyporphyrins (PdTCP and PtTCP) are adsorbed or coadsorbed onto TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which act as the electron transport medium and as a scaffold that promotes the self-organization of the porphyrinoids. The self-organization of PdTCP and PtTCP, forming H- and J-aggregates, respectively, is the key element for H2 evolution, as in the absence of TiO2 NPs no catalytic activity is detected. Notably, J-aggregated PtTCPs are more efficient for H2 production than H-aggregated PdTCPs. In this approach, a single porphyrin, which self-organizes onto TiO2 NPs, acts as the light harvester and simultaneously as the catalyst, whereas TiO2 serves as the electron transport medium. Importantly, the concurrent adsorption of PdTCP and PtTCP onto TiO2 NPs results in the most efficient catalytic system, giving a turnover number of 22,733 and 30.2 mmol(H2 ) g(cat)-1 .","738":null,"739":null,"740":null,"741":"Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have become one of the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density, environmental friendliness, and cost effectiveness.

However, if LOB technology will contribute to addressing climate change, improvements to LOB performance must not come at the cost of disproportionate increases in global warming potential (GWP) or cumulative energy demand (CED) over their lifecycle. Here, oxygen-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (O-MWCNT) cathodes were produced and assessed for their initial discharge capacities and cyclability. Contrary to previous findings, the discharge capacity of O-MWCNT cathodes increased with the ratio of carbonyl\/carboxyl moieties, outperforming pristine MWCNTs. However, increased oxygen concentrations decreased LOB cyclability, while high-temperature annealing increased both discharge capacity and cyclability. Improved performance resulting from MWCNT post-processing came at the cost of increased GWP and CED, which in some cases was disproportionately higher than the level of improved performance. Based on the findings presented here, there is a need to simultaneously advance research in improving LOB performance while minimizing or mitigating the environmental impacts of LOB production.","744":"The increased emission of CO2 has negative impacts on the environment.

An easy solution for the safer storage of hydrogen is challenging and efficient methods are still being explored in this direction. Despite having some progress in this area, no cost-effective and easily applicable solutions that fulfill the requirements of industry are yet to be claimed. Currently, the storage of hydrogen is largely limited to high-pressure compression and liquefaction or in the form of metal hydrides. Formic acid is a good source of hydrogen that also generates CO2 along with hydrogen on decomposition. Moreover, the hydrogenation of CO2 is thermodynamically unfavorable and requires high energy input. Alkali metal formates are alternative mild and noncorrosive sources of hydrogen. On decomposition, these metal formates release hydrogen and generate bicarbonates. The generated bicarbonates can be catalytically charged back to alkali formates under optimized hydrogen pressure. Hence, the formate-bicarbonate-based systems being carbon neutral at ambient condition has certain advantages over formic acid. The formate-bicarbonate cycle can be considered as a vehicle for hydrogen and energy storage. The whole process is carbon-neutral, reversible, and sustainable.

Accordingly, a Zn\/\/PQ-MCT (phenanthrenequinone macrocyclic trimer) full cell with such electrolyte exhibits a very long cycling life (more than 8000 cycles). Furthermore, this EG-based aqueous electrolyte is non-flammable and inexpensive and prevents evaporation of water when open to the atmosphere, endowing aqueous Zn batteries with excellent safety performance and easy operability in practical applications.","924":null,"925":null,"926":null,"927":"5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a promising bio-derived platform chemical with a broad scope of application, for example, in the production of solvents, fuels, polymers, or adhesives.

The low level of valuable lignin-derived products remains a major challenge hindering the implementation of microbial lignin conversion. Lignin's properties play a significant role in determining the efficiency of lignin bioconversion. To date, despite significant progress in the development of biomass pretreatment, lignin fractionation, and fermentation over the last few decades, little efforts have gone into identifying the ideal lignin substrates for an efficient microbial metabolism. In this Minireview, emerging and state-of-the-art strategies for biomass pretreatment and lignin fractionation are summarized to elaborate their roles in modifying lignin structure for bioconversion. Fermentation strategies aimed at enhancing lignin depolymerization for microbial utilization are systematically reviewed as well. With an improved understanding of the ideal lignin structure elucidated by comprehensive metabolic pathways and\/or big data analysis, modifying lignin chemistry could be more directional and effective. Ultimately, together with the progress of fermentation process optimization, biological lignin valorization will become more competitive in biorefineries.","929":null,"930":"The lignin-first strategy has emerged as one of the most powerful approaches for generating novel platform chemicals from lignin by efficient depolymerization of native lignin. Because of the emergence of this novel depolymerization method and the definition of viable platform chemicals, future focus will soon shift towards innovative downstream processing strategies. Very recently, many interesting approaches have emerged that describe the production of valuable products across the whole value chain, including bulk and fine chemical building blocks, and several concrete examples have been developed for the production of polymers, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, or fuels. This Minireview provides an overview of these recent advances.

Metal catalysts with tailorable sizes, uniform dispersions and robust sintering resistance are generally recognized as a prerequisite for obtaining better hydrogenation activity, selectivity and stability, which has prompted intensive research into metal particle size effects and their regulation strategies. The roles of metal particle sizes and corresponding dispersions of metal catalysts used for FUR hydrogenation have been clearly recognized to be crucial over the past decade. In this regard, this systematic Minireview aims to provide profound insights into particle size effects in the metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of FUR, as well as conditional and structural approaches to regulating these effects. In addition, from the aspect of catalyst stability, the impacts and improvements of the metal particle sintering issue are analyzed.

Properties of the polymer membrane as well as derived carbon molecular sieves (CMS) membranes were compared with copolyimides without the asymmetric monomer structure. CMS membranes derived from the copolyimides are very attractive for CO2 \/CH4 separation. aBPDA provides the copolyimide with additional packing-inhibited structures compared with the symmetric ones and yields a corresponding CMS membrane with very high CO2 permeability and good CO2 \/CH4 selectivity. This work, therefore, outlines a new strategy for tuning CMS membrane structure to meet separation performance needs.","935":"Chemical fixation of CO2 is an efficient means for decreasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. One of promising technologies is the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to synthesize cyclic carbonates. In this reaction, ionic liquid (IL) catalysts show versatile and unique advantages. However, the reaction mechanism using ILs is not clear. In this work, a detailed theoretical investigation was performed by DFT calculations. The energetic profile shows that the reaction consists of three steps, with the ring-opening step being the rate-determining step. Based on the results, effects of cations, anions and water were calculated. Cations show strong hydrogen bonding interactions with epoxides, which decreases the energy barrier of the ring-opening step, indicating that hydrogen bonds play a positive role in promoting the reaction. The effect of anions was evaluated by nucleophilicity index (NNu ); anions with a larger NNu (stronger nucleophilicity) value show lower energy barriers. The influence of water was investigated by implicit and explicit models. Compared with the solvent-free case, water as an implicit solvent decreases the energy barriers through polarization with epoxides. In the explicit solvent model, the water molecules form new hydrogen bonds with epoxides and cations, which can efficiently reduce the energy barriers. The result indicates that there is a new synergic catalytic mechanism, in which the water acts not only as solvent but also as a catalyst in the reaction. Supporting experiments further confirm the calculation results.","936":null,"937":null,"938":null,"939":"2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is one of the most important bio-sourced building blocks and several routes have been reported for its synthesis.

This Minireview concerns the synthesis of FDCA by using various carboxylation reactions and discusses the synthesis of FDCA starting from furoic acid and CO2 and using different catalytic and stoichiometric processes. This process is of high interest, as it avoids the glucose isomerization step and selectivity issues observed during the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation step of the current alternative route to FDCA.

Here, the latest advances in heterogeneous photo-driven oxidation reactions involving ROS are summarized. The major types of ROS and their generation are introduced, and the behaviors of various ROS involved in photo-driven processes are reviewed in terms of the formation of different bonds. Emphasis is placed on unraveling the reaction mechanisms of ROS and establishing strategies for their regulation, and the remaining challenges and perspectives are summarized and analyzed.

Although the methodology has been improved during the last decades allowing the achievement of long peptides and challenging sequences in good yields and purities, the process was not revised from an environmental point of view. One of the main problems in this regard is the large amount of solvents used, and therefore the tons of generated waste. Moreover, the solvent of choice for the SPPS is N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which is considered as reprotoxic; thus, there is an urgent necessity to replace it with safer solvents. The DMF substitution by a green solvent is not a trivial task, because it should solubilize all the reagents and byproducts involved in the process, and, in addition to facilitating the coupling of the different amino acids, it should not favor the formation of side-reactions compared with DMF. Herein, it was demonstrated that the use of the green solvent N-butylpyrrolidinone (NBP) as a replacement of DMF was beneficial in two well-documented side reactions in peptide synthesis, racemization and aspartimide formation. The use of NBP rendered a lower or equal level of racemization in the amino acids more prone to this side reaction than DMF, whilst the aspartimide formation was clearly lower when NBP was used as solvent. Our findings demonstrate that the use of a green solvent does not hamper the synthetic process and could even improve it, making it environmentally friendlier and synthetically better.","943":null,"944":null,"945":"The chemical conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals is one promising approach for CO2 utilization. It is crucial to explore highly efficient catalysts containing task-specific components for CO2 fixation.

The catalytic activity of the host-guest system was remarkably superior to those of ImIP, TT-COF, and their physical mixture. Furthermore, selective adsorption for CO2 over N2 rendered this catalytic system effective for the cycloaddition reaction of the simulated flue gas.

It was shown that the relative activity level was preserved in either direction, whereas the distinctly favored (reverse) water-gas shift modulated selectivity differently. Low selectivity in kinetically controlled MS could be overcome in MSR by exploiting thermodynamics as the driving force, with many catalysts unfit for MS still comprising appealing candidates for MSR and only few being suited for MS as well as MSR. Overall, readily identifiable properties describing catalyst behavior in the forward and backward reactions were highlighted, effectively linking research in the two fields and setting a stronger basis for developing a methanol-based hydrogen storage unit with a single reactor.","947":null,"948":null,"949":"The preparation of nanoparticles represents a powerful tool for lignin valorization, as it combines easy methodologies with high application potential.

To this purpose, two green protocols, that is, solvent-antisolvent and hydrotropic, were optimized and used to generate LNPs from the same softwood kraft lignin. The nanomaterials were fully characterized to extrapolate structure\/property relationships and reveal any differences in the mechanism of self-assembly. Furthermore, tests on methylene blue entrapment capacity and release behavior at two different pH values (2.0 and 7.4) evidenced a clear dependence on the LNPs characteristics and thus on the strategy adopted for their production.","950":"There is a growing interest in using ammonia as a liquid carrier of hydrogen for energy applications.

The H2 permeability of CMS is up to 9500 Barrer and ideal selectivity of gas pairs of H2 \/CH4 and H2 \/CO2 is up to 3800 and 13, respectively.

The prepared polymeric initiator was utilized to copolymerize CO2 with PO under heterogeneous conditions. Not only were the polymerization results similar to the samples obtained under homogeneous conditions, but the polymer substrate could easily be recovered by simple filtration.

Further investigation on the absorption spectra reveals a large enhancement of the light absorption efficiency after boron doping.

To investigate these properties, a new cell design was proposed to facilitate synchrotron X-ray imaging. Three different flow geometries were studied to understand the impact on the flow dynamics, and the formation of hydrogen bubbles. By electrolyte injection experiments, it was shown that the maximum saturation of carbon felt was achieved by a flat flow field after the first injection and by a serpentine flow field after continuous flow. Furthermore, the average saturation of the carbon felt was correlated to the cyclic voltammetry current response, and the hydrogen gas evolution was visualized in 3D by X-ray tomography. The capabilities of this cell design and experiments were outlined, which are essential for the evaluation and optimization of cell components of VRFBs.","1121":null,"1122":"Invited for this month's cover is the research team from the D.O.E.

However, the molecular mechanism of the reaction is still not well understood. A systematic study of the mechanism has been carried out with first-principles calculations. The formation energies of the intermediates are found to be insensitive to the structure of the surface. On the fully H-terminated Si(111) surface, several pathways for the conversion of CO2 into CO at a coordinatively saturated Si site are studied, including the conventional COOH* pathway and the direct insertion of CO2 into Si-H and Si-Si bonds. Although the barrier of the COOH* pathway is lowest among the three pathways, it is higher than that for OH* elimination, which suggests that CO2 should be converted by other types of active site. The reaction at the isolated and dual coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Si sites, which can be generated by light illumination, heat, and Pd loading, are then studied. The results suggest that the most efficient pathway to convert CO2 is to convert it into CO and O* at an isolated CUS Si site before O* reacts with a terminating H* to form adsorbed OH* and generate new isolated CUS Si sites. Therefore, the CUS Si site catalyzes the reaction until all H* is converted into OH*. The results provide new insight into the mechanism of the reaction and should be helpful for the design of more efficient Si-based catalysts for CO2 conversion.","1127":null,"1128":null,"1129":null,"1130":"Dendrite growth poses a significant problem in the design of modern batteries as it can lead to capacity loss and short-circuiting.

Although many active electrocatalysts have been used to electrocatalyze the N2 reduction reaction (NRR), unsatisfactory NH3 yields and lower Faraday efficiency are still far from practical industrial production, and thus, considerable research efforts are being devoted to address these problems. Nevertheless, most reports still mainly focus on the preparation of electrocatalysts and largely ignore a summary of optimization-modification strategies for the NRR.

However, recent reports have demonstrated that another simpler and plausible pathway is also involved in the sorption\/activation of CO2 by ILs associated with basic anions. Bare ILs or IL solutions contain almost invariable significant amounts of water and through interaction with CO2 generate carbonates\/bicarbonates rather than carbamic acids or amidates. In these cases, the IL acts as a base and not a nucleophile and yields buffer-like solutions that can be used to shift the equilibrium toward acid products in different CO2 reutilization reactions.

Platinum nanoparticles loaded by the impregnation method were found to retain the oxidized form on the calcium titanate photocatalyst, even under photoirradiation, and promoted hydrogen and oxygen production by photocatalytic water vapor splitting without promoting the reverse reaction.","1824":"Energy storage will be essential for balancing the renewable energy systems of tomorrow, especially if excess electricity from wind and solar power requires immediate utilization.

Infrared absorption of band-gap-excited photocatalysts demonstrated that cation doping reduced the electron-hole recombination rate and the steady-state population of charge carriers accordingly increased. In-depth studies are focused on Sr cations incorporated through solid-state, flux, and hydrothermal reactions. The recombination rate was reduced when Ta cations were exchanged with Sr cations. Sodium cations were simultaneously exchanged to balance the cationic and anionic charges with no need for creating oxygen anion vacancies. NaTaO3 Sr(Sr1\/3 Ta2\/3 )O3 solid solution was formed as a result of the simultaneous doping. In addition to doping at the appropriate sites, the intraparticle distribution of Sr cations played an essential role to reduce the recombination rate. Strontium cations segregated to produce graded composition from the Sr-rich surface to the Sr-poor core. The bottom of the conduction band was raised at the Sr-rich surface and the excited electrons were driven to the Sr-poor core, leaving holes at the surface.

A kinetic model has been developed to describe detailed reaction mechanisms and investigate competition between water-splitting and photocorrosion reactions. It is observed that some thermodynamically unstable semiconductors should photocorrode in a few minutes, whereas others are expected to operate over a period of years as a result of their extremely low photocorrosion current.

The Re and Co species are completely isolated in the CI sample, presenting a very limited Co-Re interaction. In SI samples, the metals coexist in a Janus-type structure with a concentration of Re around Co. Decoration\/core-shell structures are observed for SR samples resulting from the redox exchange between the metallic surface of the parent Co\/TiO2 catalyst and the Re7+ species of the modifier precursor salt. The contact degree between the two metals gradually increases as follows: Isolated structure (CI)&lt;Janus-type structure(SI)&lt;decoration\/core-shell structure (SR). The unchanging structure of all SI samples independent of the Re loading leads to similar electron transfer, and the increase in Re content results in agglomeration of Re, thus decreasing the catalytic activity. Density-of-state (DOS) calculations prove that the high valence of Re is a disadvantage for the hydrogenation reaction. For SR samples, the increase of Re loading contributes to the electron transfer from Re to Co that is consistent with a change of structure from decoration to core-shell. The lack of directly accessible Co atoms for SR catalysts with fully coated structure decreases the efficiency of Re reduction. The presence of Co-Re interaction resulting from the close contact between metals plays a dominant role in the hydrogenation of citral.

Fe is essential for the high activity, but the details of how Fe is incorporated into the Ni or Co (oxy)hydroxide structure and affects catalysis remain incompletely understood. This study concerns two different modes of Fe incorporation to form Co(Fe)Ox Hy , which both yield increased OER activity but result in Fe and Co species that differ in chemical reactivity and electrochemical response. Co(Fe)Ox Hy films that were cathodically deposited from mixed Co and Fe nitrate solution (co-deposited) result in Fe species that interact strongly with the Co species (as evidenced by an anodic shift in the Co redox wave) and are difficult to leach out under electrochemical conditions. Fe incorporated into a CoOx Hy film by cycling in Fe-spiked KOH electrolyte similarly enhance activity, but do not strongly electronically interact with the majority of the Co in the film and are removed by cycling in Fe-free KOH. These results support the hypothesis that co-deposition of Co(Fe)Ox Hy leads to films where the Co and Fe are mixed within the nanosheet structure and cycling in Fe-spiked KOH incorporates Fe species largely at surface, edge, or defect sites, where they drive OER but do not otherwise significantly modulate the electrochemical response of the Co.","2008":"5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is one of the versatile platform molecules that can be derived from biomass, and a promising starting substrate for producing 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA).

However, the ability of MFCs to generate power has not increased considerably within this timeframe. In recent years, the power generated by MFCs has remained at an almost contact level owing to difficulties in the scale-up of the technology and thus the application of MFCs for powering systems with high energy demands will not be fully developed, at least within a short temporal horizon. Scale-up by increasing the size of the electrodes has failed, because of the wrong assumption that a linear function describes the relationship between the amount of power generated by a MFC and its size. However, more efficient energy generation upon working with small MFCs has been described. This has led to a new approach for scaling up on the basis of miniaturization and replication. Then, MFCs can be connected electrically in series to increase the overall potential and in parallel to increase the overall current. However, cell-voltage reversal and ionic short-circuit issues must be solved for this approach to be successful. Nowadays, the applicability of MFC technology in wastewater treatment does not make any sense in light of the power levels reached, despite the fact that MFCs were seen as a paramount opportunity less than a decade ago.

Herein, a brief overview of materials developed for promising solar water splitting, with an emphasis on a mixed-anion structure and wide visible-light absorption bands, is presented, with some basic information on the principles, approaches, and research progress on the photocatalytic water-splitting reaction with particulate semiconductors.

The main challenges are the high costs of the photocatalysts and the low efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Co-catalysts, as crucial components of photocatalysts, are usually used to stimulate photoexcited electron transfer from the light absorber to the surface, and they also catalyze the proton-reduction reaction to form H2 in water. However, most co-catalysts used in photocatalytic hydrogen production are noble metals, which are expensive and contradict the low-costs demanded by industry. Therefore, the development of earth-abundant and cheap co-catalysts to replace noble metals is necessary for photocatalytic H2 production. This account highlights the performance and roles of molybdenum-based non-noble metal co-catalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen production. We developed a series of inexpensive and efficient molybdenum-based co-catalysts. We demonstrated that more H2 could be produced by loading Mo-based co-catalysts on CdS by using the co-precipitation method than by using traditional Pt\/CdS same under the same photocatalytic conditions. The molybdenum-based co-catalysts were able to form heterojunctions, which served as bridges to facilitate the transport and separation of photogenerated charges; moreover, the molybdenum-based co-catalysts were able to accept and store photoexcited electrons owing to their large specific capacitance. The stored photoelectrons could then be released according to proton-reduction processes to form H2 . Furthermore, the molybdenum-based co-catalysts were found to have metastable state structures and multiple valence states, which provided more active sites and effectively catalyzed the production of H2 and inhibited the reverse reaction. The discovery of Mo-based co-catalysts with superior properties will provide guidance for the design of new co-catalysts.","2081":null,"2082":"A process to recycle platinum from industrial waste, for example, spent catalysts from polymer fuel cells and electrolyzers, through potentiodynamic dissolution along with potentiostatic electrodeposition in dilute acidic\/acid-free baths has been explored. During potentiodynamic dissolution, owing to Ostwald ripening, redeposition of the dissolved Pt species on source nanoparticles becomes significant, leading to lower overall dissolution efficiency. Alternatively, high concentrations of Pt-complexing agents (e.g., Cl- ) are required to stabilize dissolved species through complex formation. The present process overcomes those limitations by removing the dissolved Pt species continuously through electrodepositing them in the form of Pt0 on another electrode. Such a process significantly promotes the overall reaction kinetics, and an increase in dissolution rate by a factor of two or more has been observed in non-complexing electrolytes. The process may be implemented for environmentally and industrially friendly recycling of Pt in dilute acidic\/acid-free baths, thus eliminating the additional steps such as electrolyte upconcentration and post-dissolution reduction of dissolved Pt species.","2083":"Biobased polymers have seen their attractiveness increase in recent decades thanks to the significant development of biorefineries to allow access to a wide variety of biobased building blocks.

Currently, these polyesters are mainly produced by using traditional chemical catalysts and harsh conditions, but recently greener pathways with nontoxic enzymes as biocatalysts and mild conditions have shown great potential. Bacterial polyesters, such as poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s (PHA), are the best example of the biotic production of high molar mass polymers. PHAs display a wide variety of macromolecular architectures, which allow a large range of applications.

The design of porous architectures is considered key for determining electrochemical performance. Pore size distribution, pore size, and pore connectivity strongly affect electrochemical performance. Various carbon materials with pore size ranging from micro- to macropores were extensively studied. Herein, various types of porous carbon-based and hybrid materials from different approaches and their electrochemical applications are summarized. Appropriate tuning of the pore size of carbon materials is essential for ensuring good transport of ions with different sizes throughout the electrolyte, so that the electrode materials can be fully utilized.

Under a reducing hydrogen atmosphere, the temperature of decarboxylation is significantly lower. Carbon dioxide is not directly released into the atmosphere, but may be reduced to carbon monoxide, methane, and higher hydrocarbons, which adds value to the overall process. Apart from metal oxides in different oxidation states, metals in their elemental form may also be obtained if transition-metal carbonates are processed under a hydrogen atmosphere.

The identification of active sites of single-atom sites from the visible particles has been elucidated through the combined X-ray spectroscopic, electron microscopic, and electrochemical studies. Interestingly, after a total removal of metallic cobalt sites, catalysts with purified single-atom metal sites show no faltering activity for either the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while significantly enhanced ORR selectivity is achieved; this reveals the dominant activity and selectivity contribution from single-atom electrocatalysis.

Herein, a metal-free C60 \/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3 N4 ) composite photocatalyst was fabricated by a facile method, and well characterized by TEM, SEM, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The C60 \/g-C3 N4 catalyst exhibited a high photocatalytic activity at room temperature for the selective oxidation of sulfides into the corresponding sulfoxides in the presence of other functional groups, due to the synergetic roles of C60 and g-C3 N4 . Several important parameters have been screened, and this method afforded good to excellent yields of sulfoxides under optimal conditions. The superoxide radical (. O2- ) and singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) were identified as the oxidative species for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides by exploring EPR experiments, and hence, a plausible mechanism for this oxidation was proposed. Moreover, the C60 \/g-C3 N4 catalyst can be easily recovered by filtration and then reused at least four times without loss in activity.","2257":null,"2258":null,"2259":null,"2260":null,"2261":null,"2262":null,"2263":null,"2264":null,"2265":null,"2266":null,"2267":"High activity and stability are crucial for the practical use of electrocatalysts in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water electrolysis, including the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxidation reactions of formic acid and alcohols.

Formation of DHP* itself, by surface hydride transfer, indeed any hydride transfer away from the surface, was found to be kinetically hindered. Consequently, adsorbed deprotonated dihydropyridine (2-PyH- *) was then proposed as a more likely catalytic intermediate because its formation, by transfer of a solvated proton and two electrons from the surface to adsorbed Py, is predicted to be thermodynamically favored on various semiconductor electrode surfaces active for CO2 reduction, namely GaP(111), CdTe(111), and CuInS2 (112).

We show that both In and Bi have the desired property for a secondary battery, that is, upon recharging they will remain on the surface, thereby retaining the beneficial effects on Zn dissolution and suppression of HER. This is confirmed by DEMS, where it is observed that In reduces HER and Bi affects the discharge potential beneficially compared to a battery without additives. Using a simple procedure based on adsorption energies calculated with DFT, it is found that Ag suppresses OH adsorption, but, unlike In and Bi, it does not hinder HER.

Amines-typically triethanolamine (TEOA)-are commonly employed as SEDs in such reactions. Dye-sensitized photoreforming of more sustainable, biomass-derived alcohols, on the other hand, was only recently reported by using methanol as the electron donor. In this work, several rationally designed donor-acceptor dyes were used as sensitizers in H2 photocatalytic production, comparing the efficiency of TEOA and EtOH as SEDs. In particular, the effect of hydrophobic chains in the spacer and\/or the donor unit of the dyes was systematically studied. The H2 production rates were higher when TEOA was used as SED, whereas the activity trends depended on the SED used. The best performance was obtained with TEOA by using a sensitizer with just one bulky hydrophobic moiety, propylenedioxythiophene, placed on the spacer unit. In the case of EtOH, the best-performing sensitizers were the ones featuring a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole internal unit, needed for enhancing light harvesting, and carrying alkyl chains on both the donor part and the spacer unit.

Alloying is a promising method to tailor the geometric and electric environments of active sites. The parameter space for discovering new alloys for CO2 electrocatalysis is particularly large because of the myriad products that can be formed during CO2 reduction.

However, the mechanisms underlining the utilization of mechanical forces in the depolymerization are poorly understood. A kinematic model of the milling process is applied to assess the energy dose transferred to cellulose during its mechanocatalytic depolymerization under varied conditions (rotational speed, milling time, ball size, and substrate loading). The data set is compared to the apparent energy dose calculated from the kinematic model and reveals key features of the mechanocatalytic process. At low energy doses, a rapid rise in the WSP yield associated with the apparent energy dose is observed. However, at a higher energy dose obtained by extended milling duration or high milling speeds, the formation of a substrate cake layer on the mill vials appear to buffer the mechanical forces, preventing full cellulose conversion into WSPs. By contrast, for beechwood, there exists a good linear dependence between the WSP yield and the energy dose provided to the substrate over the entire range of WSP yields. As the formation of a substrate cake in depolymerization of beechwood is less severe than that for the cellulose experiments, the current results verify the hypothesis regarding the negative effect of a substrate layer formed on the mill vials upon the depolymerization process. Overall, the current findings provide valuable insight into relationships between the energy dose and the extent of cellulose depolymerization effected by the mechanocatalytic process.","2460":null,"2461":null,"2462":null,"2463":"Unlike their bulk counterpart, Cux Iny S quantum dots (QDs) prepared by an aqueous synthetic approach, show promising activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which is competitive with the state-of-the-art Cd chalcogen QDs.

Various causes of power overshoot, identified in previous studies, are discussed in terms of their plausible contributions to electron depletion. We found that power overshoot occurred if the anodic overpotential generated by electron depletion exceeded the cathodic overpotential. The introduction of assistance current from anode connections, which ameliorated the electron depletion in the MFCs, immediately eliminated the power overshoot. As a result, if the electron production at the anode exceeded electron reduction at the cathode, a power overshoot was not generated. The results revealed that introducing assistance current supplied from an additional anode to the limited anode eliminated power overshoot. The power overshoot is not generated by kinetic limitation at the cathode; it is only generated by the kinetic limitation at the anode. The mechanism underlying power overshoot should be considered in the design of MFCs to improve reliability, particularly in scaled-up plant applications. The proposed technique is more practical than previously proposed methods.","3033":"Capacitive mixing is a newly emerging technique for the production of renewable energy from differences in salinity, usually of wastewater streams.

Usually, the renewable energy resources are seawater and river water streams. Here, we demonstrated that electrical energy can be extracted by capacitive mixing of acidic wastewater and seawater. This concept is proven by the use of proton-selective carbon as the cation-capturing electrode, fabricated by carbonization of cellulose filter paper followed by mild activation in concentrated nitric acid.

For all measurements, the carbon nanotubes were Pt free and subject to either nitrogen or oxygen plasma treatment. AC impedance spectroscopy of the electrochemical cells, with and without a DC bias, was performed and showed significantly lower initial impedances for oxygen-plasma-treated MWCNTs compared to those treated with a nitrogen plasma. In symmetric cell measurements with a DC bias, the current declines quickly for oxygen-plasma-treated MWCNTs and more slowly, over 12 days, for nitrogen-plasma-treated MWCNTs. To elucidate the degradation mechanisms of the oxygen-plasma-treated MWCNTs under SAFC operating conditions, theoretical calculations were performed using DFT. The results indicate that several degradation mechanisms are likely to occur in parallel through the reduction of the surface oxygen groups that were introduced by the plasma treatment.

Although Pd\/C and Pd\/Al2 O3 have frequently been used for decarbonylation, Pd\/ZrO2 exhibited superior catalytic performance compared with these conventional catalysts. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed that the size of the Pd particles decreased with an increase in the specific surface area of ZrO2 . ZrO2 with a high surface area immobilized Pd as clusters consisting of several (three to five) Pd atoms, whereas Pd aggregated to form nanoparticles on other supports such as carbon and Al2 O3 despite their high surface areas. The catalytic activity of Pd\/ZrO2 was enhanced with a decrease in particle size, and the smallest Pd\/ZrO2 was the most active catalyst for decarbonylation. When CeO2 was used as the support, a decrease in Pd particle size with an increase in surface area was also observed. Single Pd atoms were deposited on CeO2 with a high surface area, with a strong interaction through the formation of a Pd-O-Ce bond, which led to a lower catalytic activity than that of Pd\/ZrO2 .

However, existing perovskites solar cells (PSCs) suffer from several intrinsic instabilities, which prevent them from reaching industrial maturity, and stabilizing PSCs has become a critically important problem. Here we propose to stabilize PSCs chemically by strengthening the interactions between the organic cation and inorganic anion of the perovskite framework. In particular, we show that replacing the methylammonium cation with alternative protonated cations allows an increase in the stability of the perovskite by forming strong hydrogen bonds with the halide anions. This interaction also provides opportunities for tuning the electronic states near the bandgap.

In this work, we successfully enhanced the PEC stability of BiVO4 by doping Fe ions in substitution of Bi. Density functional theory calculations have illustrated that Fe-doping would result in an impurity band in the forbidden gap, and thus narrow its energy gap.

We combine molecular dynamics simulations and variable-time pulsed field gradient spin-echo (PFGSE) NMR spectroscopy to investigate Li(+) transport in CMC-based solutions.

Here, we develop an effective and energy-efficient process to convert raw lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., corncob) into branched diesel-range alkanes through three tandem steps for the first time. Furfural and isopropyl levulinate (LA ester) were prepared from hemicellulose and cellulose fractions of corncob in toluene\/water biphasic system with added isopropanol, which was followed by double aldol condensation of furfural with LA ester into C15 oxygenates and the final hydrodeoxygenation of C15 oxygenates into branched long-chain alkanes. The core point of this tandem process is the addition of isopropanol in the first step, which enables the spontaneous transfer of levulinic acid (LA) into the toluene phase in the form of LA ester through esterification, resulting in LA ester co-existing with furfural in the same phase, which is the basis for double aldol condensation in the toluene phase.

Moreover, the plant-based catalysts allowed novel control of the Garcia Gonzalez reaction, as two different products were obtained depending on the reaction conditions.","4121":null,"4122":null,"4123":null,"4124":null,"4125":null,"4126":null,"4127":"We present a facile synthesis of bioinspired manganese oxides for chemical and photocatalytic water oxidation, starting from a reliable and versatile manganese(II) oxalate single-source precursor (SSP) accessible through an inverse micellar molecular approach. Strikingly, thermal decomposition of the latter precursor in various environments (air, nitrogen, and vacuum) led to the three different mineral phases of bixbyite (Mn2 O3 ), hausmannite (Mn3 O4 ), and manganosite (MnO). Initial chemical water oxidation experiments using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) gave the maximum catalytic activity for Mn2 O3 and MnO whereas Mn3 O4 had a limited activity. The substantial increase in the catalytic activity of MnO in chemical water oxidation was demonstrated by the fact that a phase transformation occurs at the surface from nanocrystalline MnO into an amorphous MnOx (1&lt;x&lt;2) upon treatment with CAN, which acted as an oxidizing agent. Photocatalytic water oxidation in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3 ](2+) (bpy=2,2'-bipyridine) as a sensitizer and peroxodisulfate as an electron acceptor was carried out for all three manganese oxides including the newly formed amorphous MnOx . Both Mn2 O3 and the amorphous MnOx exhibit tremendous enhancement in oxygen evolution during photocatalysis and are much higher in comparison to so far known bioinspired manganese oxides and calcium-manganese oxides.

In an appropriate simplification, this distribution can be described by a transmission line model (TLM) consisting of infinitely thin electrode layers. To investigate the vertical distribution of currents, overpotentials, and irreversible charge losses in a porous graphite electrode in situ, a multi-layered working electrode (MWE) was developed as the experimental analogue of a TLM. In this MWE, each layer is in ionic contact but electrically insulated from the other layers by a porous separator. It was found that the negative graphite electrodes get lithiated and delithiated stage-by-stage and layer-by-layer. Several mass-transport- as well as non-mass-transport-limited processes could be identified.

Due to the very flat surface of the polyurethane acrylate\/polycarbonate (PUA\/PC) film, which was used as a mold and resembled the surface of the original substrate (silicon wafer), the transferred layer had a very smooth surface morphology, resulting in enhancement of the interfacial characteristics. The work function of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the morphology of bulk hetero junction (BHJ) layer were tuned by controlling the position of PSS enrichment in the PEDOT:PSS layer using the dry transfer. The power conversion efficiency of PTB7:PC71 BM BHJ device prepared by the dry transfer was 8.06%, which was significantly higher than that of the spin-cast device (7.32%). By avoiding direct contact between the ITO substrate and the PEDOT:PSS solution in the dry transfer system, etching and diffusion of indium in the ITO substrate were greatly reduced, thereby improving the stability.","4140":"Hydrogen was produced by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of sorbitol in a carbon-on-alumina tubular membrane reactor (4 nm pore size, 7 cm long, 3 mm internal diameter) that allows the hydrogen gas to permeate to the shell side, whereas the liquid remains in the tube side. The hydrophobic nature of the membrane serves to avoid water loss and to minimize the interaction between the ceramic support and water, thus reducing the risks of membrane degradation upon operation. The permeation of hydrogen is dominated by the diffusivity of the hydrogen in water. Thus, higher operation temperatures result in an increase of the flux of hydrogen. The differential pressure has a negative effect on the flux of hydrogen due to the presence of liquid in the larger pores. The membrane was suitable for use in APR, and yielded 2.5 times more hydrogen than a reference reactor (with no membrane). Removal of hydrogen through the membrane assists in the reaction by preventing its consumption in undesired reactions.","4141":"This article reviews, first, the prospects, practices and principles of generating solar fuels.

The massive differences between proven methods of generating fuel and chemicals from non-renewable and from solar radiation are emphasized with the aid of numerous quantitative examples. Whilst it is acknowledged that a key action in reducing the liberation of greenhouse gases (GHG) is to tackle the challenge of decreasing their evolution in power generation and in the production of steel, aluminium and other bulk commodities (metals, alloys, concrete and ceramics), nevertheless much can be done to diminish the emission of CO2 (and to use it as feedstock) through the agency of new, designed solid catalysts and microalgae.

The amine functionalities on PEI served three roles: 1) primary amines were used to tether the ligand and precatalyst, 2) amines were used to capture CO2 , and 3) amines served as a base for formate stabilization during catalysis. Ligand studies on imine and phosphine based ligands showed that a bidentate iminophosphine ligand resulted in the highest catalytic activity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that an increase in Ir 4f binding energy led to an increase in catalytic activity, which suggests that the electronics of the metal center play a significant role in catalysis. Catalyst loading studies revealed that there is a critical balance between free amines and ligand-metal sites that must be reached to optimize catalytic activity.

In this Review, we show that biological activity and cytotoxicity of ionic liquids dramatically depend on the nature of a biological system. An ionic liquid may be not toxic for particular cells or organisms, but may demonstrate high toxicity towards another target present in the environment. Thus, a careful selection of biological activity data is a must for the correct assessment of chemical technologies involving ionic liquids. In addition to the direct biological activity (immediate response), several indirect effects and aftereffects are of primary importance. The following principal factors were revealed to modulate toxicity of ionic liquids: i) length of an alkyl chain in the cation; ii) degree of functionalization in the side chain of the cation; iii) anion nature; iv) cation nature; and v) mutual influence of anion and cation.","4352":"Mesoporous-graphitic-carbon-supported HfO2 (HfO2 -MGC) nanohybrids were synthesized by using a soft-template route. Characterization and a systematic investigation of the catalytic properties, stability, and catalytic mechanism were performed for HfO2 -MGC counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The new HfO2 -MGC as a CE in DSSCs showed a surprisingly high efficiency of 7.75 % for the triiodide\/iodide redox couple and 3.69 % for the disulfide\/thiolate redox couple, greater than the Pt electrode in the corresponding electrolyte system, which opens up a possibility for its practical application.","4353":"The development of highly-efficient catalysts for conversion of glucose and fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is of great importance. In this work, theoretical simulations form the basis for rational design and synthesis of a superhydrophobic mesoporous acid, that can completely prevent HMF hydration, giving HMF as sole product from full conversion of fructose. Interestingly, the combined superhydrophobic solid acid and superhydrophilic solid base catalysts are very efficient for one-pot conversion of glucose to HMF, giving a yield as high as 95.4 %. The excellent catalytic data in the conversion of glucose to HMF is attributed to the unique wettabilities of the solid acid and base catalysts.

","4357":"The use of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) that act as all-in-one solvent-template-reactant systems offers an interesting green alternative to conventional syntheses in materials science. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview to emphasize the similarities and discrepancies between DES-assisted and conventional syntheses and rationalize certain green features that are common for the three DES-assisted syntheses described herein: one case of radical polymerization and two cases of polycondensations. For instance, DESs contain the precursor itself and some additional components that either provide certain functionality (e.g., drug delivery and controlled release, or electrical conductivity) to the resulting materials or direct their formation with a particular structure (e.g., hierarchical-type). Moreover, DESs provide a reaction medium, so polymerizations are ultimately carried out in a solventless fashion. This means that DES-assisted syntheses match green chemistry principles 2 and 5 because of the economy of reagents and solvents, whereas the functionality incorporated by the second component allows the need for any post-synthesis derivatization to be minimized or even fully avoided (principle 8). DESs also provide new precursors that favor more efficient polymerization (principle 6) by decreasing the energy input required for reaction progress. Finally, the use of mild reaction conditions in combination with the compositional versatility of DESs, which allows low-toxic components to be selected, is also of interest from the viewpoint of green chemistry because it opens up the way to design biocompatible and\/or eco-friendly synthetic methods (principle 3).","4358":null,"4359":"Polyurethanes (PUs), produced from the condensation polymerizations between polyols and isocyanates, are one of the most versatile polymer families. Currently, both polyols and isocyanates are largely petroleum derived. Recently, there have been extensive research interests in developing bio-based polyols and PUs from renewable resources. As the world's most abundant renewable biomass, lignocellulosic biomass is rich in hydroxyl groups and has potential as a feedstock to produce bio-based polyols and PUs. Lignocellulosic biomass can be converted to liquid polyols for PU applications through acid- or base-catalyzed atmospheric liquefaction processes using polyhydric alcohols as liquefaction solvents. Biomass liquefaction-derived polyols can be used to prepare various PU products, such as foams, films and adhesives.

","4362":"Among ternary oxides, Zn2 SnO4 (ZSO) is considered for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of its wide bandgap, high optical transmittance, and high electrical conductivity. However, ZSO-based DSSCs have a poor performance record owing largely to the absence of systematic efforts to enhance their performance. Herein, general strategies are proposed to improve the performance of ZSO-based DSSCs involving interfacial engineering\/modification of the photoanode. A conformal ZSO thin film (blocking layer) deposited at the fluorine-doped tin oxide-electrolyte interface by pulsed laser deposition suppressed the back-electron transfer effectively while maintaining a high optical transmittance, which resulted in a 22 % improvement in the short-circuit photocurrent density. Surface modification of ZSO nanoparticles (NPs) resulted in an ultrathin ZnO shell layer, a 9 % improvement in the open-circuit voltage, and a 4 % improvement in the fill factor because of the reduced electron recombination at the ZSO NPs-electrolyte interface. The ZSO-based DSSCs exhibited a faster charge injection and electron transport than their TiO2 -based counterparts, and their superior properties were not inhibited by the ZnO shell layer, which indicates their feasibility for highly efficient DSSCs. Each interfacial engineering strategy could be applied to the ZSO-based DSSC independently to lead to an improved conversion efficiency of 6 %, a very high conversion efficiency for a non-TiO2 based DSSC.","4363":"A new type of ionic liquid that contains a nitroxide radical (N-O(.)) and iodide as two redox couples, JC-IL, has been successfully synthesized for high-performance dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Both of the redox couples exhibit distinct redox potentials and attractive electrochemical characteristics. The UV\/Vis absorption spectra of JC-IL shows a low-intensity peak compared to the strong absorption of I2 in the wavelength region of 350-500 nm. The high open-circuit voltage of DSSCs with JC-IL is over 850 mV, which is approximately 150 mV higher than that of the DSSCs with a standard iodide electrolyte. The dramatic increase in the standard heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant leads to an increase in the short-circuit current for JC-IL compared to that of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-N-oxyl (TEMPO). DSSCs with the JC-IL electrolyte show promising cell efficiencies if coupled with dyes CR147 (8.12%) or D149 (6.76%). The efficiencies of the DSSCs based on the JC-IL electrolyte are higher than those of DSSCs based on either TEMPO electrolyte or standard iodide electrolyte alone.","4364":"Gold nanoparticles incorporated in mesoporous cobalt oxides (Au\/mCo3 O4 ) are fabricated by a nanocasting method using porous silica as the hard template. The Au\/mCo3 O4 material exhibits enhanced catalytic activity towards water oxidation compared to bulk mCo3 O4 in both alkaline and neutral solutions.

Selectivity control is one of the biggest challenges in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This Minireview focuses on the development of new catalysts with controllable product selectivities. Recent attempts to increase the selectivity to C5+ hydrocarbons by preparing catalysts with well-defined active phases or with new supports or by optimizing the interaction between the promoter and the active phase are briefly highlighted. Advances in developing bifunctional catalysts capable of catalyzing both CO hydrogenation to heavier hydrocarbons and hydrocracking\/isomerization of heavier hydrocarbons are critically reviewed. It is demonstrated that the control of the secondary hydrocracking reactions by using core-shell nanostructures or solid-acid materials, such as mesoporous zeolites and carbon nanotubes with acid functional groups, is an effective strategy to tune the product selectivity of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Very promising selectivities to gasoline- and diesel-range hydrocarbons have been attained over some bifunctional catalysts.

This work shows that bottom ashes can be atom-efficiently converted into valuable sorbents without the need for costly and hazardous chemicals. The ashes were hydrothermally treated in rotary autoclaves at autogenic pH conditions to promote the conversion of precursor mineral phases into zeolites and layered silicate hydrates. Two main mineral phases were formed: katoite and sodium aluminum phosphate silicate hydrate. These mineral alterations are accompanied by a tenfold increase in specific surface area and a twofold reduction in average particle size. Performance evaluation of the new sorbents for Cd(2+), Zn(2+), and Pb(2+) adsorption at pH5 indicates sorption capacities of 0.06, 0.08, and 0.22 mmol g(-1), respectively, which are similar to those of natural adsorbents and synthetic materials obtained from more demanding synthesis conditions.","4369":"SnSe nanocrystal electrodes on three-dimensional (3D) carbon fabric and Au-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wafer have been prepared by a simple spray-painting process and were further investigated as binder-free active-electrodes for Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and flexible stacked all-solid-state supercapacitors. The as-painted SnSe nanocrystals\/carbon fabric electrodes exhibit an outstanding capacity of 676 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and a considerable high-rate capability in lithium storage because of the excellent ion transport from the electrolyte to the active materials and the efficient charge transport between current collector and electrode materials. The binder-free electrodes also provide a larger electrochemical active surface compared with electrodes containing binders, which leads to the enhanced capacities of energy-storage devices. A flexible stacked all-solid-state supercapacitor based on the SnSe nanocrystals on Au-coated PET wafers shows high capacitance reversibility with little performance degradation at different current densities after 2200 charge-discharge cycles and even when bent. This allows for many potential applications in facile, cost-effective, spray-paintable, and flexible energy-storage devices.

These three TiO2 -graphene nanocomposites have similar particle sizes and surface areas; the only difference between them is the crystal facet exposed in TiO2 nanocrystals. UV\/Vis spectra show that band structures of TiO2 nanocrystals and TiO2 -graphene nanocomposites are dependent on the crystal facets. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectra suggest that the charge-transfer rate between {100} facets and graphene is approximately 1.4 times of that between {001} facets and graphene. Photoelectrochemical measurements also confirm that the charge-separation efficiency between TiO2 and graphene is greatly dependent on the crystal facets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that Ti-C bonds are formed between {100} facets and graphene, while {101} facets and {001} facets are connected with graphene mainly through Ti-O-C bonds. With Ti-C bonds between TiO2 and graphene, TiO2 -100-G shows the fastest charge-transfer rate, leading to higher activity in photocatalytic H2 production from methanol solution. TiO2 -101-G with more reductive electrons and medium interfacial charge-transfer rate also shows good H2 evolution rate. As a result of its disadvantageous electronic structure and interfacial connections, TiO2 -001-G shows the lowest H2 evolution rate. These results suggest that engineering the structures of the TiO2 -graphene interface can be an effective strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic performances.","4371":"The in situ autocombustion synthesis route is shown to be an easy and efficient way to produce nanoscaled nickel oxide containing lanthanum-doped mesoporous silica composite. Through this approach, ~3 nm NiO particles homogeneously dispersed in the pores of silica are obtained, while lanthanum is observed to cover the surface of the silica pore wall. Subsequent reduction of such composite precursors under hydrogen generates Ni(0) nanoparticles of a comparable size. Control over the size and size distribution of metallic nanoparticles clearly improved catalytic activity in the methane dry reforming reaction. In addition, these composite materials exhibit excellent stability under severe reaction conditions. This was achieved through the presence of LaOx species, which reduced active-site carbon poisoning, and the confinement effect of the mesoporous support, which reduced metallic particle sintering.","4372":"PEG-based ionic liquids are a new appealing group of solvents making the link between two distinct but very similar fluids: ionic liquids and poly(ethylene glycol)s. They find applications across a range of innumerable disciplines in science, technology, and engineering.

By quantifying the DNA, RNA, and protein content during the long-term growth of biofilms on polarized graphite electrodes, we show in this work that current production becomes independent of DNA accumulation immediately after a maximal current is achieved. Indeed, the mean respiratory rate of biofilms rapidly decreases after this point, which indicates the progressive accumulation of cells that do not contribute to current production or contribute to a negligible extent.

Consequently, additional CO2 gas is absorbed by amine absorbents. This study examines highly porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)\/siloxane nanofibrous layers that are modified with hydrophobic fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) functional groups and successfully coated onto a macroporous Al2 O3 membrane. The performance of these materials in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption is also investigated. Compared with pristine PVDF nanofibrous membranes, the PVDF\/siloxane nanofibrous membranes exhibit greater solvent resistance and mechanical strength, making them more suitable for use in CO2 capture by the membrane contactor. The PVDF\/siloxane nanofibrous layer in highly porous FAS-modified membranes can prevent the wetting of the membrane by the amine absorbent; this extends the periods of continuous CO2 absorption and results in a high CO2 absorption flux with a minimum of 500 % enhancement over that of the uncoated membranes. This study suggests the potential use of an FAS-modified PVDF\/siloxane nanofibrous membrane in a membrane contactor system for CO2 absorption. The resulting hydrophobic membrane contactor also demonstrates the potential for large-scale CO2 absorption during post-combustion processes in power plants.","4388":"Levulinic acid is an important platform molecule from biomass-based renewable resources. A sustainable manufacturing process for this chemical and its derivatives is the enabling factor to harness the renewable resource. An integrated catalytic process to directly convert furfural to levulinate ester was developed based on a bifunctional catalyst of Pt nanoparticles supported on a ZrNb binary phosphate solid acid. The hydrogenation of furfural and the following alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol were performed over this catalyst in a one-pot conversion model. Mesoporous ZrNb binary phosphate was synthesized by a sol-gel method and had a high surface area of 170.1 m(2) g(-1) and a large average pore size of around 8.0 nm. Pt nanoparticles remained in a monodisperse state on the support, and the reaction over Pt\/ZrNbPO4 (Pt loading: 2.0 wt%; Zr\/Nb, 1:1) gave a very high selectivity to levulinate derivatives (91% in total).

Herein, we demonstrate the one-pot synthesis of furan derivatives and sugar alcohols from raffinose by using heterogeneous acid, base, and\/or metal-supported catalysts. The combination of Amberlyst-15 and hydrotalcite (HT) showed a high activity (37% yield) for 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) through continuous hydrolysis, isomerization, and dehydration reactions. In addition, the use of a hydrotalcite-supported ruthenium catalyst (Ru\/HT) successfully afforded 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF, 27% yield) from HMF produced by raffinose, directly. Moreover, the hydrogenation of hexoses obtained by raffinose hydrolysis into sugar alcohols (galactitol, mannitol, sorbitol) was also achieved in a high yield (91%) with Amberlyst-15 and Ru\/HT catalysts.

High-resolution X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) allows the discrimination of metallic palladium, electronically modified metallic palladium hosting impurities, and cationic palladium. This is paralleled by the morphological heterogeneity observed by high-resolution TEM, in which nanoparticles with an average size of 2 nm coexisted with very small palladium clusters. The morphological distribution of palladium is modified after reaction through sintering and dissolution\/redeposition pathways. The loss of selectivity is correlated to the extent to which these processes occur as a result of the instability of the particle at the carbon surface. We assign beneficial activity in the selective hydrogenation of oxygen to palladium clusters with a modified electronic structure compared with palladium metal or palladium oxides. These beneficial species are formed and stabilized on carbons modified with nitrogen atoms in substitutional positions. The formation of larger metallic palladium particles not only reduces the number of active sites for the synthesis, but also enhances the activity for deep hydrogenation to water. The structural instability of the active species is thus detrimental in a dual way.

Insights from in situ spectroscopy study and theoretical modeling of nanostructured ceria-based materials have shed light on the origin of the ceria shape effect. It is suggested that the surface structure of ceria controls the catalytic activity and selectivity through structure-dependent surface-site geometry, surface vacancy formation energy, defect sites, and coordinatively unsaturated sites on ceria. The morphology-dependent catalysis in ceria has offered a new strategy to finely tune the catalytic activity and selectivity through shape control without altering the catalyst composition.

The ORR-specific current density is observed to increase with increasing particle diameter up to approximately 4 nm, at which point the activity begins to level off. The reduction in ORR activity for particles below 4 nm is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the overpotential for surface reduction. The resulting mass activity exhibits a maximum for particles with diameters of approximately 3.5 nm. These results are consistent with results published recently for high area carbon-supported Pt catalysts. For Pd particles, both the specific current density and the mass-specific activity for the ORR are observed to increase with increasing particle diameter, with no distinct optimum observed.

A method based on GCMC-EE simulations for dilute solutions combined with the Redlich-Kister (RK) expansion (GCMC-EE-RK) is introduced to calculate the isotherms over a wide range of concentrations. The simulations, using literature force fields, are in reasonable agreement with experimental data.

The ratio of the energetic interaction in the zeolite to the solvation free energy is a key factor in controlling separation from liquid mixtures.

A possible route for the derivatization of furanics is their oxidation to afford a broad range of chemicals with promising applications (e.g., diacids, hydroxyl acids, aldehyde acids, monomers for novel polymers). Herein we explore the organic peracid-assisted oxidation of furanics under mild reaction conditions. Using lipases as biocatalysts, alkyl esters as acyl donors, and aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide (30 % v\/v) added stepwise, peracids are formed in situ, which subsequently oxidize the aldehyde groups to afford carboxylic acids with high yields and excellent selectivities. Furthermore, the use of an immobilized silica-based 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) affords the selective oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group of HMF to afford 2,5-diformylfuran. That product can be subsequently oxidized using again lipases for the in situ peracid formation to yield 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, which is considered to be a key building block for biorefineries.

In addition to tungstic acid, other W compounds were also investigated in combination with Raney Ni. The results showed that the EG yield depended on the W compound: H(4)SiW(12)O(40) &lt;H(3 PW(12)O(40) &lt;WO(3) &lt;H(2)WO(4) , but all the investigated W compounds were selective towards EG.

The electrical conductivity of H-TNTs increases by approximately one order of magnitude in comparison to air-treated TNTs. The increase in the number of oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups on the H-TNTs help to anchor a greater number of Pt atoms during Pt electrodeposition. The H-TNTs are pretreated by using a successive ion adsorption and reaction (SIAR) method that enhances the loading and dispersion of Pt catalysts when electrodeposited. In the SIAR method a Pd activator can be used to provide uniform nucleation sites for Pt and leads to increased Pt loading on the H-TNTs. Furthermore, fabricated Pt nanoparticles with a diameter of 3.4 nm are located uniformly around the pretreated H-TNT support. The as-prepared and highly ordered electrodes exhibit excellent stability during accelerated durability tests, particularly for the H-TNT-loaded Pt catalysts that have been annealed in ultrahigh purity H2 for a second time. There is minimal decrease in the electrochemical surface area of the as-prepared electrode after 1000 cycles compared to a 68 % decrease for the commercial JM 20 % Pt\/C electrode after 800 cycles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that after the H-TNT-loaded Pt catalysts are annealed in H2 for the second time, the strong metal-support interaction between the H-TNTs and the Pt catalysts enhances the electrochemical stability of the electrodes. Fuel-cell testing shows that the power density reaches a maximum of 500 mWcm(-2) when this highly ordered electrode is used as the anode.

Using FeCl(3) as a catalyst, HMF is shown to alkylate toluene, xylene, and mesitylene in high yields in CH(2)Cl(2) and MeNO(2) solvents. Efforts to extend this reaction to greener or safer solvents showed that most ether-based solvents are unsatisfactory. Acid catalysts (e.g, p-TsOH) also proved to be ineffective. Using formic acid as a reactive solvent, mesitylene could be alkylated to give mesitylmethylfurfural (MMF) starting from fructose with yields up to approximately 70 %. The reaction of fructose with formic acid in the absence of mesitylene gave rise to low yields of the formate ester of HMF, which indicates the stabilizing effect of replacing the hydroxyl substituent with mesityl. The arene also serves as a second phase into which the product is extracted. Even by using formic acid, the mesitylation of less expensive precursors such as glucose and cellulose proceeded only in modest yields (ca. 20 %). These simpler substrates were found to undergo mesitylation by using hydrogen chloride\/formic acid via the intermediate chloromethylfurfural.","4669":"A disulfide\/thiolate (T(2)\/T(-)) redox-couple electrolyte, which is a promising iodine-free electrolyte owing to its transparent and noncorrosive properties, requires alternative counter-electrode materials because conventional Pt shows poor catalytic activity in such an electrolyte.

The mesoporous tungsten suboxide, which possesses interconnected pores of 4 and 20 nm, provides a large surface area and efficient electrolyte penetration into the m-WO(3-x) pores. In addition to the advantages conferred by the mesoporous structure, partial reduction of tungsten oxide creates oxygen vacancies that can function as active catalytic sites, which causes a high electrical conductivity because of intervalence charge transfer between the W(5+) and W(6+) ions. m-WO(3-x) shows a superior photovoltaic performance (79 % improvement in the power conversion efficiency) over Pt in the T(2)\/T(-) electrolyte. The superior catalytic activity of m-WO(3-x) is investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization curve analysis.","4670":"Spray pyrolysis was used to prepare films of AgInS(2) (AIS) with and without Sn as an extrinsic dopant. The photoelectrochemical performance of these films was evaluated after annealing under a N(2) or S atmosphere with different amounts of the Sn dopant. DFT was used to calculate the band structure of AIS and understand the role of Sn doping in the observed properties. All AIS films were n-type, and Sn was found to increase the photocurrent and carrier concentration of AIS with an optimum doping level of x=[Sn]\/([Ag]+[In])=0.02, which gave a photocurrent of 4.85 mA cm(-2). Above this level, the Sn dopants were detrimental to the photoelectrochemical performance, likely a result of a self-compensating effect and the introduction of a deep acceptor level, which could act as a recombination site for photogenerated carriers.","4671":null,"4672":null,"4673":"The rapid development in methods for transforming non-edible biomass into platform chemicals and fuels has accelerated over recent years.

We show, by using 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) as a concrete example, how a range of studies is needed to establish the benefits and risks of using a particular biofuel. In this regard, the variable with the largest impact about which little is known is probably the behaviour of DMF when it is accidentally introduced into groundwater.

In particular, magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (m-MWCNTs) coated with poly(vinylpyridine) (PVPy) self-aggregate in aqueous solutions that contain divalent metal ions (such as Zn(2+), Cu(2+) and Pb(2+)) to form tight insoluble bundles in which the M(2+) ions remain trapped through pyridyl-M(2+)-pyridyl interactions. Magnetic filtration ultimately affords the efficient separation of the depolluted solution from the precipitated M(2+)-CNT agglomerates. Upon acid treatment, the supramolecular threads could be disassembled to afford the free CNT-polymer hybrid, thus allowing recycling of the depolluting agent. All materials and complexation\/decomplexation steps were thoroughly characterised by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively).

The results show that the reasons for capacity fading over real charge-discharge cycling include not only the imbalanced vanadium active species, but also the asymmetrical valence of vanadium ions in positive and negative electrolytes. The asymmetrical valence of vanadium ions leads to a state-of-charge (SOC)-range decrease in positive electrolytes and a SOC-range increase in negative electrolytes. As a result, the higher SOC range in negative half-cells further aggravates capacity fading by creating a higher overpotential and possible hydrogen evolution. Based on this finding, we developed two methods for restoring lost capacity, thereby enabling long-term operation of VRBs to be achieved without the substantial loss of energy resulting from periodic total remixing of electrolytes.","4682":"No easy solutions: Choosing a solvent for a certain reaction is not easy, and involves sustainability on many levels.

Our strategy to improve the stability of the dye-TiO(2) interface is the encapsulation of the dye\/TiO(2) assembly in an amino-group-containing polyallylamine layer anchored to TiO(2). A low-pressure pulsed microwave discharge plasma polymerization process was employed to coat a commercial anatase nanopowder with a thin polyallylamine layer to nanoconfine the adsorbed dye molecules.

The second flow reactor contained fructose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase (RAMA, rabbit muscle aldolase) or rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (RhuA from Thermotoga maritima) and acid phosphatase. The immobilized aldolases coupled the formed dihydroxyacetone phosphate to aldehydes, resulting in phosphorylated carbohydrates. A final reactor containing acid phosphatase that dephosphorylated the phosphorylated product yielded the final product. Different aldehydes were used to synthesize carbohydrates on a gram scale.

By hydrothermal liquefaction, the wet biomass is partially transformed into a water-immiscible, oil-like organic matter called bio-oil. In this study, an integrated NMR spectroscopy\/mass spectrometry approach has been developed for the characterization of the hydrothermal liquefaction of bio-oil at the molecular level. (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy were used for the identification of functional groups and gauging the aromatic carbon content in the mixture. GC-MS analysis revealed that the volatile fraction was rich in fatty acids, as well as in amides and esters. High-resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) has been applied in a systematic way to fully categorize the bio-oil in terms of different classes of components, according to their molecular formulas. Most importantly, for the first time, by using this technique, and for the liquefaction bio-oil characterization in particular, FT-MS data have been used to develop a methodology for the determination of the aromatic versus aliphatic carbon and nitrogen content.

The volume of micropores in the range of 0.33-0.82 nm had a good linear relationship with CO(2) adsorption at 273 K and 1 bar, and the narrow micropores of about 0.55 nm produced the major contribution, which could be used to evaluate CO(2) adsorption on activated carbons.","4702":"Monodisperse yolk-shell SiO(2) -TiO(2) microspheres were synthesized using core-shell silica microspheres as templates.

These hollow nanospheres exhibited a higher activity than their bulk mesoporous counterparts (SBA-15 or FDU-12), mainly due to the short diffusion resistance of hollow nanospheres. Hollow nanospheres with silica frameworks showed higher activity and selectivity for MIBK than those with ethane-bridged frameworks, suggesting that hollow nanospheres with hydrophilic surface properties favor the formation of MIBK. This is probably due to the increased affinity of the hydrophilic surface towards acetone and its decreased affinity towards MIBK, which precludes deep condensation of MIBK with acetone. Under optimal conditions, up to 90 % selectivity for MIBK can be obtained with conversions of acetone as high as 43 %.

The sedimentation of fine tailings during such processes, however, can often require long periods of time and\/or the addition of flocculants which make later water recycling difficult. We propose the use of switchable water additives as reversible flocculants for clay\/water suspensions. Switchable water additives are compounds such as diamines that make it possible to reversibly control the ionic strength of an aqueous solution. Addition of CO(2) to such an aqueous solution causes the ionic strength to rise dramatically, and the change is reversed upon removal of the CO(2). These additives, while in the presence of CO(2), promote the aggregation of clay tailings, reduce settling times, and greatly increase the clarity of the liberated water. The removal of CO(2) from the liberated water regenerates a low ionic strength solution that does not promote clay aggregation and settling until CO(2) is added again. Such reversible behavior would be useful in applications such as oil sands separations in which the recycled water must not promote aggregation. When added to kaolinite and montmorillonite clay suspensions, switchable water provided process waters of lower turbidity than those additives from inorganic salts or by CO(2)-treatment alone. When recollected, the switchable water supernatant was shown to be recyclable over three cycles for enhanced settling of kaolinite.","4748":null,"4749":"The use of phenolic compounds as organocatalysts is discussed in the context of the atom-efficient cycloaddition of carbon dioxide to epoxides, forming useful cyclic organic carbonate products.

The technology has reached a level of maturity that it is now considered to be a field in its own right with a growing scientific community. The highest level of activity has been recorded over the last decade and it is perhaps considered commonplace that MFCs are primarily suitable for stationary, passive wastewater treatment applications. Sceptics have certainly not considered MFCs as serious contenders in the race for developing renewable energy technologies. Yet this is the only type of alternative system that can convert organic waste-widely distributed around the globe-directly into electricity, and therefore, the only technology that will allow artificial agents to autonomously operate in a plethora of environments.

This article firstly gives an overview of the particular constraints imposed on ORR by MFC operating conditions: neutral pH, slow oxygen mass transfer, sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, fouling and biofouling. A review of the literature is then proposed to assess how microbial catalysis could afford suitable solutions. Actually, microbial catalysis of ORR occurs spontaneously on the surface of metallic materials and is an effective motor of microbial corrosion. In this framework, several mechanisms have been proposed, which are reviewed in the second part of the article. The last part describes the efforts made in the domain of MFCs to determine the microbial ecology of electroactive biofilms and define efficient protocols for the formation of microbial oxygen-reducing cathodes. Although no clear mechanism has been established yet, several promising solutions have been recently proposed.","4848":"Microbial bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) employ whole microorganisms to catalyze electrode reactions. BESs allow electricity generation from wastewater, electricity-driven (bio)production, biosensing, and bioremediation. Many of these processes are perceived as highly promising; however, to date the performance of particularly bioproduction processes is not yet at the level required for practical applications. Critical to enabling high catalytic activity are the electrochemically active microorganisms. Whether the biocatalyst comes as a planktonic cell, a surface monolayer of cells, or a fully developed biofilm, effective electron transfer and process performance need to be achieved. However, despite many different approaches and extensive research, many questions regarding the functioning of electroactive microorganisms remain open. This is certainly due to the complexity of bioelectrochemical processes, as they depend on microbial, electrochemical, physical-chemical, and operational considerations. This versatility and complexity calls for a plethora of analytical tools required to study electrochemically active microorganisms, especially biofilms. Here, we present an overview of the parameters defining electroactive microbial biofilms (EABfs) and the analytical toolbox available to study them at different levels of resolution. As we will show, a broad diversity of techniques have been applied to this field; however, these have often led to conflicting information. Consequently, to alleviate this and further mature the field of BES research, a standardized framework appears essential.","4849":"Cathodic limitation in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is considered an important hurdle towards practical application as a bioenergy technology. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) needs to occur in MFCs under significantly different conditions compared to chemical fuel cells, including a neutral pH. The common reason cited for cathodic limitation is the difficulty in providing protons to the catalyst sites. Here, we show that it is not the availability of protons, but the transport of OH(-) from the catalyst layer to the bulk liquid that largely governs cathodic potential losses. OH(-) is a product of an ORR mechanism that has not been considered dominant before. The accumulation of OH(-) at the catalyst sites results in an increase in the local cathode pH, resulting in Nernstian concentration losses. For Pt-based gas-diffusion cathodes, using polarization curves developed in unbuffered and buffered solutions, we quantified this loss to be &gt;0.3 V at a current density of 10 Am(-2) . We show that this loss can be partially overcome by replacing the Nafion binder used in the cathode catalyst layer with an anion-conducting binder and by providing additional buffer to the cathode catalyst directly in the form of CO(2) , which results in enhanced OH(-) transport. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of cathodic limitations in MFCs and should allow researchers to develop and select materials for the construction of MFC cathodes and identify operational conditions that will help minimize Nernstian concentration losses due to pH gradients.","4850":null,"4851":"The discovery that Geobacter sulfurreducens can produce protein filaments with metallic-like conductivity, known as microbial nanowires, that facilitate long-range electron transport is a paradigm shift in biological electron transfer and has important implications for biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, and the emerging field of bioelectronics. Although filaments in a wide diversity of microorganisms have been called microbial nanowires, the type IV pili of G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens are the only filaments that have been shown to be required for extracellular electron transport to extracellular electron acceptors or for conduction of electrons through biofilms. Studies of G. sulfurreducens pili preparations and intact biofilms under physiologically relevant conditions have provided multiple lines of evidence for metallic-like conduction along the length of pili and for the possibility of pili networks to confer high conductivity within biofilms. This mechanism of electron conduction contrasts with the previously known mechanism for biological electron transfer via electron tunneling or hopping between closely associated molecules, a strategy unlikely to be well adapted for long-range electron transport outside the cell. In addition to promoting electron exchange with abiotic electron acceptors, microbial nanowires have recently been shown to be involved in direct interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic partners. An improved understanding of the mechanisms for metallic-like conductivity in microbial nanowires, as well as engineering microorganisms with desirable catalytic abilities with nanowires, could lead to new applications in microbial electrosynthesis and bioelectronics.","4852":"The number of investigations involving bioelectrochemical systems (BES), processes in which microorganisms catalyze electrode reactions, is increasing while their mechanisms remain unresolved. Geobacter sulfurreducens strain DL1 is a model electrode catalyst that forms multimicrobe-thick biofilms on anodes that catalyze the oxidation of acetate to result in an electric current. Here, we report the characterization by cyclic voltammetry (CV) of DL1 biofilm-modified anodes (biofilm anodes) performed during biofilm development. This characterization, based on our recently reported model of biofilm anode catalytic activity, indicates the following. 1) As a biofilm grows, catalytic activity scales linearly with the amount of anode-accessible redox cofactor in the biofilm. This observation is consistent with a catalytic activity that is limited during biofilm growth by electron transport from within cells to the extracellular redox cofactor. 2) Distinct voltammetric features are exhibited that reflect the presence of a redox cofactor expressed by cells that initially colonize an anode that is not involved in catalytic current generation.","4853":"Microbial biocathodes allow converting and storing electricity produced from renewable sources in chemical fuels (e.g., H(2) ) and are, therefore, attracting considerable attention as alternative catalysts to more expensive and less available noble metals (notably Pt). Microbial biocathodes for H(2) production rely on the ability of hydrogenase-possessing microorganisms to catalyze proton reduction, with a solid electrode serving as direct electron donor. This study provides new chemical and electrochemical data on the bioelectrocatalytic activity of Desulfovibrio species. A combination of chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy tests were used to assess the performance of the H(2) -producing microbial biocathode and to shed light on the involved electron transfer mechanisms. Cells attached onto a graphite electrode were found to catalyze H(2) production for cathode potentials more reducing than -900 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode. The highest obtained H(2) production was 8 mmol L(-1) per day, with a Coulombic efficiency close to 100 %. The electrochemical performance of the biocathode changed over time probably due to the occurrence of enzyme activation processes induced by extended electrode polarization. Remarkably, H(2) (at least up to 20 % v\/v) was not found to significantly inhibit its own production.","4854":"So close, but yet so far: G. sulfurreducens c-type cytochromes become reduced as biofilms grow on electrodes beyond a few cell thicknesses, even if the electrode is poised well above the potential required to oxidize all cytochromes.

Strains of G. sulfurreducens were generated, in which the expression of the gene for a short half-life fluorescent protein was placed under control of the promoter of the genes of interest. Anode biofilms were grown in a chamber that permitted direct examination of the cell fluorescence with confocal scanning laser microscopy. Studies on nifD and citrate synthase expression in response to environmental changes demonstrated that the reporter system revealed initiation and termination of gene transcription. Uniform expression throughout the biofilms was noted for the genes for citrate synthase; PilA, the structural protein of the conductive pili; and OmcZ, a c-type cytochrome essential for optimal current production, which was localized at the anode-biofilm interface. These results demonstrate that even cells at great distance from the anode, or within expected low-pH zones, are metabolically active and likely to contribute to current production and that there are factors other than gene expression differences influencing the distribution of OmcZ. This real-time reporter approach is likely to be a useful tool in optimizing the design of technologies relying on microbe-electrode interactions.","4856":"The thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks offers an important potential route for the production of biofuels and value-added green chemicals.

The following data support the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis to be acid-catalyzed: (i) increase in number of reducing ends following cellulose dissolution in IL; (ii) addition of N-methylimidazolium base suppresses cellulose depolymerization during dissolution in IL; (iii) small amounts of glucose and traces of hydroxymethyl furfural are present following cellulose dissolution in IL. The acid is presumably synthesized via IL decomposition to generate a carbene and proton, consistent with hypothesis derived from molecular modeling.

They have energy densities much higher than those of conventional capacitors and possess much better power delivery capabilities than batteries. This makes them unique devices that can outperform both batteries and conventional capacitors under special circumstances. Nanocarbons are the main electrode materials for supercapacitors. Abundant sources of nanocarbons and facile processes of modification have led to the fabrication of cheap electrodes. In this review, we focus on the capacitance performance of highly porous activated carbons and attempt to determine the role of different pores. Elaborate discussions are presented on individual contributions from micro- and mesopores and their mutual dependence. This article also presents a comparative performance report for both random and ordered porous nanocarbons. Novel carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, and their contributions in this context are discussed. We summarize key techniques for the functionalization of nanocarbons and their pseudocapacitive charge-storage mechanisms. Nanocarbon composites with redox-active transition-metal oxides and conducting polymers are highlighted along with their impact as electrode materials.

These are global challenges, and their resolution is vital to our energy security. Although many conventional materials, such as metals, ceramics, and plastics, cannot fulfil all requirements for these new technologies, many material combinations can offer synergistic effects that create improved and even new properties. The implementation of nanocarbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, into nanocomposites and, more recently, into the new class of hybrids, are very promising examples. In contrast to classical nanocomposites, where a low volume fraction of the carbon component is mixed into a polymer or ceramic matrix, hybrids are materials in which nanocarbon is coated with a thin layer of the functional compound, which introduces the interface as a powerful new parameter. Based on interfacial charge and energy transfer processes, nanocarbon hybrids have shown increased sensitivities in gas sensors, improved efficiencies in photovoltaics, superior activities in photocatalysts, and enhanced capacities in supercapacitors. This review compares the characteristics and potentials of both nanocarbon composites and hybrids, highlights recent developments in their synthesis and discusses key challenges for their use in various energy applications.","4914":null,"4915":null,"4916":"AHA Erlebnis: CaC(2), used to produce acetylene until several decades ago, is re-emerging as a cheap, sustainable resource synthesized from coal and lignocellulosic biomass.

To achieve such requirements, intensive studies have been carried out to improve the volumetric capacitance in supercapacitors using various types and forms of carbons including carbon nanotubes and graphenes. However, conventional porous carbons are not suitable for use as electrode material in supercapacitors for such high energy density applications. Here, we show that edge-enriched porous carbons are the best electrode material for high energy density supercapacitors to be used in vehicles as an auxiliary powertrain. Molten potassium hydroxide penetrates well-aligned graphene layers vertically and consequently generates both suitable pores that are easily accessible to the electrolyte and a large fraction of electrochemically active edge sites.

Isotherms of methane, ethane, propane, hydrogen, nitrogen, and CO(2) were measured. The atypical shape of these isotherms is attributed to the breathing properties of the material, in which a transition from a very narrow pore form to a narrow pore form and from a narrow pore form to a large pore form occurs, depending on the total pressure and the nature of the adsorbate, as demonstrated by in situ XRD patterns measured during adsorption. Apart from CO(2), all tested gases interacted weakly with the adsorbent. As a result, they are excluded from adsorption in the narrow pore form of the material at low pressure. CO(2) interacted much more strongly and was adsorbed in significant amounts at low pressure. This gives the material excellent properties to separate CO(2) from other gases. The separation of CO(2) from methane, nitrogen, hydrogen, or a combination of these gases has been demonstrated by breakthrough experiments using pellets of NH(2)-MIL-53(Al). The effect of total pressure (1-30 bar), gas composition, temperature (303-403 K) and contact time has been examined. In all cases, CO(2) was selectively adsorbed, whereas methane, nitrogen, and hydrogen nearly did not adsorb at all. Regeneration of the adsorbent by thermal treatment, inert purge gas stripping, and pressure swing has been demonstrated. The NH(2)-MIL-53(Al) pellets retained their selectivity and capacity for more than two years.","4921":"Pre-shaped hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) spheres have been synthesized through a facile anion exchanged route. An industrial polymeric anion-exchange resin with a hierarchical pore structure was used as the carbon precursor. Its high porosity was conserved using an aluminate\/silicate precursor forming a hard support to prevent the structural collapse during the carbonization process. Physicochemical bulk and surface properties of the obtained HPC spheres were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, N(2)  physisorption, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Results obtained indicate that HPC keeps the abundant hierarchical porosity including meso- and macropores as well as the high surface area of the resin precursor. The as-synthesized HPC spheres were tested as a catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. The oxygen-rich catalyst surface formed under reaction conditions shows a high catalytic performance and stability, making HPC to a potential catalyst for this type of reaction.","4922":"Fe oxide nanoparticles show enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the reduction of CO(2) to isopropanol when deposited on an N-functionalized carbon nanotube (CNT) support rather than on a pristine or oxidized CNT support. XRD and high-resolution TEM were used to investigate the nanostructure of the electrocatalysts, and CO(2) adsorptive microcalorimetry was used to study the chemical nature of the interaction of CO(2) with the surface sites. Although the particles always present the same Fe(3)O(4) phase, their structural anisotropy and size inhomogeneity are consequences of the preparation method of the carbon surface. Two types of chemisorption sites have been determined by using microcalorimetry: irreversible sites (280 kJ mol(-1)) at the uncoordinated sites of the facets and reversible sites (120 kJ mol(-1)) at the hydrated oxide surface of the small nanoparticles. N-Functionalization of the carbon support is advantageous, as it causes the formation of small nanoparticles, which are highly populated by reversible chemisorbing sites. These characteristic features correlate with a higher electrocatalytic performance.","4923":null,"4924":"The mechanistic nature of the conversion of carbohydrates to the sustainable platform chemical 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) was revealed at the molecular level.

In vitro lignin polymerization experiments revealed that RA readily underwent peroxidase-catalyzed copolymerization with monolignols and lignin oligomers to form polymers with new benzodioxane inter-unit linkages. Incorporation of RA permitted extensive depolymerization of synthetic lignins by mild alkaline hydrolysis, presumably by cleavage of ester intra-unit linkages within RA. Copolymerization of RA with monolignols into maize cell walls by in situ peroxidases significantly enhanced alkaline lignin extractability and promoted subsequent cell wall saccharification by fungal enzymes. Incorporating RA also improved cell wall saccharification by fungal enzymes and by rumen microflora even without alkaline pretreatments, possibly by modulating lignin hydrophobicity and\/or limiting cell wall cross-linking. Consequently, we anticipate that bioengineering approaches for partial monolignol substitution with RA and analogous plant hydroxycinnamates would permit more efficient utilization of plant fiber for biofuels or livestock production.","4926":"The methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is becoming the most important non-petrochemical route for the production of light olefins from coal or natural gas. Maximizing the generation of the target products, ethene and propene, and minimizing the production of byproducts and coke, are major considerations in the efficient utilization of the carbon resource of methanol. In the present work, the heterogeneous catalytic conversion of methanol was evaluated by performing simultaneous measurements of the volatile products generated in the gas phase and the confined coke deposition in the catalyst phase. Real-time and complete reaction profiles were plotted to allow the comparison of carbon atom economy of methanol conversion over the catalyst SAPO-34 at varied reaction temperatures. The difference in carbon atom economy was closely related with the coke formation in the SAPO-34 catalyst. The confined coke compounds were determined. A new type of confined organics was found, and these accounted for the quick deactivation and low carbon atom economy under low-reaction-temperature conditions. Based on the carbon atom economy evaluation and coke species determination, optimized operating conditions for the MTO process are suggested; these conditions guarantee high conversion efficiency of methanol.","4927":"Following the lead of the European Union in introducing binding measures to promote the use of regenerative energy forms, it is not unreasonable to assume that the global demand for combustible raw materials for energy generation will be reduced considerably in the second half of this century. This will not only have a favourable effect on the CO(2)  concentration in the atmosphere, but will also help preserve fossil fuels-important as raw materials in the chemical industry-for future generations. Nevertheless, associated with the concomitant massive shift to regenerative energy forms, there will be a strong demand for other exhaustible raw materials, in particular metals, some of which are already regarded as scarce. After reviewing the debate on mineral depletion between \"cornucopians\" and \"pessimists\", we discuss the meaning of mineral \"scarcity\", particularly in the geochemical sense, and mineral \"exhaustion\". The expected drastic increase in demand for mineral resources caused by demographic and societal pressures, that is, due to the increase in in-use stock, is emphasised. Whilst not discussing the issue of \"strong\" versus \"weak\" sustainability in detail, we conclude that regenerative energy systems-like nearly all resource-consuming systems in our society-do not necessarily satisfy generally accepted sustainability criteria. In this regard, we discuss some current examples, namely, lithium and cobalt for batteries, rare earth-based permanent magnets for wind turbines, cadmium and tellurium for solar cells and copper for electrical power distribution.","4928":null,"4929":"","4930":"A general procedure for the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated electrooxidation of primary and secondary alcohols modified for application in a microfluidic electrolytic cell is described.

Standards of cellulose and pure reaction products, which include glucose, fructose, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), levulinic acid (LA), formic acid, and other compounds, were measured in water under ambient and elevated temperatures. A combination of spectroscopic and HPLC analysis revealed that the cellulose hydrolysis proceeds first through the disruption of the glycosidic linkages of cellulose to form smaller cellulose molecules, which are readily observed by their distinctive C-O vibrational stretches. The continued disruption of the linkages in these oligomers eventually results in the formation and accumulation of monomeric glucose. The solid-acid catalyst accelerated the isomerization of glucose to fructose, which then rapidly reacted under hydrothermal conditions to form degradation products, which included HMF, LA, formic acid, and acetic acid. The formation of these species could be suppressed by decreasing the residence time of glucose in the reactor, reaction temperature, and contact with the metal reactor. The hydrolysis of regenerated cellulose proceeded faster and under milder conditions than microcrystalline cellulose, which resulted in increased glucose yield and selectivity.","4938":"","4939":"","4940":null,"4941":"","4942":null,"4943":"The simple transfer of established chemical production processes from batch to flow chemistry does not automatically result in more sustainable ones.

Stoichiometric amounts of activation reagents are often avoided. This fact and the milder catalytic reaction conditions diminish the formation of byproducts. In the case of homogeneous catalysis, organometallic compounds are often applied. The combination of both techniques develops synergistic effects in the sense of \"Green Chemistry\". Herein, metal carbonyl-mediated reactions are reported. These transformations are of considerable interest for the synthesis of complex polyfunctionalized compounds. Copper(I)-catalyzed [2+2] photocycloaddition gives access to a large variety of cyclobutane derivatives. Currently, a large number of publications deal with photochemical electron-transfer-induced reactions with organometallic and coordination compounds, particularly with ruthenium complexes. Several photochemically induced oxidations can easily be performed with air or molecular oxygen when they are catalyzed with organometallic complexes. Photochemical reaction conditions also play a certain role in C-H activation with organometallic catalysts, for instance, with alkanes, although such transformations are conveniently performed with a variety of other photochemical reactions.","4946":"The miniaturization of continuous processes has been of increasing interest in the past decade, and microreaction technology and flow chemistry have moved from academic and industrial research to commercial applications.

PU thermosets were prepared by using aliphatic polyisocyanates based on isophorone diisocyanate and hexamethylene diisocyanate. The properties of the PUs were studied by performing tensile testing, dynamic mechanical analysis, DSC, and thermogravimetric analysis. The properties of PU coatings on steel substrates were evaluated by using ASTM methods to determine coating hardness, adhesion, solvent resistance, and ductility.

Functional catalysts were prepared by dispersing the nanostructures onto an Al(2)O(3) support; and vibrational spectra of adsorbed CO, together with adsorption uptakes, were used to demonstrate the accessibility of the metal core to CO and the porous nature of the oxide shell. Measurements of water-gas-shift (WGS) rates demonstrated that these catalysts exhibit activities similar to that of conventional supported catalysts despite having lower metal dispersions. Pd-based CeO(2) and TiO(2) core-shell catalysts exhibit significant transient deactivation, which is probably caused by a decrease in the exposed metal surface area due to the ease of reduction of the shells. Alternatively, Pt-based analogous core-shell catalysts do not exhibit such a transient decrease. Both Pd- and Pt-based ZrO(2) core-shell catalysts deactivate at a significantly lower rate due to the less reducible nature of the ZrO(2) shell.","4954":"Optically active amphiphilic compounds derived from N-methylephedrine, N-methylprolinol, or cinchona derivatives possessing bromide or chiral lactate counterions were efficiently used as protective agents for rhodium(0) nanoparticles.

Applications as monomers and building blocks for new polymers and functional materials, new organic solvents, for medical and pharmaceutical applications, and even as fuels or fuel additives are conceivable.

The activity of the Au\/foamCeO(2) for solvent-free benzyl alcohol oxidation was superior to standard Au\/CeO(2) catalysts, and the activity was found to be dependent on the crystallization time of the precursor foam. A crystallization time of 4 h was found to produce the most active catalyst, which retained activity and a high selectivity to benzaldehyde (ca. 96 %) when re-used and this is related to the structure of the material.

The halide anion strongly absorbs to the nanoparticle surface, leading to exceptional nanoparticle stability in halide ionic liquids; other tetraalkylphosphonium ionic liquids with non-coordinating anions, such as tosylate and hexafluorophosphate, show considerably lower affinities towards the stabilization of nanoparticles. Palladium nanoparticles stabilized in the tetraalkylphosphonium halide ionic liquid were stable, efficient, and recyclable catalysts for a variety of hydrogenation reactions at ambient pressures with sustained activity. Aerial oxidation of the metal nanoparticles occurred over time and was readily reversed by re-reduction of oxidized metal salts.","4972":null,"4973":"The catalytic role of the Pt--Fe cation ensemble presented at the perimeters of the FeO film supported on Pt(111) for low-temperature CO oxidation and the promotion of water on activity were studied by using DFT calculations. We found that the perimeter sites along the edge of the FeO islands on Pt provided a favorable ensemble that consisted of coordinatively unsaturated ferrous species and nearby Pt atoms for O(2) and H(2) O activation free from CO poison. A dissociative oxygen atom at the Pt--Fe cation ensemble reacts easily with CO adsorbed on nearby Pt. The OH group from water dissociation not only facilitates activation of the oxygen molecule, more importantly it opens a facile reaction channel for CO oxidation through the formation of the carboxyl intermediate. The presence of the OH group on the FeO film strengthens interfacial interactions between FeO and Pt(111), which would make the FeO film more resistant to further oxidation. The importance of the Pt--Fe cation ensemble and the role of water as a cocatalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation is highlighted.","4974":"A series of renewable bisphenols has been synthesized from creosol (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) through stoichiometric condensation with short-chain aldehydes. Creosol can be readily produced from lignin, potentially allowing for the large scale synthesis of bisphenol A replacements from abundant waste biomass. The renewable bisphenols were isolated in good yields and purities without resorting to solvent-intense purification methods. Zinc acetate was shown to be a selective catalyst for the ortho-coupling of formaldehyde, but was unreactive when more sterically demanding aldehydes were used. Dilute HCl and HBr solutions were shown to be effective catalysts for the selective coupling of aldehydes in the position meta to the hydroxyl group.

The resulting pyrazolylphosphonium cations are valuable synthetic intermediates and are used for the synthesis of a variety of organophosphorus compounds. This represents a new approach towards the transformation of the rather inert phosphoryl group under very mild reaction and workup conditions and aims towards alternatives to existing reduction methods for phosphane oxide functionalization.","4979":"Ultrasound synthesis of zinc oxide from zinc acetate and sodium hydroxide in ionic liquids (ILs) is a fast, facile, and effective, yet highly morphology- and size-selective route to zinc oxide nanostructures of various dimensionalities. No additional organic solvents, water, surfactants, or templating agents are required. Depending on the synthetic conditions, the selective manufacturing of 0D, 1D, and 2D ZnO nanostructures is possible: Whereas the formation of rodlike structures is typically favored, ZnO nanoparticles can be obtained either under strongly basic conditions or by use of ILs with a long alkyl chain, such as 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([C(n)mim][Tf(2)N]; n&gt;8). A short ultrasound irradiation time favors the formation of ZnO nanosheets. Prolonged irradiation leads to the conversion of the ZnO nanosheets into nanorods. In contrast, ionothermal synthesis (conventional heating) does not allow for morphology tuning by variation of the IL or other synthesis conditions, as the longer reaction times required lead always to the formation of well-developed hexagonal nanocrystals with prismatic tips. The ZnO nanostructures synthesized by using ultrasound were efficient photocatalysts in the photodegradation of methyl orange. The photoactivity was observed to be as high as 95 % for ZnO nanoparticles obtained in [C(10)mim][Tf(2)N].","4980":"The Fenton reaction is widely used for remediation of waste water and for the degradation of organic pollutants in water. Currently, there is considerable interest to convert the classical Fenton reaction, which consumes stoichiometric amounts of iron(II) salts, into a catalytic process that is promoted by a solid.

The interest in this type of catalyst derives from the wide use of carbon in conventional water treatments and the wide applicability of the Fenton reaction. After two general sections that illustrate the scope and background of Fenton chemistry, the review describes the activity of activated carbon in the absence or presence of metal-containing particles. The last sections of the review focus on different types of carbonaceous materials, such as carbon nanotubes and diamond nanoparticles.

During tests, the metal or oxide nanoparticles could be further sintered, which would induces deactivation. Direct incorporation of the active phase into the matrix of a support could be an elegant alternative to prevent catalyst deactivation. Here, we report that nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) can be efficiently employed as a metal-free catalyst for oxidative reactions that allow the selective transformation of the harmful, gaseous H(2)S into solid sulfur. The catalyst exhibits a high stability during the test at high space velocity. The macroscopic shaping of the catalyst on the silicon carbide foam also increases its catalytic activity by improving the contact between the reactants and the catalyst. Such macroscopic shaping allows the avoidance of problems linked with transport and handling of nanoscopic materials and also reduces the pressure drop across the catalyst bed to a large extent.","4987":"We report an efficient three-step strategy for synthesizing rigid, chiral isohexide diamines derived from 1,4:3,6-dianhydrohexitols.

Among the three possible stereo-isomers, dideoxy-diamino isoidide and dideoxy-diamino isosorbide can be synthesized from isomannide and isosorbide respectively in high yield with absolute stereo control. Furthermore, by using this methodology dideoxy-amino isomannide-a tricyclic adduct-was obtained starting from isoidide in high yield.

The material prepared by supporting a bromide bis-imidazolium salt on the ordered mesoporous silica SBA-15 was identified as the most active catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates and displayed improved productivity compared with known supported ionic liquid catalysts. The catalyst retained its high activity upon reuse in consecutive catalytic runs.

Redox flow batteries are considered to be among the best options for electricity storage in the megawatt range and large demonstration systems have already been installed. Although the full technological potential of these systems has not been reached yet, currently the main problem hindering more widespread commercialization is the high cost of redox flow batteries. Nafion, as the preferred membrane material, is responsible for about 11% of the overall cost of a 1 MW\/8 MWh system. Therefore, in recent years two main membrane related research threads have emerged: 1) chemical and physical modification of Nafion membranes to optimize their properties with regard to vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) application; and 2) replacement of the Nafion membranes with different, less expensive materials. This review summarizes the underlying basic scientific issues associated with membrane use in VRFBs and presents an overview of membrane-related research approaches aimed at improving the efficiency of VRFBs and making the technology cost-competitive.

The SiO(2)\/Pd\/h-ZrO(2) nanoreactors are fabricated by first synthesizing SiO(2)\/Pd\/SiO(2)\/ZrO(2) microspheres, and then etching the inner SiO(2) shell with dilute NaOH solution. The hollow and nanoporous ZrO(2) shell of the nanoreactors serves two important functions: 1) it provides reactants direct access to the Pd nanoparticle multicores inside the SiO(2)\/Pd\/h-ZrO(2) nanoreactors during catalysis, and 2) it stabilizes the Pd nanoparticles or protects them from aggregation\/sintering. The fabrication of such structures capable of protecting the Pd nanoparticles from aggregation\/sintering is of particular interest considering the fact that Pd nanoparticles generally have a high tendency to aggregate because of their high surface energies. Furthermore, the structures are interesting because the Pd nanoparticles are designed and synthesized here to have 'naked' surfaces or no organic surface-passivating ligands-that are often necessary to stabilize metallic nanoparticles-in order to increase their catalytic efficiency. The resulting SiO(2)\/Pd\/h-ZrO(2) nanoreactors show excellent catalytic activity, as shown in the hydrogenation of olefins and nitro groups, even at room temperature under moderate hydrogen pressure. This stems from the SiO(2)\/Pd\/h-ZrO(2) microspheres' high surface area and their small, stable, and bare Pd nanoparticles. Furthermore, the SiO(2)\/Pd\/h-ZrO(2) nanoreactor catalysts remain fairly stable after reaction and can be recycled multiple times without losing their high catalytic activities.","4999":"Glycerol carbonate can be readily synthesized from the oxidative carbonylation of glycerol catalyzed by PdCl(2)(phen) (phen=1,10-phenanthroline) with the aid of CuI.

UV-ozone irradiation was targeted at the surface of the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layers by varying the irradiation time up to 600 s. The change of the surface characteristics in the PEDOT:PSS after UV-ozone irradiation was measured by employing optical absorption spectroscopy, photoelectron yield spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements, while Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques were introduced for more microscopic analysis. Results showed that the UV-ozone irradiation changed the chemical structure\/composition of the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layers leading to the gradual increase of ionization potential with irradiation time in the presence of up-and-down variations in the contact angle (polarity). This surface property change was attributed to the formation of oxidative components, as evidenced by XPS and Auger electron images, which affected the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS layers. Interestingly, device performance was slightly improved by short irradiation (up to 10 s), whereas it was gradually decreased by further irradiation. The short-duration illumination test showed that the lifetime of solar cells with the UV-ozone irradiated PEDOT:PSS layer was improved due to the protective role of the oxidative components formed upon UV-ozone irradiation against the attack of sulfonic acid groups in the PEDOT:PSS layer to the active layer.","5014":"","5015":"","5016":"","5017":null,"5018":"","5019":"","5020":"As a key component of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) must continuously withstand very harsh environments during long-term fuel cell operations.

Higher ethanol conversion and lower CH(4) selectivity are observed for the Co\/ZrO(2) catalyst promoted with Zn as compared to the Co\/ZrO(2) catalyst alone.

The majority of the converted carbon was in the form of ethylene, where the ethanol carbon-carbon bonds stayed intact while the oxygen was removed. Over 90% yield of ethylene was achieved by using methane as a sacrificial fuel.

Addition of 15 vol% water leads to an increase of 40% in the discharge capacity as compared to the capacity obtained using a pure ionic liquid electrolyte. If the water content increases above 20 vol%, the Si-air cell capacity dramatically decreases. The water-ionic liquid electrolyte mixture shows a maximum in the ionic conductivity with a water content of 10 vol%. In-depth studies indicate a reduced amount of discharge product at the air electrode using 15 vol% H(2)O electrolyte. The morphology of the anode surface, as well as the developed surface film in the presence of water-containing ionic liquid, is reported.

The use of water\/oil biphasic reaction conditions allowed the selective synthesis of monoethers with improved rates upon using inorganic bases as promotors. As isosorbide is a non-symmetric diol, the two hydroxyl groups display different reactivities. 2-O-substituted-monoethers were preferentially obtained if water was used as the solvent, whereas in DMSO 5-O-substituted monoethers were the major products. Complete conversions of isosorbide with up to 94% monoether selectivities were obtained. The optimized reaction conditions were successfully applied to isomannide and isoidide for the selective synthesis of the derived ethers.

Both their fluorescence in the near-infrared range of 820-1600 nm, where absorption by biological tissues is often minimal, and their inherent photostability are desirable attributes for the design of in vitro and in vivo sensors. The mechanisms by which a target molecule can selectively alter the fluorescent emission include primarily changes in emission wavelength (i.e., solvatochromism) and intensity, including effects such as charge-transfer transition bleaching and exciton quenching. The central challenge lies in engineering the nanotube interface to be selective for the analyte of interest.

This Review describes the state-of-the-art of CNT synthesis, with a focus on their mass-production in industry. At the nanoscale, the production of CNTs involves the self-assembly of carbon atoms into a one-dimensional tubular structure. We describe how this synthesis can be achieved on the macroscopic scale in processes akin to the continuous tonne-scale mass production of chemical products in the modern chemical industry. Our overview includes discussions on processing methods for high-purity CNTs, and the handling of heat and mass transfer problems. Manufacturing strategies for agglomerated and aligned single-\/multiwalled CNTs are used as examples of the engineering science of CNT production, which includes an understanding of their growth mechanism, agglomeration mechanism, reactor design, and process intensification. We aim to provide guidelines for the production and commercialization of CNTs. Although CNTs can now be produced on the tonne scale, knowledge of the growth mechanism at the atomic scale, the relationship between CNT structure and application, and scale-up of the production of CNTs with specific chirality are still inadequate. A multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the CNT industry.","5073":"Tremendous progress has been achieved during the past 20 years on not only improving the yields of carbon nanotubes and move progressively towards their mass production, but also on gaining a profound fundamental understanding of the nucleation and the growth processes. Parameters that influence the yield but also the quality (e.g., microstructure, homogeneity within a batch) are better understood. The influence of the carbon precursor, the reaction conditions, the presence of a catalyst, the chemical and physical status of the latter, and other factors have been extensively studied. The purpose of the present Review is not to list all the experiments reported in the literature, but rather to identify trends and provide a comprehensive summary on the role of selected parameters. The role of the catalyst occupies a central place in this Review as a careful control of the metal particle size, particle dispersion on the support, the metastable phase formed under reaction conditions, its possible reconstruction, and faceting strongly influence the diameter of the carbon nanotubes, their structure (number of walls, graphene sheet orientation, chirality), their alignment, and the yield.

This process integrates CO(2) capture with mineral carbonation by employing NH(3), NH(4)HSO(4), and NH(4)HCO(3) in the capture, mineral dissolution, and carbonation steps, respectively. NH(4)HSO(4) and NH(3) can then be regenerated by thermal decomposition of (NH(4))(2)SO(4). The use of NH(4)HCO(3) as the source of CO(2) can avoid desorption and compression of CO(2). The mass ratio of Mg\/NH(4)HCO(3)\/NH(3) is the key factor controlling carbonation and the optimum ratio of 1:4:2 gives a conversion of Mg ions to hydromagnesite of 95.5%. Thermogravimetric analysis studies indicated that the regeneration efficiency of NH(4)HSO(4) and NH(3) in this process is 95%. The mass balance of the process shows that about 2.63 tonnes of serpentine, 0.12 tonnes of NH(4)HSO(4), 7.48 tonnes of NH(4)HCO(3), and 0.04 tonnes of NH(3) are required to sequester 1 tonne of CO(2) as hydromagnesite.","5075":"Engineered nanomaterials, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs), hold great promise for a variety of industrial, consumer, and biomedical applications, due to their outstanding and novel properties. Over the last two decades many different types of CNTs have been produced at the industrial scale. Therefore, the exposure risk to humans associated with such a mass scale production has also increased substantially. This has led to increased concerns about the potential adverse health effects that may be associated with human exposure to CNTs, predominantly because of to their size, their shape, and chemistry. CNTs are also intended for use in many biomedical applications, and therefore their biocompatibility, biodistribution, and fate needs to be carefully assessed. This Minireview intends to highlight the current state of the assessment of potential adverse human health effects possibly associated with CNT exposure, as well as the challenges related to and posed by CNT safety research.

Carbon dioxide is widely regarded as one of the major factors contributing to the greenhouse effect, which is of major concern in today's society because it leads to global warming. Photosynthesis is Nature's tool for combating elevated carbon dioxide levels. In essence, photosynthesis allows a cell to harvest solar energy and convert it into chemical energy through the assimilation of carbon dioxide and water. Therefore photosynthesis is regarded as an ideal way to harness the abundance of solar energy that reaches Earth and convert anthropologically generated carbon dioxide into useful carbohydrates, providing a much more sustainable energy source. This Minireview aims to tackle the idea of immobilizing photosynthetic unicellular organisms within inert silica frameworks, providing protection both to the fragile cells and to the external ecosystem, and to use this resultant living hybrid material in a photobioreactor.

They are typically produced by homogeneous catalysis in aqueous solutions. However, heterogeneously catalyzed processes would be beneficial in view of the principles of green chemistry: the elimination of homogeneous mineral acids makes the reaction mixtures less corrosive, produces less waste, and facilitates easy separation and recovery of the catalyst. Finding an active and stable water-tolerant solid acid catalyst still poses a challenge for the production of furfural (furan-2-carbaldehyde) and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF). Furfural is produced in the dehydration of xylose, and HMF is formed from glucose and fructose in the presence of an acidic catalyst. Bases are not active in dehydration reaction but do catalyze the isomerization of monosaccharides, which is favorable when using glucose as a raw material. In addition to the desired dehydration of monosaccharides, many undesired side reactions take place, reducing the selectivity and deactivating the catalyst. In addition, the catalyst properties play an important role in the selectivity. In this Review, catalytic conversion approaches are summarized, focusing on the heterogeneously catalyzed formation of furfural. The attractiveness of catalytic concepts is evaluated, keeping in mind productivity, sustainability, and environmental footprint.","5078":"","5079":"","5080":null,"5081":"Sn-based SBA-15 was prepared by reacting di-n-butyldimethoxystannane with SBA-15 pretreated with trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) to cap the external hydroxyl groups.

This novel material catalyzes selectively the coupling of CO(2) with methanol to dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The reaction time-conversion dependence shows that a turnover number (TON) of 16 can be reached at 423 K under 20 MPa, which is among the highest reported so far in the absence of water traps. Moreover, as the catalytic activity is retained after recycling, even higher values can be obtained on a cumulative basis. A further TON increase is observed with the reaction temperature. Interestingly, the tin-based SBA-15 mesoporous material exhibits lower TONs if the TMCS pretreatment is left out.

The coprecipitation method allows catalysts with a metal-metal or a metal-support interaction to be obtained, which enhances the catalytic performance for both the conversion of glycerol and the selectivity to 1,2-propanediol. Analogous reactions carried out with catalysts prepared by using impregnation are less efficient. A study of the solvent and temperature effect is also presented. The obtained results allow the hydrogenolysis mechanism to be inferred; this involves both the direct replacement of the carbon-bonded OH group by an incoming hydrogen or the formation of hydroxyacetone as an intermediate, which subsequently undergoes a hydrogenation process to give 1,2-propanediol.

Traditionally, conjugated vegetable oils are added to paints, varnishes, and inks to improve their drying properties, while recently there is an increased interest in their use in the production of bioplastics. Besides the industrial applications, also food manufactures are interested in conjugated vegetable oils due to their various positive health effects. While the isomer type is less important for their industrial purposes, the beneficial health effects are mainly associated with the c9,t11, t10,c12 and t9,t11 CLA isomers. The production of CLA-enriched oils as additives in functional foods thus requires a high CLA isomer selectivity. Currently, CLAs are produced by conjugation of oils high in linoleic acid, for example soybean and safflower oil, using homogeneous bases. Although high CLA productivities and very high isomer selectivities are obtained, this process faces many ecological drawbacks. Moreover, CLA-enriched oils can not be produced directly with the homogeneous bases. Literature reports describe many catalytic processes to conjugate linoleic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid: biocatalysts, for example enzymes and cells; metal catalysts, for example homogeneous metal complexes and heterogeneous catalysts; and photocatalysts. This Review discusses state-of-the-art catalytic processes in comparison with some new catalytic production routes. For each category of catalytic process, the CLA productivities and the CLA isomer selectivity are compared. Heterogeneous catalysis seems the most attractive approach for CLA production due to its easy recovery process, provided that the competing hydrogenation reaction is limited and the CLA production rate competes with the current homogeneous base catalysis. The most important criteria to obtain high CLA productivity and isomer selectivity are (1) absence of a hydrogen donor, (2) absence of catalyst acidity, (3) high metal dispersion, and (4) highly accessible pore architecture.","5093":"","5094":"Industrial grade soybean oil (SBO) and thiols were reacted to generate thiol-functionalized oligomers via a thermal, free radical initiated thiol-ene reaction between the SBO double bond moieties and the thiol functional groups.

High thiol functionality and concentration, high thermal free radical catalyst concentration, long reaction time, and the use of a nitrogen reaction atmosphere were found to favor fast consumption of the SBO, and produced high molecular weight products. The thiol conversion during the reaction was inversely affected by a high thiol concentration, but was favored by a long reaction time and an air reaction atmosphere. These experimental observations were explained by the initial low affinity of the SBO and thiol, and the improved affinity between the generated soy-thiol oligomers and unreacted SBO during the reaction.

Photocatalytic oxidation of water to O(2) and reduction of IO(3)(-) to I(-) proceeded with good selectivity over the Pt-WO(3) photocatalyst, even in the presence of a considerable amount of I(-) anions in the solution. The key difference between the adsorption properties of IO(3)(-) and I(-) anions on WO(3) strongly suggested that the photoexcited electrons could react efficiently with IO(3)(-) adsorbed on WO(3), whereas the photogenerated holes selectively reacted with water molecules owing to the low adsorptivity of I(-) on WO(3). Photocatalytic H(2) evolution on Pt-TaON proceeded efficiently, accompanied by I(-) oxidation to IO(3)(-) due to a substantial amount of adsorption of I(-) anions on the surface, whereas H(2) evolution was significantly inhibited by the competitive adsorption of IO(3)(-), which consumes photoexcited electrons. It was also found that WO(3) photocatalysts loaded with platinum oxide (PtO) showed a much higher activity for O(2) evolution in the presence of the electron acceptor IO(3)(-), compared to those loaded with Pt metal.

Infrared results suggest that the increased adsorption half-time is a result of diffusion limitation, caused by accumulation of TEPA and PEG species on the surface of the sorbent particles. The degradation of TEPA\/SiO(2) is found to correlate with the accumulation of carboxylate\/carbamic species.

At the pressures and temperature found below 3 km of seawater, CO(2) becomes denser than seawater and so is likely to remain permanently sequestered in the sediment. Deepwater engineering, however, is expensive and seawater depths of greater than 3 km are often only reached far from shore. Here, we consider the less expensive alternative of injecting CO(2) into marine sediments at depths shallower than required for denser-than-seawater CO(2) storage. We compare the mobility of liquid CO(2) that has been injected into deep-sea reservoirs with the mobility of supercritical CO(2) that has been injected into geologically equivalent (i.e., identical porosity, permeability, and effective stress) reservoirs with terrestrial pressure and temperature conditions. We demonstrate that buoyant liquid CO(2) with a density of about 90 % that of seawater is sufficiently immobile that it can be considered trapped by gravity and capillarity. In contrast, supercritical CO(2) under typical terrestrial conditions is highly mobile and only trapped by the appropriate confining layer in either a structural or stratigraphic trap. As a result of its very high mobility under terrestrial conditions, CO(2) injected in an unconfined formation would spread beneath the confining layer to produce a large flat cylindrical-shaped plume of pure-phase CO(2). In contrast, the less mobile CO(2) in a typical deep-sea reservoir produces a spherical-shaped plume, resulting in a pure-phase-CO(2) footprint that is much smaller than the pure-phase-CO(2) footprint formed in the confined-terrestrial reservoir.","5255":"Lithium ion batteries (LIBs), which have the highest energy density among all currently available rechargeable batteries, have recently been considered for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and pure electric vehicles (PEV).

Bio-MOF-11 exhibits larger adsorption capacities compared to numerous zeolites, activated carbons, and MOFs, which is attributed to the presence of multiple Lewis basic sites and nano-sized channels. The results for the adsorption of CO(2)\/H(2) and CO(2)\/N(2) mixtures in bio-MOF-11 show that CO(2) is more dominantly adsorbed than H(2) and N(2).

Amino acids, such as sarcosine, have the same functionality as alkanol amines (e.g., monoethanolamine=MEA), but in contrast, they exhibit a better oxidative stability and resistance to degradation. In addition, they can be made nonvolatile by adding a salt functionality, which significantly reduces the liquid loss due to evaporation at elevated temperatures in the desorber.

This selectivity reaches values of 120 at a temperature difference between absorber and desorber of 35 degrees C, compared to a value of only 60 for MEA under the same conditions. Although CO(2) permeance values are somewhat lower than the values obtained for MEA, the results clearly show the potential of amino acid salt solutions as competitive absorption liquids for the energy efficient removal of CO(2).

However, ceria-based catalysts have also been developed for different applications in organic chemistry. The redox and acid-base properties of ceria, either alone or in the presence of transition metals, are important parameters that allow to activate complex organic molecules and to selectively orient their transformation. Pure ceria is used in several organic reactions, such as the dehydration of alcohols, the alkylation of aromatic compounds, ketone formation, and aldolization, and in redox reactions. Ceria-supported metal catalysts allow the hydrogenation of many unsaturated compounds. They can also be used for coupling or ring-opening reactions. Cerium atoms can be added as dopants to catalytic system or impregnated onto zeolites and mesoporous catalyst materials to improve their performances. This Review demonstrates that the exceptional surface (and sometimes bulk) properties of ceria make cerium-based catalysts very effective for a broad range of organic reactions.","5290":"One-dimensional (1D) hierarchical porous carbon fibers (HPCFs) have been prepared by controlled carbonization of alginic acid fibers and investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and electrochemical tests toward lithium storage. The as-obtained HPCFs consist of a 3D network of nanosized carbon particles with diameters less than 10 nm and exhibit a hierarchical porous architecture composed of both micropores and mesopores. Electrochemical measurements show that HPCFs exhibit excellent rate capability and capacity retention compared with commercial graphite when employed as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. At the discharge\/charge rate of 45 C, the reversible capacity of HPCFs is still as high as 80 mA h g(-1) even after 1500 cycles, which is about five times larger than that of commercial graphite anode. The much improved electrochemical performances could be attributed to the nanosized building blocks, the hierarchical porous structure, and the 1D morphology of HPCFs.","5291":"Beech lignin was oxidatively cleaved in ionic liquids to give phenols, unsaturated propylaromatics, and aromatic aldehydes. A multiparallel batch reactor system was used to screen different ionic liquids and metal catalysts. Mn(NO(3))(2) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [EMIM][CF(3)SO(3)] proved to be the most effective reaction system. A larger scale batch reaction with this system in a 300 mL autoclave (11 g lignin starting material) resulted in a maximum conversion of 66.3 % (24 h at 100 degrees C, 84x10(5) Pa air). By adjusting the reaction conditions and catalyst loading, the selectivity of the process could be shifted from syringaldehyde as the predominant product to 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ).

The engineered magnetic nanoparticle sorbents have inherently high active surface areas, allowing for increased binding capacities. To demonstrate the performance of the nanoparticle sorbents, river water was spiked with specific metals and exposed to low concentrations of the functionalized nanoparticles. In almost all cases, the nanoparticles were found to be superior to commercially available sorbent materials as well as the unfunctionalized iron oxide nanoparticles.","5295":"","5296":"Production of propanols from glycerol, which are known as biopropanols, requires catalysts for the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-propanediol, which has been easily derived from glycerol. It is found that the Rh\/SiO(2) catalysts modified with ReO(x) species exhibited high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-propanediol to propanols with low selectivity to degradation products and high stability. The optimized Rh--ReO(x)\/SiO(2) (Re\/Rh=0.5) catalyst gave high yields of 1-propanol (66 %) and propanols (1-propanol +2-propanol) (85 %) in the hydrogenolysis of 1,2-propanediol. In addition, the catalyst was applicable to the one-pot conversion of glycerol to propanols. The structure of Rh metal particles with attached ReO(x) clusters is suggested from the catalyst characterization.

Under the same conditions, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran is formed from pentose. The reaction employs a soluble rhodium catalyst, dihydrogen, and HI\/HCl+NaI.

Pure anatase TiO(2) and the CNT-TiO(2) composite are tested in the photocatalytic degradation of four para-substituted phenols: 4-chlorophenol, 4-aminophenol, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-nitrophenol. The effect of several operational parameters on the photoefficiency of the composite catalyst is studied by using 4-chlorophenol as model compound, namely catalyst loading, pH of the medium, hydrogen peroxide concentration, substrate concentration. A relationship between the Hammett constant of each para-substituted phenolic compound and its degradability by the photocatalysts is found. The effect of the carbon phase in the catalyst is ascribed to its photosensitizer action. A clear beneficial effect is observed for the degradation of 4-aminophenol and 4-chlorophenol.

The Ullmann reaction, in water as medium, is used to investigate the catalytic performance of Pd\/H-PMO(Ph). The results show that the Pd\/H-PMO(Ph) catalyst has excellent catalytic activity and selectivity, which can be attributed to synergetic effects derived from the highly dispersed catalytic species and the hydrophobic microenvironments. Furthermore, the catalyst could be conveniently recovered and recycled five times without significant loss of activity and selectivity.","5303":"","5304":"Because of their relatively high efficiency, high photostability, abundance, low cost, and nontoxic qualities, titania-based photocatalysts are still the most extensively studied materials for the photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water. The effects of the chemical and physical properties of titania, including crystal phase, crystallinity, particle size, and surface area, on its photoactivity towards hydrogen generation have been identified by various investigations. The high overpotential for hydrogen generation, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, rapid reverse reaction of molecular hydrogen and oxygen, and inability to absorb visible light are considered the most important factors that restrict the photoactivity of titania, and strategies to overcome these barriers have been developed. These issues and strategies are carefully reviewed and summarized in this Minireview.

The conversion of glycerol to hydrogen-rich mixtures presents an attractive route towards sustainable biodiesel production. Here we explored the use of Pt\/Al(2)O(3)-based catalysts for the catalytic steam reforming of glycerol, evidencing the influence of La(2)O(3) and CeO(2) doping on the catalyst activity and selectivity. The addition of the latter metal oxides to a Pt\/Al(2)O(3) catalyst is found to significantly improve the glycerol steam reforming, with high H(2) and CO(2) selectivities. A good catalytic stability is achieved for the Pt\/La(2)O(3)\/Al(2)O(3) system working at 350 degrees C, while the Pt\/CeO(2)\/Al(2)O(3) catalyst sharply deactivates after 20 h under similar conditions. Studies carried out on fresh and exhausted catalysts reveal that both systems maintain high surface areas and high Pt dispersions. Therefore, the observed catalyst deactivation can be attributed to coke deposition on the active sites throughout the catalytic process and only marginally to Pt nanoparticle sintering. This work suggests that an appropriate support composition is mandatory for preparing high-performance Pt-based catalysts for the sustainable conversion of glycerol into syngas.","5306":"","5307":"","5308":"The requirement that chemical processes are sustainable, reflected in waste reduction and the use of safe reagents and reaction conditions, is becoming even more stringent as a result of pressure by society and governments to preserve the environment and protect human health.

Up to 20,000 equivalents of lactide were polymerized (metal catalyst loading of 50-100 ppm) in a controlled fashion in the presence of 10-100 equivalents of a double-headed transfer agent to give as many end-functionalized poly(lactide) macromolecules that can be used eventually as macroinitiators for the controlled nitroxide-mediated polymerization of styrene. The specific use of the sterically shielded complex [BDI-iPr]Zn-N(SiMe(3))(2) ([BDI-iPr]=bis(diketiminate) ligand) allowed the efficient, catalytic, and controlled production of poly(lactide)-block-poly(styrene) materials in a one-pot, solvent-free sequential procedure, with nearly 100% atom-efficiency.","5312":"","5313":"Solution-processed small-molecule bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells are fabricated by using [6,6]-phenyl-C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron acceptor and triisopropylsilylethynyl anthracene (TIPSAnt) derivatives substituted with naphthalene (TIPSAntNa) and bithiophene (TIPSAntBT) as electron donors. In contrast to TIPS-pentacene, the TIPSAnt derivatives are not susceptible to Diels-Alder reactions with PCBM when processed in solution, as confirmed by UV\/Vis measurements. Photoluminescence quenching measurements show exciton diffusion lengths of 5 and 3 nm for TIPSAntBT and TIPSAntNa, respectively. Blending TIPSAntBT and TIPSAntNa with PCBM (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 weight ratios) produces films that possess adequate hole and electron mobilities. The morphological changes that result from varying the blending ratio range from obvious phase-segregated crystalline domains at a 1:1 ratio to homogeneous, nearly amorphous phases at a 1:4 ratio.

In the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) with propene for exhaust gas purification, the PtNPs@ZnO paper demonstrates a high catalytic performance at a low reaction temperature, with one-third the dosage of precious platinum compared to conventional platinum-loaded honeycomb catalysts. These results imply that the combination of easily synthesized PtNPs and a unique fiber-network microstructure can provide excellent performances, promoting the effective transport of heat and reactants to the active sites of the platinum nanocatalysts.

Atmospheric-pressure glow-discharge plasma (APGDP) is an alternative and ecofriendly method to obtain similar or better results with polymeric materials, compared to wet-chemical treatments. The hydrophilic behavior of PET samples is investigated after a roll-to-roll APGDP treatment by varying the plasma gas mixture, gas fluxes, and electrode temperatures.

Atomic force microscopy images coupled with Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy measurements further allow us to assess the quality, number of layers, and surface density of the reaction center films. Based on these measurements, we calculate that the theoretical photoelectronic current density available for an ideal monolayer of core complexes is 43 microA cm(-2) at a photon flux density of 2000 micromol quanta m(-2) s(-1) between 365 and 750 nm. While this current density is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the best organic photovoltaic cells (for an equivalent area), it provides an indication for future improvement strategies.

The morphology of the synthesized silica powders was found to depend on the size and the conformation of the biosurfactant molecules or aggregates in solution. The use of waste-derived biosurfactants as templating agents reduces the fabrication costs and the environmental impact of mesoporous materials.

Strongly dispersed iron particles with small sizes were produced on a planar surface of soaked fibrous wollastonite by a reduction process. These particles then catalyzed the decomposition of ethylene, leading to the synchronous growth of CNTs to form leaf- and brush-like wollastonite\/CNT hybrids. The as-obtained hybrids could be further transformed into porous SiO(2)\/CNT hybrids by reaction with hydrochloric acid. Further treatment with hydrofluoric acid resulted in aligned CNT arrays, with purities as high as 98.7 %.

Numerous works reviewed herein have shown higher performances for such electrodes, but mostly give diverse values that show no converging tendency towards future development. The lack of knowledge about interface processes and defect dynamics of electrodes, as well as the missing cooperation between material scientists, electrochemists, and battery engineers, are reasons for the currently widespread trial-and-error strategy of experiments.

Tapping into this feedstock for the production of biofuels and chemicals requires--as the first-step--its depolymerization or its hydrolysis into intermediates that are more susceptible to chemical and\/or biological transformations. We have shown earlier that solid acids selectively catalyze the depolymerization of cellulose solubilized in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) at 100 degrees C. Here, we address the factors responsible for the control of this reaction. Both cellulose and solid acid catalysts have distinct and important roles in the process. Describing the depolymerization of cellulose by the equivalent number of scissions occurring in the cellulosic chains allows a direct correlation between the product yields and the extent of the polymer breakdown. The effect of the acid strength on the depolymerization of cellulose is discussed in detail. Practical aspects of the reaction, concerning the homogeneous nature of the catalysis in spite of the use of a solid acid catalyst, are thoroughly addressed.

This Review does not focus on the most recent or efficient dyes, but rather on how model dyes prepared from aromatic hydrocarbons have been used, over time, in key fundamental studies of heterogeneous charge transfer. In particular, we describe model chromophores prepared from anthracene, pyrene, perylene, and azulene. As the level of complexity of the model dye-bridge-anchor group compounds has increased, the understanding of some aspects of very complex charge transfer events has improved.

Carbon and carbon nitride combine environmental acceptability with inexhaustible resources and allow a favorable management of energy with good thermal conductivity. Owing to lower reaction temperatures and increased selectivity, these catalysts could be candidates for green chemistry with low emission and an efficient use of the chemical feedstock.

However, some blends that showed such large clusters yielded at the same time high power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices, approaching 3.7 %. This is in sharp contrast with previously studied systems, in which a substantial phase separation always resulted in a poor photovoltaic performance. We assume that the attachment of thienyl or furyl groups to the fullerene cage results in a certain ordering of the designed fullerene derivatives I-IX with P3HT in photoactive blends.

Our principle sources of energy are carbon-based (coal, oil, and gas) and many of our consumer goods are derived from organic (i.e., carbon-based) chemicals (including plastics, fabrics and materials, personal care and cleaning products, dyes, and coatings). Even our large-volume inorganic-chemicals-based industries, including fertilizers and construction materials, rely on the consumption of carbon, notably in the form of large amounts of energy. The environmental problems which we now face and of which we are becoming increasingly aware result from a human-induced disturbance in the natural carbon cycle of the Earth caused by transferring large quantities of terrestrial carbon (coal, oil, and gas) to the atmosphere, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is by no means the only element whose natural cycle we have disturbed: we are transferring significant quantities of elements including phosphorus, sulfur, copper, and platinum from natural sinks or ores built up over millions of years to unnatural fates in the form of what we refer to as waste or pollution. However, our complete dependence on the carbon cycle means that its disturbance deserves special attention, as is now manifest in indicators such as climate change and escalating public concern over global warming. As with all disturbances in materials balances, we can seek to alleviate the problem by (1) dematerialization: a reduction in consumption; (2) rematerialization: a change in what we consume; or (3) transmaterialization: changing our attitude towards resources and waste. The \"low-carbon\" mantra that is popularly cited by organizations ranging from nongovernmental organizations to multinational companies and from local authorities to national governments is based on a combination of (1) and (2) (reducing carbon consumption though greater efficiency and lower per capita consumption, and replacing fossil energy sources with sources such as wind, wave, and solar, respectively). \"Low carbon\" is of inherently less value to the chemical and plastics industries at least in terms of raw materials although a version of (2), the use of biomass, does apply, especially if we use carbon sources that are renewable on a human timescale. There is however, another renewable, natural source of carbon that is widely available and for which greater utilization would help restore material balance and the natural cycle for carbon in terms of resource and waste. CO(2), perhaps the most widely discussed and feared chemical in modern society, is as fundamental to our survival as water, and like water we need to better understand the human as well as natural production and consumption of CO(2) so that we can attempt to get these into a sustainable balance. Current utilization of this valuable resource by the chemical industry is only 90 megatonne per year, compared to the 26.3 gigatonne CO(2) generated annually by combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation, as such significant opportunities exist for increased utilization of CO(2) generated from industrial processes.

It is believed that the introduction of an ester function into the cation of the ionic liquids greatly increases their biodegradability. The density of three such ionic liquids is measured as a function of temperature, and the solubility of four gases-carbon dioxide, ethane, methane, and hydrogen-is determined between 303 K and 343 K and at pressures close to atmospheric level. Carbon dioxide is the most soluble gas, followed by ethane and methane; the mole fraction solubilities vary from 1.8 x 10(-3) to 3.7 x 10(-2). These solubilities are of the same order of magnitude as those determined for alkylimidazolium-based ionic liquids. The chemical modification of the alkyl side chain does not result in a significant change of the solvation properties of the ionic liquid. All of the solubilities decrease with increasing temperature, corresponding to an exothermal solvation process.

Knowledge-based systematic approaches are mandatory to arrive at scalable and sustainable solutions. Chemistry for energy, \"ENERCHEM\" contributes in many ways already today to the use of fossil energy carriers. Optimization of these processes exemplified by catalysis for fuels and chemicals production or by solid-state lightning can contribute in the near future substantially to the dual challenge of energy use and climate protection being in fact two sides of the same challenge. The paper focuses on the even greater role that ENERCHEM will have to play in the era of renewable energy systems where the storage of solar energy in chemical carries and batteries is a key requirement. A multidisciplinary and diversified approach is suggested to arrive at a stable and sustainable system of energy conversion processes. The timescales for transformation of the present energy scenario will be decades and the resources will be of global economic dimensions.

In the presence of only 0.1-0.5 mol % catalyst, products in moderate to good yields were obtained. The aryl bromide reactants were able to tolerate a wide range of functionalities, such as acetyl, propionyl, formyl, ester, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, or fluoro groups.

Four different types of peroxyl radicals are generated; the verbenyl peroxyl radical being the most abundant one. The peroxyl radicals propagate a long radical chain, implying that chain termination does not play an important role in the production of the products. Two distinct types of propagation steps are active in parallel: the abstraction of allylic H atoms and the addition to the unsaturated C=C bond. The efficiency for both pathways appears to depend on the structure of the peroxyl radical. The latter step yields the corresponding epoxide product, as well as alkoxyl radicals. Under the investigated reaction conditions the alkoxyl radicals seem to produce both the alcohol and ketone products, the ketone presumably being formed upon the abstraction of the weakly bonded alphaH atom by O2. This mechanism explains the predominantly primary nature of all quantified products. At higher conversion, co-oxidation of the hydroperoxide products constitutes an additional, albeit small, source of alcohol and ketone products.","5354":"","5355":"Currently, a shift towards chemical products derived from renewable, biological feedstocks is observed more and more.

We illustrate how this simple concept can be used to evaluate different resource types and processes.

In addition, peculiar properties have been observed for some metal\/metal oxide particles of critical sizes. However, thermal stability of these nanostructures is limited by their size; smaller the particle size, the lower the thermal stability. The ability to fabricate and control the structure of nanoparticles allows to influence the resulting properties and, ultimately, to design stable catalysts with the desired characteristics. Tuning particle sizes provides the possibility to modulate the catalytic activity. Unique and unexpected properties have been observed by confining\/embedding metal nanoparticles in inorganic channels or cavities, which indeed offers new opportunities for the design of advanced catalytic systems. Innovation in catalyst design is a powerful tool in realizing the goals of more green, efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

Nitrile hydrolysis yields amides and acids used in various applications. The conventional nitrile hydrolysis process relies on stoichiometric amounts of mineral acid or base which inherently deliver great amounts of waste brine. Improving this process towards green chemistry would require reaction conditions which can provide technically significant results without the use of catalysts. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of valeronitrile in pure supercritical water was investigated.

In multistage extractions the sulfur content could be lowered to less than 10 ppm within seven stages. Regeneration of the ionic liquid was achieved by distillation or re-extraction procedures. Supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) materials, obtained by dispersing the ionic liquid as a thin film on highly porous silica, exhibited a significantly higher extraction performance owing to their larger surface areas, reducing the sulfur content to less than 100 ppm in one stage. Multistage extraction with these SILP materials reduced the sulfur level to 50 ppm in the second stage.

In this study, PEG radicals assumed to result from thermal oxidative degradation are successfully applied, in combination with compressed CO(2), to initiate a range of free-radical reactions, such as selective formylation of primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols, oxidation of benzylic alcohols, benzylic C==C bond cleavage, and benzylic sp(3) C--H oxidation, demonstrating enormous synthetic potential in a cost-efficient, practically useful, and environmentally friendly manner; not requiring any catalyst or additional free-radical initiator. We find that both PEG and molecular oxygen are prerequisites in order to perform these reactions smoothly. Given that dense CO(2) is immune to free-radical chemistry; it is an ideal solvent for such reactions. As a result, compressed CO(2) allows reactions initiated by PEG radicals to be tuned by subtly adjusting reaction parameters such as the CO(2) pressure, thereby enhancing the product selectivity. By attaining a high selectivity towards the desired products this methodology is practical for organic syntheses.","5418":"We report a new type of dendritic terthiophene attached to a 2,2'-bipyridine ligand for ruthenium-based dye-sensitized solar cells. As a result of the incorporation of this electron-rich terthiophene donor unit into the heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizer [Ru(dcbpy)(3Tbpy)(NCS)(2)] (3T), the lowest-energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition is red-shifted and the molar extinction coefficient is increased compared to the analogous standard Z907Na sensitizer. A preliminary investigation of the 3T dye in combination with an iodine\/iodide-based electrolyte shows an interesting photovoltaic performance, with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 7.4 % measured under air mass 1.5 global sunlight irradiation.

It will be almost impossible to prevent it from growing by at least another 400 Gt in the present century. Theoretically, there exists only one single possibility to effect a decline of the resultant increase in atmospheric CO(2) concentration: the excess carbon has to be removed from the carbon cycle by transferring it into an environment in which it is safe from oxidation, just as is the case for the deposits of fossil fuels. Only natural photosynthesis offers the possibility of efficiently fixing carbon dioxide from the air and removing it from the carbon cycle through geostorage of the resulting biomass. The present paper shows, in the context of an initial feasibility study, that the use of forests and the geostorage of wood in an environment corresponding to lignite deposits represents the ecologically most sensible and economical variant of removal of carbon from the carbon cycle and, thereby, reclamation of the atmosphere.","5422":null,"5423":null,"5424":"","5425":"This Review documents some examples of recent innovations in the field of catalytic selective oxidation from an industrial point of view.

The Sun is a source of silent and precious energy that is distributed fairly all over the Earth daily. However, its tremendous potential as a clean, safe, and economical energy source cannot be exploited unless the energy is accumulated or converted into more useful forms. The conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via the water-splitting process, assisted by photo-semiconductor catalysts, is one of the most promising technologies for the future because large quantities of hydrogen can potentially be generated in a clean and sustainable manner. This Minireview provides an overview of the principles, approaches, and research progress on solar hydrogen production via the water-splitting reaction on photo-semiconductor catalysts. It presents a survey of the advances made over the last decades in the development of catalysts for photochemical water splitting under visible-light irradiation. The Minireview also analyzes the energy requirements and main factors that determine the activity of photocatalysts in the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight. Remarkable progress has been made since the pioneering work by Fujishima and Honda in 1972, but he development of photocatalysts with improved efficiencies for hydrogen production from water using solar energy still faces major challenges. Research strategies and approaches adopted in the search for active and efficient photocatalysts, for example through new materials and synthesis methods, are presented and analyzed.","5427":"","5428":"","5429":"The ONN-tridentate unsymmetrical pincer-type (S)-1-((6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-methyl-N-(3-(triethoxysilyl)pro-pyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide ligand has been synthesized by an easy method, in high purity and good yield. Its respective palladium(II) and gold(III) complexes have been prepared as air-stable solids. After deprotonation of the -OH group the coordination of the metal ion is completely stereospecific and gives rise to only one diastereoisomer. The complexes, immobilized onto ordered mesoporous silica (MCM-41), are shown to be very active catalysts in the hydrogenation of prochiral olefins (98% ee was achieved with the heterogenized chiral Au(MCM-41) complex), hydrosilylation, and Suzuki and Heck C-C coupling reactions, under mild conditions. The reactions were studied with the soluble catalysts as well as their heterogenized counterparts.

It encompasses social, environmental, and economical aspects. Herein, sustainable development is translated into four basic dimensions, called \"sustainability stresses\": resources, wastes, hazards, and costs. These sustainability stresses are discussed in some detail and their usefulness is illustrated by applying them to three manufacturing processes applied commercially by Shell, namely Shell's OMEGA, SMPO, and \"low monol\" technologies for producing ethene diol, styrene\/propene oxide, and polyether polyols, respectively.

They benefit from low costs, operational simplicity, and high reactivity and thus constitute the \"green\" sister of the palladium and nickel establishment. This timely Review traces back major achievements, discusses their mechanistic background, and highlights numerous applications to molecular synthesis.Iron-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions have matured to an indispensable class of reactions in organic synthesis. The advent of economically and ecologically attractive iron catalysts in the past years has stepped up the competition with the established palladium and nickel catalyst systems that have dominated the field for more than 30 years, but suffer from high costs, toxicity, and sometimes low reactivity. Iron-catalyzed protocols do not merely benefit from economic advantages but entertain a rich manifold of reactivity patterns and tolerate various functional groups. The past years have witnessed a rapid development with ever-more-efficient protocols for the cross-coupling between alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, and acyl moieties becoming available to organic chemists. This Review intends to shed light onto the versatility that iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions offer, summarize major achievements, and clear the way for further use of such superior methodologies in the synthesis of fine chemicals, bioactive molecules, and materials.","5439":"Aerosols constitute a climate and health risk via both direct and indirect effects.

These catalysts are studied in Suzuki biaryl couplings and in Heck reactions to establish the influence of metal loading and innocent surface modifications (trimethylsilylation). The Suzuki reaction proceeded efficiently with model and practically relevant substrates; the catalyst performance increasing with an increasing degree of metalation (decreasing N\/Pd ratio). Catalyst poisoning tests revealed that the reaction takes place in the liquid phase with the catalyst serving as a reservoir of active metal species and also as a stabilizing support once the reaction is performed. In the Heck reactions, on the other hand, the catalyst performance strongly changed with the reaction temperature and with the N\/Pd ratio. The material with the lowest metal loading (0.01 mmol palladium per gram of material, N\/Pd ratio ca. 100:1) proved particularly attractive in the Heck coupling, being highly active at elevated temperatures, recyclable, and capable of acting as a bifunctional catalyst (i.e., functioning without any external base.","5443":"Cellular electron transfer under diverse anaerobic conditions is a primary topic of research conducted by the Newman group.

After optimization of the reaction conditions this system was applied to different secondary amines and anilines as well as a number of vicinal diols. With the exception of ethylene glycol, monoamination of the vicinal diols occurred selectively and the corresponding amino alcohols were obtained in good yields, producing water as the only side product.","5448":"Catscade reactions: Heterogeneous catalysis can enable sustainability by carrying out multistep reactions in one step. It is shown that single- and multisite solid catalysts can be designed to carry out cascade reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals.","5449":"Furfural, a potential coproduct of levulinic acid, can be converted into levulinic acid via hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol and subsequent ethanolysis to ethyl levulinate. The ethanolysis reaction is known to proceed in the presence of H(2)SO(4). We show here that several strongly acidic resins are comparably effective catalysts for this reaction. Optimal performance is achieved by balancing the number of acid sites with their accessibility in the resin. Acidic zeolites such as H-ZSM-5 also catalyze this reaction, although with a lower activity and a higher co-production of diethyl ether.","5450":"Dilute aqueous solutions of lactic acid (30 %wt.) can be catalytically processed at 573 K and 57 bar over a low-metal-content Pt(0.1 %)\/Nb(2)O(5) catalyst in a spontaneously separating organic phase rich in valuable products such as C(4)-C(7) ketones. An increase in the lactic acid concentration to 60 wt % allows conversion of approximately 50 % of the carbon feed in this organic layer, while maintaining good stability of the catalyst. Experiments at low conversion showed that lactic acid reacts first over Pt(0.1 %)\/Nb(2)O(5) to produce acetaldehyde and propanoic acid (along with CO and CO(2) in the gas phase). These compounds (less oxygenated than lactic acid but still reactive) are the key intermediates in the overall process, and they react differently depending on the nature of the catalyst support. In particular, reaction kinetics studies with propanoic acid as feed showed that Pt(0.1 %)\/Nb(2)O(5) favored the formation of pentanones by ketonization reactions, whereas a monofunctional Pt(0.1 %)\/carbon catalyst produced ethane and CO(x) by decomposition reactions. In the same manner, acetaldehyde was preferentially hydrogenated to ethanol over Pt(0.1 %)\/carbon, whereas the presence of niobia allowed this intermediate to react (by successive aldol condensations) to form C(4)-C(7) condensation products stored in the organic phase. Finally, reaction pathways are proposed to explain the catalytic processing of lactic acid over bifunctional Pt(0.1 %)\/Nb(2)O(5). In this scheme, metal sites catalyze hydrogenation reactions and niobia promotes C--C coupling processes (ketonization and aldol condensation), in contrast to C--C cleavage reactions which take place preferentially over Pt(0.1 %)\/carbon and lead to loss of carbon in the gas effluent as CO, CO(2), and methane.","5451":"The predicted shortage of fossil fuels and related environmental concerns have recently attracted significant attention to scientific and technological issues concerning the conversion of biomass into fuels. First-generation biodiesel, obtained from vegetable oils and animal fats by transesterification, relies on commercial technology and rich scientific background, though continuous progress in this field offers opportunities for improvement. This review focuses on new catalytic systems for the transesterification of oils to the corresponding ethyl\/methyl esters of fatty acids. It also addresses some innovative\/emerging technologies for the production of biodiesel, such as the catalytic hydrocracking of vegetable oils to hydrocarbons.

The products of these acylation reactions are important compounds for the pharmaceutical industry, fragrance and flavor materials, dyes, polymers, agrochemicals, and other applications.","5454":"The effect of halide and acid addition on the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide is studied for magnesium oxide- and carbon-supported bimetallic gold-palladium catalysts. The addition of acids decreases the hydrogenation\/decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, and the effect is particularly pronounced for the magnesium oxide-supported catalysts whilst for carbon-supported catalysts the pH requires close control to optimize hydrogen peroxide synthesis. The addition of bromide leads to a marked decrease in the hydrogenation\/decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with either catalyst. These effects are discussed in terms of the structure of the gold-palladium alloy nanoparticles and the isoelectric point of the support. We conclude that with the highly active carbon-supported gold-palladium catalysts these additives are not required and that therefore this system presents the potential for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide to be operated using green process technology.","5455":"Three different pincer ligand systems are synthesized via nucleophilic substitution reactions of polyaromatic benzyl bromides as support molecules and phenol derivatives as ligand precursors. Retention tests using a polymeric nanofiltration membrane show moderate to good retention in THF and CH(2)Cl(2). Concentration-dependent NMR spectroscopy gives no indication for the formation of aggregates in solution. The three ligand systems are active in both the allylic alkylation and allylic amination reactions and show high selectivity towards the linear trans products. An investigation of the kinetic parameters of the allylic amination reaction show that the reaction of cinnamyl acetate with morpholine is of zero order in cinnamyl acetate and of first order in morpholine. The order in catalyst is found to be one, and the rate constant k' is determined for a reaction under standard conditions. Moreover, one of the tri(pincer)-palladium complexes is used as soluble, molecular-weight-enlarged homogeneous catalyst in continuous allylic alkylation and amination reactions. The conversion of the allylic alkylation reaches a maximum of 30 %, while a maximum conversion of 80 % is reached in the allylic amination reaction. No palladium black was formed.","5456":"Efficient photocatalytic decomposition of chemical warfare agents is a process that may find application in emergency situations or for the controlled destruction of chemical warfare stockpiles. A series of heterogeneous photocatalysts comprising TiO2-activated carbon or N-TiO2-activated carbon composites exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity to effect the complete decomposition of yperite, soman, and VX in high concentrations. The remarkable photocatalytic activity arises from the synergism between adsorption on active carbon and photoactivity by titania. Nitridation makes the composite also active under visible-light irradiation.","5457":"The after-pulse time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) decays observed in P3HT:PCBM blends display a dependence on time close to t(-beta), independent of excitation intensity, in the 10 ns-1 micros range. This is explained in terms of the relaxation of carriers in a Gaussian density of states (DOS). The model is based on a demarcation level that moves with time by thermal release and retrapping of initially trapped carriers. The model shows that when the disorder is large the after-pulse decay of the type t(-beta) is obtained, while at low disorder and large temperature the carrier distribution becomes independent of time. In the measurements different beta values were observed depending on the solvent used for spin-coating: 0.4-0.6 for chlorobenzene and 0.3-0.4 for toluene. The model was applied to extract the shape of the DOS from the TRMC decays, giving a dispersion parameter of about 120 meV for blends with high P3HT content.","5458":"Two new organic dyes have been synthesized and used as efficient light-harvesting materials in molecular photovoltaic devices. These dyes are based on conjugated thienylvinylene units, with FL-4 consisting of a four-unit thienylvinylene oligomer and its homologue FL-7 which additionally incorporates the electron-donating triphenylamine unit (TPA) into its structure. Upon light excitation both dyes show efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band and slow back electron transfer to the oxidized dye. In fact, for FL-7, the back electron transfer dynamics are slower owing to efficient hole transfer to the TPA moiety situated further from the semiconductor surface. However, the electron recombination kinetics with the oxidized electrolyte for both FL-4 and FL-7 in dye-sensitized solar cells are faster than for devices made using the ruthenium dye N719. We believe that this is a serious limiting factor for devices based on oligothiophenes which, despite showing higher molecular extinction coefficients in the vis-NIR region of the solar spectrum, still cannot challenge the light-to-energy conversion efficiency of N719 or other ruthenium polypyridyl complexes.","5459":"Two organic ligands based on bis-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole (Hbpp) functionalized with a para-methylenebenzoic acid (Hbpp-R(a)) or its ester derivative (Hbpp-R(e)) were prepared and characterized.

The complexes were characterized in solution by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, UV\/Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The [Ru(II)2(mu-Cl)(bpp-R(e))(trpy)2](PF6)(2) complex was further characterized in the solid state by X-ray diffraction. The complexes containing the free carboxylic acid ligand were anchored onto rutile TiO2 and treated with 0.1 M triflic acid solution to generate the homologous water-oxidation catalysts TiO(2)-[Ru(II) (2)(H2O)(2)(bpp-R(a))(trpy)2]2+. This new hybrid material catalytically oxidizes water to molecular oxygen in a heterogeneous manner using Ce(IV) as chemical oxidant. The generation of molecular oxygen is accompanied by the formation of carbon dioxide as well as some leaching of the Ru catalyst.","5460":"To provide truly transparent solar cells for power window applications, both semiconductor and electrode materials have to have a very low absorption over as much of the visible spectrum as possible.

Solvent-free stoichiometric melting or kneading ball-milling reactions of aldehydes or ketones with carbonyl reagents yields arylhydrazones and oximes in quantitative yield. The carbonyl compounds can be quantitatively recovered from the imino derivatives by using gaseous NO(2).An effective methodology of kneading with a ball mill under temperature control was used for the stoichiometric quantitative preparation of synthetically versatile oximes and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones from low-melting aldehydes and ketones. Also, a large number of phenylhydrazones are obtained by safe stoichiometric quantitative melt reactions. Advantages of this technique are short reaction times, eco-friendliness, and ease of handling under solvent-free conditions, as no waste-producing purifying workup is necessary. The different reactivities of aldehydes and ketones allow for easy separation of mixtures containing aldehydes and ketones. Furthermore, a new effective, gas-solid deprotection methodology for oximes was developed, using nitrogen dioxide as the reagent under solvent-free conditions to recover the aldehydes or ketones. The corresponding aldehydes were obtained free of overoxidized acids in quantitative yields.","5462":"Amines to an end: The basic diamine-functionalized ionic liquid 1,3-di(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate was prepared and used in the hydrogenation of CO(2) to formic acid.

Nearly 98 % of the moisture was removed from the lubricating oil under ambient conditions, resulting in a significant improvement in the lubricating service lifetime. Moreover, both the lubricant and the microporous sorbents can be recovered and reused.The selective capture of water from lubricants using nanosized microporous aluminophosphate and aluminosilicate materials was studied with an aim to increase the lifetime of the lubricating mineral oil. The amount of water present in oxidized lubricating oil before and after treatment with microporous materials was studied by FTIR spectroscopy and determined quantitatively using the Karl Fischer titration method. Nanosized aluminophosphate revealed a high selectivity for water without adsorbing other additives, in contrast to nanosized aluminosilicates which also adsorb polar oxidation products and ionic additives. About 98 % of the initial moisture could be removed from the lubricating oil under ambient conditions, resulting in a significant improvement in the lubricating service lifetime. Moreover, no by-products are formed during the process and both the lubricant and the sorbents can be recovered and reused, thus the method is environmentally friendly.","5464":"Ring ring ring: Ruthenium-catalyzed direct arylations of N-aryl 1,2,3-triazoles with chlorides as arylating reagents proceed efficiently with an in situ generated complex derived from phosphane PCy(3) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent.","5465":"A (super)critical transfer: The consecutive hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation of the lignin model compound dihydrobenzofuran was studied in supercritical methanolic solutions using porous metal oxide catalysts. These catalysts promote H(2) production from methanol followed by hydrogenolysis of the ether linkages and reduction of the aromatic rings, leading principally to a mixture of cyclohexanols.","5466":"Waste not, want not: The increase in waste polymer generation, which continues to exceed recycle, represents a critical environmental burden. However, plastic waste may be viewed as a potential resource and, with the correct treatment, can serve as hydrocarbon raw material or as fuel oil, as described in this Minireview.Effective waste management must address waste reduction, reuse, recovery, and recycle. The consumption of plastics continues to grow, and, while plastic recycle has seen a significant increase since the early 1990s, consumption still far exceeds recycle. However, waste plastic can be viewed as a potential resource and can serve, with the correct treatment, as hydrocarbon raw material or as fuel oil. This Minireview considers the role of catalysis in waste polymer reprocessing and provides a critical overview of the existing waste plastic treatment technologies. Thermal pyrolysis results in a random scissioning of the polymer chains, generating products with varying molecular weights. Catalytic degradation provides control over the product composition\/distribution and serves to lower significantly the degradation temperature. Incineration of waste PVC is very energy demanding and can result in the formation of toxic chloro emissions. The efficacy of a catalytic transformation of PVC is also discussed.","5467":"A sense of stability: The stability of carbon-supported platinum catalysts at high potentials is important for the commercialization of fuel cells for homes and cars.

These biosurfactants were used to solubilize a dye in water below and above their critical micellar concentration. The biosurfactant unimers appear to have higher dye-solubilizing power than the corresponding micelles.Humic acid like substances isolated from compost show potential as chemical auxiliaries. In the present study, three surfactant samples were obtained from green waste composted for 0-60 days to assess aging effects of the source on the properties of the products. The surface activity, dye solubility enhancement, and chemical nature of these substances were compared. No differences in performance were established among the samples. They lower water surface tension and enhance the dye solubility upon increasing their concentration. However, the ratio of soluble dye to added surfactant is higher in the premicellar than in the postmicellar concentration region. Structural investigations indicated the humic acid like substances to be amphiphiles with molecular weights in the range of 1-3 x 10(5) g mol(-1). The surfactant samples were also compared to sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, polyacrylic acid, and soil and water humic substances. The results encourage the application of compost as a source of low-cost biosurfactant.","5471":"Indium summer: The use of low-valent indium species in organic chemistry was, until quite recently, underdeveloped.

The results suggest that the cellulose ester plastic films are promising alternatives to petrochemical commodity plastics such as polyethylene.Cellulose-based plastic films were prepared by acylating cellulose in homogeneous media under microwave irradiation with fatty acyl chlorides containing either saturated or unsaturated chains of various lengths (C(12) to C(18)). The resultant cellulose esters were analysed by FTIR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy to confirm their structure and to determine their degree of substitution. Some of the cellulose fatty esters were then converted into polymer films by casting. The mechanical properties of these films were determined, including their elastic modulus, tensile strength and tensile strain level. The hydrophobicity of the polymer films was determined by contact angle measurement with water. The mechanical and hydrophobic properties of the plastic films were then compared to those of commodity plastics.","5477":"Veggie-based products: Vegetable-oil-based polymeric materials, prepared by free radical, cationic, and olefin metathesis polymerizations, range from soft rubbers to ductile or rigid plastics, and to high-performance biocomposites and nanocomposites.

Heterogeneous catalysts can provide new routes for the environmentally benign production of biodiesel. Particulate heterogeneous catalysts can be readily separated from products following reaction allowing the catalyst to be reused, generating less waste, and consuming less energy. Diesel engines are simple and powerful, and exhibit many advantages in energy efficiency and cost. Therefore, the production of higher fatty acid esters from plant materials has become of interest in recent years for the manufacture of biodiesel, a clean-burning alternative fuel. The industrial production of biodiesel mostly proceeds in the presence of \"soluble\" catalysts such as alkali hydroxides and liquid acids. A considerable amount of energy is required for the purification of products and catalyst separation, and furthermore these catalysts are not reusable. This process results in substantial energy wastage and the production of large amounts of chemical waste. Particulate heterogeneous catalysts can be readily separated from products following reaction, allowing the catalyst to be reused and consuming less energy. This Minireview describes the environmentally benign production of biodiesel using heterogeneous catalysts such as solid bases, acid catalysts, and immobilized enzymes.","5479":"Straight to the point: The direct 3- or 4-arylation of pyrrole derivatives through C--H bond activation proceeds in moderate to good yields using Pd(OAc)(2) as catalyst. In contrast to classical coupling procedures, the preparation of an organometallic derivative is not required and the major by-products are AcOH\/KBr instead of metallic salts.","5480":"Shine a light: A PtNiRu\/TiO(2) anode catalyst for direct ethanol fuel cells shows photocatalytic activity. The peak current density for ethanol oxidation under solar light illumination is 2-3 times greater than that in the absence of solar light. Ethanol is oxidized by light-generated holes, and the electrons are collected by the TiO(2) support to generate the oxidation current.Novel PtNiRu\/TiO(2) anode catalysts for direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) were prepared from PtNiRu nanoparticles (1:1:1 atomic ratios) and a nanoporous TiO(2) film by a sol-gel and electrodeposition method. The performances of the catalysts for ethanol oxidation were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate a remarkable enhancement of activity for ethanol oxidation under solar light illumination. Under solar light illumination, the generated oxidation peak current density is 24.6 mA cm(-2), which is about 2.5 times higher than that observed without solar light (9.9 mA cm(-2)). The high catalytic activity of the PtNiRu\/TiO(2) complex catalyst for the electrooxidation of ethanol may be attributed to the modified metal\/nanoporous TiO(2) film, and the enhanced electrooxidation of ethanol under solar light may be due to the photogeneration of holes in the modified nanoporous TiO(2) film.","5481":"No escape: The formation of cross-linked chloroperoxidase aggregates (CPO-CLEAs) in the pores of mesocellular foam materials results in active biocatalysts that are more resistant to leaching than the conventional catalyst prepared by physisorption of chloroperoxidase.

These first-generation materials contain large, dispersed clusters of polyoxometalates. Although the morphology of these films is not yet optimal, they already demonstrate practical proton conductivities and proton diffusion within the clusters appears to be very high.","5483":"Glycerol, a commodity by-product of the biodiesel industry, has value as a fuel feedstock and chemical intermediate. It is also a simple prototype of sugars and carbohydrates. Through catalytic partial oxidation (CPOx), glycerol can be converted into syngas without the addition of process heat. We explored the CPOx of glycerol using a nebulizer to mix droplets with air at room temperature for reactive flash volatilization. Introducing this mixture over a noble-metal catalyst oxidizes the glycerol at temperatures over 600 degrees C in 30-90 ms. Rhodium catalysts produce equilibrium selectivity to syngas, while platinum catalysts produce mainly autothermal non-equilibrium products. The addition of water to the glycerol increases the selectivity to H(2) by the water gas shift reaction and reduces non-equilibrium products. However, water also quenches the reaction, resulting in a maximum in H(2) production at a steam\/carbon ratio of 2:3 over a Rh-Ce catalyst. Glycerol without water produces a variety of chemicals over Pt, including methylglyoxal, hydroxyacetone, acetone, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and olefins.","5484":"","5485":"","5486":"A thirst for water: Organic-inorganic hybrid silica nanosieve membranes with narrow pore size distributions were developed for the separation of binary (bio)alcohol\/water mixtures, for example, to remove water from wet biofuels during production.

To control the properties of nanoparticles with particular respect to shape, size and dispersity is imperative, as these will determine the activity in the desired application. Supported metal nanoparticles are widely employed in catalysis. Recent advances in controlling the shape and size of nanoparticles have opened the possibility to optimise the particle geometry for enhanced catalytic activity, providing the optimum size and surface properties for specific applications. This Review describes the state of the art with respect to the preparation and use of supported metal nanoparticles in catalysis. The main groups of such nanoparticles (noble and transition metal nanoparticles) are highlighted and future prospects are discussed.","5489":"","5490":"Despite a rising output, in the last few decades the known reserves of fossil energy resources have steadily increased. Additionally, there are in all likelihood tremendous reserves of methane hydrate. In view of the climate change, new means must be explored for its use as an energy source. Starting with an assessment of various options for dealing with the carbon cycle and thermodynamic considerations of methane chemistry, a new approach for the use of methane as energy source is developed in this Concept. After thermal methane cracking, only the energy content of the hydrogen is used and the carbon is stored safely and retrievably in disused coal beds. Arguments for the viability of a carbon moratorium of this kind are discussed.","5491":"Benzylic alcohols are quantitatively oxidized by gaseous nitrogen dioxide to give pure aromatic aldehydes. The reaction gas mixtures are transformed to nitric acid, which renders the processes free of waste. The exothermic gas-liquid or gas-solid reactions profit from the solubility of nitrogen dioxide in the neat benzylic alcohols. The acid formed impedes further oxidation of the benzaldehydes. The neat isolated benzaldehydes and nitrogen dioxide quantitatively give the benzoic acids. Solid long-chain primary alcohols are directly and quantitatively oxidized with nitrogen dioxide gas to give the fatty acids in the solid state. The oxidations with ubiquitous nitrogen dioxide are extended to solid heterocyclic thioamides, which gives disulfides, and to diphenylamine, which gives tetraphenylhydrazine. These sustainable (green) specific oxidation procedures produce no dangerous residues from the oxidizing agent or from auxiliaries.","5492":"Ni-Zn and Ni-Zn-P alloys supported on Vulcan XC-72 are effective materials for the spontaneous deposition of palladium through redox transmetalation with Pd(IV) salts. The materials obtained, Pd-(Ni-Zn)\/C and Pd-(Ni-Zn-P)\/C, have been characterized by a variety of techniques. The analytical and spectroscopic data show that the surface of Pd-(Ni-Zn)\/C and Pd-(Ni-Zn-P)\/C contain very small, highly dispersed, and highly crystalline palladium clusters as well as single palladium sites, likely stabilized by interaction with oxygen atoms from Ni--O moieties. As a reference material, a nanostructured Pd\/C material was prepared by reduction of an aqueous solution of PdCl(2)\/HCl with ethylene glycol in the presence of Vulcan XC-72. In Pd\/C, the Pd particles are larger, less dispersed, and much less crystalline. Glassy carbon electrodes coated with the Pd-(Ni-Zn)\/C and Pd-(Ni-Zn-P)\/C materials, containing very low Pd loadings (22-25 microg cm(-2)), were studied for the oxidation of ethanol in alkaline media in half cells and provided excellent results in terms of both specific current (as high as 3600 A g(Pd)(-1) at room temperature) and onset potential (as low as -0.6 V vs Ag\/AgCl\/KCl(sat)).","5493":"Physicochemical characterization of boron(III) subporphyrazines (SubPzs)--lower subphthalocyanine (SubPc) homologues--has been carried out for the first time. The SubPz macrocycle can act both as an oxidizing and a reducing entity, giving rise to stable radical anion or radical cation species, respectively. SubPzs are luminescent and exhibit fluorescence quantum yields that are in the range known for SubPcs. The peripheral substitution plays a dramatic role with respect to the luminescence properties. Moreover, as with SubPcs, deactivation of the singlet excited state of the SubPzs by intersystem crossing affords long-lived triplet excited states, which are amenable to being used as singlet-oxygen generators. Subporphyrazines are also promising electro- and photoactive materials for molecular photovoltaics.","5494":"","5495":"The influence of starting materials on the physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) were investigated in an attempt to optimize the preparation conditions. The catalyst was successfully prepared by nitriding a starting mixture of ZnO and Ga2O3. A mixture of metallic zinc and GaN, however, did not afford the desired compound. The crystallinity, surface area, composition, and absorption characteristics of the resultant (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) solid solution are found to be dependent on the morphology of ZnO but largely insensitive to the choice of Ga2O3 polymorph. The use of coarser-grained ZnO results in a coarser-grained catalyst with elevated zinc and oxygen content and reduced uniformity in composition and crystallinity. The results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate ZnO and Ga2O3 starting materials for maximizing the photocatalytic activity of (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)) for overall water splitting under visible light.","5496":"A Pd on porous glass catalyst system was used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of terpenoid substrates with dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. A multitude of substances were hydrogenated selectively with yields of 90-100 %. In all experiments, only C--C, C--N, and N--N double bonds were hydrogenated. Studies revealed that carbonyl and aromatic double bonds are inert towards catalytic reduction with dihydrogen under the conditions employed. In some cases, hydrogenation was accompanied by isomerization, so that treatment of beta-pinene, for example, afforded isomeric alpha-pinene, which was subsequently hydrogenated to pinane.","5497":"","5498":"Owing to the large amount of glycerol that is formed as a by-product during biodiesel production, there have been great efforts to develop new reactions and processes based on glycerol as a renewable feedstock. One example is the telomerization of butadiene with glycerol which provides an atom-economic route to amphiphilic molecules. The reaction is catalyzed by homogeneous palladium catalysts which necessitates efficient catalyst recycling. By employing an aqueous biphasic system, an increased selectivity towards the desired mono-ethers was observed in the telomerization reaction. The performance of the reaction and separation and recycling of the catalyst were optimized by the addition of organic solvents as well as cyclodextrins. By adding cyclodextrins, the conversion of glycerol could be increased and the leaching of palladium could be reduced. Leaching of palladium into the organic phase could be lowered also by using 2-octanol or 2-propanol as additional solvents. Furthermore, the catalyst system could be stabilized by adding nitriles or phosphonium salts, and radical polymerization, which leads to fouling, could be inhibited successfully.","5499":"The selective telomerization of 1,3-butadiene with seven different linear and cyclic diols proceeds in the presence of in situ generated palladium carbene catalysts.

The results revealed that the Zn(2)GeO(4) nanorods have a much higher photocatalytic activity for decomposing organic pollutants in aqueous solution than both Zn(2)GeO(4) prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction and widely used TiO(2) (Degussa P25). There is no obvious deactivation of Zn(2)GeO(4) nanorods in the photocatalytic reactions.

This first systematic study of the exploitation of suberin as a precursor to novel aliphatic polyesters confirmed the huge potential of using this abundant renewable resource to prepare macromolecular materials for promising applications.","5505":"The palladium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of aromatic ketones to alkylbenzenes was studied in mixtures of ionic liquids to explore the promotional effect of these reaction media. Choline-based ionic liquids displayed complete miscibility with the aromatic ketone substrate at reaction temperature and a clear phase separation of the derived alkylbenzene product at room temperature. Selected ionic liquids were then assessed as reaction media in the hydrogenolysis of aromatic ketones over palladium catalysts. A binary mixture of choline and betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquids resulted in the highest conversion and selectivity values in the hydrogenolysis of acetophenone. At the end of the reaction, the immiscible alkylbenzene separates from the ionic liquid mixture and the pure product phase can be isolated by simple decantation.

As the commercially available Hoveyda II catalyst was not sufficiently retained by the membrane, a set of homogeneous ruthenium-based catalysts were prepared to enhance the recovery of the catalyst by solvent-resistant commercial membranes made of polyimide (Starmem 228). The molecular weights of the catalysts were gradually increased from 627 to 2195 g mol(-1), and recovery was found to increase from around 70 % to 90 % both in toluene and dimethyl carbonate. The most retained catalyst was then engaged in a series of model ring-closing metathesis reactions associated to a final nanofiltration step to recover and recycle the catalyst.

They were still officially used by the German Government as recently as 1973. The two main constituents of the ink are tannic acid and ferrous sulfate (vitriol). The vitriol normally used was not very pure and likely contained a mixture of iron sulfate with traces of other metals, in particular, copper. Certain transition-metal ions contained in iron gall inks and their acidity are known to deteriorate paper. Therefore, stabilization treatments consist of deacidification and the addition of antioxidants. To this end, the use of tetraalkylammonium bromides was recently proposed. Here, it is shown that 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium bromide both in aqueous and in alcoholic solution can prevent the oxidative deterioration of cellulose.

No CO was produced in this catalytic decomposition of HCOOH. The decomposition rate reached a maximum value at pH 3.8. No deterioration of the catalyst was observed during the catalytic decomposition of HCOOH, and the catalytic activity remained the same for the repeated addition of HCOOH. The rhodium-hydride complex was detected as the catalytic active species that undergoes efficient H\/D exchange with water. When the catalytic decomposition of HCOOH was performed in D2O, D2 was produced selectively. Such an efficient H\/D exchange and the observation of a deuterium kinetic isotope effect in the catalytic decomposition of DCOOH in H2O provide valuable mechanistic insight into this efficient and selective decomposition process.","5521":"In this study, we aimed to produce a highly selective and stable catalyst for the production of dimethyl ether by methanol dehydration. The activities were compared of different active phases of the employed system, zeolite HZSM-5 or gamma-alumina, supported on silicon carbide as foam, and it was found that the supported zeolite catalysts are more active than and as selective as the alumina-based catalysts. The as-prepared zeolite\/SiC composites reveal good stability in long-term tests in the presence or absence of steam. The high stability is attributed to the presence of highly dispersed micrometer-sized zeolite particles, which make the active sites more accessible to the reactants and promote the quick transfer of the desired product, dimethyl ether, out of the catalyst bed, minimizing deactivation of the catalyst.","5522":"Waste fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs), which are formidable composite plastics for chemical treatment, can be efficiently depolymerized by treatment with supercritical methanol in the presence of catalytic amounts of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), which is a well-known catalyst for the formation of esters and amides. This novel depolymerization reaction also provides ready separation of the depolymerized products into three components: methanol-soluble oil, CHCl3-soluble solid, and an inorganic residue. Thus, almost complete decomposition of FRP as well as useful separation of the decomposed products was achieved with the present method, and the latter were ready for chemical recycling. Investigation of the reaction profile revealed that the reaction rate increased as the amount of DMAP increased. Unfortunately, DMAP employed in the reaction could not be recovered because of its decomposition catalyzed by dimethyl phthalate, a depolymerized product from waste FRP, under the reaction conditions employed.","5523":"Glycerol upgrading to diglycerols in the presence of basic (Na+ or Cs+) ion-exchanged (FAU or BEA) zeolite catalysts was studied in a liquid-phase batch rector at 260 degrees C under normal pressure.

The selectivity to linear diglycerols decreased at higher conversions\/reaction times owing to the consecutive formation of higher oligomers, with preferential further conversion of alpha,alpha'-diglycerol. The maximum yield of linear diglycerols was limited to about 30 %. The activities of the zeolites followed the order X&gt;Y&gt;Beta, independent of the alkali ion present. Catalysis by the zeolites starts with an induction period attributed to a slow leaching of alkaline cations from the zeolite.

The primary products undergo consecutive ring-opening reactions with formation of n- and isoheptanes. The latter further react to form lower-molecular-weight n- and isoalkanes. The selectivity and distribution of products deriving from ring-contraction and ring-opening reactions are strongly affected by the pore size and topology of the zeolites.

Direct covalent attachment of preformed homogeneous cobalt Schiff base complexes to the resins was also possible. The catalytic efficiency of the so-prepared polystyrene-bound cobalt Schiff bases was studied for the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds using molecular oxygen as oxidant.

The catalyst with a Ni loading of 8.0 % displays excellent activity and stability at 800 degrees C over 1400 h time on stream. After reaction, the hexagonal mesoporous structure of SBA-15 is still present and the pore walls of SBA-15 prevent the aggregation of nickel. Interactions between NiO, SBA-15, and the Al(2)O(3)\/FeCrAl support modify the redox properties of the Ni\/SBA-15\/Al(2)O(3)\/FeCrAl catalysts.","5548":"","5549":"","5550":"","5551":"","5552":"","5553":"It is crucial to develop economical and energy-efficient processes for the sustainable transformation of biomass into fuels and chemicals. In this context, supercritical water biomass valorization (SCBV) processes are an alternative way to produce biogas, biofuels, and valuable chemicals. Supercritical water technology has seen much progress over the last fifteen years and an industrial application has merged: the supercritical water oxidation of wastes. The evolution from lab-scale to pilot-scale facilities has provided data on reaction mechanisms, kinetics, modeling, and reactor technology as well as an important know-how, which can now be exploited to use the reactivity in supercritical water to transform biomass into gases (CO, H(2), CO(2), CH(4), and N(2)) or into liquids (liquid fuel and valuable chemicals) with the supercritical water biomass gasification and liquefaction processes, respectively. This Review highlights the potential of SCBV processes to transform biomass into gas and liquid energy sources and highlights the developments that are still necessary to push this technology onto the market.","5554":"","5555":"Results from this study of stability\/sustainability conditions of an urban system show that an average citizen of Rome, in one year, uses directly or indirectly as much as 45 tons of abiotic material (minerals, raw fuel, topsoil). Out of such an abiotic flow, about 6.5 tons of fuel per person are required, while the Italian nationwide average is 3.6 tons per year. In addition, 816 tons of water are indirectly used or diverted from their natural pattern in support of individual food, electricity and commodity demand. Despite the scarce 0.05 Ha of productive land available per capita, each citizen in Rome virtually \"uses\" 4.51 Ha of productive land. Each Roman releases in one year 20 tons CO(2), 50 kg CO, 36 kg NO(x) and 24 kg SO(2), and generates about 450 kg of solid waste, thus contributing in several ways to environmental pollution. Finally, to generate 100 euro of local GDP requires 29 kg of raw oil, an amount that is only paid about 10 euro in the international market.","5556":"To design more sustainable processes for the alkylation of ketones, the use of both atom-ineffective leaving groups such as halides and boron as well as noble-metal-based catalysts should be avoided. For that purpose, high-surface-area titanium nitride was prepared from high-surface-area titanium dioxide using cyanamide as a transcription agent. The resulting nitride as well as the initial oxide proved to be effective and versatile catalysts for the alkylation of ketones with alcohols. Interestingly, the TiN catalyst yields unsaturated compounds, while the oxide-based catalyst mainly yields saturated coupling products. As a result of its metallic properties, TiN shows a strong tendency to catalyse the dehydrogenation of alcohols, which then undergo aldol condensation with ketones. In contrast, TiO(2) promotes the direct nucleophilic attack of ketones on alcohols.","5557":"A sol-gel-derived microporous ceramic membrane with an exceptionally low permeability for CO(2) from gaseous streams was developed and characterized. The sols were prepared from a mixture of niobium and silicon alkoxide precursors by acid-catalyzed synthesis. Microporous films were formed by coating asymmetric gamma-alumina disks with the polymeric sol (Si\/Nb=3:1), followed by calcination at 500 degrees C. The membrane consists of a 150-nm-thick layer with a Si\/Nb atomic ratio of about 1.5. The single-gas permeance of small gas molecules such as H(2), CH(4), N(2), and SF(6) decreases steadily with kinetic diameter. Hydrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide follow an activated transport mechanism through the membrane. The permeance of CO(2) in this membrane is much lower than that in pure silica, and its behavior deviates strongly from the general trend observed with the other gases. This is attributed to a relatively strong interaction between CO(2) and adsorption sites in the niobia-silica membrane.","5558":"A novel short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase from Paracoccus pantotrophus DSM 11072, which is applicable for hydrogen transfer, has been identified, cloned, and overexpressed in E. coli. The enzyme stereoselectively reduces several ketones in a sustainable substrate-coupled approach using 2-propanol (5% v\/v) as hydrogen donor. The enzyme maintained its activity in organic co-solvents in biphasic as well as monophasic systems and was even active in micro-aqueous media (1% v\/v aqueous buffer). In general, a higher conversion was observed at higher log P values of the solvent, however, DMSO, which exhibits the lowest log P value of all solvents investigated, was not only tolerated but led to a higher conversion and relative activity (110-210%). For example, the conversion after 24 h in 15% v\/v DMSO was double that for the reaction performed in buffer. This tolerance to DMSO may be attributed to the ability of the wild-type strain to adapt and grow in media with high sulfur content.","5559":"To combine the high chemical performance of asymmetric catalysis with the increasing need for sustainability, a strategy is presented that involves the straightforward preparation of \"Trost\"-like ligands suitable for application in multiphasic homogeneous catalysis. Ligands with coordinating functions (phosphinoamide-phoshinoester groups) as well as phase tags introduced on a D-glucose scaffold were prepared and then examined in the Pd-catalysed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso-2-cyclopenten-1,4-diol biscarbamate. In line with our assumption, the performance of the catalyst system under traditional conditions is as high as that of the original Trost ligand, derived from trans-cyclohexanediamine, giving enantioselectivities of 98 % ee. Moreover, promising results were observed under multiphasic homogeneous conditions.","5560":"Liquid transportation fuels must burn cleanly and have high energy densities, criteria that are currently fulfilled by petroleum, a non-renewable resource, the combustion of which leads to increasing levels of atmospheric CO(2). An attractive approach for the production of transportation fuels from renewable biomass resources is to convert carbohydrates into alkanes with targeted molecular weights, such as C(8)-C(15) for jet-fuel applications. Targeted n-alkanes can be produced directly from fructose by an integrated process involving first the dehydration of this C(6) sugar to form 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, followed by controlled formation of C-C bonds with acetone to form C(9) and C(15) compounds, and completed by hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions to form the corresponding n-alkanes. Analogous reactions are demonstrated starting with 5-methylfurfural or 2-furaldehyde, with the latter leading to C(8) and C(13) n-alkanes.","5561":"Spider silk is a material consisting of very large (&gt;200 kDa) proteins and has a high potential for biomedical applications as a result of its biocompatibility and biodegradability. We report on the influence of physicochemical factors on structure formation of the engineered spider silk protein eADF4(C16), which mimics the known sequence of the dragline protein ADF4 from the spider Araneus diadematus. Under certain experimental conditions, eADF4(C16) forms stable microspheres that have been analyzed with respect to sphere size, size distribution, and surface inertness upon different preparation methods (dialysis, pipette and micromixing). As a result of their material strength, biocompatibility, and the possibility of functionalization, spider silk microspheres have a high potential for the development of targeted drug-delivery systems.","5562":"","5563":"","5564":"","5565":"","5566":"","5567":"With respect to the negative role of carbon dioxide on our climate, it is clear that the time is ripe for the development of processes that convert CO(2) into useful products. The electroreduction of CO(2) is a prime candidate here, as the reaction at near-ambient conditions can yield organics such as formic acid, methanol, and methane. Recent laboratory work on the 100 A scale has shown that reduction of CO(2) to formate (HCO(2)(-)) may be carried out in a trickle-bed continuous electrochemical reactor under industrially viable conditions. Presuming the problems of cathode stability and formate crossover can be overcome, this type of reactor is proposed as the basis for a commercial operation. The viability of corresponding processes for electrosynthesis of formate salts and\/or formic acid from CO(2) is examined here through conceptual flowsheets for two process options, each converting CO(2) at the rate of 100 tonnes per day.","5568":"","5569":"Phytoremediation is an emerging technology for the clean-up of sites contaminated with hazardous chemicals. The term phytoremediation refers to a number of technologies that use photoautotrophic vascular plants for the remediation of sites contaminated with inorganic and organic contaminants. Phytoremediation of organic contaminants can be organized by considering 1) the green liver concept, which elucidates the metabolism of contaminants in planta versus that of contaminants ex planta (e.g. rhizosphere), 2) processes that lead to complete degradation (mineralization) of contaminants as opposed to those that only lead to partial degradation or transformation, and 3) active plant uptake versus passive processes (e.g. sorption). Understanding of these processes needs an interdisciplinary approach involving chemists, biologists, soil scientists, and environmentalists. This Review presents the basic concepts of phytoremediation of organic contaminants in soil and groundwater using selected contaminants as examples.","5570":"Recently, the role of nanostructured materials in addressing the challenges in energy and natural resources has attracted wide attention. In particular, oriented nanostructures demonstrate promising properties for energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. In this Review, we highlight the synthesis and application of oriented nanostructures in a few key areas of energy technologies, namely photovoltaics, batteries, supercapacitors, and thermoelectrics. Although the applications differ from field to field, a common fundamental challenge is to improve the generation and transport of electrons and ions. We highlight the role of high surface area to maximize the surface activity and discuss the importance of optimum dimension and architecture, controlled pore channels, and alignment of the nanocrystalline phase to optimize the transport of electrons and ions. Finally, we discuss the challenges in attaining integrated architectures to achieve the desired performance. Brief background information is provided for the relevant technologies, but the emphasis is focused mainly on the nanoscale effects of mostly inorganic-based materials and devices.","5571":"","5572":"A novel approach has been developed in order to use Kraft lignin as a renewable resource for the production of chemicals. The concept is based on the use of polyoxometalates as reversible oxidants and on the use of radical scavengers, which prevent lignin fragments from repolymerizing. The oxidation of Kraft lignin, which is a potential source of functionalized phenols, by H3PMo12O40 in water yields a relatively small amount of monomeric species detected by GC-MS. The addition of methanol to the reaction resulted in an increase in the yield of monomeric products by a factor of up to 15. Vanillin and methyl vanillate are the main products obtained, in a maximum yield of 5 wt % based on dry Kraft lignin. Methanol plays a decisive role in the prevention of repolymerization by reducing lignin-lignin condensation reactions. Furthermore, it is proposed that methanol generates small amounts of .CH3 and CH3O. radicals through the acid-catalyzed formation of dimethyl ether which couple with lignin fragments.","5573":"The efficient generation of hydrogen from formic acid\/amine adducts at ambient temperature is demonstrated. The highest catalytic activity (TOF up to 3630 h(-1) after 20 min) was observed in the presence of in situ generated ruthenium phosphine catalysts. Compared to the previously known methods to generate hydrogen from liquid feedstocks, the systems presented here can be operated at room temperature without the need for any high-temperature reforming processes, and the hydrogen produced can then be directly used in fuel cells. A variety of Ru precursors and phosphine ligands were investigated for the decomposition of formic acid\/amine adducts. These catalytic systems are particularly interesting for the generation of H2 for new applications in portable electric devices.","5574":"There are strong incentives to develop the production of fuels, chemicals and materials from biomass. However, the extensive use of biomass for industrial production, particularly for biofuels which involves high tonnages, raises environmental and ethical issues that may throw some doubts on the sustainability of these processes. The processing cost of biomass must be decreased by designing new processing routes and catalytic systems because those employed for hydrocarbons are not adapted to the molecular structure of biomolecules. To avoid competition with food supply, lignocellulosic feedstocks should be used rather than traditional agricultural crops particularly for biofuel production. Life-cycle assessment, which takes into account all the inputs and outputs of a process\/product, should be carried out to evaluate the environmental impact of processes and used as a decision-making tool for product development.","5575":"The dye-sensitized solar cell, developed in the 1990s, is a non-conventional solar technology that has attracted much attention owing to its stability, low cost, and device efficiency. Power-conversion efficiencies of over 11% have been achieved for devices that contain liquid electrolytes, whereas solid-state devices that do not require a liquid electrolyte display an overall efficiency of 5%. Improvement of the efficiency of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells requires optimization of their various components, such as the hole-transport material, sensitizer, mesoporous TiO2 film, and the blocking layer.

Under basic conditions, the combination of the ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMINTf2), alcohols, and K2CO3 (40 mol %) results in the production of biodiesel from soybean oil in high yields (&gt;98%) and purity. H2SO4 immobilized in BMINTf2 efficiently promotes the transesterification reaction of soybean oil and various primary and secondary alcohols. In this multiphase process the acid is almost completely retained in the ionic liquid phase, while the biodiesel forms a separate phase. The recovered ionic liquid containing the acid could be reused at least six times without any significant loss in the biodiesel yield or selectivity. In both catalytic processes (acid and base), the reactions proceed as typical multiphasic systems in which the formed biodiesel accumulates as the upper phase and the glycerol by-product is selectively captured by the alcohol-ionic liquid-acid\/base phase. Classical ionic liquids such as 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate are not stable under these acidic or basic conditions and decompose.","5577":"","5578":"","5579":"","5580":"","5581":"The development of sustainable organometallic chemistry is one of the many challenges that chemists must address to solve environmental issues.

This approach results in a reduced number of operations leading to time and cost benefits.

Their morphology, pore structure, and physical properties were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption measurements, UV\/Vis spectrometry, and tensile tests. The cellulose hydrogel was composed of interconnected about 20 nm wide. By using supercritical CO2 drying, the network structure in the hydrogel was well preserved in the aerogel. The results are preliminary but demonstrate the ability of this method to give cellulose aerogels of large surface areas (400-500 m2 g(-1)) which may be useful as adsorbents, heat\/sound insulators, filters, catalyst supports, or carbon aerogel precursors.","5589":"Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing monooxygenases of different bacterial origin were evaluated in microbial Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of racemic fused ketones. During the enzymatic oxidation process, both the \"normal\" lactone generated by migration of the more-substituted carbon atom and\/or the \"abnormal\" lactone resulting from migration of the less-substituted carbon atom can be formed. Depending on the nature of the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, either a regiodivergent biooxygenation to both lactones in high optical purities was observed or essentially racemic \"normal\" rearrangement product was formed. The complementary behavior of enzymes was found to correlate with our previous observation of clustering of cycloketone-oxidizing proteins into two distinct clusters based on phylogenetic relationship and biocatalyst performance.","5590":"Two novel types of chemically recyclable ester-containing polyurethanes, namely, a diol-diacid-type poly(diester-urethane) (PDEU) and a hydroxy acid type poly(ester-urethane) (PEU), were prepared by a green synthetic route that avoids the use of hazardous diisocyanate. The urethane linkage was introduced by the reaction of ethylene carbonate with amino alcohols and amino acids to form urethanediol and urethane-containing hydroxy acids, respectively. The urethanediol underwent polymerization with dimethyl adipate in the presence of lipase to produce a high-molecular-weight PDEU, while PEU was prepared by the lipase-catalyzed direct polycondensation of the urethane-containing hydroxy acid monomer. The periodic introduction of ester linkages into the polyurethane chain afforded primary biodegradation points and chemically recyclable segments. Both PDEU and PEU were readily degraded in the presence of lipase into oligomers which were readily repolymerized in the presence of the same enzyme.","5591":"The energy consumed for four different organic transformations carried out under microwave and conventional heating under otherwise identical reaction conditions was measured with the aid of a Wattmeter. In the case of open-vessel reflux processing, microwave dielectric heating required significantly more energy than conventional techniques using oil baths or heating mantles. This is a consequence of the comparably low energy efficiency of the magnetron in converting electrical to microwave energy. Significant savings in energy were experienced by taking advantage of sealed-vessel microwave processing at high temperatures. When comparing a conventionally heated reflux experiment with a microwave-heated experiment using a superheated solvent in a sealed vessel, reaction times were reduced significantly from hours to minutes. The energy savings in these instances are, however, largely connected to the reduced reaction time and are not an inherent feature of microwave heating.","5592":"Unsaturated vegetable oils are an attractive renewable feedstock, and the selective cleavage of unsaturated fatty esters is an important transformation in this respect. The efficient and selective cross-metathesis of methyl oleate with ethylene was achieved under mild conditions with ruthenium-alkylidene catalysts in toluene and room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) to give two important chemical intermediates, 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate, without double-bond migration. As recovery of the catalyst is an important target with respect to industrial applications, catalyst recycling studies were also carried out in RTILs with the first-generation Hoveyda catalyst.","5593":"Physicochemical characterization of particulate matter fractionated into eight samples by size from 10 to 0.43 microm was performed by HS-SPME\/GC-MS for the organic (semi-)volatile components and SEM X-ray microanalysis (SEM\/EDX) for analysis of the elemental composition. The HS-SPME technique was shown to be efficient with respect to requiring an extremely low amount of material, being selective and clean and avoiding use of any solvents. Particulate matter was collected at four sites characterized by particular environmental locations and different pollution levels around the city of L'Aquila in central Italy. The results reveal a tight correlation between the particle composition, size, and the emission source. The analyses show also that the finer the particle, the higher its content of elemental carbon and organic compounds. Well-known carcinogens such as PAHs were detected among the identified organic compounds from both the rural and highly polluted sites.","5594":"A polar olefin metathesis catalyst that bears a quaternary ammonium group was prepared from commercially available reagents. The electron-withdrawing quaternary ammonium group not only activates the Ru catalyst electronically but at the same time makes the catalyst more hydrophilic. The catalyst can therefore be efficiently used both in traditional media, such as dichloromethane and toluene, as well as in technical-grade alcohols, alcohol-water mixtures and in neat water. Various metathesis reactions, including ring-closing, cross- and enyne metathesis, were conducted in these solvents in the presence of air. In addition, the Ru catalyst can act as an inisurf (initiator and surfactant) molecule, promoting metathesis under heterogeneous aqueous conditions.","5595":"A novel dimeric phthalocyanine-C60 nanoconjugate, consisting of a bisphthalocyanine core to which two fullerenes are attached, has been prepared. The synthetic strategy implemented the preparation of a diformyl butadiynyl-bridged bisphthalocynaninato-zinc(II) complex by means of palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions and subsequent dipolar cycloaddition reactions. Photophysical experiments confirm that an intramolecular electron transfer, namely, from the photoexcited ZnPc moiety to the electron-accepting C60 unit, governs the overall photoreactivity of the nanoconjugate. Through-space charge-transfer interactions facilitated by the close proximity of the ZnPc and the C60 moieties play a decisive role in determining the lifetimes of the charge-separated state which range from 10(-10) to 10(-9) seconds.","5596":"Palladium catalysts have been studied for the Sonogashira-Hagihara coupling of aryl and heteroaryl bromides with terminal alkynes.

Inorganic molecular sieves with different pore topologies as well as heteropolyacids (HPA) were used as acid catalysts to perform both the ketalization and the esterification step. These catalysts are found to hydrolyze the ketal function and promote the esterification between the free hydroxy groups and oleic acid in a cascade process. The results show a positive shape-selectivity effect when the process is carried out using tridirectional, and especially monodirectional (mordenite), zeolites, such that the ratio of mono- to higher esters and the hydroxy number of the final product are increased as compared to those obtained for the homogeneous-catalyzed process.","5598":"","5599":"","5600":"","5601":"","5602":"","5603":"","5604":"","5605":"Energy is the most important issue of the 21st century.

Prompt global action to solve the energy crisis is therefore needed. To pursue such an action, we are urged to save energy and to use energy in more efficient ways, but we are also forced to find alternative energy sources, the most convenient of which is solar energy for several reasons. The sun continuously provides the Earth with a huge amount of energy, fairly distributed all over the world.

The number of porphyrin molecules on the surface of a single CdSe nanoparticle increased with increasing reaction time to reach a saturated maximum of 21. The porphyrins as well as the core in CdSe-H2P can absorb UV\/Vis radiation. Steady-state emission and emission-lifetime measurements reveal efficient energy transfer from the CdSe excited state to the porphyrins in the CdSe-H2P nanoparticles. The resulting porphyrin excited singlet state is not quenched by the CdSe core. These unique properties are in sharp contrast with those of multiporphyrin-modified metal and silica nanoparticles. Thus, semiconducting nanoparticle-multiporphyrin composites are highly promising as novel artificial photosynthetic materials.","5611":"Organic carbonates, such as propylene carbonate, butylene carbonate, and diethyl carbonate, were tested in the Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions of rac-1,3-diphenyl-3-acetoxy-prop-1-ene with dimethyl malonate or benzylamine as nucleophiles. Bidentate diphosphanes were used as chiral ligands. The application of monodentate phosphanes capable of self-assembling with the metal was likewise tested. In the substitution reaction with dimethyl malonate, enantioselectivities up to 98% were achieved. In the amination reaction, the chiral product was obtained with up to 83% ee. The results confirm that these \"green solvents\" can be advantageously used for this catalytic transformation as an alternative to those solvents usually employed which run some risk of being harmful to the environment.","5612":"The oxidation of citronellal to citronellic acid was studied using molecular oxygen as oxidant and gold-containing supported catalysts under aqueous conditions. The reactions were carried out at 60-90 degrees C, with 200 Nml min(-1) O2 and at pH values from 9 to 12. The alumina- or titania-supported catalysts were synthesized according to the deposition-precipitation procedure using urea or NaOH. Mechanistic studies have revealed that radical-initiated reactions lead to undesired by-products especially at pH &lt;9, that is, the C=C bond is attacked and a diol is primarily formed probably via an epoxide intermediate. This side reaction can be suppressed to a large extent by increasing the pH to 12 and by raising the catalyst\/oxygen ratio. Furthermore, detailed studies on the influence of reaction time, pH value, reactant concentration and amount of catalyst show that citronellic acid can be obtained in over 90% yield with total conversion of citronellal at pH 12 and a temperature of 80 degrees C.","5613":"A bifunctional cobalt-salen complex containing a Lewis acidic metal center and a quaternary phosphonium salt unit anchored on the ligand effectively catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides under mild conditions without the utilization of additional organic solvents or co-catalysts. The effects of various reaction variables on the catalytic performance were studied in detail and indicate an optimized reaction temperature of about I00 degrees C and CO2 pressure of around 4 MPa, although the reaction proceeds smoothly even at pressures as low as 2 MPa. The catalyst is applicable to a variety of epoxides, producing the corresponding cyclic carbonates in good yields in most cases. Furthermore, the catalyst can be easily recovered and reused several times without significant loss of its catalytic activity. This process thus represents a greener pathway for the environmentally benign chemical fixation of CO2 to produce cyclic carbonates.","5614":"The absorption of CO2 by aqueous NH3 solutions has been investigated at atmospheric pressure and 0 degrees C. The CO2 absorption is fast and occurs with high efficiency (88-99%). The maximum CO2-removal efficiency increases slightly with the NH3 concentration. Addition of zinc(II) salts (as chloride, nitrate or sulfate) to the NH3 absorbent solution increases the overall CO2-absorption capacity without appreciably affecting the removal efficiency. Stripping of pure CO2 from HCO3(-) solutions is achieved by adding the calculated amount of ZnII salts, which under ambient conditions lead to rapid release of about 30-35% of the initially captured CO2. At the same time, about 65-70% of the captured CO2 is transformed into solid basic zinc carbonates. The recovery of these valuable solid products and the release of only 1\/3 of free CO2 at room temperature and pressure reduces the cost of the overall process of CO2 capture, making it a potentially attractive method for CO2 capture on a larger scale.","5615":"The formation of terraminopiperazinium salts using water as solvent provides a green, straightforward approach to highly energetic salts that exhibit good thermal stabilities and moderate densities. The N,N,N',N'-tetraaminopiperazinium cation was selected for this study because of its high nitrogen-nitrogen bond content and its hign positive near or formation. Theoretical and empirical calculations on energetic salts based on this nitrogen-rich cation reveal them to have high positive molar enthalpies of formation, as high as 1034.0 kJ mol(-1), supporting the application of these new salts as potential energetic materials.","5616":"The gas-phase continuous hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) over 1 mol% Au\/TiO2 and Au\/Al2O3 was compared for the first time. Both catalysts exhibit 100% selectivity in terms of -NO2 group reduction, resulting in the sole formation of p-chloroaniline (p-CAN). Au\/TiO2 exhibited a narrower particle size (1-10 nm) distribution than Au\/Al2O3 (1-20 nm) and a smaller surface-area-weighted mean Au size (6 nm versus 9 nm). Au\/TiO2 delivered a higher specific hydrogenation rate (by a factor of up to four), a response that is discussed in terms of Au particle size and a possible contribution of the support to p-CNB activation. A CNB isomer reactivity sequence was established, that is, o&gt; p&gt; m, which is attributed to resonance stabilisation effects. The results presented establish a basis for the development of a sustainable alternative route for the production of haloamines.","5617":"The cost of chemicals prohibits many technically feasible enhanced oil recovery methods to be applied in oil fields. It is shown that by-products from oil palm processing can be a source of valuable chemicals. Analysis of the pyrolysis oil from oil palm shells, a by-product of the palm oil industry, reveals a complex mixture of mainly phenolic compounds, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes. The phenolic compounds were extracted from the pyrolysis oil by liquid-liquid extraction using alkali and an organic solvent and analyzed, indicating the presence of over 93% phenols and phenolic compounds. Simultaneous sulfonation and alkylation of the pyrolysis oil was carried out to produce surfactants for application in oil fields. The lowest measured surface tension and critical micelle concentration was 30.2 mNm(-1) and 0.22 wt%, respectively.

Under these conditions, the nsTiO2 film is remarkably efficient and selective for the electroreduction of CO2. The current efficiency for the formation of the electrolytic product is about 8-14% at -1.50 V (vs SCE). The electrocatalytic activity of the electrode in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), and the probable electrode reaction mechanism is discussed.","5619":"Photobromination of phenol takes place upon UV\/Vis irradiation of FeIII and bromide under acidic conditions, and most likely involves the brominating agent Br2(-*). Bromination is also observed in the presence of nitrate and bromide under UV irradiation, most likely involving Br2(-*) formed upon oxidation of bromide by *OH. Moreover, quantitative bromination of phenol is observed in the dark in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and bromide. This process is strongly favored under acidic conditions, but a residual, pH-independent bromination pathway is also present. The rates and yields of bromination (up to 100%) are considerably higher than those reported for chlorination under comparable conditions, suggesting that the higher activity of bromine species could compensate for the lower concentration of bromide ions in aerosol compared to chlorides. The reported processes are potent tial sources of reactive bromine species (Br2(-*), HBrO) and aromatic bromo derivatives in atmospheric aerosols, in particular after the acidification process linked with aerosol aging.","5620":"","5621":"","5622":"","5623":"","5624":"","5625":"","5626":"","5627":"Iro (III)-entrapped gamma-alumina nanosorbents were prepared by an environmentally benign method using an ionothermal process based on an ionic liquid to synthesize the gamma-alumina host and a sonochemical method to entrap the iron(III) guest. The morphology of the alumina depends on the aluminum precursor used, giving aligned bundled and randomly debundled gamma-alumina nanorods as well as wormlike mesoporous alumina. In particular, the rodlike structure shows significantly greater mesoporosity than the wormlike porous gamma-alumina structure. Moreover, entrapment of iron(III) in the gamma-alumina nanosorbents with randomly debundled rodlike structures leads to the greatest AsV removal capacity and the fastest adsorption rate as compared to the other FeIII-entrapped adsorbents, as a result of its larger surface area and pore sizes. Thus, this method provides a clean and effective route to an advanced host-guest adsorbent system for application in the removal of arsenic from drinking water.","5628":"Li-ion batteries presently operate on inorganic insertion compounds. The abundance and materials life-cycle costs of such batteries may present issues in the long term with foreseeable large-scale applications. To address the issue of sustainability of electrode materials, a radically different approach from the conventional route has been adopted to develop new organic electrode materials. The oxocarbon salt Li2C6O6 is synthesized through potentially low-cost processes free of toxic solvents and by enlisting the use of natural organic sources (CO2-harvesting entities). It contains carbonyl groups as redox centres and can electrochemically react with four Li ions per formula unit. Such battery processing comes close to both sustainable and green chemistry concepts, which are not currently present in Li-ion cell technology. The consideration of renewable resources in designing electrode materials could potentially enable the realization of green and sustainable batteries within the next decade.","5629":"The catalytic activity of Pd supported on porous glass was studied for both Suzuki and Heck reactions under aerobic conditions, with particular focus on the Suzuki coupling. The reactions were carried out in water under microwave irradiation. The effects of the catalyst preparation process (calcination time and temperature), as well as the base, substrate, and boron compound used on the coupling reaction were investigated in relation to the reusability of the catalyst. Various bases promote the Suzuki coupling of phenylboronic acid with bromophenol very effectively resulting in quantitative conversion and excellent selectivity for the coupling product. However, most bases lead to deactivation of the catalyst after the first reaction cycle and the catalyst must be reactivated before reuse. Therefore, excellent conversions and selectivities for individual reactions are not sufficient to conclude if the chosen conditions are suitable for a given reaction, but resuits from recycling studies have to be considered also.","5630":"Catalytic hydroaminations are one of the most sustainable C-N bond-forming processes as a result of 100% atom economy and the availability of substrates. Here, it is shown that the intermolecular hydroamination of terminal alkynes with anilines proceeds smoothly in the presence of catalytic amounts of zinc triflate, an easily available and inexpensive zinc salt. Amination and subsequent reduction with NaBH3CN gives a variety of secondary and tertiary amines in up to 99% yield and with over 99% Markovnikov regioselectivity. Moreover, difficult functional groups such as nitro and cyano substituents are tolerated by the homogeneous catalyst.","5631":"One-pot condensation\/oxidation of primary amines and aldehydes using urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP) as the stoichiometric oxidant in the presence of methyltrioxorhenium (MTO) as catalyst affords nitrones in a simple and regioselective manner. UHP is a practical and safe source of H2O2, and its use here instead of aqueous H2O2 solutions also simplifies greatly the workup procedure as extractions with organic solvents can be avoided. Typically, at the end of the reaction the solid urea is simply filtered off. From a sustainability point of view, this one-pot synthesis is simple to perform, takes place under mild conditions, has a high atom economy, and releases water as the only by-product.","5632":"Gold-loaded zirconia and sulfated zirconia catalysts were tested in the low-temperature water gas shift reaction. The samples were characterized by N2 adsorption analysis, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction, pulse-flow CO chemisorption, FTIR spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. A reference catalyst, Au\/TiO2, provided by the World Gold Council was investigated for comparison. CO chemisorption and FTIR data indicate the presence of only highly dispersed gold clusters on the sulfated sample and both small clusters and small particles on the non-sulfated sample. Both gold-zirconia catalysts are much more active than the Au\/TiO2 reference sample over all the temperature range investigated. The sample prepared on sulfated zirconia exhibits higher stability than the catalyst on unmodified zirconia. The prominent role in the water gas shift reaction of gold clusters in close contact with the support was deduced.","5633":"A series of Pd\/SBA-15\/Al2O3\/FeCrAl and Pd\/5 wt% Ce(1-x)Zr(x)O2\/SBA-15\/Al2O3\/FeCrAl (x = 0-1) metal monolithic catalysts were prepared and characterized by various techniques. The catalytic activity and the stability of the catalysts for methane combustion were evaluated. All the catalysts retain the SBA-15 mesoporous structure, with PdO being confined in its channels. The results show that the addition of Ce(1-x)Zr(x)O2 as promoters can improve the activity and stability of the catalysts. The stabilities of the metal monolithic catalysts are much better than those of Pd\/ SBA-15 particle catalysts. The catalyst with ZrO2 as promoter exhibits the best activity and stability (T90= 395 degrees C), and the conversion of methane remains constant during the 700 h test.","5634":"","5635":"","5636":"","5637":"","5638":"","5639":"The possibilities for establishing a renewable chemicals industry featuring renewable resources as the dominant feedstock rather than fossil resources are discussed in this Concept. Such use of biomass can potentially be interesting from both an economical and ecological perspective. Simple and educational tools are introduced to allow initial estimates of which chemical processes could be viable. Specifically, fossil and renewables value chains are used to indicate where renewable feedstocks can be optimally valorized. Additionally, C factors are introduced that specify the amount of CO2 produced per kilogram of desired product to illustrate in which processes the use of renewable resources lead to the most substantial reduction of CO2 emissions. The steps towards a renewable chemicals industry will most likely involve intimate integration of biocatalytic and conventional catalytic processes to arrive at cost-competitive and environmentally friendly processes.","5640":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Investigating molecular transformation processes of biodiesel components during long-term storage via high resolution mass
