effector arms of the immune system are optimized to protect from different classes of pathogens. In some cases, pathogens manipulate the host immune system to promote the wrong type of effector response-a phenomenon known as immune deviation. Typically, immune deviation helps pathogens to avoid destructive immune responses. Here, we report on a type of immune deviation whereby an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), induces the type 2 immune response resulting in mucin production that is used as an energy source by the pathogen. Specifically, P. aeruginosa-secreted toxin, LasB, processed and activated epithelial amphiregulin to induce type 2 inflammation and mucin production. This \"niche remodeling\" by P. aeruginosa promoted colonization and, as a by-product, allergic sensitization. Our study thus reveals a type of bacterial immune deviation by increasing nutrient supply. It also uncovers a mechanism of allergic sensitization by a bacterial virulence factor.","1":null,"2":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant can escape neutralization by vaccine-elicited and convalescent antibodies. Memory B cells (MBCs) represent another layer of protection against SARS-CoV-2, as they persist after infection and vaccination and improve their affinity. Whether MBCs elicited by mRNA vaccines can recognize the Omicron variant remains unclear. We assessed the affinity and neutralization potency against the Omicron variant of several hundred naturally expressed MBC-derived monoclonal IgG antibodies from vaccinated COVID-19-recovered and -naive individuals. Compared with other variants of concern, Omicron evaded recognition by a larger proportion of MBC-derived antibodies, with only 30% retaining high affinity against the Omicron RBD, and the reduction in neutralization potency was even more pronounced. Nonetheless, neutralizing MBC clones could be found in all the analyzed individuals. Therefore, despite the strong immune escape potential of the Omicron variant, these results suggest that the MBC repertoire generated by mRNA vaccines still provides some protection against the Omicron variant in vaccinated individuals.","3":"Understanding the mechanisms of HIV tissue persistence necessitates the ability to visualize tissue microenvironments where infected cells reside; however, technological barriers limit our ability to dissect the cellular components of these HIV reservoirs. Here, we developed protein and nucleic acid in situ imaging (PANINI) to simultaneously quantify DNA, RNA, and protein levels within these tissue compartments. By coupling PANINI with multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), we measured over 30 parameters simultaneously across archival lymphoid tissues from healthy or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected nonhuman primates. PANINI enabled the spatial dissection of cellular phenotypes, functional markers, and viral events resulting from infection. SIV infection induced IL-10 expression in lymphoid B cells, which correlated with local macrophage M2 polarization. This highlights a potential viral mechanism for conditioning an immunosuppressive tissue environment for virion production. The spatial multimodal framework here can be extended to decipher tissue responses in other infectious diseases and tumor biology.","4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":"Nonresolving inflammation contributes to many diseases, including COVID-19 in its fatal and long forms. Our understanding of inflammation is rapidly evolving. Like the immune system of which it is a part, inflammation can now be seen as an interactive component of a homeostatic network with the endocrine and nervous systems. This review samples emerging insights regarding inflammatory memory, inflammatory aging, inflammatory cell death, inflammatory DNA, inflammation-regulating cells and metabolites, approaches to resolving or modulating inflammation, and inflammatory inequity.","8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":"The epithelium is an integral component of mucosal barrier and host immunity. Following helminth infection, the intestinal epithelial cells secrete \"alarmin\" cytokines, such as interleukin-25 (IL-25) and IL-33, to initiate the type 2 immune responses for helminth expulsion and tolerance. However, it is unknown how helminth infection and the resulting cytokine milieu drive epithelial remodeling and orchestrate alarmin secretion. Here, we report that epithelial O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) protein modification was induced upon helminth infections. By modifying and activating the transcription factor STAT6, O-GlcNAc transferase promoted the transcription of lineage-defining Pou2f3 in tuft cell differentiation and IL-25 production. Meanwhile, STAT6 O-GlcNAcylation activated the expression of Gsdmc family genes. The membrane pore formed by GSDMC facilitated the unconventional secretion of IL-33. GSDMC-mediated IL-33 secretion was indispensable for effective anti-helminth immunity and contributed to induced intestinal inflammation. Protein O-GlcNAcylation can be harnessed for future treatment of type 2 inflammation-associated human diseases.","17":null,"18":null,"19":null,"20":"Lymph node (LN) stromal cells play a crucial role in LN development and in supporting adaptive immune responses. However, their origin, differentiation pathways, and transcriptional programs are still elusive. Here, we used lineage-tracing approaches and single-cell transcriptome analyses to determine origin, transcriptional profile, and composition of LN stromal and endothelial progenitors. Our results showed that all major stromal cell subsets and a large proportion of blood endothelial cells originate from embryonic Hoxb6+ progenitors of the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), whereas lymphatic endothelial cells arise from Pax3+ progenitors of the paraxial mesoderm (PXM). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the existence of different Cd34+ and Cxcl13+ stromal cell subsets and showed that embryonic LNs contain proliferating progenitors possibly representing the amplifying populations for terminally differentiated cells. Taken together, our work identifies the earliest embryonic sources of LN stromal and endothelial cells and demonstrates that stromal diversity begins already during LN development.","21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":null,"27":"The immune system is a complex, dynamic, and plastic ecosystem composed of multiple cell types that constantly sense and interact with their local microenvironment to protect from infection and maintain homeostasis. For over a century, great efforts and ingenuity have been applied to the characterization of immune cells and their microenvironments, but traditional marker-based and bulk technologies left key questions unanswered. In the past decade, the advent of single-cell genomic approaches has revolutionized our knowledge of the cellular and molecular makeup of the immune system. In this perspective, we outline the past, present, and future applications of single-cell genomics in immunology and discuss how the integration of multiomics at the single-cell level will pave the way for future advances in immunology research and clinical translation.","28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":null,"33":"The presence of intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with positive clinical outcomes and responses to immunotherapy in cancer. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to examine the nature of B cell responses within TLS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). B cells were enriched in TLS, and therein, we could identify all B cell maturation stages toward plasma cell (PC) formation. B cell repertoire analysis revealed clonal diversification, selection, expansion in TLS, and the presence of fully mature clonotypes at distance. In TLS+ tumors, IgG- and IgA-producing PCs disseminated into the tumor beds along fibroblastic tracks. TLS+ tumors exhibited high frequencies of IgG-producing PCs and IgG-stained and apoptotic malignant cells, suggestive of anti-tumor effector activity. Therapeutic responses and progression-free survival correlated with IgG-stained tumor cells in RCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, intratumoral TLS sustains B cell maturation and antibody production that is associated with response to immunotherapy, potentially via direct anti-tumor effects.","34":null,"35":null,"36":"Developmental origins of dendritic cells (DCs) including conventional DCs (cDCs, comprising cDC1 and cDC2 subsets) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) remain unclear.

Inducible tracing of Cx3cr1+ hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow showed that they simultaneously produce all DC subsets including pDCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s. Clonal tracing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and of Cx3cr1+ progenitors revealed clone sharing between cDC1s and pDCs, but not between the two cDC subsets or between pDCs and B cells. Accordingly, CITE-seq analyses of differentiating HSCs and Cx3cr1+ progenitors identified progressive stages of pDC development including Cx3cr1+ Ly-6D+ pro-pDCs that were distinct from lymphoid progenitors. These results reveal the shared origin of pDCs and cDCs and suggest a revised scheme of DC development whereby pDCs share clonal relationship with cDC1s.","37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":null,"41":"","42":null,"43":null,"44":"Nutrition affects all physiological processes including those linked to the development and function of our immune system.

This will be examined through the lens of studies showing that mild or transient reductions in dietary intake can enhance protective immunity while also limiting aberrant inflammatory responses. We will further discuss how trade-offs and priorities begin to emerge in the context of severe nutritional stress. In those settings, specific immunological functions are heightened to re-enforce processes and tissue sites most critical to survival. Altogether, these examples will emphasize the profound influence nutrition has over the immune system and highlight how a mechanistic exploration of this cross talk could ultimately lead to the design of novel therapeutic approaches that prevent and treat disease.","45":null,"46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":"","50":"SARS-CoV-2 infections mostly lead to mild or even asymptomatic infections in children, but the reasons for this are not fully understood.

Here, I will discuss our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and hypothesize that a life history and energy allocation perspective might offer an additional explanation to mild infections, viral dynamics, and the higher incidence of rare multisystem inflammatory syndromes in children and young people.","51":"Tbet+CD11c+ B cells arise during type 1 pathogen challenge, aging, and autoimmunity in mice and humans. Here, we examined the developmental requirements of this B cell subset. In acute infection, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, but not Th1 cells, drove Tbet+CD11c+ B cell generation through proximal delivery of help. Tbet+CD11c+ B cells developed prior to germinal center (GC) formation, exhibiting phenotypic and transcriptional profiles distinct from GC B cells. Fate tracking revealed that most Tbet+CD11c+ B cells developed independently of GC entry and cell-intrinsic Bcl6 expression. Tbet+CD11c+ and GC B cells exhibited minimal repertoire overlap, indicating distinct developmental pathways. As the infection resolved, Tbet+CD11c+ B cells localized to the marginal zone where splenic retention depended on integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4, forming a competitive memory subset that contributed to antibody production and secondary GC seeding upon rechallenge. Therefore, Tbet+CD11c+ B cells comprise a GC-independent memory subset capable of rapid and robust recall responses.","52":"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines confer robust protection against COVID-19, but the emergence of variants has generated concerns regarding the protective efficacy of the currently approved vaccines, which lose neutralizing potency against some variants. Emerging data suggest that antibody functions beyond neutralization may contribute to protection from the disease, but little is known about SARS-CoV-2 antibody effector functions. Here, we profiled the binding and functional capacity of convalescent antibodies and Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies across SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Although the neutralizing responses to VOCs decreased in both groups, the Fc-mediated responses were distinct. In convalescent individuals, although antibodies exhibited robust binding to VOCs, they showed compromised interactions with Fc-receptors. Conversely, vaccine-induced antibodies also bound robustly to VOCs but continued to interact with Fc-receptors and mediate antibody effector functions. These data point to a resilience in the mRNA-vaccine-induced humoral immune response that may continue to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 VOCs independent of neutralization.","53":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are defined by a Bcl6+CXCR5hiPD-1hi phenotype, but only a minor fraction of these reside in germinal centers (GCs). Here, we examined whether GC-resident and -nonresident Tfh cells share a common physiology and function. Fluorescently labeled, GC-resident Tfh cells in different mouse models were distinguished by low expression of CD90. CD90neg\/lo GCTfh cells required antigen-specific, MHCII+ B cells to develop and stopped proliferating soon after differentiation. In contrast, nonresident, CD90hi Tfh (GCTfh-like) cells developed normally in the absence of MHCII+ B cells and proliferated continuously during primary responses. The TCR repertoires of both Tfh subsets overlapped initially but later diverged in association with dendritic cell-dependent proliferation of CD90hi GCTfh-like cells, suggestive of TCR-dependency seen also in TCR-transgenic adoptive transfer experiments. Furthermore, the transcriptomes of CD90neg\/lo and CD90hi GCTfh-like cells were enriched in different functional pathways. Thus, GC-resident and nonresident Tfh cells have distinct developmental requirements and activities, implying distinct functions.","54":"The Th17 cell-lineage-defining cytokine IL-17A contributes to host defense and inflammatory disease by coordinating multicellular immune responses. The IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA) is expressed by diverse intestinal cell types, and therapies targeting IL-17A induce adverse intestinal events, suggesting additional tissue-specific functions. Here, we used multiple conditional deletion models to identify a role for IL-17A in secretory epithelial cell differentiation in the gut. Paneth, tuft, goblet, and enteroendocrine cell numbers were dependent on IL-17A-mediated induction of the transcription factor ATOH1 in Lgr5+ intestinal epithelial stem cells. Although dispensable at steady state, IL-17RA signaling in ATOH1+ cells was required to regenerate secretory cells following injury. Finally, IL-17A stimulation of human-derived intestinal organoids that were locked into a cystic immature state induced ATOH1 expression and rescued secretory cell differentiation. Our data suggest that the cross talk between immune cells and stem cells regulates secretory cell lineage commitment and the integrity of the mucosa.","55":"","56":null,"57":null,"58":null,"59":null,"60":"Human immune responses to viral infections are highly variable, but the genetic factors that contribute to this variability are not well characterized.

We identified an EBV serosignature that predicted viral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and was associated with variants in the MHC class I locus.

We screened a cohort of 435 HCV-infected individuals and found that 2%-5% demonstrated outstanding HCV-neutralizing activity. From four of these patients, we isolated 310 HCV antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies with exceptional breadth and potency. High neutralizing activity was enabled by the use of the VH1-69 heavy-chain gene segment, somatic mutations within CDRH1, and CDRH2 hydrophobicity. Structural and mutational analyses revealed an important role for mutations replacing the serines at positions 30 and 31, as well as the presence of neutral and hydrophobic residues at the tip of the CDRH3. Based on these characteristics, we computationally created a de novo antibody with a fully synthetic VH1-69 heavy chain that efficiently neutralized multiple HCV genotypes.

Germline DNA was genotyped using a custom genotyping array. HLA diversity (measured by heterozygosity and evolutionary divergence) across class I loci was not associated with improved response to pembrolizumab, either within each tumor type evaluated or across all patients. Similarly, HLA heterozygosity at each class I and class II gene was not associated with response to pembrolizumab after accounting for the number of tests conducted. No conclusive association between HLA genotype and response to pembrolizumab was identified in this dataset. Germline HLA genotype or diversity alone is not an important independent determinant of response to pembrolizumab and should not be used for clinical decision-making in patients treated with pembrolizumab.","68":null,"69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":null,"74":null,"75":null,"76":"Antigenic drift refers to the evolutionary accumulation of amino acid substitutions in viral proteins selected by host adaptive immune systems as the virus circulates in a population.

These phenotypes resulted from the action of food-derived retinoic acid (ATRA), which enhanced actomyosin contractility and promoted LP cDC2 transmigration into the epithelium. There, cDC2s were imprinted by environmental cues, including ATRA itself and the mucus component Muc2. Hence, by reaching distinct subtissular niches, DCs can exist as immature and mature cells within the same tissue, revealing an additional mechanism of DC functional diversification.","80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":"Adjuvants are critical for improving the quality and magnitude of adaptive immune responses to vaccination.

Using influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and protein subunit vaccines, we demonstrated that our LNP formulation has intrinsic adjuvant activity that promotes induction of strong T follicular helper cell, germinal center B cell, long-lived plasma cell, and memory B cell responses that are associated with durable and protective antibodies in mice. Comparative experiments demonstrated that this LNP formulation outperformed a widely used MF59-like adjuvant, AddaVax.

Long-term protective immunity is dependent on the continual production of neutralizing antibodies by the subset of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). LLPCs are not intrinsically long-lived, but require interaction with LLPC niche stromal cells for survival. However, it remains unclear which and how these interactions sustain LLPC survival and long-term humoral immunity. We now have found that the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is required to sustain antibody responses and LLPC survival. Activation of IDO1 occurs upon the engagement of CD80\/CD86 on the niche dendritic cells by CD28 on LLPC. Kynurenine, the product of IDO1 catabolism, activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in LLPC, reinforcing CD28 expression and survival signaling. These findings expand the immune function of IDO1 and uncover a novel pathway for sustaining LLPC survival and humoral immunity.","89":null,"90":"Viral mutations are an emerging concern in reducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination efficacy. Second-generation vaccines will need to elicit neutralizing antibodies against sites that are evolutionarily conserved across the sarbecovirus subgenus. Here, we immunized mice containing a human antibody repertoire with diverse sarbecovirus receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to identify antibodies targeting conserved sites of vulnerability. Antibodies with broad reactivity against diverse clade B RBDs targeting the conserved class 4 epitope, with recurring IGHV\/IGKV pairs, were readily elicited but were non-neutralizing. However, rare class 4 antibodies binding this conserved RBD supersite showed potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and all variants of concern. Structural analysis revealed that the neutralizing ability of cross-reactive antibodies was reserved only for those with an elongated CDRH3 that extends the antiparallel beta-sheet RBD core and orients the antibody light chain to obstruct ACE2-RBD interactions. These results identify a structurally defined pathway for vaccine strategies eliciting escape-resistant SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.","91":"Repeat antigens, such as the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP), use both sequence degeneracy and structural diversity to evade the immune response. A few PfCSP-directed antibodies have been identified that are effective at preventing malaria infection, including CIS43, but how these repeat-targeting antibodies might be improved has been unclear. Here, we engineered a humanized mouse model in which B cells expressed inferred human germline CIS43 (iGL-CIS43) B cell receptors and used both vaccination and bioinformatic analysis to obtain variant CIS43 antibodies with improved protective capacity. One such antibody, iGL-CIS43.D3, was significantly more potent than the current best-in-class PfCSP-directed antibody. We found that vaccination with a junctional epitope peptide was more effective than full-length PfCSP at recruiting iGL-CIS43 B cells to germinal centers. Structure-function analysis revealed multiple somatic hypermutations that combinatorically improved protection. This mouse model can thus be used to understand vaccine immunogens and to develop highly potent anti-malarial antibodies.","92":"Interactions between intracellular bacteria and mononuclear phagocytes give rise to diverse cellular phenotypes that may determine the outcome of infection. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have identified multiple subsets within the mononuclear population, but implications to their function during infection are limited.

We described eclipse-like growth kinetics in the spleen, with a first phase of bacterial control mediated by tissue-resident red-pulp macrophages. A second phase involved extensive bacterial replication within a macrophage population characterized by CD9 expression. We demonstrated that CD9+ macrophages induced pathways for detoxificating oxidized lipids, that may be utilized by intracellular S.Tm. We established that CD9+ macrophages originated from non-classical monocytes (NCM), and NCM-depleted mice were more resistant to S.Tm infection.

Maternal interleukin-6 (IL-6) elevation during pregnancy causes abnormal behavior in offspring, but whether these defects result from altered synaptic developmental trajectories remains unclear. Here we showed that transient IL-6 elevation via injection into pregnant mice or developing embryos enhanced glutamatergic synapses and led to overall brain hyperconnectivity in offspring into adulthood. IL-6 activated synaptogenesis gene programs in glutamatergic neurons and required the transcription factor STAT3 and expression of the RGS4 gene. The STAT3-RGS4 pathway was also activated in neonatal brains during poly(I:C)-induced maternal immune activation, which mimics viral infection during pregnancy. These findings indicate that IL-6 elevation at early developmental stages is sufficient to exert a long-lasting effect on glutamatergic synaptogenesis and brain connectivity, providing a mechanistic framework for the association between prenatal inflammatory events and brain neurodevelopmental disorders.","95":"Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection.

Sites of lineage-specific hypomethylation were associated with distinct combinations of transcription factors in each cell type. By contrast, sites of lineage-specific hypermethylation were restricted mostly to adaptive immune cells. PU.1 binding sites were associated with lineage-specific hypo- and hypermethylation in different cell types, suggesting that it regulates DNA methylation in a context-dependent manner.

Harmonious cell-cell communication involving microglia are considered crucial to maintain the healthy state of the tissue environment and to overcome pathology such as neuroinflammation. Analyses of such intercellular pathways have contributed to our understanding of the heterogeneous but context-associated microglial responses to environmental cues across neuropathology, including inflammatory conditions such as infections and autoimmunity, as well as immunosuppressive states as seen in brain tumors.

However, molecular pathways that govern their differentiation have remained incompletely understood. Here, we show that uncoupling protein-2-mediated mitochondrial reprogramming and the transcription factor GATA3 specifically controlled the differentiation of pro-resolving AAMs in response to the alarmin IL-33. In macrophages, IL-33 sequentially triggered early expression of pro-inflammatory genes and subsequent differentiation into AAMs. Global analysis of underlying signaling events revealed that IL-33 induced a rapid metabolic rewiring of macrophages that involved uncoupling of the respiratory chain and increased production of the metabolite itaconate, which subsequently triggered a GATA3-mediated AAM polarization. Conditional deletion of GATA3 in mononuclear phagocytes accordingly abrogated IL-33-induced differentiation of AAMs and tissue repair upon muscle injury. Our data thus identify an IL-4-independent and GATA3-dependent pathway in mononuclear phagocytes that results from mitochondrial rewiring and controls macrophage plasticity and the resolution of inflammation.","120":null,"121":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a devastating pandemic worldwide.

Parabiosis experiments together with lineage tracing showed that meningeal developing B cells were replenished continuously from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived progenitors via a circulation-independent route. Autoreactive immature B cells that recognized myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a central nervous system-specific antigen, were eliminated specifically from the meninges. Furthermore, genetic deletion of the Mog gene restored the self-reactive B cell population in the meninges.

These cells could differentiate into pre-memory cells. B cell-specific deletion of IL4Ra or STAT6 favored the pre-memory cell trajectory, and provision of exogenous IL-4 in a wild-type context reduced pre-memory cell frequencies. IL-4 acted during antigen-specific interactions but also influenced bystander cells. Deletion of IL4Ra from follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) increased the availability of IL-4 in the GC, impaired the selection of affinity-matured B cells, and reduced memory cell generation.

Most APs rapidly exited the cell cycle, giving rise to non-GC-derived early memory B cells (eMBCs) that retained an AP-like transcriptional profile. Rapid decline of antigen availability controlled these events; provision of excess antigen precluded cell cycle exit and induced a new wave of PBs. Fate mapping revealed a prominent contribution of eMBCs to the MBC pool. Quiescent cells with an MBC phenotype dominated the early response to immunization in primates.

However, in the absence of a conceptual framework, these effects appear chaotic, leading to confusion. Here, we examine how stressor diversity is imbedded in the neuroimmune axis. Stressors differ in the brain patterns they induce, diversifying the neuronal and endocrine mediators dispatched to the periphery and generating a wide range of potential immune effects.

A2aR-deficient mice showed improved resistance to post-sepsis infections. Sepsis expanded a subset of CD39hi B cells and elevated extracellular adenosine, which was absent in mice lacking CD39-expressing B cells. Sepsis-surviving B cell-deficient mice were more resistant to secondary infections. Mechanistically, metabolic reprogramming of septic B cells increased production of ATP, which was converted into adenosine by CD39 on plasmablasts. Adenosine signaling via A2aR impaired macrophage bactericidal activity and enhanced interleukin-10 production. Septic individuals exhibited expanded CD39hi plasmablasts and adenosine accumulation.

KC2 expressed genes involved in metabolic processes, including fatty acid metabolism both in steady-state and in diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis. Functional characterization by depletion of KC2 or targeted silencing of the fatty acid transporter Cd36 highlighted a crucial contribution of KC2 in the liver oxidative stress associated with obesity.

Of five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized the WA1\/2020 D614G strain, all retained neutralizing capacity against the B.1.617.2 variant, four also neutralized the B.1.1.7 variant, and only one, 2C08, also neutralized the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants. 2C08 reduced lung viral load and morbidity in hamsters challenged with the WA1\/2020 D614G, B.1.351, or B.1.617.2 strains. Clonal analysis identified 2C08-like public clonotypes among B cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in 41 out of 181 individuals.

Examination of primary B-NHL tissues revealed that FOXO1 mutations and PI3K pathway activity were not directly correlated. Human B cell lines bearing FOXO1 mutations exhibited hyperactivation of PI3K and Stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)\/Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, and increased cell survival under stress conditions as a result of alterations in FOXO1 transcriptional affinities and activation of transcriptional programs characteristic of GC-positive selection. When modeled in mice, FOXO1 mutations conferred competitive advantage to B cells in response to key T-dependent immune signals, disrupting GC homeostasis. FOXO1 mutant transcriptional signatures were prevalent in human B-NHL and predicted poor clinical outcomes.

We review these findings here and integrate them into the current understanding of GC B cell replication and death, the retention of high-affinity and class-switched B cells in the GC, and differentiation into plasma and memory cell effectors. We also discuss how the biology of GC responses relates to vaccine effectiveness and outline current and future challenges in the field.","163":null,"164":null,"165":null,"166":null,"167":null,"168":"The migration of neutrophils from the blood circulation to sites of infection or injury is a key immune response and requires the breaching of endothelial cells (ECs) that line the inner aspect of blood vessels. Unregulated neutrophil transendothelial cell migration (TEM) is pathogenic, but the molecular basis of its physiological termination remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that ECs of venules in inflamed tissues exhibited a robust autophagic response that was aligned temporally with the peak of neutrophil trafficking and was strictly localized to EC contacts. Genetic ablation of EC autophagy led to excessive neutrophil TEM and uncontrolled leukocyte migration in murine inflammatory models, while pharmacological induction of autophagy suppressed neutrophil infiltration into tissues. Mechanistically, autophagy regulated the remodeling of EC junctions and expression of key EC adhesion molecules, facilitating their intracellular trafficking and degradation. Collectively, we have identified autophagy as a modulator of EC leukocyte trafficking machinery aimed at terminating physiological inflammation.","169":"Hypertension affects one-third of the world's population, leading to cardiac dysfunction that is modulated by resident and recruited immune cells. Cardiomyocyte growth and increased cardiac mass are essential to withstand hypertensive stress; however, whether immune cells are involved in this compensatory cardioprotective process is unclear. In normotensive animals, single-cell transcriptomics of fate-mapped self-renewing cardiac resident macrophages (RMs) revealed transcriptionally diverse cell states with a core repertoire of reparative gene programs, including high expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1). Hypertension drove selective in situ proliferation and transcriptional activation of some cardiac RM states, directly correlating with increased cardiomyocyte growth. During hypertension, inducible ablation of RMs or selective deletion of RM-derived Igf1 prevented adaptive cardiomyocyte growth, and cardiac mass failed to increase, which led to cardiac dysfunction. Single-cell transcriptomics identified a conserved IGF1-expressing macrophage subpopulation in human cardiomyopathy. Here we defined the absolute requirement of RM-produced IGF-1 in cardiac adaptation to hypertension.","170":null,"171":"The development of effective vaccines to combat infectious diseases is a complex multi-year and multi-stakeholder process. To accelerate the development of vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel pathogen emerging in late 2019 and spreading globally by early 2020, the United States government (USG) mounted an operation bridging public and private sector expertise and infrastructure. The success of the endeavor can be seen in the rapid advanced development of multiple vaccine candidates, with several demonstrating efficacy and now being administered around the globe. Here, we review the milestones enabling the USG-led effort, the methods utilized, and ensuing outcomes.

We analyzed 6 independent groups of clonally related severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies from 5 individuals shortly after infection and later in convalescence to determine the impact of maturation over months. In addition to increased affinity and neutralization potency, antibody evolution changed the mutational pathways for the acquisition of viral resistance and restricted neutralization escape options. For some antibodies, maturation imposed a requirement for multiple substitutions to enable escape. For certain antibodies, affinity maturation enabled the neutralization of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and heterologous sarbecoviruses. Antibody-antigen structures revealed that these properties resulted from substitutions that allowed additional variability at the interface with the RBD. These findings suggest that increasing antibody diversity through prolonged or repeated antigen exposure may improve protection against diversifying SARS-CoV-2 populations, and perhaps against other pandemic threat coronaviruses.","176":"Cardiac macrophages represent a heterogeneous cell population with distinct origins, dynamics, and functions. Recent studies have revealed that C-C Chemokine Receptor 2 positive (CCR2+) macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes regulate myocardial inflammation and heart failure pathogenesis. Comparatively little is known about the functions of tissue resident (CCR2-) macrophages. Herein, we identified an essential role for CCR2- macrophages in the chronically failing heart. Depletion of CCR2- macrophages in mice with dilated cardiomyopathy accelerated mortality and impaired ventricular remodeling and coronary angiogenesis, adaptive changes necessary to maintain cardiac output in the setting of reduced cardiac contractility. Mechanistically, CCR2- macrophages interacted with neighboring cardiomyocytes via focal adhesion complexes and were activated in response to mechanical stretch through a transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)-dependent pathway that controlled growth factor expression. These findings establish a role for tissue-resident macrophages in adaptive cardiac remodeling and implicate mechanical sensing in cardiac macrophage activation.","177":null,"178":null,"179":null,"180":null,"181":"","182":"Myeloid cells encounter stromal cells and their matrix determinants on a continual basis during their residence in any given organ. Here, we examined the impact of the collagen receptor LAIR1 on myeloid cell homeostasis and function. LAIR1 was highly expressed in the myeloid lineage and enriched in non-classical monocytes. Proteomic definition of the LAIR1 interactome identified stromal factor Colec12 as a high-affinity LAIR1 ligand. Proteomic profiling of LAIR1 signaling triggered by Collagen1 and Colec12 highlighted pathways associated with survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Lair1-\/- mice had reduced frequencies of Ly6C- monocytes, which were associated with altered proliferation and apoptosis of non-classical monocytes from bone marrow and altered heterogeneity of interstitial macrophages in lung. Myeloid-specific LAIR1 deficiency promoted metastatic growth in a melanoma model and LAIR1 expression associated with improved clinical outcomes in human metastatic melanoma. Thus, monocytes and macrophages rely on LAIR1 sensing of stromal determinants for fitness and function, with relevance in homeostasis and disease.","183":"Neutrophils are immune cells with unusual biological features that furnish potent antimicrobial properties. These cells phagocytose and subsequently kill prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms very efficiently. Importantly, it is not only their ability to attack microbes within a constrained intracellular compartment that endows neutrophils with antimicrobial function. They can unleash their effectors into the extracellular space, where, even post-mortem, their killing machinery can endure and remain functional. The antimicrobial activity of neutrophils must not be misconstrued as being microbe specific and should be viewed more generally as biotoxic. Outside of fighting infections, neutrophils can harness their noxious machinery in other contexts, like cancer. Inappropriate or dysregulated neutrophil activation damages the host and contributes to autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Here we review a number of topics related to neutrophil biology based on contemporary findings.","184":null,"185":null,"186":null,"187":null,"188":null,"189":"Development COVID-19 vaccines in a record time has been an unprecedented global scientific achievement.

Here we showed that the South African variant B.1.351 was the most resistant to current monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected individuals, followed by the Brazilian variant P.1 and the United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7. This resistance hierarchy corresponded with Y144del and 242-244del mutations in the N-terminal domain and K417N\/T, E484K, and N501Y mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Crystal structure analysis of the B.1.351 triple mutant (417N-484K-501Y) RBD complexed with the monoclonal antibody P2C-1F11 revealed the molecular basis for antibody neutralization and escape. B.1.351 and P.1 also acquired the ability to use mouse and mink ACE2 receptors for entry. Our results demonstrate major antigenic shifts and potential broadening of the host range for B.1.351 and P.1 variants, which poses serious challenges to current antibody therapies and vaccine protection.","196":null,"197":"Tight control of inflammatory gene expression by antagonistic environmental cues is key to ensure immune protection while preventing tissue damage. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) modulates macrophage activation during homeostasis and disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. Here we dissected the genomic properties of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced genes whose expression is antagonized by PGE2. The latter molecule targeted a set of inflammatory gene enhancers that, already in unstimulated macrophages, displayed poorly permissive chromatin organization and were marked by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A). Deletion of MEF2A phenocopied PGE2 treatment and abolished type I interferon (IFN I) induction upon exposure to innate immune stimuli. Mechanistically, PGE2 interfered with LPS-mediated activation of ERK5, a known transcriptional partner of MEF2. This study highlights principles of plasticity and adaptation in cells exposed to a complex environment and uncovers a transcriptional circuit for IFN I induction with relevance for infectious diseases or cancer.","198":null,"199":"Microbe-derived acetate activates the Drosophila immunodeficiency (IMD) pathway in a subset of enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the anterior midgut. In these cells, the IMD pathway co-regulates expression of antimicrobial and enteroendocrine peptides including tachykinin, a repressor of intestinal lipid synthesis. To determine whether acetate acts on a cell surface pattern recognition receptor or an intracellular target, we asked whether acetate import was essential for IMD signaling. Mutagenesis and RNA interference revealed that the putative monocarboxylic acid transporter Tarag was essential for enhancement of IMD signaling by dietary acetate. Interference with histone deacetylation in EECs augmented transcription of genes regulated by the steroid hormone ecdysone including IMD targets. Reduced expression of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 decreased IMD signaling and blocked rescue by dietary acetate and other sources of intracellular acetyl-CoA. Thus, microbe-derived acetate induces chromatin remodeling within enteroendocrine cells, co-regulating host metabolism and intestinal innate immunity via a Tip60-steroid hormone axis that is conserved in mammals.","200":null,"201":"The interindividual heterogeneity of the immune system likely determines the personal risk for acquiring infections and developing diseases with inflammatory components. In addition to genetic factors, the immune system's heterogeneity is driven by diverging exposures of leukocytes and their progenitors to infections, vaccinations, and health behavior, including lifestyle-related stimuli such as diet, physical inactivity, and psychosocial stress. We review how such experiences alter immune cell responses to concurrent and subsequent challenges, leading to either improved host resilience or disease susceptibility due to a muted or overzealous immune system, with a primary focus on the contribution of innate immune cells. We explore the involvement of diverse mechanisms, including trained immunity, and their relevance for infections and cardiovascular disease, as these prevalent conditions are heavily influenced by immune cell abundance and phenotypic adaptions. Understanding the mechanistic bases of immune modulations by prior or co-exposures may lead to new therapies targeting dysfunctional inflammation.","202":null,"203":null,"204":null,"205":null,"206":null,"207":null,"208":"The extra-embryonic yolk sac contains the first definitive multipotent hematopoietic cells, denominated erythromyeloid progenitors. They originate in situ prior to the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells and give rise to erythroid, monocytes, granulocytes, mast cells and macrophages, the latter in a Myb transcription factor-independent manner. We uncovered here the heterogeneity of yolk sac erythromyeloid progenitors, at the single cell level, and discriminated multipotent from committed progenitors, prior to fetal liver colonization. We identified two temporally distinct megakaryocyte differentiation pathways. The first occurs in the yolk sac, bypasses intermediate bipotent megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and, similar to the differentiation of macrophages, is Myb-independent. By contrast, the second originates later, from Myb-dependent bipotent progenitors expressing Csf2rb and colonize the fetal liver, where they give rise to megakaryocytes and to large numbers of erythrocytes. Understanding megakaryocyte development is crucial as they play key functions during vascular development, in particular in separating blood and lymphatic networks.","209":null,"210":null,"211":"Alterations in the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway affect intestinal homeostasis. We sought to delineate the functional role of STING in intestinal inflammation. Increased STING expression was a feature of intestinal inflammation in mice with colitis and in humans afflicted with inflammatory bowel disease. Mice bearing an allele rendering STING constitutively active exhibited spontaneous colitis and dysbiosis, as well as progressive chronic intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. Bone marrow chimera experiments revealed STING accumulation in intestinal macrophages and monocytes as the initial driver of inflammation. Depletion of Gram-negative bacteria prevented STING accumulation in these cells and alleviated intestinal inflammation. STING accumulation occurred at the protein rather than transcript level, suggesting post-translational stabilization. We found that STING was ubiquitinated in myeloid cells, and this K63-linked ubiquitination could be elicited by bacterial products, including cyclic di-GMP. Our findings suggest a positive feedback loop wherein dysbiosis foments the accumulation of STING in intestinal myeloid cells, driving intestinal inflammation.","212":"Despite mounting evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) engagement with immune cells, most express little, if any, of the canonical receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, using a myeloid cell receptor-focused ectopic expression screen, we identified several C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, LSECtin, ASGR1, and CLEC10A) and Tweety family member 2 (TTYH2) as glycan-dependent binding partners of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Except for TTYH2, these molecules primarily interacted with spike via regions outside of the receptor-binding domain. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of pulmonary cells from individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) indicated predominant expression of these molecules on myeloid cells. Although these receptors do not support active replication of SARS-CoV-2, their engagement with the virus induced robust proinflammatory responses in myeloid cells that correlated with COVID-19 severity. We also generated a bispecific anti-spike nanobody that not only blocked ACE2-mediated infection but also the myeloid receptor-mediated proinflammatory responses. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2-myeloid receptor interactions promote immune hyperactivation, which represents potential targets for COVID-19 therapy.","213":null,"214":"Aging is associated with dysregulated immune functions. Here, we investigated the impact of age on neutrophil diapedesis. Using confocal intravital microscopy, we found that in aged mice, neutrophils adhered to vascular endothelium in inflamed tissues but exhibited a high frequency of reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM). This retrograde breaching of the endothelium by neutrophils was governed by enhanced production of the chemokine CXCL1 from mast cells that localized at endothelial cell (EC) junctions. Increased EC expression of the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) supported this pro-inflammatory milieu in aged venules. Accumulation of CXCL1 caused desensitization of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 on neutrophils and loss of neutrophil directional motility within EC junctions. Fluorescent tracking revealed that in aged mice, neutrophils undergoing rTEM re-entered the circulation and disseminated to the lungs where they caused vascular leakage. Thus, neutrophils stemming from a local inflammatory site contribute to remote organ damage, with implication to the dysregulated systemic inflammation associated with aging.","215":null,"216":null,"217":"Viral infections during pregnancy are a considerable cause of adverse outcomes and birth defects, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Among those, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection stands out as the most common intrauterine infection in humans, putatively causing early pregnancy loss. We employed murine CMV as a model to study the consequences of viral infection on pregnancy outcome and fertility maintenance. Even though pregnant mice successfully controlled CMV infection, we observed highly selective, strong infection of corpus luteum (CL) cells in their ovaries. High infection densities indicated complete failure of immune control in CL cells, resulting in progesterone insufficiency and pregnancy loss. An abundance of gap junctions, absence of vasculature, strong type I interferon (IFN) responses, and interaction of innate immune cells fully protected the ovarian follicles from viral infection. Our work provides fundamental insights into the effect of CMV infection on pregnancy loss and mechanisms protecting fertility.","218":null,"219":null,"220":null,"221":null,"222":null,"223":null,"224":"Fibroblasts and macrophages are present in all tissues, and mounting evidence supports that these cells engage in direct communication to influence the overall tissue microenvironment and affect disease outcomes.

We present an integrated view of fibroblast-macrophage interactions that is centered on the CSF1-CSF1R axis and discuss how additional molecular programs linking these cell types can underpin disease onset, progression, and resolution. These programs may be tissue and context dependent, affected also by macrophage and fibroblast origin and state, as seen most clearly in cancer. Continued efforts to understand these cells and the means by which they interact may provide therapeutic approaches for the treatment of fibrosis and cancer.","225":"Tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through a complex series of events that are driven by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In particular, non-malignant stromal cells, including immune cells, modify tumor metastatic behavior. Of these cells, tumor-associated innate immune cells, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, suppress the cytotoxic activity of innate and adaptive killer cells and interact with tumor cells to promote their growth and malignancy. These findings in mouse cancer models suggest that targeting these sub-populations of immune cells holds therapeutic promise in treating metastatic disease. In this review, we describe the origin and role of the macrophages, neutrophils, and their progenitors in the metastatic cascade and suggest strategies that might enhance cancer therapy.","226":null,"227":null,"228":null,"229":null,"230":null,"231":null,"232":null,"233":"Blockade of the inhibitory receptor TIM-3 shows efficacy in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials. TIM-3 inhibits production of the chemokine CXCL9 by XCR1+ classical dendritic cells (cDC1), thereby limiting antitumor immunity in mammary carcinomas. We found that increased CXCL9 expression by splenic cDC1s upon TIM-3 blockade required type I interferons and extracellular DNA. Chemokine expression as well as combinatorial efficacy of TIM-3 blockade and paclitaxel chemotherapy were impaired by deletion of Cgas and Sting. TIM-3 blockade increased uptake of extracellular DNA by cDC1 through an endocytic process that resulted in cytoplasmic localization. DNA uptake and efficacy of TIM-3 blockade required DNA binding by HMGB1, while galectin-9-induced cell surface clustering of TIM-3 was necessary for its suppressive function. Human peripheral blood cDC1s also took up extracellular DNA upon TIM-3 blockade. Thus, TIM-3 regulates endocytosis of extracellular DNA and activation of the cytoplasmic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway in cDC1s, with implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying TIM-3 immunotherapy.","234":null,"235":null,"236":null,"237":null,"238":"The sympathetic nervous system is composed of an endocrine arm, regulating blood adrenaline and noradrenaline, and a local arm, a network of fibers innervating immune organs.

Intra-rectal insertion of an optogenetic probe in mice engineered to express channelrhodopsin-2 in tyrosine hydroxylase cells activated colonic sympathetic fibers. In contrast to systemic application of noradrenaline, local activation of sympathetic fibers attenuated experimental colitis and reduced immune cell abundance. Gene expression profiling showed decreased endothelial expression of the adhesion molecule MAdCAM-1 upon optogenetic stimulation; this decrease was sensitive to adrenergic blockers and 6-hydroxydopamine. Antibody blockade of MAdCAM-1 abrogated the optogenetic effect on immune cell extravasation into the colon and the pathology. Thus, sympathetic fibers control colonic inflammation by regulating immune cell extravasation from circulation, a mechanism likely relevant in multiple organs.","239":"The transcription factor Foxp3 plays crucial roles for Treg cell development and function. Conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) at the Foxp3 locus control Foxp3 transcription, but how they developmentally contribute to Treg cell lineage specification remains obscure. Here, we show that among Foxp3 CNSs, the promoter-upstream CNS0 and the intergenic CNS3, which bind distinct transcription factors, were activated at early stages of thymocyte differentiation prior to Foxp3 promoter activation, with sequential genomic looping bridging these regions and the promoter. While deletion of either CNS0 or CNS3 partially compromised thymic Treg cell generation, deletion of both completely abrogated the generation and impaired the stability of Foxp3 expression in residual Treg cells. As a result, CNS0 and CNS3 double-deleted mice succumbed to lethal systemic autoimmunity and inflammation. Thus, hierarchical and coordinated activation of Foxp3 CNS0 and CNS3 initiates and stabilizes Foxp3 gene expression, thereby crucially controlling Treg cell development, maintenance, and consequently immunological self-tolerance.","240":null,"241":"A cardinal feature of COVID-19 is lung inflammation and respiratory failure. In a prospective multi-country cohort of COVID-19 patients, we found that increased Notch4 expression on circulating regulatory T (Treg) cells was associated with disease severity, predicted mortality, and declined upon recovery. Deletion of Notch4 in Treg cells or therapy with anti-Notch4 antibodies in conventional and humanized mice normalized the dysregulated innate immunity and rescued disease morbidity and mortality induced by a synthetic analog of viral RNA or by influenza H1N1 virus. Mechanistically, Notch4 suppressed the induction by interleukin-18 of amphiregulin, a cytokine necessary for tissue repair. Protection by Notch4 inhibition was recapitulated by therapy with Amphiregulin and, reciprocally, abrogated by its antagonism. Amphiregulin declined in COVID-19 subjects as a function of disease severity and Notch4 expression. Thus, Notch4 expression on Treg cells dynamically restrains amphiregulin-dependent tissue repair to promote severe lung inflammation, with therapeutic implications for COVID-19 and related infections.","242":null,"243":null,"244":"Despite advances in single-cell multi-omics, a single stem or progenitor cell can only be tested once.

We identified, and then validated using CRISPR, genes that controlled fate bias for different dendritic cell (DC) subtypes. This included Bcor as a suppressor of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC type 2 (cDC2) numbers during Flt3 ligand-mediated emergency DC development. We then developed SIS-skew to examine development of wild-type and Bcor-deficient siblings of the same clone in parallel. We found Bcor restricted clonal expansion, especially for cDC2s, and suppressed clonal fate potential, especially for pDCs. Therefore, SIS-seq and SIS-skew can reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing clonal fate.","245":null,"246":"Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP (cGAMP) sensor STING requires its translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and subsequent polymerization. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to define factors critical for STING activation in cells, we identified proteins critical for biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in the Golgi apparatus. Binding of sGAGs promoted STING polymerization through luminal, positively charged, polar residues. These residues are evolutionarily conserved, and selective mutation of specific residues inhibited STING activation. Purified or chemically synthesized sGAGs induced STING polymerization and activation of the kinase TBK1. The chain length and O-linked sulfation of sGAGs directly affected the level of STING polymerization and, therefore, its activation. Reducing the expression of Slc35b2 to inhibit GAG sulfation in mice impaired responses to vaccinia virus infection. Thus, sGAGs in the Golgi apparatus are necessary and sufficient to drive STING polymerization, providing a mechanistic understanding of the requirement for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi apparatus translocation for STING activation.","247":null,"248":null,"249":null,"250":null,"251":null,"252":null,"253":null,"254":null,"255":null,"256":"Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that regulate the migration of immune cells.

Due to the pleiotropic effects of IL-2R signaling, it is unclear how STAT5 acts directly on the Foxp3 locus to promote its expression. Here, we report that IL-2 - STAT5 signaling converged on an enhancer (CNS0) during Foxp3 induction. CNS0 facilitated the IL-2 dependent CD25+Foxp3- precursor to Treg cell transition in the thymus. Its deficiency resulted in impaired Treg cell generation in neonates, which was partially mitigated with age. While the thymic Treg cell paucity caused by CNS0 deficiency did not result in autoimmunity on its own, it exacerbated autoimmune manifestations caused by disruption of the Aire gene. Thus, CNS0 enhancer activity ensures robust Treg cell differentiation early in postnatal life and cooperatively with other tolerance mechanisms minimizes autoimmunity.","258":null,"259":"An effective vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an unrealized public health goal. A single dose of the prefusion-stabilized fusion (F) glycoprotein subunit vaccine (DS-Cav1) substantially increases serum-neutralizing activity in healthy adults.

We evaluated RSV F-specific B cell responses before and after vaccination in six participants using complementary B cell sequencing methodologies and identified 555 clonal lineages. DS-Cav1-induced lineages recognized the prefusion conformation of F (pre-F) and were genetically diverse. Expressed antibodies recognized all six antigenic sites on the pre-F trimer. We identified 34 public clonotypes, and structural analysis of two antibodies from a predominant clonotype revealed a common mode of recognition. Thus, vaccination with DS-Cav1 generates a diverse polyclonal response targeting the antigenic sites on pre-F, supporting the development and advanced testing of pre-F-based vaccines against RSV.","260":"Murine regulatory T (Treg) cells in tissues promote tissue homeostasis and regeneration. We sought to identify features that characterize human Treg cells with these functions in healthy tissues. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of murine and human tissue Treg cells defined a conserved, microbiota-independent tissue-repair Treg signature with a prevailing footprint of the transcription factor BATF. This signature, combined with gene expression profiling and TCR fate mapping, identified a population of tissue-like Treg cells in human peripheral blood that expressed BATF, chemokine receptor CCR8 and HLA-DR. Human BATF+CCR8+ Treg cells from normal skin and adipose tissue shared features with nonlymphoid T follicular helper-like (Tfh-like) cells, and induction of a Tfh-like differentiation program in naive human Treg cells partially recapitulated tissue Treg regenerative characteristics, including wound healing potential. Human BATF+CCR8+ Treg cells from healthy tissue share features with tumor-resident Treg cells, highlighting the importance of understanding the context-specific functions of these cells.","261":null,"262":null,"263":"Viral infections induce a conserved host response distinct from bacterial infections.

Severe viral infection was associated with increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We identified protective and detrimental gene modules that defined distinct trajectories associated with mild versus severe outcomes. The interferon response was decoupled from the protective host response in patients with severe outcomes. These findings were consistent, irrespective of age and virus, and provide insights to accelerate the development of diagnostics and host-directed therapies to improve global pandemic preparedness.","264":null,"265":"Immune cells identify and destroy tumors by recognizing cellular traits indicative of oncogenic transformation.

This immunosurveillance phenotype was further enhanced by treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies. We also observed that high MRTF signaling in human melanoma is associated with ICB efficacy in patients. Using biophysical and functional assays, we showed that MRTF overexpression rigidified the filamentous actin cytoskeleton and that this mechanical change rendered mouse and human cancer cells more vulnerable to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Collectively, these results suggest that immunosurveillance has a mechanical dimension, which we call mechanosurveillance, that is particularly relevant for the targeting of metastatic disease.","266":null,"267":null,"268":null,"269":null,"270":null,"271":"Autophagy is a quality-control, metabolic, and innate immunity process.

As a cytoplasmic degradative pathway, autophagy protects from exogenous hazards, including infection, and from endogenous sources of inflammation, including molecular aggregates and damaged organelles. The focus of this review is on the role of autophagy in inflammation, including type I interferon responses and inflammasome outputs, from molecules to immune cells.

Myeloid cells mediated the pro-resolution function of Dectin-1 in EAE with enhanced gene expression of the neuroprotective molecule, Oncostatin M (Osm), through a Card9-independent pathway, mediated by the transcription factor NFAT. Furthermore, we find that the Osm receptor (OsmR) functioned specifically in astrocytes to reduce EAE severity. Notably, Dectin-1 did not respond to heat-killed Mycobacteria, an adjuvant to induce EAE. Instead, endogenous Dectin-1 ligands, including galectin-9, in the central nervous system (CNS) were involved to limit EAE. Our study reveals a mechanism of beneficial myeloid cell-astrocyte crosstalk regulated by a Dectin-1 pathway and identifies potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune neuroinflammation.","289":null,"290":"","291":"","292":null,"293":"Astrocytes play both physiological and pathological roles in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) function.

Our goal is to stimulate inquiry into how these molecular identifiers link to specific functional changes in astrocytes and to define the implications of these heterogeneous molecular and functional changes in brain function and pathology.

It is also known to improve outcomes in sepsis, a leading cause of mortality resulted from infection-induced immune dysfunction. Whereas it is relatively clear how heparin exerts its anticoagulant effect, the immunomodulatory mechanisms enabled by heparin remain enigmatic. Here, we show that heparin prevented caspase-11-dependent immune responses and lethality in sepsis independent of its anticoagulant properties. Heparin or a chemically modified form of heparin without anticoagulant function inhibited the alarmin HMGB1-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction and prevented the macrophage glycocalyx degradation by heparanase. These events blocked the cytosolic delivery of LPS in macrophages and the activation of caspase-11, a cytosolic LPS receptor that mediates lethality in sepsis. Survival was higher in septic patients treated with heparin than those without heparin treatment. The identification of this previously unrecognized heparin function establishes a link between innate immune responses and coagulation.","301":null,"302":"Immunological memory is a mechanism to protect us against reinfection.

Here, we demonstrated that MC-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was crucial for neutrophil extravasation to sites of contact hypersensitivity-induced skin inflammation by promoting intraluminal crawling. MC-derived TNF directly primed circulating neutrophils via TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) while being dispensable for endothelial cell activation. The MC-derived TNF was infused into the bloodstream by directional degranulation of perivascular MCs that were part of the vascular unit with access to the vessel lumen. Consistently, intravenous administration of MC granules boosted neutrophil extravasation. Pronounced and rapid intravascular MC degranulation was also observed upon IgE crosslinking or LPs challenge indicating a universal MC potential. Consequently, the directional MC degranulation of pro-inflammatory mediators into the bloodstream may represent an important target for therapeutic approaches aimed at dampening cytokine storm syndromes or shock symptoms, or intentionally pushing immune defense.","305":"Definition of the specific germline immunoglobulin (Ig) alleles present in an individual is a critical first step to delineate the ontogeny and evolution of antigen-specific antibody responses. Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are important animal models for pre-clinical studies, with four main sub-groups being used: Indian- and Chinese-origin rhesus macaques and Mauritian and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques. We applied the (Ig) gene inference tool IgDiscover and performed extensive Sanger sequencing-based genomic validation to define germline VDJ alleles in these 4 sub-groups, comprising 45 macaques in total. There was allelic overlap between Chinese- and Indian-origin rhesus macaques and also between the two macaque species, which is consistent with substantial admixture. The island-restricted Mauritian cynomolgus population displayed the lowest number of alleles of the sub-groups, yet maintained high individual allelic diversity. These comprehensive databases of germline IGH alleles for rhesus and cynomolgus macaques provide a resource toward the study of B cell responses in these important pre-clinical models.","306":"Microglia are activated in many neurological diseases and have been suggested to play an important role in the development of affective disorders including major depression. To investigate how microglial signaling regulates mood, we used bidirectional chemogenetic manipulations of microglial activity in mice. Activation of microglia in the dorsal striatum induced local cytokine expression and a negative affective state characterized by anhedonia and aversion, whereas inactivation of microglia blocked aversion induced by systemic inflammation. Interleukin-6 signaling and cyclooxygenase-1 mediated prostaglandin synthesis in the microglia were critical for the inflammation-induced aversion. Correspondingly, microglial activation led to a prostaglandin-dependent reduction of the excitability of striatal neurons. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which microglial activation causes negative affect through prostaglandin-dependent modulation of striatal neurons and indicate that interference with this mechanism could milden the depressive symptoms in somatic and psychiatric diseases involving microglial activation.","307":"Vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a key HIV-research goal. The VRC01 class of bnAbs targets the CD4-binding site on the HIV-envelope trimer and requires extensive somatic hypermutation (SHM) to neutralize effectively. Despite substantial progress, vaccine-induced VRC01-class antibodies starting from unmutated precursors have exhibited limited neutralization breadth, particularly against viruses bearing glycan on loop D residue N276 (glycan276), present on most circulating strains. Here, using sequential immunization of immunoglobulin (Ig)-humanized mice expressing diverse unmutated VRC01-class antibody precursors, we elicited serum responses capable of neutralizing viruses bearing glycan276 and isolated multiple lineages of VRC01-class bnAbs, including two with &gt;50% breadth on a 208-strain panel. Crystal structures of representative bnAbs revealed the same mode of recognition as known VRC01-class bnAbs. Structure-function studies further pinpointed key mutations and correlated their induction with specific immunizations. VRC01-class bnAbs can thus be matured by sequential immunization from unmutated ancestors to &gt;50% breadth, and we delineate immunogens and regimens inducing key SHM.","308":"The role of innate immune cells in allergen immunotherapy that confers immune tolerance to the sensitizing allergen is unclear. Here, we report a role of interleukin-10-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (IL-10+ ILC2s) in modulating grass-pollen allergy. We demonstrate that KLRG1+ but not KLRG1- ILC2 produced IL-10 upon activation with IL-33 and retinoic acid. These cells attenuated Th responses and maintained epithelial cell integrity. IL-10+ KLRG1+ ILC2s were lower in patients with grass-pollen allergy when compared to healthy subjects. In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we demonstrated that the competence of ILC2 to produce IL-10 was restored in patients who received grass-pollen sublingual immunotherapy. The underpinning mechanisms were associated with the modification of retinol metabolic pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways in the ILCs. Altogether, our findings underscore the contribution of IL-10+ ILC2s in the disease-modifying effect by allergen immunotherapy.","309":"The vaccine strain against smallpox, vaccinia virus (VACV), is highly immunogenic yet causes relatively benign disease. These attributes are believed to be caused by gene loss in VACV. Using a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we identified a viral inhibitor found in cowpox virus (CPXV) and other orthopoxviruses that bound to the host SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) machinery and the essential necroptosis kinase receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). This \"viral inducer of RIPK3 degradation\" (vIRD) triggered ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of RIPK3 and inhibited necroptosis. In contrast to orthopoxviruses, the distantly related leporipoxvirus myxoma virus (MYXV), which infects RIPK3-deficient hosts, lacks a functional vIRD. Introduction of vIRD into VACV, which encodes a truncated and defective vIRD, enhanced viral replication in mice. Deletion of vIRD reduced CPXV-induced inflammation, viral replication, and mortality, which were reversed in RIPK3- and MLKL-deficient mice. Hence, vIRD-RIPK3 drives pathogen-host evolution and regulates virus-induced inflammation and pathogenesis.","310":null,"311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":null,"315":null,"316":null,"317":null,"318":null,"319":null,"320":null,"321":null,"322":"The developmental and molecular heterogeneity of tissue macrophages is unravelling, as are their diverse contributions to physiology and pathophysiology.

Here we examined the contribution of host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in viral immune evasion. By functional screening of lncRNAs whose expression decreased upon viral infection of macrophages, we identified a lncRNA (lncRNA-GM, Gene Symbol: AK189470.1) that promoted type I interferon (IFN-I) production and inhibited viral replication. Deficiency of lncRNA-GM in mice increased susceptibility to viral infection and impaired IFN-I production. Mechanistically, lncRNA-GM bound to glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and blocked GSTM1 interaction with the kinase TBK1, reducing GSTM1-mediated S-glutathionylation of TBK1. Decreased S-glutathionylation enhanced TBK1 activity and downstream production of antiviral mediators. Viral infection reprogrammed intracellular glutathione metabolism and furthermore, an oxidized glutathione mimetic could inhibit TBK1 activity and promote viral replication. Our findings reveal regulation of TBK1 by S-glutathionylation and provide insight into the viral mediated metabolic changes that impact innate immunity and viral evasion.","327":"Activated B cells participate in either extrafollicular (EF) or germinal center (GC) responses. Canonical responses are composed of a short wave of plasmablasts (PBs) arising from EF sites, followed by GC producing somatically mutated memory B cells (MBC) and long-lived plasma cells. However, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation can take place at both sites, and a substantial fraction of MBC are produced prior to GC formation. Infection responses range from GC responses that persist for months to persistent EF responses with dominant suppression of GCs. Here, we review the current understanding of the functional output of EF and GC responses and the molecular switches promoting them. We discuss the signals that regulate the magnitude and duration of these responses, and outline gaps in knowledge and important areas of inquiry. Understanding such molecular switches will be critical for vaccine development, interpretation of vaccine efficacy and the treatment for autoimmune diseases.","328":null,"329":null,"330":null,"331":null,"332":null,"333":"Temporal resolution of cellular features associated with a severe COVID-19 disease trajectory is needed for understanding skewed immune responses and defining predictors of outcome.

Validation was performed in two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 was characterized by an increase of proliferating, metabolically hyperactive plasmablasts. Coinciding with critical illness, we also identified an expansion of interferon-activated circulating megakaryocytes and increased erythropoiesis with features of hypoxic signaling. Megakaryocyte- and erythroid-cell-derived co-expression modules were predictive of fatal disease outcome.

Many licensed vaccines confer protection by inducing long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B cells (MBCs), cell types canonically generated during germinal center (GC) reactions. Here, we directly compared two vaccine platforms-mRNA vaccines and a recombinant protein formulated with an MF59-like adjuvant-looking for their abilities to quantitatively and qualitatively shape SARS-CoV-2-specific primary GC responses over time. We demonstrated that a single immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA, but not with the recombinant protein vaccine, elicited potent SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses as well as LLPCs and MBCs. Importantly, GC responses strongly correlated with neutralizing antibody production. mRNA vaccines more efficiently induced key regulators of the Tfh cell program and influenced the functional properties of Tfh cells. Overall, this study identifies SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines as strong candidates for promoting robust GC-derived immune responses.","336":"Various vaccine strategies have been proposed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, each with unique strategies for eliciting immune responses. Here, we developed nanoparticle vaccines by covalently conjugating the self-assembled 24-mer ferritin to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and\/or heptad repeat (HR) subunits of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. Compared to monomer vaccines, nanoparticle vaccines elicited more robust neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses. RBD and RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccinated hACE2 transgenic mice vaccinated with RBD and\/or RBD-HR nanoparticles exhibited reduced viral load in the lungs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. RBD-HR nanoparticle vaccines also promoted neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against other coronaviruses.

COVA1-16 binds a highly conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, mainly through a long complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3, and competes with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor because of steric hindrance rather than epitope overlap. COVA1-16 binds to a flexible up conformation of the RBD on the spike and relies on antibody avidity for neutralization. These findings, along with the structural and functional rationale for epitope conservation, provide insights for development of more universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines and therapies.","342":null,"343":"The last few years have witnessed an increasing body of evidence that challenges the traditional view that immunological memory is an exclusive trait of the adaptive immune system.

Trained immunity is based on two main pillars: the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of cells.

Rig-I or Mda5 deficiency reduced HSPC numbers by inhibiting inflammatory signals that were in turn enhanced in Lgp2 deficient embryos. Simultaneous reduction of Lgp2 and either Rig-I or Mda5 rescued inflammatory signals and HSPC numbers. Modulating the expression of the signaling mediator Traf6 in RLR deficient embryos restored HSPC numbers. Repetitive element transcripts could be detected in hemogenic endothelial cells and HSPCs, suggesting a role as RLR ligands. Indeed, ectopic expression of repetitive elements enhanced HSPC formation in wild-type, but not in Rig-I or Mda5 deficient embryos.

We developed a machine-learning-based pipeline to identify 11 proteins as biomarkers and a set of biomarker combinations, which were validated by an independent cohort and accurately distinguished and predicted COVID-19 outcomes. Some of the biomarkers were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a larger cohort. These markedly altered proteins, including the biomarkers, mediate pathophysiological pathways, such as immune or inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation and coagulation, and metabolism, that likely contribute to the pathogenesis.

Polyreactive mAbs were preferentially induced by novel viral exposures due to their broad viral binding breadth. Polyreactivity augmented mAb viral binding strength by increasing antibody flexibility, allowing for adaption to imperfectly conserved epitopes.

Using a liver-specific partial and acute deletion of Crif1, a critical mitoribosomal component for protein synthesis, we found that mice were protected against sepsis, an observation that was phenocopied by the transient inhibition of complex I of the ETC by phenformin.

To address this need, we created Seq-Well S3 (\"Second-Strand Synthesis\"), a massively parallel scRNA-seq protocol that uses a randomly primed second-strand synthesis to recover complementary DNA (cDNA) molecules that were successfully reverse transcribed but to which a second oligonucleotide handle, necessary for subsequent whole transcriptome amplification, was not appended due to inefficient template switching. Seq-Well S3 increased the efficiency of transcript capture and gene detection compared with that of previous iterations by up to 10- and 5-fold, respectively.

Conditional deletion of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) between heterologous challenges of West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, and dengue viruses did not affect recall responses. DIII-specific MBCs were contained mostly within the plasma-cell-biased CD80+ subset, and few GCs arose following heterologous boosters, demonstrating that recall responses are confined by preexisting clonal diversity. Measurement of monoclonal antibody (mAb) binding affinity to DIII proteins, timed AID deletion, single-cell RNA sequencing, and lineage tracing experiments point to selection of relatively low-affinity MBCs as a mechanism to promote diversity.

Recruited macrophages existed in two subsets with distinct activation states, either closely resembling homeostatic KCs or lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) from obese adipose tissue. Hepatic LAMs expressed Osteopontin, a biomarker for patients with NASH, linked with the development of fibrosis.

HTRA1 induced the persistence of monocytes in the subretinal space and exacerbated pathogenic inflammation by hydrolyzing thrombospondin 1 (TSP1), which separated the two CD47-binding sites within TSP1 that are necessary for efficient CD47 activation. This HTRA1-induced inhibition of CD47 signaling induced the expression of pro-inflammatory osteopontin (OPN). OPN expression increased in early monocyte-derived macrophages in 10q26 risk carriers.

Genes expressed commonly by cDC1 and cDC2 used EICE-dependent enhancers that were redundantly activated by low amounts of either IRF4 or IRF8. By contrast, cDC1-specific genes relied on AICE-dependent enhancers, which required high IRF concentrations, but were activated by either IRF4 or IRF8. IRF8 was specifically required only by a minority of cDC1-specific genes, such as Xcr1, which could distinguish between IRF8 and IRF4 DNA-binding domains. Thus, these results explain how BATF3-dependent Irf8 autoactivation underlies emergence of the cDC1-specific transcriptional program.","411":null,"412":null,"413":"As SARS-CoV-2 infections and death counts continue to rise, it remains unclear why some individuals recover from infection, whereas others rapidly progress and die. Although the immunological mechanisms that underlie different clinical trajectories remain poorly defined, pathogen-specific antibodies often point to immunological mechanisms of protection. Here, we profiled SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses in a cohort of 22 hospitalized individuals. Despite inter-individual heterogeneity, distinct antibody signatures resolved individuals with different outcomes. Although no differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels were observed, spike-specific humoral responses were enriched among convalescent individuals, whereas functional antibody responses to the nucleocapsid were elevated in deceased individuals. Furthermore, this enriched immunodominant spike-specific antibody profile in convalescents was confirmed in a larger validation cohort. These results demonstrate that early antigen-specific and qualitative features of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies point to differences in disease trajectory, highlighting the potential importance of functional antigen-specific humoral immunity to guide patient care and vaccine development.","414":null,"415":"CD47 acts as a \"don't eat me\" signal that protects cells from phagocytosis by binding and activating its receptor SIPRA on macrophages. CD47 suppresses multiple different pro-engulfment \"eat me\" signals, including immunoglobulin G (IgG), complement, and calreticulin, on distinct target cells. This complexity has limited understanding of how the \"don't eat me\" signal is transduced biochemically. Here, we utilized a reconstituted system with a defined set of signals to interrogate the mechanism of SIRPA activation and its downstream targets. CD47 ligation altered SIRPA localization, positioning SIRPA for activation at the phagocytic synapse. At the phagocytic synapse, SIRPA inhibited integrin activation to limit macrophage spreading across the surface of the engulfment target. Chemical reactivation of integrin bypassed CD47-mediated inhibition and rescued engulfment, similar to the effect of a CD47 function-blocking antibody. Thus, the CD47-SIRPA axis suppresses phagocytosis by inhibiting inside-out activation of integrin signaling in the macrophage, with implications to cancer immunotherapy applications.","416":null,"417":null,"418":"Autoinflammatory disease can result from monogenic errors of immunity. We describe a patient with early-onset multi-organ immune dysregulation resulting from a mosaic, gain-of-function mutation (S703I) in JAK1, encoding a kinase essential for signaling downstream of &gt;25 cytokines. By custom single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine mosaicism with single-cell resolution. We find that JAK1 transcription was predominantly restricted to a single allele across different cells, introducing the concept of a mutational \"transcriptotype\" that differs from the genotype. Functionally, the mutation increases JAK1 activity and transactivates partnering JAKs, independent of its catalytic domain. S703I JAK1 is not only hypermorphic for cytokine signaling but also neomorphic, as it enables signaling cascades not canonically mediated by JAK1. Given these results, the patient was treated with tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, leading to the rapid resolution of clinical disease. These findings offer a platform for personalized medicine with the concurrent discovery of fundamental biological principles.","419":null,"420":null,"421":"Psychological stress has adverse effects on various human diseases, including those of the cardiovascular system. However, the mechanisms by which stress influences disease activity remain unclear. Here, using vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) of sickle cell disease as a vascular disease model, we show that stress promotes VOEs by eliciting a glucocorticoid hormonal response that augments gut permeability, leading to microbiota-dependent interleukin-17A (IL-17A) secretion from T helper 17 (Th17) cells of the lamina propria, followed by the expansion of the circulating pool of aged neutrophils that trigger VOEs. We identify segmented filamentous bacteria as the commensal essential for the stress-induced expansion of aged neutrophils that enhance VOEs in mice. Importantly, the inhibition of glucocorticoids synthesis, blockade of IL-17A, or depletion of the Th17 cell-inducing gut microbiota markedly reduces stress-induced VOEs. These results offer potential therapeutic targets to limit the impact of psychological stress on acute vascular occlusion.","422":"Programmed cell death contributes to host defense against pathogens. To investigate the relative importance of pyroptosis, necroptosis, and apoptosis during Salmonella infection, we infected mice and macrophages deficient for diverse combinations of caspases-1, -11, -12, and -8 and receptor interacting serine\/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3). Loss of pyroptosis, caspase-8-driven apoptosis, or necroptosis had minor impact on Salmonella control. However, combined deficiency of these cell death pathways caused loss of bacterial control in mice and their macrophages, demonstrating that host defense can employ varying components of several cell death pathways to limit intracellular infections. This flexible use of distinct cell death pathways involved extensive cross-talk between initiators and effectors of pyroptosis and apoptosis, where initiator caspases-1 and -8 also functioned as executioners when all known effectors of cell death were absent. These findings uncover a highly coordinated and flexible cell death system with in-built fail-safe processes that protect the host from intracellular infections.","423":null,"424":null,"425":null,"426":null,"427":null,"428":"Innate immune sensors that detect nucleic acids are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention because of their diverse roles in many disease processes. In detecting RNA and DNA from either self or non-self, nucleic acid sensors mediate the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite promising pre-clinical data and investigational use in the clinic, relatively few drugs targeting nucleic acid sensors are approved for therapeutic use. Nevertheless, there is growing appreciation for the untapped potential of nucleic acid sensors as therapeutic targets, driven by the need for better therapies for cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. This review highlights the diverse mechanisms by which nucleic acid sensors are activated and exert their biological effects in the context of various disease settings. We discuss current therapeutic strategies utilizing agonists and antagonists targeting nucleic acid sensors to treat infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.","429":null,"430":"All lifeforms have developed highly sophisticated systems equipped to detect altered self and non-self nucleic acids (NA). In vertebrates, NA-sensing receptors safeguard the integrity of the organism by detecting pathogens, dyshomeostasis and damage, and inducing appropriate responses to eliminate pathogens and reconstitute homeostasis. Effector mechanisms include i) immune signaling, ii) restriction of NA functions such as inhibition of mRNA translation, and iii) cell death pathways. An appropriate effector response is necessary for host defense, but dysregulated NA-sensing can lead to devastating autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease. Their inherent biochemical similarity renders the reliable distinction between self NA under homeostatic conditions and altered or exogenous NA particularly challenging. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in our understanding of the closely coordinated and regulated network of innate immune receptors, restriction factors, and nucleases to effectively respond to pathogens and maintain host integrity.","431":"Besides its role as the blueprint of life, DNA can also alert the cell to the presence of microbial pathogens as well as damaged or malignant cells. A major sensor of DNA that triggers the innate immune response is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which produces the second messenger cGAMP. cGAMP activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which activates a signaling cascade leading to the production of type I interferons and other immune mediators. Recent research has demonstrated an expanding role of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in many physiological and pathological processes, including host defense against microbial infections, anti-tumor immunity, cellular senescence, autophagy, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Biochemical and structural studies have elucidated the mechanism of signal transduction in the cGAS pathway at the atomic resolution. This review focuses on the structural and mechanistic insights into the roles of cGAS and STING in immunity and diseases revealed by these recent studies.","432":"Faithful maintenance of immune homeostasis relies on the capacity of the cellular immune surveillance machinery to recognize \"nonself\", such as the presence of pathogenic RNA. Several families of pattern-recognition receptors exist that detect immunostimulatory RNA and then induce cytokine-mediated antiviral and proinflammatory responses. Here, we review the distinct features of bona fide RNA sensors, Toll-like receptors and retinoic-acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors in particular, with a focus on their functional specificity imposed by cell-type-dependent expression, subcellular localization, and ligand preference. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances on the roles of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors and DEAD-box or DEAH-box RNA helicases in an orchestrated RNA-sensing network and also discuss the relevance of RNA sensor polymorphisms in human disease.","433":"B cells are capable of a wide range of effector functions including antibody secretion, antigen presentation, cytokine production, and generation of immunological memory. A consistent strategy for classifying human B cells by using surface molecules is essential to harness this functional diversity for clinical translation. We developed a highly multiplexed screen to quantify the co-expression of 351 surface molecules on millions of human B cells. We identified differentially expressed molecules and aligned their variance with isotype usage, VDJ sequence, metabolic profile, biosynthesis activity, and signaling response. Based on these analyses, we propose a classification scheme to segregate B cells from four lymphoid tissues into twelve unique subsets, including a CD45RB+CD27- early memory population, a class-switched CD39+ tonsil-resident population, and a CD19hiCD11c+ memory population that potently responds to immune activation.

An interagency working group of the US Department of Health and Human Services convened a virtual workshop to identify knowledge gaps and key outstanding scientific issues and to develop strategies to fill them. Key outcomes of the workshop included recommendations for (1) advancing serology assays as a tool to better understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) conducting crucial serology field studies to advance an understanding of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, leading to protection and duration of protection, including the correlation between serological test results and risk of reinfection.","443":"The elevated circulating levels of cytokines associated with a variety of infectious and immune-mediated conditions are frequently termed a cytokine storm.

Although studies have proposed lineage heterogeneity within GMPs, it is unclear if committed progenitors already exist among these progenitors and how they may behave differently during inflammation. By combining single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we identified the early committed progenitor within the GMPs responsible for the strict production of neutrophils, which we designate as proNeu1. Our dissection of the GMP hierarchy led us to further identify a previously unknown intermediate proNeu2 population. Similar populations could be detected in human samples. proNeu1s, but not proNeu2s, selectively expanded during the early phase of sepsis at the expense of monocytes. Collectively, our findings help shape the neutrophil maturation trajectory roadmap and challenge the current definition of GMPs.","447":"Kupffer cells (KCs) are liver-resident macrophages that self-renew by proliferation in the adult independently from monocytes. However, how they are maintained during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains ill defined. We found that a fraction of KCs derived from Ly-6C+ monocytes during NASH, underlying impaired KC self-renewal. Monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) gradually seeded the KC pool as disease progressed in a response to embryo-derived KC (EmKC) death. Those MoKCs were partly immature and exhibited a pro-inflammatory status compared to EmKCs. Yet, they engrafted the KC pool for the long term as they remained following disease regression while acquiring mature EmKC markers. While KCs as a whole favored hepatic triglyceride storage during NASH, EmKCs promoted it more efficiently than MoKCs, and the latter exacerbated liver damage, highlighting functional differences among KCs with different origins. Overall, our data reveal that KC homeostasis is impaired during NASH, altering the liver response to lipids, as well as KC ontogeny.","448":"Located within red pulp cords, splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) are constantly exposed to the blood flow, clearing senescent red blood cells (RBCs) and recycling iron from hemoglobin. Here, we studied the mechanisms underlying RPM homeostasis, focusing on the involvement of stromal cells as these cells perform anchoring and nurturing macrophage niche functions in lymph nodes and liver. Microscopy revealed that RPMs are embedded in a reticular meshwork of red pulp fibroblasts characterized by the expression of the transcription factor Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Conditional deletion of Csf1 in WT1+ red pulp fibroblasts, but not white pulp fibroblasts, drastically altered the RPM network without altering circulating CSF1 levels. Upon RPM depletion, red pulp fibroblasts transiently produced the monocyte chemoattractants CCL2 and CCL7, thereby contributing to the replenishment of the RPM network. Thus, red pulp fibroblasts anchor and nurture RPM, a function likely conserved in humans.","449":null,"450":null,"451":null,"452":"Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) have a broad spectrum of immune- and non-immune-related tissue-supporting activities.

We review recent findings within this context and discuss the technological advances that are revolutionizing the study of macrophage biology.","453":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the sentinels of the immune system, sensing a diverse array of pathogens to stimulate a robust and appropriate immune response. To initiate responses to highly disparate challenges, DCs have diversified into multiple phenotypically, anatomically, and functionally distinct cell types. As a result of the application of new single-cell technologies, the full extent of this diversity, as well as the developmental relationships of the DC lineages, is currently undergoing reassessment. Here, we review the cellular and molecular evidence that underpins current models of DC differentiation and functional diversification in the murine and human systems. We discuss these models in the context of the diversity revealed by single-cell studies and propose that understanding DC identity will require defining the regulatory interactions that control gene expression in these cells.","454":null,"455":null,"456":null,"457":null,"458":null,"459":null,"460":null,"461":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide, igniting an unprecedented effort from the scientific community to understand the biological underpinning of COVID19 pathophysiology.

We found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with common autoimmune diseases were predominantly enriched in CpG demethylated regions (DRs) specifically present in naive Treg cells but much less enriched in activation-induced DRs common in Tconv and Treg cells. Naive Treg cell-specific DRs were largely included in Treg cell-specific super-enhancers and closely associated with transcription and other epigenetic changes in naive and effector Treg cells. Thus, naive Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation had a key role in controlling Treg cell-specific gene transcription and epigenetic modification. The results suggest possible contribution of altered function or development of natural Treg cells to the susceptibility to common autoimmune diseases.","484":"Tissue-resident and recruited macrophages contribute to both host defense and pathology. Multiple macrophage phenotypes are represented in diseased tissues, but we lack deep understanding of mechanisms controlling diversification. Here, we investigate origins and epigenetic trajectories of hepatic macrophages during diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The NASH diet induced significant changes in Kupffer cell enhancers and gene expression, resulting in partial loss of Kupffer cell identity, induction of Trem2 and Cd9 expression, and cell death. Kupffer cell loss was compensated by gain of adjacent monocyte-derived macrophages that exhibited convergent epigenomes, transcriptomes, and functions. NASH-induced changes in Kupffer cell enhancers were driven by AP-1 and EGR that reprogrammed LXR functions required for Kupffer cell identity and survival to instead drive a scar-associated macrophage phenotype. These findings reveal mechanisms by which disease-associated environmental signals instruct resident and recruited macrophages to acquire distinct gene expression programs and corresponding functions.","485":"Pathways controlling intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) death regulate gut immune homeostasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, we show that caspase-8 and its adapter FADD act in IECs to regulate intestinal inflammation downstream of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)- and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1)-mediated receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 signaling. Mice with IEC-specific FADD or caspase-8 deficiency developed colitis dependent on mixed lineage kinase-like (MLKL)-mediated epithelial cell necroptosis. However, MLKL deficiency fully prevented ileitis caused by epithelial caspase-8 ablation, but only partially ameliorated ileitis in mice lacking FADD in IECs. Our genetic studies revealed that caspase-8 and gasdermin-D (GSDMD) were both required for the development of MLKL-independent ileitis in mice with epithelial FADD deficiency. Therefore, FADD prevents intestinal inflammation downstream of ZBP1 and TNFR1 by inhibiting both MLKL-induced necroptosis and caspase-8-GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis-like death of epithelial cells.","486":"B cell subsets expressing the transcription factor T-bet are associated with humoral immune responses and autoimmunity. Here, we examined the anatomic distribution, clonal relationships, and functional properties of T-bet+ and T-bet- memory B cells (MBCs) in the context of the influenza-specific immune response. In mice, both T-bet- and T-bet+ hemagglutinin (HA)-specific B cells arose in germinal centers, acquired memory B cell markers, and persisted indefinitely. Lineage tracing and IgH repertoire analyses revealed minimal interconversion between T-bet- and T-bet+ MBCs, and parabionts showed differential tissue residency and recirculation properties. T-bet+ MBCs could be subdivided into recirculating T-betlo MBCs and spleen-resident T-bethi MBCs. Human MBCs displayed similar features. Conditional gene deletion studies revealed that T-bet expression in B cells was required for nearly all HA stalk-specific IgG2c antibodies and for durable neutralizing titers to influenza. Thus, T-bet expression distinguishes MBC subsets that have profoundly different homing, residency, and functional properties, and mediate distinct aspects of humoral immune memory.","487":null,"488":null,"489":null,"490":"","491":"The omentum is a visceral adipose tissue rich in fat-associated lymphoid clusters (FALCs) that collects peritoneal contaminants and provides a first layer of immunological defense within the abdomen.

Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial analysis of omental stromal cells revealed that the surface of FALCs were covered by CXCL1+ mesothelial cells, which we termed FALC cover cells. Blockade of CXCL1 inhibited the recruitment and aggregation of neutrophils at FALCs during zymosan-induced peritonitis. Inhibition of protein arginine deiminase 4, an enzyme important for the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, abolished neutrophil aggregation and the capture of peritoneal contaminants by omental FALCs. Analysis of omental samples from patients with acute appendicitis confirmed neutrophil recruitment and bacterial capture at FALCs. Thus, specialized omental mesothelial cells coordinate the recruitment and aggregation of neutrophils to capture peritoneal contaminants.","492":"Mucociliary clearance through coordinated ciliary beating is a major innate defense removing pathogens from the lower airways, but the pathogen sensing and downstream signaling mechanisms remain unclear. We identified virulence-associated formylated bacterial peptides that potently stimulated ciliary-driven transport in the mouse trachea. This innate response was independent of formyl peptide and taste receptors but depended on key taste transduction genes. Tracheal cholinergic chemosensory cells expressed these genes, and genetic ablation of these cells abrogated peptide-driven stimulation of mucociliary clearance. Trpm5-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection with a natural pathogen, and formylated bacterial peptides were detected in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Optogenetics and peptide stimulation revealed that ciliary beating was driven by paracrine cholinergic signaling from chemosensory to ciliated cells operating through muscarinic M3 receptors independently of nerves.

Here, we have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 associated with erythrocytes and co-cooperated with heme to promote the generation of mature RPMs through activation of the MyD88 adaptor protein and ERK1\/2 kinases downstream of the IL-33 receptor, IL1RL1. IL-33- and IL1RL1-deficient mice showed defective iron recycling and increased splenic iron deposition. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility studies revealed a role for GATA transcription factors downstream of IL-33 signaling during the development of pre-RPMs that retained full potential to differentiate into RPMs. Thus, IL-33 instructs the development of RPMs as a response to physiological erythrocyte damage with important implications to iron recycling and iron homeostasis.","503":"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play an important role in the control and maintenance of barrier immunity. However, chronic activation of ILCs results in immune-mediated pathology. Here, we show that tissue-resident type 2 ILCs (ILC2s) display a distinct metabolic signature upon chronic activation. In the context of allergen-driven airway inflammation, ILC2s increase their uptake of both external lipids and glucose. Externally acquired fatty acids are transiently stored in lipid droplets and converted into phospholipids to promote the proliferation of ILC2s. This metabolic program is imprinted by interleukin-33 (IL-33) and regulated by the genes Pparg and Dgat1, which are both controlled by glucose availability and mTOR signaling. Restricting dietary glucose by feeding mice a ketogenic diet largely ablated ILC2-mediated airway inflammation by impairing fatty acid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets. Together, these results reveal that pathogenic ILC2 responses require lipid metabolism and identify ketogenic diet as a potent intervention strategy to treat airway inflammation.","504":"SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, first emerged in late 2019 in China.

Vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic.

Segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatMs) are critical for the development of fibrosis. Here we examined the mechanisms that recruit SatMs to pre-fibrotic areas. A screen based on cytokine expression in the fibrotic lung revealed that the chemokine Cxcl12, which is produced by apoptotic nonhematopoietic cells, was essential for SatM recruitment. Analyses of lung tissues at fibrosis onset showed increased expression of Rbm7, a component of the nuclear exosome targeting complex. Rbm7 deletion suppressed bleomycin-induced fibrosis and at a cellular level, suppressed apoptosis of nonhematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, Rbm7 bound to noncoding (nc)RNAs that form subnuclear bodies, including Neat1 speckles. Dysregulated expression of Rbm7 resulted in the nuclear degradation of Neat1 speckles, the dispersion of the DNA repair protein BRCA1, and the triggering of apoptosis. Thus, Rbm7 in epithelial cells plays a critical role in the development of fibrosis by regulating ncRNA decay and thereby the production of chemokines that recruit SatMs.","508":null,"509":"Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, and IL-17A\/F heterodimers are key cytokines of the innate and adaptive immune response.

The receptor IL-17RC is thought to act in concert with IL-17RA to transduce IL-17A-, IL-17F-, and IL-17A\/F-mediated signals. We report the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of human IL-17RC in complex with IL-17F. In contrast to the expected model, we found that IL-17RC formed a symmetrical 2:1 complex with IL-17F, thus competing with IL-17RA for cytokine binding. Using biophysical techniques, we showed that IL-17A and IL-17A\/F also form 2:1 complexes with IL-17RC, suggesting the possibility of IL-17RA-independent IL-17 signaling pathways. The crystal structure of the IL-17RC:IL-17F complex provides a structural basis for IL-17F signaling through IL-17RC, with potential therapeutic applications for respiratory allergy and inflammatory bowel diseases.","510":"The ability of the nervous system to sense environmental stimuli and to relay these signals to immune cells via neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is indispensable for effective immunity and tissue homeostasis.

Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the complex interactions between the immune and the nervous systems in different tissues and contexts. We outline current gaps in knowledge and argue for the importance of considering infectious and inflammatory disease within a conceptual framework that integrates neuro-immune circuits both local and systemic, so as to better understand effective immunity to develop improved approaches to treat inflammation and disease.","511":"The intestines have the essential but challenging mission of absorbing nutrients, restricting damage from food-derived toxins, promoting colonization by symbionts, and expelling pathogens.

This indicated that the surviving endothelial cells in the penumbrium of the inflammatory injury were compromised in their regenerative capacity. In an experimental model of inflammatory lung injury, deletion of cGas in mice restored endothelial regeneration. The results suggest that targeting the endothelial Gasdermin D activated cGAS-YAP signaling pathway could serve as a potential strategy for restoring endothelial function after inflammatory injury.","519":"Helminths, allergens, and certain protists induce type 2 immune responses, but the underlying mechanisms of immune activation remain poorly understood. In the small intestine, chemosensing by epithelial tuft cells results in the activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), which subsequently drive increased tuft cell frequency. This feedforward circuit is essential for intestinal remodeling and helminth clearance. ILC2 activation requires tuft-cell-derived interleukin-25 (IL-25), but whether additional signals regulate the circuit is unclear. Here, we show that tuft cells secrete cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) to rapidly activate type 2 immunity following chemosensing of helminth infection. CysLTs cooperate with IL-25 to activate ILC2s, and tuft-cell-specific ablation of leukotriene synthesis attenuates type 2 immunity and delays helminth clearance. Conversely, cysLTs are dispensable for the tuft cell response induced by intestinal protists. Our findings identify an additional tuft cell effector function and suggest context-specific regulation of tuft-ILC2 circuits within the small intestine.","520":null,"521":"The intestine contains some of the most diverse and complex immune compartments in the body.

Flies lacking materazzi had higher hemolymph concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased lipid peroxidation. These flies also displayed Malpighian tubule dysfunction and were susceptible to infections and environmental stress. Feeding flies with antioxidants rescued the materazzi phenotype, indicating that the main role of Materazzi is to protect the organism from damage caused by stress-induced ROS. Our findings suggest that purging hemolymphatic lipids presents a physiological adaptation to protect host tissues from excessive ROS during immune and stress responses, a process that is likely to apply to other organisms.","525":"Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critical for lung defense against bacterial pneumonia in the neonatal period, but the signals that guide pulmonary ILC3 development remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that pulmonary ILC3s descended from ILC precursors that populated a niche defined by fibroblasts in the developing lung. Alveolar fibroblasts produced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), which instructed expansion and maturation of pulmonary ILC precursors. Conditional ablation of IGF1 in alveolar fibroblasts or deletion of the IGF-1 receptor from ILC precursors interrupted ILC3 biogenesis and rendered newborn mice susceptible to pneumonia. Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by interrupted postnatal alveolar development and increased morbidity to respiratory infections, had reduced IGF1 concentrations and pulmonary ILC3 numbers. These findings indicate that the newborn period is a critical window in pulmonary immunity development, and disrupted lung development in prematurely born infants may have enduring effects on host resistance to respiratory infections.","526":"Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Clinical features of asthma and its immunological and molecular etiology vary significantly among patients. An understanding of the complexities of asthma has evolved to the point where precision medicine approaches, including microbiome analysis, are being increasingly recognized as an important part of disease management. Lung and gut microbiota play several important roles in the development, regulation, and maintenance of healthy immune responses. Dysbiosis and subsequent dysregulation of microbiota-related immunological processes affect the onset of the disease, its clinical characteristics, and responses to treatment. Bacteria and viruses are the most extensively studied microorganisms relating to asthma pathogenesis, but other microbes, including fungi and even archaea, can potently influence airway inflammation. This review focuses on recently discovered connections between lung and gut microbiota, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea, and their influence on asthma.","527":null,"528":null,"529":null,"530":null,"531":null,"532":null,"533":"","534":"Mast cells are rare tissue-resident cells of importance to human allergies.

Proteome comparison between human and mouse suggested evolutionary conservation of core mast cell functions. In addition to specific proteases and proteins associated with degranulation and proteoglycan biosynthesis, mast cells expressed proteins potentially involved in interactions with neurons and neurotransmitter metabolism, including cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and G protein coupled receptors.

High-resolution structures revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions. Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520.

While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.

In a targeted screen of C-type lectin receptors, a Clec2d reporter responded to lysates from necrotic cells. Biochemical purification identified histones, both free and bound to nucleosomes or neutrophil extracellular traps, as Clec2d ligands. Clec2d recognized poly-basic sequences in histone tails and this recognition was sensitive to post-translational modifications of these sequences. As compared with WT mice, Clec2d-\/- mice exhibited reduced proinflammatory responses to injected histones, and less tissue damage and improved survival in a hepatotoxic injury model. In macrophages, Clec2d localized to the plasma membrane and endosomes. Histone binding to Clec2d did not stimulate kinase activation or cytokine production. Rather, histone-bound DNA stimulated endosomal Tlr9-dependent responses in a Clec2d-dependent manner. Thus, Clec2d binds to histones released upon necrotic cell death, with functional consequences to inflammation and tissue damage.","565":"Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation induces inflammatory responses in macrophages by activating temporally defined transcriptional cascades. Whether concurrent changes in the cellular metabolism that occur upon TLR activation influence the quality of the transcriptional responses remains unknown. Here, we investigated how macrophages adopt their metabolism early after activation to regulate TLR-inducible gene induction. Shortly after TLR4 activation, macrophages increased glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle volume. Metabolic tracing studies revealed that TLR signaling redirected metabolic fluxes to generate acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) from glucose resulting in augmented histone acetylation. Signaling through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF resulted in activation of ATP-citrate lyase, which in turn facilitated the induction of distinct LPS-inducible gene sets. We postulate that metabolic licensing of histone acetylation provides another layer of control that serves to fine-tune transcriptional responses downstream of TLR activation.

Because Ehrlichia prominently infects the liver, we investigated the nature of liver B cell response and that of the spleen. B cells within infected livers proliferated and underwent somatic hypermutation (SHM). Vh-region sequencing revealed trafficking of clones between the spleen and liver and often subsequent local clonal expansion and intraparenchymal localization of T-bet+ MBCs. T-bet+ MBCs expressed MBC subset markers CD80 and PD-L2. Many T-bet+ MBCs lacked CD11b or CD11c expression but had marginal zone (MZ) B cell phenotypes and colonized the splenic MZ, revealing T-bet+ MBC plasticity. Hence, liver and spleen are generative sites of B cell responses, and they include V-region mutation and result in liver MBC localization.","586":"The elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer remains a major vaccine challenge. Most cross-conserved protein determinants are occluded by self-N-glycan shielding, limiting B cell recognition of the underlying polypeptide surface. The exceptions to the contiguous glycan shield include the conserved receptor CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and glycoprotein (gp)41 elements proximal to the furin cleavage site. Accordingly, we performed heterologous trimer-liposome prime:boosting in rabbits to drive B cells specific for cross-conserved sites. To preferentially expose the CD4bs to B cells, we eliminated proximal N-glycans while maintaining the native-like state of the cleavage-independent NFL trimers, followed by gradual N-glycan restoration coupled with heterologous boosting. This approach successfully elicited CD4bs-directed, cross-neutralizing Abs, including one targeting a unique glycan-protein epitope and a bNAb (87% breadth) directed to the gp120:gp41 interface, both resolved by high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy.

However, the metabolite-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate colonic ILC3s remain poorly understood.

Deficiency of Ffar2 in ILC3s decreased their in situ proliferation and ILC3-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) production. This led to impaired gut epithelial function characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to colonic injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22+ CCR6+ ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in colonic lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis.

Drosophila deficient for the transcription factor Klf15 (Klf15NN) are viable but lack nephrocytes-cells structurally and functionally homologous to the glomerular podocytes of the kidney. We found that Klf15NN flies were more resistant to infection than wild-type (WT) counterparts but exhibited a shortened lifespan. This was associated with constitutive Toll pathway activation triggered by excess peptidoglycan circulating in Klf15NN flies. In WT flies, peptidoglycan was removed from systemic circulation by nephrocytes through endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation.

To test this, we generated transgenic mice with human CDRH3 diversity but simultaneously constrained to individual user-defined human immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain (VH) genes, including IGHV1-69, which shows biased usage in human bnAbs targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of group 1 influenza A viruses. Sequential immunization with a stalk-only hemagglutinin nanoparticle elicited group 1 bnAbs, but only in IGHV1-69 mice. This VH-endowed response required minimal affinity maturation, was elicited alongside pre-existing influenza immunity, and when IGHV1-69 B cells were diluted to match the frequency measured in humans.

We posit that upstream regulatory proteins, classically known as pattern-recognition receptors, operate to assess infectious and non-infectious threats to the host. Threat assessment is achieved through two general strategies: (1) direct binding of receptors to microbial or host-derived ligands or (2) indirect detection of changes in cellular homeostasis.

These macrophages expressed a pro-inflammatory signature, localized to the aorta, and dynamically interacted with nascent and emerging intra-aortic hematopoietic cells (IAHCs). Importantly, upon macrophage depletion, no adult-repopulating HSCs were detected, thus implicating a role for pro-inflammatory AGM-associated macrophages in regulating the development of HSCs.","687":null,"688":"The perinatal period is a critical window for distribution of innate tissue-resident immune cells within developing organs. Despite epidemiologic evidence implicating the early-life environment in the risk for allergy, temporally controlled lineage tracing of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) during this period remains unstudied. Using complementary fate-mapping approaches and reporters for ILC2 activation, we show that ILC2s appeared in multiple organs during late gestation like tissue macrophages, but, unlike the latter, a majority of peripheral ILC2 pools were generated de novo during the postnatal window. This period was accompanied by systemic ILC2 priming and acquisition of tissue-specific transcriptomes. Although perinatal ILC2s were variably replaced across tissues with age, the dramatic increases in tissue ILC2s following helminth infection were mediated through local expansion independent of de novo generation by bone marrow hematopoiesis. We provide comprehensive temporally controlled fate mapping of an innate lymphocyte subset with notable nuances as compared to tissue macrophage ontogeny.","689":null,"690":null,"691":"Nearly every tissue in the body undergoes routine turnover of cells as part of normal healthy living.

Perturbed clearance arises for many reasons, including overwhelming of the clearance machinery, disruptions at different stages of efferocytosis, and responses of phagocytes during efferocytosis, all of which can alter the homeostatic tissue environment.

Following inflammasome activation, pyroptotic macrophages released tissue factor (TF), an essential initiator of coagulation cascades. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TF abolishes inflammasome-mediated blood clotting and protects against death.

Tape stripping mouse skin, a surrogate for scratching, caused expansion and activation of small intestinal MCs, increased intestinal permeability, and promoted food anaphylaxis in sensitized mice. Tape stripping caused keratinocytes to systemically release interleukin-33 (IL-33), which synergized with intestinal tuft-cell-derived IL-25 to drive the expansion and activation of intestinal type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). These provided IL-4, which targeted MCs to expand in the intestine. Duodenal MCs were expanded in AD.

Here we discuss the progression of IBD from the perspective of remodeling of cytokine networks. We place well-established and under-studied cytokine modules in the context of cellular interactions, their dynamic regulation in early and late stages of disease (i.e., fibrosis), and their current and potential use in the clinic.

Here, we review the cytokine networks driving asthma, placing these in cellular context and incorporating insights from cytokine-targeting therapies in the clinic.

IL-10 family cytokines exert essential functions to maintain tissue homeostasis during infection and inflammation through restriction of excessive inflammatory responses, upregulation of innate immunity, and promotion of tissue repairing mechanisms. Their important functions in diseases are supported by data from many preclinical models, human genetic studies, and clinical interventions.

The mechanisms that determine functional redundancies and distinctions are not completely understood. Yet, research has clarified the role of IL-6 family cytokines in autoimmune diseases and has led to effective therapies that target them.

NLRC3 is a negative regulator that attenuates type I interferon (IFN-I) response by sequestering and attenuating stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation.

Microglia in these niches differed in their interleukin-34 dependency and functional contribution to visual-information processing. During certain retinal-degeneration models, microglia from both pools relocated to the subretinal space, an inducible disease-associated niche that was poorly accessible to monocyte-derived cells. This microglial transition involved transcriptional reprogramming of microglia, characterized by reduced expression of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. This transition was associated with protection of the retinal pigmented epithelium from damage caused by disease.

This approach enabled the isolation of antibodies from all peripheral B cell subsets and revealed the anti-BK virus antibody repertoire as clonally complex with respect to immunoglobulin sequences and isotypes (both IgM and IgG), including a high frequency of monoclonal antibodies that broadly neutralize BK virus subtypes and the related JC polyomavirus. Cryo-electron microscopy of a broadly neutralizing IgG single-chain variable fragment complexed with BK virus-like particles revealed the quaternary nature of a conserved viral epitope at the junction between capsid pentamers.

Analysis of resting tissues from these mice, and mice deficient in each individual receptor, provides clear evidence for redundant use of these receptors in establishing tissue-resident monocytic cell populations. In contrast, analysis of cellular recruitment to inflamed sites provides evidence of specificity of receptor use for distinct leukocyte subtypes and no indication of comprehensive redundancy.

In contrast to mice, human ILCs are less strictly compartmentalized and tissue localization selectively impacts ILC distribution in a subset-dependent manner. Tissue-specific distinctions are particularly apparent for ILC1 populations, whose distribution was markedly altered in obesity or aging.

The gene Bmal1 regulated expression of the chemokine CXCL2 to induce chemokine receptor CXCR2-dependent diurnal changes in the transcriptional and migratory properties of circulating neutrophils. These diurnal alterations, referred to as neutrophil aging, were antagonized by CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) and regulated the outer topology of neutrophils to favor homeostatic egress from blood vessels at night, resulting in boosted anti-microbial activity in tissues. Mice engineered for constitutive neutrophil aging became resistant to infection, but the persistence of intravascular aged neutrophils predisposed them to thrombo-inflammation and death.

Here, we mapped how all possible single amino acid mutations in Env affect neutralization of HIV by nine bnAbs targeting five epitopes. For most bnAbs, mutations at only a small fraction of structurally defined contact sites mediated escape, and most escape occurred at sites near, but not in direct contact with, the antibody. The Env mutations selected by two pooled bnAbs were similar to those expected from the combination of the bnAbs's independent action.

We found that endothelial IL-1R1 was necessary and sufficient for mediating sickness behavior and drove leukocyte recruitment to the CNS and impaired neurogenesis, whereas ventricular IL-1R1 was critical for monocyte recruitment to the CNS. Although microglia did not express IL-1R1, IL-1 stimulation of endothelial cells led to the induction of IL-1 in microglia.

We found that neuronal ZIKV infection activated the nucleotide sensor ZBP1 and the kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, core components of virus-induced necroptotic cell death signaling. However, activation of this pathway in ZIKV-infected neurons did not induce cell death. Rather, RIPK signaling restricted viral replication by altering cellular metabolism via upregulation of the enzyme IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate. Itaconate inhibited the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes.

In Oasl2-\/- mice and OASL-deficient human cells, DNA viruses such as vaccinia, herpes simplex, and adenovirus induced increased IFN production, which resulted in reduced virus replication and pathology. Correspondingly, ectopic expression of OASL in human cells inhibited IFN induction through the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing pathway. cGAS was necessary for the reduced DNA virus replication observed in OASL-deficient cells. OASL directly and specifically bound to cGAS independently of double-stranded DNA, resulting in a non-competitive inhibition of the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP production.

Rdh7 expression and associated RA amounts were lower in the intestinal tissue of conventional mice, as compared to germ-free mice. Deletion of Rdh7 in IECs diminished RA signaling in immune cells, reduced the IL-22-dependent antimicrobial response, and enhanced resistance to colonization by Salmonella Typhimurium.

Instead, apoptosis was triggered preferentially in late G1, a stage wherein cells with functional BCRs re-entered cell cycle or reduced surface expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 to enable LZ migration. Ectopic expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 was not sufficient for cells with damaging mutations to reach the LZ, suggesting that BCR-dependent cues may actively facilitate the transition.

We discuss immune responses that are necessary to promote healthy pregnancy and those that lead to congenital disorders and pregnancy complications, with a particular emphasis on the role of interferons and cytokines.

Hundreds of endogenous microbial compounds penetrated 23 host tissues and fluids after intestinal exposure: subsequent 12C host metabolome signatures included lipidemia, reduced glycolysis, and inflammation.

To evaluate conformational landscapes of ligand-free, CD4-bound, inhibitor-bound, and antibody-bound SOSIPs, we measured inter-subunit distances throughout spin-labeled SOSIPs using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and compared results to soluble and virion-bound Env structures, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-derived dynamics of virion-bound Envs. Unliganded SOSIP measurements were consistent with closed, neutralizing antibody-bound structures and shielding of non-neutralizing epitopes, demonstrating homogeneity at Env apex, increased flexibility near Env base, and no evidence for the intra-subunit flexibility near Env apex suggested by smFRET.

Moreover, impaired pTreg cell generation led to pervasive changes in metabolite profiles, altered features of the intestinal epithelium, and reduced body weight in the presence of commensal microbes. Absence of a single species of bacteria depleted in pTreg cell-deficient animals, Mucispirillum schaedleri, partially accounted for the sequelae of pTreg cell deficiency.

In murine models of sepsis, conditions that promoted cell hyperactivation resulted in inflammation but not lethality.

We studied the earliest mycobacterium-macrophage interactions in the optically transparent zebrafish. First-responding resident macrophages phagocytosed and eradicated infecting mycobacteria, suggesting that to establish a successful infection, mycobacteria must escape out of the initially infected resident macrophage into growth-permissive monocytes. We defined a critical role for mycobacterial membrane phenolic glycolipid (PGL) in engineering this transition. PGL activated the STING cytosolic sensing pathway in resident macrophages, inducing the production of the chemokine CCL2, which in turn recruited circulating CCR2+ monocytes toward infection. Transient fusion of infected macrophages with CCR2+ monocytes enabled bacterial transfer and subsequent dissemination, and interrupting this transfer so as to prolong mycobacterial sojourn in resident macrophages promoted clearing of infection. Human alveolar macrophages produced CCL2 in a PGL-dependent fashion following infection, arguing for the potential of PGL-blocking interventions or PGL-targeting vaccine strategies in the prevention of tuberculosis. VIDEO ABSTRACT.","1161":"The liver is positioned at the interface between two routes traversed by pathogens in disseminating infection. Whereas blood-borne pathogens are efficiently cleared in hepatic sinusoids by Kupffer cells (KCs), it is unknown how the liver prevents dissemination of peritoneal pathogens accessing its outer membrane. We report here that the hepatic capsule harbors a contiguous cellular network of liver-resident macrophages phenotypically distinct from KCs. These liver capsular macrophages (LCMs) were replenished in the steady state from blood monocytes, unlike KCs that are embryonically derived and self-renewing. LCM numbers increased after weaning in a microbiota-dependent process. LCMs sensed peritoneal bacteria and promoted neutrophil recruitment to the capsule, and their specific ablation resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment and increased intrahepatic bacterial burden. Thus, the liver contains two separate and non-overlapping niches occupied by distinct resident macrophage populations mediating immunosurveillance at these two pathogen entry points to the liver.","1162":null,"1163":"Select humans and animals control persistent viral infections via adaptive immune responses that include production of neutralizing antibodies.

It encodes the beta subunit of the non-classical major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-like molecule H2-O, a negative regulator of antigen presentation. The recessive and functionally null I\/LnJ H2-Ob allele supported the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies independently of the classical MHC haplotype. Subsequent bioinformatics and functional analyses of the human H2-Ob homolog, HLA-DOB, revealed both loss- and gain-of-function alleles, which could affect the ability of their carriers to control infections with human hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses.

This role was exerted on two quantitative grades: a constitutive one independent of RIPK3, and an enhanced one, triggered by RIPK3, where the association of MLKL with the endosomes was enhanced, and it was found to bind endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins and the flotillins and to be excluded, together with them, from cells within vesicles.

When the 3A-mediated RNAi suppression was impaired, the mutant HEV71 readily triggered the production of abundant HEV71-derived small RNAs with canonical siRNA properties in cells and mice. These virus-derived siRNAs were produced from viral dsRNA replicative intermediates in a Dicer-dependent manner and loaded into AGO, and they were fully active in degrading cognate viral RNAs. Recombinant HEV71 deficient in 3A-mediated RNAi suppression was significantly restricted in human somatic cells and mice, whereas Dicer deficiency rescued HEV71 infection independently of type I interferon response.

Here we review the history of public-data reuse and argue for greater incorporation of computational and statistical sciences into the biomedical education curriculum and the development of biologist-friendly crowdsourcing tools. Finally, we provide a resource list for the reuse of public data and highlight an illustrative crowdsourcing exercise to explore public gene-expression data of human autoimmune diseases and corresponding mouse models.

CD148 loss-of-function mice were found to have defective B1 B-cell-mediated antibody responses against the T-cell-independent antigens NP-ficoll and Pneumovax 23 and had impaired selection of the B1 B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. These deficiencies were associated with a decreased ability of B1 B cells to induce BCR signaling downstream of the SFK Lyn.

Here, using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, we found that mycobacterial granuloma formation is accompanied by macrophage induction of canonical epithelial molecules and structures. We identified fundamental macrophage reprogramming events that parallel E-cadherin-dependent mesenchymal-epithelial transitions. Macrophage-specific disruption of E-cadherin function resulted in disordered granuloma formation, enhanced immune cell access, decreased bacterial burden, and increased host survival, suggesting that the granuloma can also serve a bacteria-protective role.

Coordinate expression of genes that specify the GC B cell phenotype-most prominently BCL6-was achieved through a multilayered chromatin reorganization process involving (1) increased promoter connectivity, (2) formation of enhancer networks, (3) 5' to 3' gene looping, and (4) merging of gene neighborhoods that share active epigenetic marks. BCL6 was an anchor point for the formation of GC-specific gene and enhancer loops on chromosome 3.

We determined that SFB, by driving differentiation and egress of PP Tfh cells into systemic sites, boosted systemic Tfh cell and auto-antibody responses that exacerbated arthritis. SFB induced PP Tfh cell differentiation by limiting the access of interleukin 2 to CD4(+) T cells, thereby enhancing Tfh cell master regulator Bcl-6 in a dendritic cell-dependent manner.

Mice deficient for CaV3.1 were resistant to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and had reduced productions of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells. CaV3.1 deficiency led to decreased secretion of GM-CSF from in vitro polarized Th1 and Th17 cells. Nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) was also reduced in CaV3.1-deficient T cells. These data provide evidence for T-type channels in immune cells and their potential role in shaping the autoimmune response.","1516":null,"1517":"Few apoptotic corpses are seen even in tissues with high cellular turnover, leading to the notion that the capacity for engulfment in vivo is vast. Whether corpse clearance can be enhanced in vivo for potential benefit is not known. In a colonic inflammation model, we noted that the expression of the phagocytic receptor Bai1 was progressively downmodulated. Consistent with this, BAI1-deficient mice had more pronounced colitis and lower survival, with many uncleared apoptotic corpses and inflammatory cytokines within the colonic epithelium. When we engineered and tested transgenic mice overexpressing BAI1, these had fewer apoptotic cells, reduced inflammation, and attenuated disease. Boosting BAI1-mediated uptake by intestinal epithelial cells (rather than myeloid cells) was important in attenuating inflammation. A signaling-deficient BAI1 transgene could not provide a similar benefit. Collectively, these complementary genetic approaches showed that cell clearance could be boosted in vivo, with potential to regulate tissue inflammation in specific contexts.","1518":null,"1519":"Tissue-resident macrophages can derive from yolk sac macrophages (YS-Macs), fetal liver monocytes (FL-MOs), or adult bone-marrow monocytes (BM-MOs). The relative capacity of these precursors to colonize a niche, self-maintain, and perform tissue-specific functions is unknown. We simultaneously transferred traceable YS-Macs, FL-MOs, and BM-MOs into the empty alveolar macrophage (AM) niche of neonatal Csf2rb(-\/-) mice. All subsets produced AMs, but in competition preferential outgrowth of FL-MOs was observed, correlating with their superior granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reactivity and proliferation capacity. When transferred separately, however, all precursors efficiently colonized the alveolar niche and generated AMs that were transcriptionally almost identical, self-maintained, and durably prevented alveolar proteinosis. Mature liver, peritoneal, or colon macrophages could not efficiently colonize the empty AM niche, whereas mature AMs could. Thus, precursor origin does not affect the development of functional self-maintaining tissue-resident macrophages and the plasticity of the mononuclear phagocyte system is largest at the precursor stage. ","1520":"Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer predicts favorable outcomes. However, the mechanistic relationship between microsatellite instability, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, Immunoscore, and their impact on patient survival remains to be elucidated. We found significant differences in mutational patterns, chromosomal instability, and gene expression that correlated with patient microsatellite instability status. A prominent immune gene expression was observed in microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors, as well as in a subgroup of microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. MSI tumors had increased frameshift mutations, showed genetic evidence of immunoediting, had higher densities of Th1, effector-memory T cells, in situ proliferating T cells, and inhibitory PD1-PDL1 cells, had high Immunoscores, and were infiltrated with mutation-specific cytotoxic T cells. Multivariate analysis revealed that Immunoscore was superior to microsatellite instability in predicting patients' disease-specific recurrence and survival. These findings indicate that assessment of the immune status via Immunoscore provides a potent indicator of tumor recurrence beyond microsatellite-instability staging that could be an important guide for immunotherapy strategies.","1521":null,"1522":"Physical separation between the mammalian immune system and commensal bacteria is necessary to limit chronic inflammation. However, selective species of commensal bacteria can reside within intestinal lymphoid tissues of healthy mammals. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoid-tissue-resident commensal bacteria (LRC) colonized murine dendritic cells and modulated their cytokine production. In germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice, LRCs colonized intestinal lymphoid tissues and induced multiple members of the IL-10 cytokine family, including dendritic-cell-derived IL-10 and group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3)-derived IL-22. Notably, IL-10 limited the development of pro-inflammatory Th17 cell responses, and IL-22 production enhanced LRC colonization in the steady state. Furthermore, LRC colonization protected mice from lethal intestinal damage in an IL-10-IL-10R-dependent manner.

Microglia are fundamental for the development and function of a healthy brain. By contrast, their role in immune host defense of the CNS remains speculative, given the immune privilege of this organ. Alterations in microglia functionality are involved in brain aging, as well as in neurodegenerative disease severity and progression. The combination of their ontogeny with the influence of the complex environment of the CNS makes microglia a unique cell population. Recent observations about microglia ontogeny combined with extensive gene expression profiling allow us to better capture the variety of nuances that microglia can manifest. Here, we provide a contemporary appraisal of microglial uniqueness based on their origin, functions, and expression profiles. Furthermore, we give an overview of the impact of aging and neurodegenerative diseases on microglia transcriptomes. ","1531":"Iron is a transition metal that due to its inherent ability to exchange electrons with a variety of molecules is essential to support life. In mammals, iron exists mostly in the form of heme, enclosed within an organic protoporphyrin ring and functioning primarily as a prosthetic group in proteins. Paradoxically, free iron also has the potential to become cytotoxic when electron exchange with oxygen is unrestricted and catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. These biological properties demand that iron metabolism is tightly regulated such that iron is available for core biological functions while preventing its cytotoxic effects. Macrophages play a central role in establishing this delicate balance. Here, we review the impact of macrophages on heme-iron metabolism and, reciprocally, how heme-iron modulates macrophage function.","1532":"Phagocytes are crucial for host defense against bacterial pathogens. As first demonstrated by Metchnikoff, neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes share the capacity to engulf, kill, and digest microbial invaders. Generally, neutrophils focus on extracellular, and mononuclear phagocytes on intracellular, pathogens. Reciprocally, extracellular pathogens often capitalize on hindering phagocytosis and killing of phagocytes, whereas intracellular bacteria frequently allow their engulfment and then block intracellular killing. As foreseen by Metchnikoff, phagocytes become highly versatile by acquiring diverse phenotypes, but still retaining some plasticity. Further, phagocytes engage in active crosstalk with parenchymal and immune cells to promote adjunctive reactions, including inflammation, tissue healing, and remodeling. This dynamic network allows the host to cope with different types of microbial invaders. Here we present an update of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying phagocyte functions in antibacterial defense. We focus on four exemplary bacteria ranging from an opportunistic extracellular to a persistent intracellular pathogen.

After tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, such that uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contribute to a state of persistent injury, and this could lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound-healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue-regenerating phenotypes after injury, and we highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically. ","1535":"Defining the origins and developmental pathways of tissue-resident macrophages should help refine our understanding of the role of these cells in various disease settings and enable the design of novel macrophage-targeted therapies. In recent years the long-held belief that macrophage populations in the adult are continuously replenished by monocytes from the bone marrow (BM) has been overturned with the advent of new techniques to dissect cellular ontogeny. The new paradigm suggests that several tissue-resident macrophage populations are seeded during waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and self-maintain independently of BM contribution during adulthood. However, the exact nature of the embryonic progenitors that give rise to adult tissue-resident macrophages is still debated, and the mechanisms enabling macrophage population maintenance in the adult are undefined.

We explored the population dynamics of genetically diverse GC responses to two complex antigens-Bacillus anthracis protective antigen and influenza hemagglutinin-in which B cells competed both intra- and interclonally for distinct epitopes. Preferred VH rearrangements among antigen-binding, naive B cells were similarly abundant in early GCs but, unlike responses to haptens, clonal diversity increased in GC B cells as early \"winners\" were replaced by rarer, high-affinity clones. Despite affinity maturation, inter- and intraclonal avidities varied greatly, and half of GC B cells did not bind the immunogen but nonetheless exhibited biased VH use, V(D)J mutation, and clonal expansion comparable to antigen-binding cells. GC reactions to complex antigens permit a range of specificities and affinities, with potential advantages for broad protection. ","1541":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) increase the affinity and diversify the effector functions of antibodies during immune responses. Although SHM and CSR are fundamentally different, their independent roles in regulating B cell fate have been difficult to uncouple because a single enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (encoded by Aicda), initiates both reactions. Here, we used a combination of Aicda and antibody mutant alleles that separate the effects of CSR and SHM on polyclonal immune responses. We found that class-switching to IgG1 biased the fate choice made by B cells, favoring the plasma cell over memory cell fate without significantly affecting clonal expansion in the germinal center (GC). In contrast, SHM reduced the longevity of memory B cells by creating polyreactive specificities that were selected against over time. Our data define the independent contributions of SHM and CSR to the generation and persistence of memory in the antibody system. ","1542":"Targeted inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) can induce regression of tumors bearing activating mutations in the Ras pathway but rarely leads to tumor eradication. Although combining MEK inhibition with T-cell-directed immunotherapy might lead to more durable efficacy, T cell responses are themselves at least partially dependent on MEK activity. We show here that MEK inhibition did profoundly block naive CD8(+) T cell priming in tumor-bearing mice, but actually increased the number of effector-phenotype antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells within the tumor. MEK inhibition protected tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells from death driven by chronic TCR stimulation while sparing cytotoxic activity. Combining MEK inhibition with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) resulted in synergistic and durable tumor regression even where either agent alone was only modestly effective. Thus, despite the central importance of the MAP kinase pathway in some aspects of T cell function, MEK-targeted agents can be compatible with T-cell-dependent immunotherapy.","1543":"The cationic polysaccharide chitosan is an attractive candidate adjuvant capable of driving potent cell-mediated immunity, but the mechanism by which it acts is not clear. We show that chitosan promotes dendritic cell maturation by inducing type I interferons (IFNs) and enhances antigen-specific T helper 1 (Th1) responses in a type I IFN receptor-dependent manner. The induction of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and dendritic cell maturation by chitosan required the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and STING, implicating this pathway in dendritic cell activation. Additionally, this process was dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the presence of cytoplasmic DNA. Chitosan-mediated enhancement of antigen specific Th1 and immunoglobulin G2c responses following vaccination was dependent on both cGAS and STING. These findings demonstrate that a cationic polymer can engage the STING-cGAS pathway to trigger innate and adaptive immune responses.

We report that selective gut symbiotic gram-negative bacteria were able to disseminate systemically to induce immunoglobulin G (IgG) response, which primarily targeted gram-negative bacterial antigens and conferred protection against systemic infections by E. coli and Salmonella by directly coating bacteria to promote killing by phagocytes. T cells and Toll-like receptor 4 on B cells were important in the generation of microbiota-specific IgG. We identified murein lipoprotein (MLP), a highly conserved gram-negative outer membrane protein, as a major antigen that induced systemic IgG homeostatically in both mice and humans. Administration of anti-MLP IgG conferred crucial protection against systemic Salmonella infection. Thus, our findings reveal an important function for the gut microbiota in combating systemic infection through the induction of protective IgG.","1545":"Upon antigen engagement, augmented cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are needed to achieve optimal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. However, uncontrolled ROS production is a prominent cause of necrosis, which elicits hyper-inflammation and tissue damage. Hence, it is critical to program activated T cells to achieve ROS equilibrium. Here, we determined that miR-23a is indispensable for effector CD4(+) T cell expansion, particularly by providing early protection from excessive necrosis. Mechanistically, miR-23a targeted PPIF, gatekeeper of the mitochondria permeability transition pore, thereby restricting ROS flux and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Upon acute Listeria monocytogenes infection, deleting miR-23a in T cells resulted in excessive inflammation, massive liver damage, and a marked mortality increase, which highlights the essential role of miR-23a in maintaining immune homeostasis.","1546":null,"1547":"Stromal cells generate a complex cellular scaffold that provides specialized microenvironments for lymphocyte activation in secondary lymphoid organs.

CNS stromal cell activation was dominated by a rapid and vigorous production of CC-motif chemokine receptor (CCR) 7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 by vascular endothelial cells and adjacent fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-like cells in the perivascular space. Moreover, CCR7 ligands produced by CNS stromal cells were crucial to support recruitment and local re-activation of antiviral CD8(+) T cells and to protect the host from lethal neuroinflammatory disease, indicating that CNS stromal cells generate confined microenvironments that control protective T cell immunity.","1548":null,"1549":null,"1550":null,"1551":null,"1552":"Lymphocyte homing to draining lymph nodes is critical for the initiation of immune responses.

The arrival of these cells introduces high amounts of retinoic acid, mediates the neonatal to adult addressin switch on endothelial cells, and directs the homing of lymphocytes to both gut-associated lymphoid tissues and peripheral lymph nodes. In adult mice, a small number of these RALDH(+) cells might serve to maintain the volume of secondary lymphoid organs.

Decreased STAT3 activity was caused by hypoxia and affected all myeloid cells but was not observed in tumor cells. Upregulation of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity in MDSCs exposed to hypoxia in tumor site was responsible for downregulation of STAT3. This effect was mediated by the disruption of CD45 protein dimerization regulated by sialic acid. Thus, STAT3 has a unique function in the tumor environment in controlling the differentiation of MDSC into TAM, and its regulatory pathway could be a potential target for therapy.

Such cells failed to accumulate in acutely injured muscle of old mice, known to undergo ineffectual repair. This defect reflected reduced recruitment of Treg cells to injured muscle, as well as less proliferation and retention therein. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) regulated muscle Treg cell homeostasis in young mice, and its administration to old mice ameliorated their deficits in Treg cell accumulation and muscle regeneration. The major IL-33-expressing cells in skeletal muscle displayed a constellation of markers diagnostic of fibro\/adipogenic progenitor cells and were often associated with neural structures, including nerve fibers, nerve bundles, and muscle spindles, which are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors important for proprioception.

Although Treg cell depletion enhances tumor rejection, the ensuing autoimmune sequelae limits its utility in the clinic and highlights the need for limiting Treg cell activity within the tumor microenvironment.

Using an IL-35 reporter mouse, we observed substantial enrichment of IL-35(+) Treg cells in tumors. Neutralization with an IL-35-specific antibody or Treg cell-restricted deletion of IL-35 production limited tumor growth in multiple murine models of human cancer. Limiting intratumoral IL-35 enhanced T cell proliferation, effector function, antigen-specific responses, and long-term T cell memory. Treg cell-derived IL-35 promoted the expression of multiple inhibitory receptors (PD1, TIM3, LAG3), thereby facilitating intratumoral T cell exhaustion.

ILC numbers were preserved by antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only if initiated during acute infection. Transcriptional profiling during the acute phase revealed upregulation of genes associated with cell death, temporally linked with a strong IFN acute-phase response and evidence of gut barrier breakdown.

Among these were miR-24 and miR-27, miRNAs coexpressed from two genomic clusters, which each functioned independently to limit interleukin-4 (IL-4) production. Mice lacking both clusters in T cells displayed increased Th2 cell responses and tissue pathology in a mouse model of asthma. Gene expression and pathway analyses placed miR-27 upstream of genes known to regulate Th2 cells. They also identified targets not previously associated with Th2 cell biology which regulated IL-4 production in unbiased functional testing. Thus, elucidating the biological function and target repertoire of miR-24 and miR-27 reveals regulators of Th2 cell biology.","1570":"Exposure to environmental antigens, such as house dust mite (HDM), often leads to T helper 2 (Th2) cell-driven allergic responses. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of these responses are incompletely understood. We found that the initial exposure to HDM did not lead to Th2 cell development but instead promoted the formation of interleukin-4 (IL-4)-committed T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Following challenge exposure to HDM, Tfh cells differentiated into IL-4 and IL-13 double-producing Th2 cells that accumulated in the lung and recruited eosinophils. B cells were required to expand IL-4-committed Tfh cells during the sensitization phase, but did not directly contribute to disease. Impairment of Tfh cell responses during the sensitization phase or Tfh cell depletion prevented Th2 cell-mediated responses following challenge. Thus, our data demonstrate that Tfh cells are precursors of HDM-specific Th2 cells and reveal an unexpected role of B cells and Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma.

Aif-deficiency in T cells led to decreased peripheral T cell numbers and defective homeostatic proliferation, but thymic T cell development was unaffected. In contrast, Aif-deficient B cells developed and functioned normally. The difference in the dependency of T cells versus B cells on AIF for function and survival correlated with their metabolic requirements. Ectopic Ndi1 expression rescued homeostatic proliferation of Aif-deficient T cells. Despite its reported roles in cell death, fibroblasts, thymocytes and B cells lacking AIF underwent normal death.

We assessed circulating HIV-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) T cells and showed transcriptional and phenotypic similarities to lymphoid Tfh cells, and hence representing peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cells. pTfh cells were functionally active and B cell helper quality differed depending on antigen specificity. Furthermore, we found higher frequency of pTfh cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens from the ALVAC+AIDSVAX (RV144) HIV vaccine trial associated with protective antibody responses compared to the non-protective DNA+Ad5 vaccine trial.

Major complications of HSCT are graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that targets specific tissues and tumor relapses. However, the mechanisms dictating the anatomical features of GVHD and GVL remain unclear. Here, we show that after HSCT, CTLs exhibited different killing activity in distinct tissues, being highest in the liver and lowest in lymph nodes. Differences were imposed by the microenvironment, partly through differential PD-1 ligand expression, which was strongly elevated in lymph nodes. Two-photon imaging revealed that PD-1 blockade restored CTL sensitivity to antigen and killing in lymph nodes. Weak CTL activity in lymph nodes promoted local tumor escape but could be reversed by anti-PD-1 treatment.

We confirmed these observations in wild-type (WT) mice and extended them with germinal center (GC) disruption experiments and variable region gene sequencing. We thus show that the GC response undergoes a temporal switch in its output as it matures, revealing that the reaction engenders both MBC subsets with different immune effector function and, ultimately, LLPCs at largely separate points in time.

Id2 deletion in mature NK cells was incompatible with their homeostasis due to impaired IL-15 receptor signaling and metabolic function and this could be rescued by strong IL-15 receptor stimulation or genetic ablation of Socs3. During NK cell maturation, we observed an inverse correlation between E-protein target genes and Id2. These results shift the current paradigm on the role of ID2, indicating that it is required not only to antagonize E-proteins during NK cell commitment, but constantly required to titrate E-protein activity to regulate NK cell fitness and responsiveness to IL-15.

At elevated precursor frequencies, intraclonal competition impaired initial activation and overall expansion of the tumor-specific CD4(+) T cell population. However, through clonally derived help, this population acquired a polyfunctional effector phenotype and antitumor immunity was enhanced. Conversely, development of effector function was attenuated at low precursor frequencies due to irreversible T cell exhaustion.

Antigen cross-presentation by non-activated DCs, however, is not sufficient for the effective induction of immune responses. Additionally, DCs need to be activated through innate receptors, like Toll-like receptors (TLRs). During DC maturation, cross-presentation efficiency is first upregulated and then turned off. Here we show that during this transient phase of enhanced cross-presentation, phago-lysosome fusion was blocked by the topological re-organization of lysosomes into perinuclear clusters. LPS-induced lysosomal clustering, inhibition of phago-lysosome fusion and enhanced cross-presentation, all required expression of the GTPase Rab34. We conclude that TLR4 engagement induces a Rab34-dependent re-organization of lysosomal distribution that delays antigen degradation to transiently enhance cross-presentation, thereby optimizing the priming of CD8(+) T cell responses against pathogens.","1602":null,"1603":"The T helper 17 (Th17) cell pathway has been linked by genome-wide association studies to multiple autoimmune diseases.

In this study, we found elevated amounts of LL37-mtDNA complex in atherosclerotic plasma and plaques. The complex was resistant to DNase II degradation and escaped from autophagic recognition, leading to activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-mediated inflammatory responses. Mouse model studies indicated that Cramp-mtDNA complex aggravated atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and antibody treatment against the complex alleviated the lesion.

In the LZ, however, FOXO1 was expressed in a fraction of cells destined for DZ reentry. Upon FOXO1 ablation or induction of PI3K activity, GCs lost their DZ, owing at least partly to downregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4.

FOXO1-negative GC B cells displayed normal somatic hypermutation but defective affinity maturation and class switch recombination. The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation.

For pancreatic self antigen, this resulted in an absence of steady-state tolerance, while for the lung and intestine, tolerance was maintained by the enhanced presence of thymically-derived antigen-specific Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. Unlike deletional tolerance, Treg cell-mediated tolerance was broken by successive antigen challenges.

However, most AID+ immature B cells lacked anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and were deleted by apoptosis. AID inhibition using lentiviral-encoded short hairpin (sh)RNA in B cells developing in humanized mice resulted in a failure to remove autoreactive clones.

Upon detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), CD14 induces an inflammatory endocytosis pathway that delivers Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to endosomes. Although several regulators of CD14-dependent TLR4 endocytosis have been identified, the cargo-selection mechanism during this process remains unknown. We reveal that, in contrast to classic cytosolic interactions that promoted the endocytosis of transmembrane receptors, TLR4 was selected as cargo for inflammatory endocytosis entirely through extracellular interactions. Mechanistically, the extracellular protein MD-2 bound to and dimerized TLR4 in order to promote this endocytic event. Our analysis of LPS variants from human pathogens and gut commensals revealed a common mechanism by which bacteria prevent inflammatory endocytosis.

We found that in response to microbial stimuli, MYSM1 accumulated in the cytoplasm where it interacted with and inactivated TRAF3 and TRAF6 complexes to terminate PRR pathways for pro-inflammatory and type I interferon responses. Consequently, Mysm1 deficiency in mice resulted in hyper-inflammation and enhanced viral clearance but also susceptibility to septic shock.

IL-2-mediated activation of the Akt kinase and mTORc1 signaling was both necessary and sufficient to shift differentiation away from Tfh cells, instead promoting that of Th1 cells. These findings were not the result of generalized signaling attenuation in Tfh cells, because they retained the ability to flux calcium and activate NFAT-transcription-factor-dependent cytokine production.

This phenotype was associated with an altered repertoire of T cells residing in adipose tissue and could be completely prevented by T cell depletion in vivo. A similar impact of perf-DCs on inflammatory T cells was also found in a well-defined model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephlalomyelitis (EAE).

Control of tumor growth was independent of differential cancer cell colonization or proliferation, intestinal microbiota effects, or tumoricidal activity by the adaptive immune system. Instead, the inflammasome-IL-18 pathway impacted maturation of hepatic NK cells, surface expression of the death ligand FasL, and capacity to kill FasL-sensitive tumors.

We show that during strong stimulation, a profound suppression of primary CD4(+) T-cell-mediated immune responses ensued and was observed across preclinical models and patients undergoing high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy. This suppression targeted naive CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells and was mediated through transient suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) inhibition of the STAT5b transcription factor signaling pathway. These events resulted in complete paralysis of primary CD4(+) T cell activation, affecting memory generation and induction of autoimmunity as well as impaired viral clearance. These data highlight the critical regulation of naive CD4(+) T cells during inflammatory conditions.","1698":"Langerhans cells (LCs) populate the mucosal epithelium, a major entry portal for pathogens, yet their ontogeny remains unclear. We found that, in contrast to skin LCs originating from self-renewing radioresistant embryonic precursors, oral mucosal LCs derive from circulating radiosensitive precursors. Mucosal LCs can be segregated into CD103(+)CD11b(lo) (CD103(+)) and CD11b(+)CD103(-) (CD11b(+)) subsets. We further demonstrated that similar to non-lymphoid dendritic cells (DCs), CD103(+) LCs originate from pre-DCs, whereas CD11b(+) LCs differentiate from both pre-DCs and monocytic precursors. Despite this ontogenetic discrepancy between skin and mucosal LCs, the transcriptomic signature and immunological function of oral LCs highly resemble those of skin LCs but not DCs. These findings, along with the epithelial position, morphology, and expression of the LC-associated phenotype strongly suggest that oral mucosal LCs are genuine LCs. Collectively, in a tissue-dependent manner, murine LCs differentiate from at least three distinct precursors (embryonic, pre-DC, and monocytic) in steady state. ","1699":"The role of intestinal eosinophils in immune homeostasis is enigmatic and the molecular signals that drive them from protective to tissue damaging are unknown. Most commonly associated with Th2 cell-mediated diseases, we describe a role for eosinophils as crucial effectors of the interleukin-23 (IL-23)-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) axis in colitis. Chronic intestinal inflammation was characterized by increased bone marrow eosinopoiesis and accumulation of activated intestinal eosinophils. IL-5 blockade or eosinophil depletion ameliorated colitis, implicating eosinophils in disease pathogenesis. GM-CSF was a potent activator of eosinophil effector functions and intestinal accumulation, and GM-CSF blockade inhibited chronic colitis. By contrast neutrophil accumulation was GM-CSF independent and dispensable for colitis. In addition to TNF secretion, release of eosinophil peroxidase promoted colitis identifying direct tissue-toxic mechanisms. Thus, eosinophils are key perpetrators of chronic inflammation and tissue damage in IL-23-mediated immune diseases and it suggests the GM-CSF-eosinophil axis as an attractive therapeutic target.

Barrier epithelial cells (ECs) represent the very first line of defense and express pattern recognition receptors to recognize type-2-cell-mediated immune insults like proteolytic allergens or helminths. These ECs mount a prototypical response made up of chemokines, innate cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), as well as the alarmins uric acid, ATP, HMGB1, and S100 proteins. These signals program dendritic cells (DCs) to mount Th2-cell-mediated immunity and in so doing boost ILC2, basophil, and mast cell function. Here we review the general mechanisms of how different stimuli trigger type-2-cell-mediated immunity at mucosal barriers and how this leads to protection or disease.

However, LLPCs have yet to be characterized in humans. Here we used CD19, CD38, and CD138 to identify four PC subsets in human bone marrow (BM). We found that the CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) subset was morphologically distinct, differentially expressed PC-associated genes, and exclusively contained PCs specific for viral antigens to which the subjects had not been exposed for more than 40 years. Protein sequences of measles- and mumps-specific circulating antibodies were encoded for by CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs in the BM. Finally, we found that CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs had a distinct RNA transcriptome signature and human immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) repertoire that was relatively uncoupled from other BM PC subsets and probably represents the B cell response's \"historical record\" of antigenic exposure. Thus, our studies define human LLPCs and provide a mechanism for the life-long maintenance of anti-viral antibodies in the serum.","1713":"The B cell response to Salmonella typhimurium (STm) occurs massively at extrafollicular sites, without notable germinal centers (GCs). Little is known in terms of its specificity. To expand the knowledge of antigen targets, we screened plasmablast (PB)-derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for Salmonella specificity, using ELISA, flow cytometry, and antigen microarray. Only a small fraction (0.5%-2%) of the response appeared to be Salmonella-specific. Yet, infection of mice with limited B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires impaired the response, suggesting that BCR specificity was important. We showed, using laser microdissection, that somatic hypermutation (SHM) occurred efficiently at extrafollicular sites leading to affinity maturation that in turn led to detectable STm Ag-binding. These results suggest a revised vision of how clonal selection and affinity maturation operate in response to Salmonella. Clonal selection initially is promiscuous, activating cells with virtually undetectable affinity, yet SHM and selection occur during the extrafollicular response yielding higher affinity, detectable antibodies.","1714":"MicroRNA (miRNA)-dependent regulation of gene expression confers robustness to cellular phenotypes and controls responses to extracellular stimuli. Although a single miRNA can regulate expression of hundreds of target genes, it is unclear whether any of its distinct biological functions can be due to the regulation of a single target. To explore in vivo the function of a single miRNA-mRNA interaction, we mutated the 3' UTR of a major miR-155 target (SOCS1) to specifically disrupt its regulation by miR-155. We found that under physiologic conditions and during autoimmune inflammation or viral infection, some immunological functions of miR-155 were fully or largely attributable to the regulation of SOCS1, whereas others could be accounted only partially or not at all by this interaction. Our data suggest that the role of a single miRNA-mRNA interaction is dependent on cell type and biological context.","1715":"During early embryogenesis, microglia arise from yolk sac progenitors that populate the developing central nervous system (CNS), but how the tissue-resident macrophages are maintained throughout the organism's lifespan still remains unclear. Here, we describe a system that allows specific, conditional ablation of microglia in adult mice. We found that the microglial compartment was reconstituted within 1 week of depletion. Microglia repopulation relied on CNS-resident cells, independent from bone-marrow-derived precursors. During repopulation, microglia formed clusters of highly proliferative cells that migrated apart once steady state was achieved. Proliferating microglia expressed high amounts of the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), and treatment with an IL-1R antagonist during the repopulation phase impaired microglia proliferation. Hence, microglia have the potential for efficient self-renewal without the contribution of peripheral myeloid cells, and IL-1R signaling participates in this restorative proliferation process.","1716":"Targeted mutagenesis in mice is a powerful tool for functional analysis of genes. However, genetic variation between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) used for targeting (previously almost exclusively 129-derived) and recipient strains (often C57BL\/6J) typically results in congenic mice in which the targeted gene is flanked by ESC-derived passenger DNA potentially containing mutations. Comparative genomic analysis of 129 and C57BL\/6J mouse strains revealed indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in alternative or aberrant amino acid sequences in 1,084 genes in the 129-strain genome. Annotating these passenger mutations to the reported genetically modified congenic mice that were generated using 129-strain ESCs revealed that nearly all these mice possess multiple passenger mutations potentially influencing the phenotypic outcome. We illustrated this phenotypic interference of 129-derived passenger mutations with several case studies and developed a Me-PaMuFind-It web tool to estimate the number and possible effect of passenger mutations in transgenic mice of interest. ","1717":"Distinct groups of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) such as ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 populate the intestine, but how these ILCs develop tissue tropism for this organ is unclear. We report that prior to migration to the intestine ILCs first undergo a \"switch\" in their expression of homing receptors from lymphoid to gut homing receptors. This process is regulated by mucosal dendritic cells and the gut-specific tissue factor retinoic acid (RA). This change in homing receptors is required for long-term population and effector function of ILCs in the intestine. Only ILC1 and ILC3, but not ILC2, undergo the RA-dependent homing receptor switch in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In contrast, ILC2 acquire gut homing receptors in a largely RA-independent manner during their development in the bone marrow and can migrate directly to the intestine. Thus, distinct programs regulate the migration of ILC subsets to the intestine for regulation of innate immunity.

Mutations in AIRE cause a rare autosomal-recessive disease, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), distinguished by multi-organ autoimmunity. We have identified multiple cases and families with mono-allelic mutations in the first plant homeodomain (PHD1) zinc finger of AIRE that followed dominant inheritance, typically characterized by later onset, milder phenotypes, and reduced penetrance compared to classical APS-1. These missense PHD1 mutations suppressed gene expression driven by wild-type AIRE in a dominant-negative manner, unlike CARD or truncated AIRE mutants that lacked such dominant capacity. Exome array analysis revealed that the PHD1 dominant mutants were found with relatively high frequency (&gt;0.0008) in mixed populations. Our results provide insight into the molecular action of AIRE and demonstrate that disease-causing mutations in the AIRE locus are more common than previously appreciated and cause more variable autoimmune phenotypes.","1722":"Research on the human microbiome has established that commensal and pathogenic bacteria can influence obesity, cancer, and autoimmunity through mechanisms mostly unknown. We found that a component of bacterial biofilms, the amyloid protein curli, irreversibly formed fibers with bacterial DNA during biofilm formation. This interaction accelerated amyloid polymerization and created potent immunogenic complexes that activated immune cells, including dendritic cells, to produce cytokines such as type I interferons, which are pathogenic in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). When given systemically, curli-DNA composites triggered immune activation and production of autoantibodies in lupus-prone and wild-type mice. We also found that the infection of lupus-prone mice with curli-producing bacteria triggered higher autoantibody titers compared to curli-deficient bacteria. These data provide a mechanism by which the microbiome and biofilm-producing enteric infections may contribute to the progression of SLE and point to a potential molecular target for treatment of autoimmunity.

We found that the microRNA-212\/132 cluster (Mirc19) is enriched in HSCs and is upregulated during aging. Both overexpression and deletion of microRNAs in this cluster leads to inappropriate hematopoiesis with age. Enforced expression of miR-132 in the bone marrow of mice led to rapid HSC cycling and depletion. A genetic deletion of Mirc19 in mice resulted in HSCs that had altered cycling, function, and survival in response to growth factor starvation. We found that miR-132 exerted its effect on aging HSCs by targeting the transcription factor FOXO3, a known aging associated gene. Our data demonstrate that Mirc19 plays a role in maintaining balanced hematopoietic output by buffering FOXO3 expression. We have thus identified it as a potential target that might play a role in age-related hematopoietic defects.","1728":"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a nuclear-associated cytokine of the IL-1 family originally described as a potent inducer of allergic type 2 immunity. IL-33 signals via the receptor ST2, which is highly expressed on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thus underpinning its association with helminth infection and allergic pathology. Recent studies have revealed ST2 expression on subsets of regulatory T cells, and for a role for IL-33 in tissue homeostasis and repair that suggests previously unrecognized interactions within these cellular networks. IL-33 can participate in pathologic fibrotic reactions, or, in the setting of microbial invasion, can cooperate with inflammatory cytokines to promote responses by cytotoxic NK cells, Th1 cells, and CD8(+) T cells. Here, we highlight the regulation and function of IL-33 and ST2 and review their roles in homeostasis, damage, and inflammation, suggesting a conceptual framework for future studies.","1729":"Members of the extended interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine family, such as IL-1, IL-18, IL-33, and IL-36, play a pivotal role in the initiation and amplification of immune responses. However, deregulated production and\/or activation of these cytokines can lead to the development of multiple inflammatory disorders. IL-1 family members share a broadly similar domain organization and receptor signaling pathways. Another striking similarity between IL-1 family members is the requirement for proteolytic processing in order to unlock their full biological potential. Although much emphasis has been put on the role of caspase-1, another emerging theme is the involvement of neutrophil- and mast cell-derived proteases in IL-1 family cytokine processing. Elucidating the regulation of IL-1 family members by proteolytic processing is of great interest for understanding inflammation and immunity. Here, we review the identity of the proteases involved in the proteolytic processing of IL-1 family cytokines and the therapeutic implications in inflammatory disease.

Transient pharmacological blockade of c-Met during T cell priming led to enhanced survival of heart, but not skin, allografts associated with impaired localization of alloreactive T cells to heart grafts.

The thymus also harbors B cells; whether they also display unique tolerogenic features and how they genealogically relate to peripheral B cells is unclear. Here, we found that Aire is expressed in thymic but not peripheral B cells. Aire expression in thymic B cells coincided with major histocompatibility class II (MHCII) and CD80 upregulation and immunoglobulin class-switching. These features were recapitulated upon immigration of naive peripheral B cells into the thymus, whereby this intrathymic licensing required CD40 signaling in the context of cognate interactions with autoreactive CD4(+) thymocytes. Moreover, a licensing-dependent neo-antigen selectively upregulated in immigrating B cells mediated negative selection through direct presentation. Thus, autoreactivity within the nascent T cell repertoire fuels a feed forward loop that endows thymic B cells with tolerogenic features.","1741":"Breaching endothelial cells (ECs) is a decisive step in the migration of leukocytes from the vascular lumen to the extravascular tissue, but fundamental aspects of this response remain largely unknown. We have previously shown that neutrophils can exhibit abluminal-to-luminal migration through EC junctions within mouse cremasteric venules and that this response is elicited following reduced expression and\/or functionality of the EC junctional adhesion molecule-C (JAM-C). Here we demonstrate that the lipid chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was efficacious at causing loss of venular JAM-C and promoting neutrophil reverse transendothelial cell migration (rTEM) in vivo. Local proteolytic cleavage of EC JAM-C by neutrophil elastase (NE) drove this cascade of events as supported by presentation of NE to JAM-C via the neutrophil adhesion molecule Mac-1. The results identify local LTB4-NE axis as a promoter of neutrophil rTEM and provide evidence that this pathway can propagate a local sterile inflammatory response to become systemic.","1742":null,"1743":null,"1744":"It has long been thought that clonal deletion efficiently removes almost all self-specific T cells from the peripheral repertoire.

For the Y chromosome-encoded SMCY antigen, self-specific T cells exhibited only a 3-fold lower average frequency in males versus females and were anergic with respect to peptide activation, although this inhibition could be overcome by a stronger stimulus. We conclude that clonal deletion prunes but does not eliminate self-specific T cells and suggest that to do so would create holes in the repertoire that pathogens could readily exploit. In support of this hypothesis, we detected T cells specific for all 20 amino acid variants at the p5 position of a hepatitis C virus epitope in a random group of blood donors.","1745":"The two major lineages of classical dendritic cells (cDCs) express and require either IRF8 or IRF4 transcription factors for their development and function. IRF8-dependent cDCs promote anti-viral and T-helper 1 (Th1) cell responses, whereas IRF4-expressing cDCs have been implicated in controlling both Th2 and Th17 cell responses. Here, we have provided evidence that Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) is required in IRF4-expressing cDCs to promote Th2, but not Th17, cell responses in vivo. Conditional Klf4 deletion within cDCs impaired Th2 cell responses during Schistosoma mansoni infection, Schistosoma egg antigen (SEA) immunization, and house dust mite (HDM) challenge without affecting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), Th1 cell, or Th17 cell responses to herpes simplex virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Citrobacter rodentium infections. Further, Klf4 deletion reduced IRF4 expression in pre-cDCs and resulted in selective loss of IRF4-expressing cDCs subsets in several tissues. These results indicate that Klf4 guides a transcriptional program promoting IRF4-expressing cDCs heterogeneity.","1746":"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-27 signal through a shared receptor subunit and employ the same downstream STAT transcription proteins, but yet are ascribed unique and overlapping functions. To evaluate the specificity and redundancy for these cytokines, we quantified their global transcriptomic changes and determined the relative contributions of STAT1 and STAT3 using genetic models and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) approaches. We found an extensive overlap of the transcriptomes induced by IL-6 and IL-27 and few examples in which the cytokines acted in opposition. Using STAT-deficient cells and T cells from patients with gain-of-function STAT1 mutations, we demonstrated that STAT3 is responsible for the overall transcriptional output driven by both cytokines, whereas STAT1 is the principal driver of specificity. STAT1 cannot compensate in the absence of STAT3 and, in fact, much of STAT1 binding to chromatin is STAT3 dependent. Thus, STAT1 shapes the specific cytokine signature superimposed upon STAT3's action.","1747":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) use polarized secretion to rapidly destroy virally infected and tumor cells. To understand the temporal relationships between key events leading to secretion, we used high-resolution 4D imaging. CTLs approached targets with actin-rich projections at the leading edge, creating an initially actin-enriched contact with rearward-flowing actin. Within 1 min, cortical actin reduced across the synapse, T cell receptors (TCRs) clustered centrally to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), and centrosome polarization began. Granules clustered around the moving centrosome within 2.5 min and reached the synapse after 6 min. TCR-bearing intracellular vesicles were delivered to the cSMAC as the centrosome docked. We found that the centrosome and granules were delivered to an area of membrane with reduced cortical actin density and phospholipid PIP2. These data resolve the temporal order of events during synapse maturation in 4D and reveal a critical role for actin depletion in regulating secretion.","1748":null,"1749":null,"1750":"The mammalian virome includes diverse commensal and pathogenic viruses that evoke a broad range of immune responses from the host.

Despite strong genetic evidence implicating CLEC16A in autoimmunity, this gene's broad association with disease remains unexplained. We generated Clec16a knock-down (KD) mice in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) model for type 1 diabetes and found that Clec16a silencing protected against autoimmunity. Disease protection was attributable to T cell hyporeactivity, which was secondary to changes in thymic epithelial cell (TEC) stimuli that drive thymocyte selection. Our data indicate that T cell selection and reactivity were impacted by Clec16a variation in thymic epithelium owing to Clec16a's role in TEC autophagy.

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is caused by inactivating mutations in FAS or FASL, with autoantibodies thought to arise through failure of FAS-mediated removal of self-reactive germinal center (GC) B cells. Here we show that FAS is in fact not required for this process. Instead, FAS inactivation led to accumulation of a population of unconventional GC B cells that underwent somatic hypermutation, survived despite losing antigen reactivity, and differentiated into a large population of plasma cells that included autoantibody-secreting clones. IgE(+) plasma cell numbers, in particular, increased after FAS inactivation and a major cohort of ALPS-affected patients were found to have hyper-IgE. We propose that these previously unidentified cells, designated \"rogue GC B cells,\" are a major driver of autoantibody production and provide a mechanistic explanation for the linked production of IgE and autoantibodies in autoimmune disease.","1761":"The molecular mechanisms regulating antigen translocation into the cytosol for cross-presentation are under controversial debate, mainly because direct data is lacking. Here, we have provided direct evidence that the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocon protein Sec61 is essential for endosome-to-cytosol translocation. We generated a Sec61-specific intrabody, a crucial tool that trapped Sec61 in the ER and prevented its recruitment into endosomes without influencing Sec61 activity and antigen presentation in the ER. Expression of this ER intrabody inhibited antigen translocation and cross-presentation, demonstrating that endosomal Sec61 indeed mediates antigen transport across endosomal membranes. Moreover, we showed that the recruitment of Sec61 toward endosomes, and hence antigen translocation and cross-presentation, is dependent on dendritic cell activation by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. These data shed light on a long-lasting question regarding antigen cross-presentation and point out a role of the ER-associated degradation machinery in compartments distinct from the ER.

Corynebacterium mastitidis, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium bovis sequentially emerged during the onset of eczematous dermatitis, and antibiotics specific for these bacterial species almost completely reversed dysbiosis and eliminated skin inflammation. Whereas S. aureus prominently drove eczema formation, C. bovis induced robust T helper 2 cell responses. Langerhans cells were required for eliciting immune responses against S. aureus inoculation. These results characterize differential contributions of dysbiotic flora during eczema formation, and highlight the microbiota-host immunity axis as a possible target for future therapeutics in eczematous dermatitis.","1764":"Microbiota-mediated effects on the host immune response facilitate colonization resistance against pathogens. However, it is unclear whether and how the host immune response can regulate the microbiota to mediate colonization resistance. ID2, an essential transcriptional regulator for the development of innate lymphoid cell (ILC) progenitors, remains highly expressed in differentiated ILCs with unknown function. Using conditionally deficient mice in which ID2 is deleted from differentiated ILC3s, we observed that these mutant mice exhibited greatly impaired gut colonization resistance against Citrobacter rodentium. Utilizing gnotobiotic hosts, we showed that the ID2-dependent early colonization resistance was mediated by interleukin-22 (IL-22) regulation of the microbiota. In addition to regulating development, ID2 maintained homeostasis of ILC3s and controlled IL-22 production through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and IL-23 receptor pathway. Thus, ILC3s can mediate immune surveillance, which constantly maintains a proper microbiota, to facilitate early colonization resistance through an ID2-dependent regulation of IL-22.

We show that YS MFs are the main precursors of microglia, while most other MFs derive from fetal monocytes (MOs). Both YS MFs and fetal MOs arise from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) generated in the YS. In the YS, EMPs gave rise to MFs without monocytic intermediates, while EMP seeding the FL upon the establishment of blood circulation acquired c-Myb expression and gave rise to fetal MOs that then seeded embryonic tissues and differentiated into MFs. Thus, adult tissue-resident MFs established from hematopoietic stem cell-independent embryonic precursors arise from two distinct developmental programs.","1768":null,"1769":"Tumors cells can release natural killer (NK) cell ligands for activating receptor NKG2D that are thought to inhibit NK cell function.

It is poorly understood how radiotherapy supports tumor-specific immunity. Here we report that radiotherapy induced tumor cell death and transiently activated complement both in murine and human tumors. The local production of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a was crucial to the tumor response to radiotherapy and concomitant stimulation of tumor-specific immunity. Dexamethasone, a drug frequently given during radiotherapy, limited complement activation and the anti-tumor effects of the immune system.

However, the roles of Tet proteins in the immune response are unknown. Here, we characterized the genome-wide distribution of 5 hmC in CD4(+) T cells and found that 5 hmC marks putative regulatory elements in signature genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Moreover, Tet2 protein was recruited to 5 hmC-containing regions, dependent on lineage-specific transcription factors. Deletion of Tet2 in T cells decreased their cytokine expression, associated with reduced p300 recruitment.

Restriction of the primary Tfh cell subpopulation in the GC was mediated by downregulation of chemotactic receptor EBI2. Following collapse of the GC, memory T cells persisted in the outer follicle where they scanned CD169(+) subcapsular sinus macrophages. Reactivation and intrafollicular expansion of these follicular memory T cells in the subcapsular region was followed by their extrafollicular dissemination via the lymphatic flow. These data suggest that Tfh cells integrate their antigen-experience history to focus T cell help within the GC during primary responses but act rapidly to provide systemic T cell help after re-exposure to the antigen.","1784":"Antibodies play major roles in immunity to malaria; however, a limited understanding of mechanisms mediating protection is a major barrier to vaccine development. We have demonstrated that acquired human anti-malarial antibodies promote complement deposition on the merozoite to mediate inhibition of erythrocyte invasion through C1q fixation and activation of the classical complement pathway. Antibody-mediated complement-dependent (Ab-C') inhibition was the predominant invasion-inhibitory activity of human antibodies; most antibodies were non-inhibitory without complement. Inhibitory activity was mediated predominately via C1q fixation, and merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were identified as major targets. Complement fixation by antibodies was very strongly associated with protection from both clinical malaria and high-density parasitemia in a prospective longitudinal study of children. Ab-C' inhibitory activity could be induced by human immunization with a candidate merozoite surface-protein vaccine. Our findings demonstrate that human anti-malarial antibodies have evolved to function by fixing complement for potent invasion-inhibitory activity and protective immunity. ","1785":"Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is presumed to be central to the altered responsiveness to recurrent infection in these patients. We examined the effects of smoke priming underlying the exacerbated response to viral infection in mice. Lack of interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling conferred complete protection during exacerbation and prevented enhanced inflammation and exaggerated weight loss. Mechanistically, smoke was required to upregulate epithelial-derived IL-33 and simultaneously alter the distribution of the IL-33 receptor ST2. Specifically, smoke decreased ST2 expression on group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) while elevating ST2 expression on macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, thus altering IL-33 responsiveness within the lung. Consequently, upon infection and release, increased local IL-33 significantly amplified type I proinflammatory responses via synergistic modulation of macrophage and NK cell function. Therefore, in COPD, smoke alters the lung microenvironment to facilitate an alternative IL-33-dependent exaggerated proinflammatory response to infection, exacerbating disease.","1786":"The inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) is a potent promoter of organ inflammation in murine lupus. ICOS stimulates T follicular helper cell differentiation in lymphoid tissue, suggesting that it might drive autoimmunity by enhancing autoantibody production. Yet the pathogenic relevance of this mechanism remains unclear. It is also unknown whether other ICOS-induced processes might contribute to lupus pathology. Here we show that selective ablation of ICOS ligand (ICOSL) in CD11c(+) cells, but not in B cells, dramatically ameliorates kidney and lung inflammation in lupus-prone MRL.Fas(lpr) mice. Autoantibody formation was largely unaffected by ICOSL deficiency in CD11c(+) cells. However, ICOSL display by CD11c(+) cells in inflamed organs had a nonredundant role in protecting invading T cells from apoptosis by elevating activity of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby facilitating T cell accrual. These findings reveal a mechanism that locally sustains organ inflammation in lupus.","1787":null,"1788":"The mechanisms underlying human natural killer (NK) cell phenotypic and functional heterogeneity are unknown. Here, we describe the emergence of diverse subsets of human NK cells selectively lacking expression of signaling proteins after human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were strikingly similar between HCMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector T cells but differed from those of canonical NK cells. Functional interrogation demonstrated altered cytokine responsiveness in adaptive NK cells that was linked to reduced expression of the transcription factor PLZF. Furthermore, subsets of adaptive NK cells demonstrated significantly reduced functional responses to activated autologous T cells. The present results uncover a spectrum of epigenetically unique adaptive NK cell subsets that diversify in response to viral infection and have distinct functional capabilities compared to canonical NK cell subsets.","1789":null,"1790":"Macrophage polarization involves a coordinated metabolic and transcriptional rewiring that is only partially understood. By using an integrated high-throughput transcriptional-metabolic profiling and analysis pipeline, we characterized systemic changes during murine macrophage M1 and M2 polarization. M2 polarization was found to activate glutamine catabolism and UDP-GlcNAc-associated modules. Correspondingly, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of N-glycosylation decreased M2 polarization and production of chemokine CCL22. In M1 macrophages, we identified a metabolic break at Idh, the enzyme that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, providing mechanistic explanation for TCA cycle fragmentation. (13)C-tracer studies suggested the presence of an active variant of the aspartate-arginosuccinate shunt that compensated for this break. Consistently, inhibition of aspartate-aminotransferase, a key enzyme of the shunt, inhibited nitric oxide and interleukin-6 production in M1 macrophages, while promoting mitochondrial respiration. This systems approach provides a highly integrated picture of the physiological modules supporting macrophage polarization, identifying potential pharmacologic control points for both macrophage phenotypes.

In the past two decades, mitochondria have emerged as signaling organelles that contribute critical decisions about cell proliferation, death, and differentiation. Mitochondria not only sustain immune cell phenotypes but also are necessary for establishing immune cell phenotype and their function. Mitochondria can rapidly switch from primarily being catabolic organelles generating ATP to anabolic organelles that generate both ATP and building blocks for macromolecule synthesis. This enables them to fulfill appropriate metabolic demands of different immune cells. Mitochondria have multiple mechanisms that allow them to activate signaling pathways in the cytosol including altering in AMP\/ATP ratio, the release of ROS and TCA cycle metabolites, as well as the localization of immune regulatory proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this Review, we discuss the evidence and mechanisms that mitochondrial dependent signaling controls innate and adaptive immune responses.

ILC2s express ICOS, a T cell costimulatory molecule with a currently unknown function. Here we showed that a lack of ICOS on murine ILC2s and blocking the ICOS:ICOS-ligand interaction in human ILC2s reduced AHR and lung inflammation. ILC2s expressed both ICOS and ICOS-ligand, and the ICOS:ICOS-ligand interaction promoted cytokine production and survival in ILC2s through STAT5 signaling. Thus, ICOS:ICOS-ligand signaling pathway is critically involved in ILC2 function and homeostasis.","1799":"CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in limiting peripheral virus replication, yet how they locate virus-infected cells within tissues is unknown. Here, we have examined the environmental signals that CD8(+) T cells use to localize and eliminate virus-infected skin cells. Epicutaneous vaccinia virus (VV) infection, mimicking human smallpox vaccination, greatly increased expression of the CXCR3 chemokine receptor ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 in VV-infected skin. Despite normal T cell numbers in the skin, Cxcr3(-\/-) mice exhibited dramatically impaired CD8(+)-T-cell-dependent virus clearance. Intravital microscopy revealed that Cxcr3(-\/-) T cells were markedly deficient in locating, engaging, and killing virus-infected cells. Further, transfer of wild-type CD8(+) T cells restored viral clearance in Cxcr3(-\/-) animals. These findings demonstrate a function for CXCR3 in enhancing the ability of tissue-localized CD8(+) T cells to locate virus-infected cells and thereby exert anti-viral effector functions.","1800":"Oral immunotherapy has had limited success in establishing tolerance in food allergy, reflecting failure to elicit an effective regulatory T (Treg) cell response. We show that disease-susceptible (Il4ra(F709)) mice with enhanced interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) signaling exhibited STAT6-dependent impaired generation and function of mucosal allergen-specific Treg cells. This failure was associated with the acquisition by Treg cells of a T helper 2 (Th2)-cell-like phenotype, also found in peripheral-blood allergen-specific Treg cells of food-allergic children. Selective augmentation of IL-4R signaling in Treg cells induced their reprogramming into Th2-like cells and disease susceptibility, whereas Treg-cell-lineage-specific deletion of Il4 and Il13 was protective. IL-4R signaling impaired the capacity of Treg cells to suppress mast cell activation and expansion, which in turn drove Th2 cell reprogramming of Treg cells. Interruption of Th2 cell reprogramming of Treg cells might thus provide candidate therapeutic strategies in food allergy.","1801":null,"1802":"Little is known about the role of negative regulators in controlling natural killer (NK) cell development and effector functions. Foxo1 is a multifunctional transcription factor of the forkhead family. Using a mouse model of conditional deletion in NK cells, we found that Foxo1 negatively controlled NK cell differentiation and function. Immature NK cells expressed abundant Foxo1 and little Tbx21 relative to mature NK cells, but these two transcription factors reversed their expression as NK cells proceeded through development. Foxo1 promoted NK cell homing to lymph nodes by upregulating CD62L expression and inhibited late-stage maturation and effector functions by repressing Tbx21 expression. Loss of Foxo1 rescued the defect in late-stage NK cell maturation in heterozygous Tbx21(+\/-) mice. Collectively, our data reveal a regulatory pathway by which the negative regulator Foxo1 and the positive regulator Tbx21 play opposing roles in controlling NK cell development and effector functions.

Priming of the type I interferon system by DNA damage involved release of DNA into the cytoplasm where it activated the cytosolic DNA sensing STING-mediated pathway, which in turn enhanced responses to innate stimuli by activating the expression of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, cytoplasmic DNA sensors, and their downstream signaling partners. This study provides a potential explanation for the inflammatory phenotype of AT patients and establishes damaged DNA as a cell intrinsic danger signal that primes the innate immune system for a rapid and amplified response to microbial and environmental threats. ","1806":"The epidermis constantly encounters invasions that disrupt its architecture, yet whether the epidermal immune system utilizes damaged structures as danger signals to activate self-defense is unclear. Here, we used a C. elegans epidermis model in which skin-penetrating infection or injury activates immune defense and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production. By systemically disrupting each architectural component, we found that only disturbance of the apical hemidesmosomes triggered an immune response and robust AMP expression. The epidermis recognized structural damage through hemidesmosomes associated with a STAT-like protein, whose disruption led to detachment of STA-2 molecules from hemidesmosomes and transcription of AMPs. This machinery enabled the epidermis to bypass certain signaling amplification and directly trigger AMP production when subjected to extensive architectural damage. Together, our findings uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the epithelial barriers to detect danger and activate immune defense.","1807":"Memory CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells provide long-term protection against pathogens and are essential for the development of vaccines; however, some antigen-specific memory Th cells also drive immune-related pathology, including asthma. The mechanisms regulating the pathogenicity of memory Th cells remain poorly understood. We found that interleukin-33 (IL-33)-ST2 signals selectively licensed memory Th2 cells to induce allergic airway inflammation via production of IL-5 and that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was a central downstream target of IL-33-ST2 in memory Th2 cells. In addition, we found that IL-33 induced upregulation of IL-5 by memory CD4(+) T cells isolated from nasal polyps of patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus, IL-33-ST2-p38 signaling appears to directly instruct pathogenic memory Th2 cells to produce IL-5 and induce eosinophilic inflammation.","1808":null,"1809":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential for efficient B cell responses, yet the factors that regulate differentiation of this CD4(+) T cell subset are incompletely understood. Here we found that the KLF2 transcription factor serves to restrain Tfh cell generation. Induced KLF2 deficiency in activated CD4(+) T cells led to increased Tfh cell generation and B cell priming, whereas KLF2 overexpression prevented Tfh cell production. KLF2 promotes expression of the trafficking receptor S1PR1, and S1PR1 downregulation is essential for efficient Tfh cell production. However, KLF2 also induced expression of the transcription factor Blimp-1, which repressed transcription factor Bcl-6 and thereby impaired Tfh cell differentiation. Furthermore, KLF2 induced expression of the transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 and enhanced Th1 differentiation. Hence, our data indicate KLF2 is pivotal for coordinating CD4(+) T cell differentiation through two distinct and complementary mechanisms: via control of T cell localization and by regulation of lineage-defining transcription factors.","1810":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential in the induction of high-affinity, class-switched antibodies. The differentiation of Tfh cells is a multi-step process that depends upon the co-receptor ICOS and the activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase leading to the expression of key Tfh cell genes. We report that ICOS signaling inactivates the transcription factor FOXO1, and a Foxo1 genetic deletion allowed for generation of Tfh cells with reduced dependence on ICOS ligand. Conversely, enforced nuclear localization of FOXO1 inhibited Tfh cell development even though ICOS was overexpressed. FOXO1 regulated Tfh cell differentiation through a broad program of gene expression exemplified by its negative regulation of Bcl6. Final differentiation to germinal center Tfh cells (GC-Tfh) was instead FOXO1 dependent as the Foxo1(-\/-) GC-Tfh cell population was substantially reduced. We propose that ICOS signaling transiently inactivates FOXO1 to initiate a Tfh cell contingency that is completed in a FOXO1-dependent manner.","1811":"Type 2 inflammatory responses can be elicited by diverse stimuli, including toxins, venoms, allergens, and infectious agents, and play critical roles in resistance and tolerance associated with infection, wound healing, tissue repair, and tumor development. Emerging data suggest that in addition to characteristic type 2-associated cytokines, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like molecule Amphiregulin (AREG) might be a critical component of type 2-mediated resistance and tolerance. Notably, numerous studies demonstrate that in addition to the established role of epithelial- and mesenchymal-derived AREG, multiple leukocyte populations including mast cells, basophils, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), and a subset of tissue-resident regulatory CD4(+) T cells can express AREG.

We found that only yeast induced Th17 cell responses through a mechanism that required Dectin-1-mediated expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by Langerhans cells. Filamentous forms induced Th1 without Th17 cell responses due to the absence of Dectin-1 ligation. Notably, Th17 cell responses provided protection against cutaneous infection while Th1 cell responses provided protection against systemic infection. Thus, C. albicans morphology drives distinct T helper cell responses that provide tissue-specific protection.

Our data support that this F. nucleatum-mediated inhibition is mediated by human, but not by mouse TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor present on all human NK cells and on various T cells. Using a library of F. nucleatum mutants, we found that the Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum directly interacted with TIGIT, leading to the inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity. We have further demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed TIGIT and that T cell activities were also inhibited by F. nucleatum via Fap2. Our results identify a bacterium-dependent, tumor-immune evasion mechanism in which tumors exploit the Fap2 protein of F. nucleatum to inhibit immune cell activity via TIGIT.","1823":"T helper 1 (Th1) cell-associated immunity exacerbates ileitis induced by oral Toxoplasma gondii infection. We show here that attenuated ileitis observed in interleukin-22 (IL-22)-deficient mice was associated with reduced production of Th1-cell-promoting IL-18. IL-22 not only augmented the expression of Il18 mRNA and inactive precursor protein (proIL-18) in intestinal epithelial cells after T. gondii or Citrobacter rodentium infection, but also maintained the homeostatic amount of proIL-18 in the ileum. IL-22, however, did not induce the processing to active IL-18, suggesting a two-step regulation of IL-18 in these cells. Although IL-18 exerted pathogenic functions during ileitis triggered by T. gondii, it was required for host defense against C. rodentium. Conversely, IL-18 was required for the expression of IL-22 in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) upon T. gondii infection. Our results define IL-18 as an IL-22 target gene in epithelial cells and describe a complex mutual regulation of both cytokines during intestinal infection.","1824":"During persistent antigen stimulation, CD8(+) T cells show a gradual decrease in effector function, referred to as exhaustion, which impairs responses in the setting of tumors and infections.

We defined the genomic regions occupied by endogenous and engineered NFAT1 in primary CD8(+) T cells and showed that genes directly induced by the engineered NFAT1 overlapped with genes expressed in exhausted CD8(+) T cells in vivo.

Utilizing whole LN 3D imaging, histo-cytometry, and intravital 2-photon microscopy, we have identified a specialized population of DCs, enriched in the LN-resident CD11b(+) subset, which resides within the lymphatic sinus endothelium and scans lymph with motile dendrites. These DCs capture draining particles and present associated antigens to T lymphocytes, inducing T cell responses much sooner than and independently of migratory DCs.

In vitro, DLL4-deficient APCs were less efficient stimulators of CD4(+) T cell activation, metabolism, proliferation, and cytokine secretion.

This property was biologically relevant because systemic expression of a self peptide reduced the size of a naive cell population specific for a related foreign peptide by deletion of cells with cross-reactive TCRs. Reciprocally, an incompletely deleted naive T cell population specific for a tissue-restricted self peptide could be triggered by related microbial peptides to cause autoimmunity. Thus, TCR cross-reactivity between similar self and foreign peptides can reduce the size of certain foreign peptide-specific T cell populations and might allow T cell populations specific for tissue-restricted self peptides to cause autoimmunity after infection.","1842":null,"1843":"The cellular mechanisms controlling infection-induced emergency granulopoiesis are poorly defined.

Kupffer cell death also triggered a type 2 response that involved the hepatocyte-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) and basophil-derived interleukin-4 (IL-4). This led to the alternative activation of the monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the liver, which thereby replaced ablated Kupffer cells and restored liver homeostasis. Kupffer cell death is therefore a key signal orchestrating type 1 microbicidal inflammation and type-2-mediated liver repair upon infection.

Here we showed deletion of CTLA-4 in adult mice increased Tfh and Tfr cell numbers and augmented B cell responses. In the effector phase, loss of CTLA-4 on Tfh cells resulted in heightened B cell responses, whereas loss of CTLA-4 on Tfr cells resulted in defective suppression of antigen-specific antibody responses. We also found that non-Tfr Treg cells could suppress B cell responses through CTLA-4 and that Treg and\/or Tfr cells might downregulate B7-2 on B cells outside germinal centers as a means of suppression. Within the germinal center, however, Tfr cells potently suppress B cells through CTLA-4, but with a mechanism independent of altering B7-1 or B7-2. Thus, we identify multifaceted regulatory roles for CTLA-4 in Tfh, Tfr, and Treg cells, which together control humoral immunity.","1850":"CD4(+)Foxp3-expressing Treg cells, which constitutively express the inhibitory coreceptor CTLA-4, are indispensable for immune homeostasis. We determined the roles of Treg cells and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells in the control of humoral immune responses. Depletion of Treg cells, blocking of CTLA-4 or a Treg cell specific reduction in CTLA-4 expression, resulted in an increase in the formation of antigen-specific Tfh cells, germinal center (GC), and plasma and memory B cells after vaccination. In the absence of Treg cell-expressed CTLA-4, large numbers of Tfr cells were present but were unable to restrain Tfh cell and GC formation. Temporary Treg cell depletion during primary immunization was sufficient to enhance secondary immune responses. Treg cells directly inhibited, via CTLA-4, B cell expression of CD80 and CD86, which was essential for Tfh cell formation. Thus, Treg and Tfr cells control Tfh cell and germinal center development, via CTLA-4-dependent regulation of CD80 and CD86 expression.","1851":"Decreased HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation is a hallmark of chronic infection, but the mechanisms of decline are unclear. We analyzed gene expression profiles from antigen-stimulated HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells from patients with controlled and uncontrolled infection and identified caspase-8 as a correlate of dysfunctional CD8(+) T cell proliferation. Caspase-8 activity was upregulated in HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells from progressors and correlated positively with disease progression and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) expression, but negatively with proliferation. In addition, progressor cells displayed a decreased ability to upregulate membrane-associated caspase-8 activity and increased necrotic cell death following antigenic stimulation, implicating the programmed cell death pathway necroptosis. In vitro necroptosis blockade rescued HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation in progressors, as did silencing of necroptosis mediator RIPK3. Thus, chronic stimulation leading to upregulated caspase-8 activity contributes to dysfunctional HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation through activation of necroptosis and increased cell death.","1852":null,"1853":null,"1854":null,"1855":"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, ERIS, or MPYS) is essential for host immune responses triggered by microbial DNAs. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying STING-mediated signaling are not fully understood. We report here that, upon cytoplasmic DNA stimulation, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein AMFR was recruited to and interacted with STING in an insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1)-dependent manner. AMFR and INSIG1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, then catalyzed the K27-linked polyubiquitination of STING. This modification served as an anchoring platform for recruiting TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and facilitating its translocation to the perinuclear microsomes. Depletion of AMFR or INSIG1 impaired STING-mediated antiviral gene induction. Consistently, myeloid-cell-specific Insig1(-\/-) mice were more susceptible to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection than wild-type mice.

Here we have studied the light chain usage of human and rhesus macaque antibodies targeted to a dominant region of the HIV-1 envelope second variable (V2) region involving lysine (K) 169, the site of immune pressure in the RV144 vaccine efficacy trial. We found that humans and rhesus macaques used orthologous lambda variable gene segments encoding a glutamic acid-aspartic acid (ED) motif for K169 recognition. Structure determination of an unmutated ancestor antibody demonstrated that the V2 binding site was preconfigured for ED motif-mediated recognition prior to maturation. Thus, light chain usage for recognition of the site of immune pressure in the RV144 trial is highly conserved across species. These data indicate that the HIV-1 K169-recognizing ED motif has persisted over the diversification between rhesus macaques and humans, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of this antibody recognition mode.","1857":"The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins NOD1 and NOD2, the founding members of the intracellular NOD-like receptor family, sense conserved motifs in bacterial peptidoglycan and induce proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses.

Several routes for the entry of peptidoglycan ligands to the host cytosol to trigger activation of NOD1 and NOD2 have been elucidated. Furthermore, genetic screens and biochemical analyses have revealed mechanisms that regulate NOD1 and NOD2 signaling. Finally, recent studies have suggested several mechanisms to account for the link between NOD2 variants and susceptibility to Crohn's disease.

PlGF repressed the expression of the protein Timp3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3), through the transcriptional Sirt1-p53 axis. Timp3 repression allowed costimulation of T cells and their deployment toward classical organs involved in hypertension. We showed that the spleen is an essential organ for the development of hypertension through a noradrenergic drive mediated by the celiac ganglion efferent. Overall, we demonstrate that PlGF mediates the neuroimmune interaction in the spleen, organizing a unique and nonredundant response that allows the onset of hypertension.","1870":"Defensins are short cationic, amphiphilic, cysteine-rich peptides that constitute the front-line immune defense against various pathogens. In addition to exerting direct antibacterial activities, defensins inactivate several classes of unrelated bacterial exotoxins. To date, no coherent mechanism has been proposed to explain defensins' enigmatic efficiency toward various toxins. In this study, we showed that binding of neutrophil ?-defensin HNP1 to affected bacterial toxins caused their local unfolding, potentiated their thermal melting and precipitation, exposed new regions for proteolysis, and increased susceptibility to collisional quenchers without causing similar effects on tested mammalian structural and enzymatic proteins. Enteric ?-defensin HD5 and ?-defensin hBD2 shared similar toxin-unfolding effects with HNP1, albeit to different degrees. We propose that protein susceptibility to inactivation by defensins is contingent to their thermolability and conformational plasticity and that defensin-induced unfolding is a key element in the general mechanism of toxin inactivation by human defensins.

Here we consider explanations for what we call \"the macrophage paradox:\" why do so many pathogenic bacteria replicate in the very cells equipped to destroy them? We ask whether replication in macrophages is an unavoidable fate that essentially defines a key requirement to be a pathogen. Conversely, we consider whether fundamental aspects of macrophage biology provide unique cellular or metabolic environments that pathogens can exploit.

Development of the granulocyte subset requires MCL-1-mediated control of the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. Monocytic suppressors tolerate the absence of MCL-1 provided cytokines increase expression of the MCL-1-related protein A1. Monocytic suppressors mediate T cell suppression, whereas their granulocytic counterparts lack suppressive function. The loss of the granulocytic subset via conditional MCL-1 deletion did not alter tumor incidence implicating the monocytic compartment as the functionally immunosuppressive subset in vivo.

By using IL-10 reporter mice, we found that plasmablasts in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), but not splenic B lineage cells, predominantly expressed IL-10 during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These plasmablasts were generated only during EAE inflammation. Mice lacking plasmablasts by genetic ablation of the transcription factors Blimp1 or IRF4 in B lineage cells developed an exacerbated EAE. Furthermore, IRF4 positively regulated IL-10 production that can inhibit dendritic cell functions to generate pathogenic T cells.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate GALT function and result in gut-commensal homeostasis are poorly defined. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in Peyer's patches (PPs) promote high-affinity IgA responses. Here we found that the ATP-gated ionotropic P2X7 receptor controls Tfh cell numbers in PPs. Lack of P2X7 in Tfh cells enhanced germinal center reactions and high-affinity IgA secretion and binding to commensals. The ensuing depletion of mucosal bacteria resulted in reduced systemic translocation of microbial components, lowering B1 cell stimulation and serum IgM concentrations. Mice lacking P2X7 had increased susceptibility to polymicrobial sepsis, which was rescued by Tfh cell depletion or administration of purified IgM. Thus, regulation of Tfh cells by P2X7 activity is important for mucosal colonization, which in turn results in IgM serum concentrations necessary to protect the host from bacteremia.

By 4 weeks of age, CD4(+) T cells entered islets coincident with an increase in CD103(+) DCs. In order to examine the role of the CD103(+) DCs in diabetes, we examined Batf3-deficient NOD mice that lacked the CD103(+) DCs in islets and pancreatic lymph nodes. This led to a lack of autoreactive T cells in islets and, importantly, no incidence of diabetes. Additional examination revealed that presentation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitopes in the pancreatic lymph nodes was absent with a partial impairment of MHC class II presentation. Altogether, this study reveals that CD103(+) DCs are essential for autoimmune diabetes development.","1890":"Natural killer (NK) cells have been reported to control adaptive immune responses that occur in lymphoid organs at the early stages of immune challenge. The physiological purpose of such regulatory activity remains unclear, because it generally does not confer a survival advantage. We found that NK cells specifically eliminated activated CD4(+) T cells in the salivary gland during chronic murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. This was dependent on TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression by NK cells. Although NK cell-mediated deletion of CD4(+) T cells prolonged the chronicity of infection, it also constrained viral-induced autoimmunity. In the absence of this activity, chronic infection was associated with a Sjogren's-like syndrome characterized by focal lymphocytic infiltration into the glands, production of autoantibodies, and reduced saliva and tear secretion. Thus, NK cells are an important homeostatic control that balances the efficacy of adaptive immune responses with the risk of developing autoimmunity.","1891":"Pathobionts play a critical role in disease development, but the immune mechanisms against pathobionts remain poorly understood. Here, we report a critical role for interleukin-22 (IL-22) in systemic protection against bacterial pathobionts that translocate into the circulation after infection with the pathogen Clostridium difficile. Infection with C. difficile induced IL-22, and infected Il22(-\/-) mice harbored high numbers of pathobionts in extraintestinal organs despite comparable pathogen load and intestinal damage in mutant and wild-type mice. Pathobionts exhibited increased resistant against complement-mediated phagocytosis, and their intravenous administration resulted in high animal mortality. Selective removal of translocated commensals rescued Il22(-\/-) mice, and IL-22 administration enhanced the elimination of pathobionts. Mechanistically, IL-22 augmented bacterial phagocytosis by increasing the expression and bacterial binding of complement C3. Our study demonstrates an unexpected role for IL-22 in controlling the elimination of pathobionts that enter the systemic circulation through the regulation of the complement system.","1892":"Chronic inflammation is a contributing factor to most life-shortening human diseases. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that sustain chronic inflammatory responses remain poorly understood, making it difficult to treat this deleterious condition.

Upon analyzing lymphocytes from inflamed versus healthy middle-aged mice, we found elevated numbers of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, and autoantibodies, all occurring in a miR-155-dependent manner. Further, Cd4-cre Mir155(fl\/fl) mice were generated and demonstrated that miR-155 functions in T cells, in addition to its established role in B cells, to promote humoral immunity in a variety of contexts. Taken together, our study discovers that miR-146a and miR-155 counterregulate Tfh cell development that drives aberrant GC reactions during chronic inflammation.","1893":null,"1894":null,"1895":null,"1896":"Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are specialized providers of T cell help to B cells, and are essential for germinal center formation, affinity maturation, and the development of most high-affinity antibodies and memory B cells.

HIF induces a number of aspects of host immune function, from boosting phagocyte microbicidal capacity to driving T cell differentiation and cytotoxic activity. Cellular metabolism is emerging as a key regulator of immunity, and it constitutes another layer of fine-tuned immune control by HIF that can dictate myeloid cell and lymphocyte development, fate, and function. Here we discuss how oxygen sensing in the immune microenvironment shapes immunological response and examine how HIF and the hypoxia pathway control innate and adaptive immunity.","1898":"Because of its lethality, the Ebola virus often appears to be an invincible adversary.

Atg16L1-deficient allo-HSCT recipients with GVHD displayed increased T cell proliferation due to increased dendritic cell (DC) numbers and costimulatory molecule expression. Reduced autophagy within DCs was associated with lysosomal abnormalities and decreased amounts of A20, a negative regulator of DC activation.

On B cells LOX-1 signaling upregulated CCR7, promoting cellular migration toward lymphoid tissues. LOX-1 signaling on DCs licensed the cells to promote B cell differentiation into class-switched plasmablasts and led to downregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR5 and upregulation of chemokine receptor CCR10 on plasmablasts, enabling their exit from germinal centers and migration toward local mucosa and skin. Finally, we found that targeting influenza hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) subunit to LOX-1 elicited HA1-specific protective antibody responses in rhesus macaques.

Use of Dicer-deficient or Rab27a and Rab27b double-deficient Treg cells to disrupt miRNA biogenesis or the exosomal pathway, respectively, established a requirement for miRNAs and exosomes for Treg-cell-mediated suppression.

However, where the fatty acids (FA) that fuel this process come from remains unclear. While CD8(+) memory T cells engage FAO to a greater extent, we found that they acquired substantially fewer long-chain FA from their external environment than CD8(+) effector T (Teff) cells. Rather than using extracellular FA directly, memory T cells used extracellular glucose to support FAO and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), suggesting that lipids must be synthesized to generate the substrates needed for FAO. We have demonstrated that memory T cells rely on cell intrinsic expression of the lysosomal hydrolase LAL (lysosomal acid lipase) to mobilize FA for FAO and memory T cell development. Our observations link LAL to metabolic reprogramming in lymphocytes and show that cell intrinsic lipolysis is deterministic for memory T cell fate.","1962":null,"1963":null,"1964":null,"1965":null,"1966":null,"1967":null,"1968":"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are among the most closely studied chronic inflammatory disorders that involve environmental, host genetic, and commensal microbial factors. This combination of features has made IBD both an appropriate and a high-priority platform for translatable research in host-microbiome interactions. Decades of epidemiology have identified environmental risk factors, although most mechanisms of action remain unexplained. The genetic architecture of IBD has been carefully dissected in multiple large populations, identifying several responsible host epithelial and immune pathways but without yet a complete systems-level explanation. Most recently, the commensal gut microbiota have been found to be both ecologically and functionally perturbed during the disease, but with as-yet-unexplained heterogeneity among IBD subtypes and individual patients. IBD thus represents perhaps the most comprehensive current model for understanding the human microbiome's role in complex inflammatory disease.

However, even with the limited current state of knowledge, individual connections between microbes and metabolites, between microbes and immune function, and between metabolites and immune function are being established. Here, we provide our perspective on these connections and outline a systematic research program that could turn these individual links into a broader network that allows us to understand how these components interact. This program will enable us to exploit connections among the microbiome, metabolome, and host immune system to maintain health and perhaps help us understand how to reverse the processes that lead to a wide range of immune and other diseases.

Mining the microbiota for bacterial strains responsible for shaping the structure and dynamic operations of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system represents a formidable combinatorial problem but one that needs to be overcome to advance mechanistic understanding of microbial community and immune system coregulation and to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches that promote health. Here, we discuss a scalable, less biased approach for identifying effector strains in complex microbial communities that impact immune function. The approach begins by identifying uncultured human fecal microbiota samples that transmit immune phenotypes to germ-free mice. Clonally arrayed sequenced collections of bacterial strains are constructed from representative donor microbiota. If the collection transmits phenotypes, effector strains are identified by testing randomly generated subsets with overlapping membership in individually housed germ-free animals. Detailed mechanistic studies of effector strain-host interactions can then be performed.

Here we show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor that senses environmental stimuli, modulates pathology in psoriasis. AhR-activating ligands reduced inflammation in the lesional skin of psoriasis patients, whereas AhR antagonists increased inflammation. Similarly, AhR signaling via the endogenous ligand FICZ reduced the inflammatory response in the imiquimod-induced model of skin inflammation and AhR-deficient mice exhibited a substantial exacerbation of the disease, compared to AhR-sufficient controls. Nonhematopoietic cells, in particular keratinocytes, were responsible for this hyperinflammatory response, which involved upregulation of AP-1 family members of transcription factors. Thus, our data suggest a critical role for AhR in the regulation of inflammatory responses and open the possibility for novel therapeutic strategies in chronic inflammatory disorders.

Here we found defective Th17 cell cytokine expression in miR-155-deficient CD4+ T cells in vitro and in vivo. Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin. PRC2 binding to chromatin and H3K27 histone methylation was increased in miR-155-deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il22, Il10, Il9, and Atf3. Defects in Th17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis in the absence of Mir155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid2 deletion. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.","1982":"Epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic infections impair immune responses to unrelated pathogens and vaccines. The underlying mechanisms, however, are unclear and distinguishing effects on priming versus development of immunological memory has been challenging. We investigated whether bystander chronic infections impact differentiation of memory CD8(+) T cells, the hallmark of protective immunity against intracellular pathogens. Chronic bystander infections impaired development of memory CD8(+) T cells in several mouse models and humans. These effects were independent of initial priming and were associated with chronic inflammatory signatures. Chronic inflammation negatively impacted the number of bystander CD8(+) T cells and their memory development. Distinct underlying mechanisms of altered survival and differentiation were revealed with the latter regulated by the transcription factors T-bet and Blimp-1. Thus, exposure to prolonged bystander inflammation impairs the effector to memory transition. These data have relevance for immunity and vaccination during persisting infections and chronic inflammation.","1983":"Allergic asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by lung eosinophilia controlled by type 2 cytokines. Cysteine proteases are potent triggers of allergic inflammation by causing barrier disruption in lung epithelial cells inducing the elevation of interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13 from natural helper (NH) cells, a member of ILC2s, which leads to lung eosinophilia. In this study, we found that basophils play a crucial role in NH cell-mediated eosinophilic inflammation induced by protease allergens. Conditional deletion of basophils caused a resolution of the papain-induced eosinophilia and mucus production. Resolution of eosinophilia was also observed in mice lacking IL-4 specifically in basophils, indicating that basophil-derived IL-4 enhanced expression of the chemokine CCL11, as well as IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 in NH cells, thus attracting eosinophils. These results demonstrate that IL-4 from basophils has an important role in the NH-derived cytokine and chemokine expression, subsequently leading to protease allergen-induced airway inflammation.","1984":null,"1985":"Classical dendritic cells (cDCs) form a critical interface between innate and adaptive immunity.

Here we review recent progress in our understanding of cDC subsets in mice. We will discuss cDC subset ontogeny and transcription factor dependencies, as well as emerging functional specializations within the cDC compartment in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues.","1986":"Cytokines can provide survival and proliferation signals to cancer cells, thus promoting tumor progression.

Here we detected interleukin-22 (IL-22) in patient colorectal cancer tissues that was produced predominantly by CD4(+) T cells. In a mouse model, migration of these cells into the colon cancer microenvironment required the chemokine receptor CCR6 and its ligand CCL20. IL-22 acted on cancer cells to promote activation of the transcription factor STAT3 and expression of the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methytransferase DOT1L. The DOT1L complex induced the core stem cell genes NANOG, SOX2, and Pou5F1, resulting in increased cancer stemness and tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, high DOT1L expression and H3K79me2 in colorectal cancer tissues was a predictor of poor patient survival. Thus, IL-22(+) cells promote colon cancer stemness via regulation of stemness genes that negatively affects patient outcome. Efforts to target this network might be a strategy in treating colorectal cancer patients.","1991":null,"1992":"Glutamine has been implicated as an immunomodulatory nutrient, but how glutamine uptake is mediated during T cell activation is poorly understood. We have shown that naive T cell activation is coupled with rapid glutamine uptake, which depended on the amino acid transporter ASCT2. ASCT2 deficiency impaired the induction of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells and attenuated inflammatory T cell responses in mouse models of immunity and autoimmunity. Mechanistically, ASCT2 was required for T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated activation of the metabolic kinase mTORC1. We have further shown that TCR-stimulated glutamine uptake and mTORC1 activation also required a TCR signaling complex composed of the scaffold protein CARMA1, the adaptor molecule BCL10, and the paracaspase MALT1. This function was independent of IKK kinase, a major downstream target of the CARMA1 complex.

Following wild-type (WT) CD4(+) T cell transfer, Rag2(-\/-)Il10rb(-\/-) mice developed severe colitis in association with profound defects in generation and function of Treg cells. Moreover, loss of IL-10R signaling impaired the generation and function of anti-inflammatory intestinal and bone-marrow-derived macrophages and their ability to secrete IL-10. Importantly, transfer of WT but not Il10rb(-\/-) anti-inflammatory macrophages ameliorated colitis induction by WT CD4(+) T cells in Rag2(-\/-)Il10rb(-\/-) mice. Similar alterations in the generation and function of anti-inflammatory macrophages were observed in IL-10R-deficient patients with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Collectively, our studies define innate immune IL-10R signaling as a key factor regulating mucosal immune homeostasis in mice and humans.","1995":"Antigen specificity is critical in immune response and requires integration of antigen-specific signals with antigen-nonspecific signals such as those provided by cytokines. The mechanism integrating these pathways is incompletely understood. We report here that antigen-specific proliferative responses of CD4(+) T cells required downmodulation of tumor suppressor p53. In the absence of T cell receptor (TCR) signal, IL-2 induced sustained increase in p53 protein, which prevented proliferative responses despite strong signaling through the IL-2 receptor. In contrast, TCR signaling resulted in early termination of p53 protein expression by decreasing p53 mRNA as well as strong transcriptional induction of the p53-regulating protein Mdm2. Downmodulation of p53 in response to antigen stimulation was in fact critical for antigen-specific T cell proliferation, and preventing p53 degradation by inhibiting Mdm2 resulted in sustained p53 protein and prevented antigen-specific T cell proliferation. It is thus termination of p53 by TCR signaling that allows proliferative responses, enforcing antigen specificity.","1996":null,"1997":"All previously characterized broadly neutralizing antibodies to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) target one of four major sites of vulnerability. Here, we define and structurally characterize a unique epitope on Env that is recognized by a recently discovered family of human monoclonal antibodies (PGT151-PGT158). The PGT151 epitope is comprised of residues and glycans at the interface of gp41 and gp120 within a single protomer and glycans from both subunits of a second protomer and represents a neutralizing epitope that is dependent on both gp120 and gp41. Because PGT151 binds only to properly formed, cleaved trimers, this distinctive property, and its ability to stabilize Env trimers, has enabled the successful purification of mature, cleaved Env trimers from the cell surface as a complex with PGT151. Here we compare the structural and functional properties of membrane-extracted Env trimers from several clades with those of the soluble, cleaved SOSIP gp140 trimer.","1998":"Broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies are much sought after (a) to guide vaccine design, both as templates and as indicators of the authenticity of vaccine candidates, (b) to assist in structural studies, and (c) to serve as potential therapeutics. However, the number of targets on the viral envelope spike for such antibodies has been limited. Here, we describe a set of human monoclonal antibodies that define what is, to the best of our knowledge, a previously undefined target on HIV Env. The antibodies recognize a glycan-dependent epitope on the prefusion conformation of gp41 and unambiguously distinguish cleaved from uncleaved Env trimers, an important property given increasing evidence that cleavage is required for vaccine candidates that seek to mimic the functional HIV envelope spike. The availability of this set of antibodies expands the number of vaccine targets on HIV and provides reagents to characterize the native envelope spike.","1999":"Immunity in the urinary tract has distinct and poorly understood pathophysiological characteristics and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality. We investigated the role of the soluble pattern recognition molecule pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a key component of the humoral arm of innate immunity, in UTIs. PTX3-deficient mice showed defective control of UTIs and exacerbated inflammation. Expression of PTX3 was induced in uroepithelial cells by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and MyD88-dependent manner. PTX3 enhanced UPEC phagocytosis and phagosome maturation by neutrophils. PTX3 was detected in urine of UTI patients and amounts correlated with disease severity. In cohorts of UTI-prone patients, PTX3 gene polymorphisms correlated with susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis and cystitis. These results suggest that PTX3 is an essential component of innate resistance against UTIs. Thus, the cellular and humoral arms of innate immunity exert complementary functions in mediating resistance against UTIs.","2000":"Segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB) is a symbiont that drives postnatal maturation of gut adaptive immune responses. In contrast to nonpathogenic E. coli, SFB stimulated vigorous development of Peyer's patches germinal centers but paradoxically induced only a low frequency of specific immunoglobulin A (IgA)-secreting cells with delayed accumulation of somatic mutations. Moreover, blocking Peyer's patch development abolished IgA responses to E. coli, but not to SFB. Indeed, SFB stimulated the postnatal development of isolated lymphoid follicles and tertiary lymphoid tissue, which substituted for Peyer's patches as inductive sites for intestinal IgA and SFB-specific T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. Strikingly, in mice depleted of gut organized lymphoid tissue, SFB still induced a substantial but nonspecific intestinal Th17 cell response. These results demonstrate that SFB has the remarkable capacity to induce and stimulate multiple types of intestinal lymphoid tissues that cooperate to generate potent IgA and Th17 cell responses displaying only limited target specificity.","2001":null,"2002":"Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells regulate immune responses and maintain self-tolerance. Recent work shows that Treg cells are comprised of many subpopulations with specialized regulatory functions. Here we identified Foxp3(+) T cells expressing the coinhibitory molecule TIGIT as a distinct Treg cell subset that specifically suppresses proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell, but not Th2 cell responses. Transcriptional profiling characterized TIGIT(+) Treg cells as an activated Treg cell subset with high expression of Treg signature genes. Ligation of TIGIT on Treg cells induced expression of the effector molecule fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2), which promoted Treg-cell-mediated suppression of T effector cell proliferation. In addition, Fgl2 was necessary to prevent suppression of Th2 cytokine production in a model of allergic airway inflammation. TIGIT expression therefore identifies a Treg cell subset that demonstrates selectivity for suppression of Th1 and Th17 cell but not Th2 cell responses.","2003":null,"2004":"Sepsis, a clinical syndrome occurring in patients following infection or injury, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

We previously reported that MCs highly express P2X7, a receptor for extracellular ATP, in the colon but not in the skin. The ATP-P2X7 pathway induces MC activation and consequently exacerbates the inflammation. Here, we identified the mechanisms by which P2X7 expression on MCs is reduced by fibroblasts in the skin, but not in the other tissues. The retinoic-acid-degrading enzyme Cyp26b1 is highly expressed in skin fibroblasts, and its inhibition resulted in the upregulation of P2X7 on MCs. We also noted the increased expression of P2X7 on skin MCs and consequent P2X7- and MC-dependent dermatitis (so-called retinoid dermatitis) in the presence of excessive amounts of retinoic acid. These results demonstrate a unique skin-barrier homeostatic network operating through Cyp26b1-mediated inhibition of ATP-dependent MC activation by fibroblasts.","2011":"Aspirin gained tremendous popularity during the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus pandemic, 50 years prior to the demonstration of their inhibitory action on prostaglandins. Here, we show that during influenza A virus (IAV) infection, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was upregulated, which led to the inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production and apoptosis in macrophages, thereby causing an increase in virus replication. This inhibitory role of PGE2 was not limited to innate immunity, because both antigen presentation and T cell mediated immunity were also suppressed. Targeted PGE2 suppression via genetic ablation of microsomal prostaglandin E-synthase 1 (mPGES-1) or by the pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 substantially improved survival against lethal IAV infection whereas PGE2 administration reversed this phenotype. These data demonstrate that the mPGES-1-PGE2 pathway is targeted by IAV to evade host type I IFN-dependent antiviral immunity. We propose that specific inhibition of PGE2 signaling might serve as a treatment for IAV.","2012":"The transcription factor IRF3 is a central regulator of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The mechanisms underlying deactivation of IRF3 are poorly understood although many studies suggest that IRF3 activity is terminated through degradation after viral infection. Here we report that IRF3 is deactivated via dephosphorylation mediated by the serine and threonine phosphatase PP2A and its adaptor protein RACK1. The PP2A-RACK1 complex negatively regulated the IRF3 pathway after LPS or poly(I:C) stimulation or Sendai virus (SeV) infection. After challenge with LPS, poly(I:C), or low-titer SeV, activated IRF3 was dephosphorylated and returned to resting state without being degraded, although high-titer SeV infection triggered the degradation of IRF3. Furthermore, PP2A-deficient macrophages showed enhanced type I IFN signaling upon LPS, poly(I:C), and SeV challenge and protected mice from lethal vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Therefore, dephosphorylation of IRF3 is a deactivation mechanism that contributes to termination of IRF3-type I IFN signaling.","2013":"Selectins play a central role in leukocyte trafficking by mediating tethering and rolling on vascular surfaces. Here we have reported that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) is a P-selectin ligand. We have shown that human and murine TIM-1 binds to P-selectin, and that TIM-1 mediates tethering and rolling of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17, but not Th2 and regulatory T cells on P-selectin. Th1 and Th17 cells lacking the TIM-1 mucin domain showed reduced rolling in thrombin-activated mesenteric venules and inflamed brain microcirculation. Inhibition of TIM-1 had no effect on naive T cell homing, but it reduced T cell recruitment in a skin hypersensitivity model and blocked experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Uniquely, the TIM-1 immunoglobulin variable domain was also required for P-selectin binding. Our data demonstrate that TIM-1 is a major P-selectin ligand with a specialized role in T cell trafficking during inflammatory responses and the induction of autoimmune disease.","2014":null,"2015":"How commensal microbiota contributes to immune cell homeostasis at barrier surfaces is poorly understood. Lamina propria (LP) T helper 17 (Th17) cells participate in mucosal protection and are induced by commensal segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB).

Expression of MHCII on CD11c(+) cells was necessary and sufficient for SFB-induced Th17 cell differentiation. Most SFB-induced Th17 cells recognized SFB in an MHCII-dependent manner. SFB primed and induced Th17 cells locally in the LP and Th17 cell induction occurred normally in mice lacking secondary lymphoid organs. The importance of other innate cells was unveiled by the finding that MHCII deficiency in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) resulted in an increase in SFB-independent Th17 cell differentiation.

Indeed, the resolution phase of inflammation is just as actively orchestrated and carefully choreographed as its induction and inhibition. In this review, we explore the immunological consequences of omega-3-derived specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) and discuss their place within what is currently understood of the role of the arachidonic acid-derived prostaglandins, lipoxins, and their natural C15-epimers.

CD103(+) RDCs supported the generation of CD8(+) T effector (Teff) cells, which migrate from lymph nodes to the infected lungs. In contrast, migrant CD11b(hi) RDCs activated CD8(+) T cells characteristic of central memory CD8(+) T (CD8(+) Tcm) cells including retention within the draining lymph nodes. CD103(+) RDCs expressed CD24 at an elevated level, contributing to the propensity of this DC subpopulation to support CD8(+) Teff cell differentiation. Mechanistically, CD24 was shown to regulate CD8(+) T cell activation through HMGB1-mediated engagement of T cell RAGE. Thus, there is distribution of labor among DC subsets in regulating CD8(+) T cell differentiation.","2028":"Recognition of cell death by the innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses. However, how these reactions are regulated is not well understood. Here, we identify the inhibitory C-type lectin receptor Clec12a as a specific receptor for dead cells. Both human and mouse Clec12a could physically sense uric acid crystals (monosodium urate, MSU), which are key danger signals for cell-death-induced immunity. Clec12a inhibited inflammatory responses to MSU in vitro, and Clec12a-deficient mice exhibited hyperinflammatory responses after being challenged with MSU or necrotic cells and after radiation-induced thymocyte killing in vivo. Thus, we identified a negative regulatory MSU receptor that controls noninfectious inflammation in response to cell death that has implications for autoimmunity and inflammatory disease.","2029":null,"2030":null,"2031":"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also named MITA, MYPS, or ERIS) is an intracellular DNA sensor that induces type I interferon through its interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1).

NLRC3 associated with both STING and TBK1 and impeded STING-TBK1 interaction and downstream type I interferon production. By using purified recombinant proteins, we found NLRC3 to interact directly with STING. Furthermore, NLRC3 prevented proper trafficking of STING to perinuclear and punctated region, known to be important for its activation. In animals, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected Nlrc3(-\/-) mice exhibited enhanced innate immunity and reduced morbidity and viral load.

Global transcriptional analysis demonstrated a molecular profile distinct from effector and memory CD4(+) T cells and also from exhausted CD8(+) T cells, though some common features of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell exhaustion were revealed. We have demonstrated unappreciated roles for transcription factors (TFs) including Helios, type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, and a diverse set of coinhibitory and costimulatory molecules during CD4(+) T cell exhaustion. Moreover, the signature of CD4(+) T cell exhaustion was found to be distinct from that of other CD4(+) T cell lineage subsets and was associated with TF heterogeneity.

Although much progress has been made in the understanding of macrophage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these processes remain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage transcriptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a refined, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages. This resource serves as a framework for future research into regulation of macrophage activation in health and disease.","2041":"MDA5 is an essential intracellular sensor for several viruses, including picornaviruses, and elicits antiviral interferon (IFN) responses by recognizing viral dsRNAs. MDA5 has been implicated in autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms of how MDA5 contributes to autoimmunity remain unclear. Here we provide direct evidence that dysregulation of MDA5 caused autoimmune disorders. We established a mutant mouse line bearing MDA5 mutation by ENU mutagenesis, which spontaneously developed lupus-like autoimmune symptoms without viral infection. Inflammation was dependent on an adaptor molecule, MAVS indicating the importance of MDA5-signaling. In addition, intercrossing the mutant mice with type I IFN receptor-deficient mice ameliorated clinical manifestations. This MDA5 mutant could activate signaling in the absence of its ligand but was paradoxically defective for ligand- and virus-induced signaling, suggesting that the mutation induces a conformational change in MDA5. These findings provide insight into the association between disorders of the innate immune system and autoimmunity. ","2042":"Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is highly induced in response to infections with a variety of pathogens, and its main functions are considered to be tissue repair and host defense at mucosal surfaces. Here we showed that IL-22 has a unique role during infection in that its expression suppressed the intestinal microbiota and enhanced the colonization of a pathogen. IL-22 induced the expression of antimicrobial proteins, including lipocalin-2 and calprotectin, which sequester essential metal ions from microbes. Because Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium can overcome metal ion starvation mediated by lipocalin-2 and calprotectin via alternative pathways, IL-22 boosted its colonization of the inflamed intestine by suppressing commensal Enterobacteriaceae, which are susceptible to the antimicrobial proteins. Thus, IL-22 tipped the balance between pathogenic and commensal bacteria in favor of a pathogen. Taken together, IL-22 induction can be exploited by pathogens to suppress the growth of their closest competitors, thereby enhancing pathogen colonization of mucosal surfaces.

Here we show an unanticipated division of labor among APCs for the establishment of oral tolerance. Chemokine receptor CX3CR1(+) macrophages were found to take up soluble fed antigens and quickly transfer them to CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs). Antigen transfer occurred via a mechanism that was Connexin 43-dependent and required membrane transfer, indicating a physiological role of gap junctions in antigen presentation. Deletion of Connexin 43 in APCs affected antigen transfer and resulted in the inability of CD103(+) DCs to acquire and present antigens in vivo, to drive T regulatory cell differentiation and to induce tolerance to food antigens. This functional cooperation between intestinal phagocytes might be a mechanism to avoid the exposure of tolerogenic DCs to the intestinal microbiota.","2048":"Activated T cells must mediate effector responses sufficiently to clear pathogens while avoiding excessive tissue damage. Here we have combined dynamic intravital microscopy with ex vivo assessments of T cell cytokine responses to generate a detailed spatiotemporal picture of CD4(+) T cell effector regulation in the skin. In response to antigen, effector T cells arrested transiently on antigen-presenting cells, briefly producing cytokine and then resuming migration. Antigen recognition led to upregulation of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) glycoprotein by T cells and blocking its canonical ligand, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), lengthened the duration of migration arrest and cytokine production, showing that PD-1 interaction with PD-L1 is a major negative feedback regulator of antigen responsiveness. We speculate that the immune system employs T cell recruitment, transient activation, and rapid desensitization to allow the T cell response to rapidly adjust to changes in antigen presentation and minimize collateral injury to the host.","2049":null,"2050":"Cardiac macrophages are crucial for tissue repair after cardiac injury but are not well characterized. Here we identify four populations of cardiac macrophages. At steady state, resident macrophages were primarily maintained through local proliferation. However, after macrophage depletion or during cardiac inflammation, Ly6c(hi) monocytes contributed to all four macrophage populations, whereas resident macrophages also expanded numerically through proliferation. Genetic fate mapping revealed that yolk-sac and fetal monocyte progenitors gave rise to the majority of cardiac macrophages, and the heart was among a minority of organs in which substantial numbers of yolk-sac macrophages persisted in adulthood. CCR2 expression and dependence distinguished cardiac macrophages of adult monocyte versus embryonic origin. Transcriptional and functional data revealed that monocyte-derived macrophages coordinate cardiac inflammation, while playing redundant but lesser roles in antigen sampling and efferocytosis. These data highlight the presence of multiple cardiac macrophage subsets, with different functions, origins, and strategies to regulate compartment size.","2051":"Innate immune recognition controls adaptive immune responses through multiple mechanisms. The MyD88 signaling adaptor operates in many cell types downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family members. Cell-type-specific functions of MyD88 signaling remain poorly characterized. Here, we have shown that the T cell-specific ablation of MyD88 in mice impairs not only T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses, but also Th1 cell responses. MyD88 relayed signals of TLR-induced IL-1, which became dispensable for Th1 cell responses in the absence of T regulatory (Treg) cells. Treg cell-specific ablation of MyD88 had no effect, suggesting that IL-1 acts on naive CD4(+) T cells instead of Treg cells themselves. Together, these findings demonstrate that IL-1 renders naive CD4(+) T cells refractory to Treg cell-mediated suppression in order to allow their differentiation into Th1 cells. In addition, IL-1 was also important for the generation of functional CD4(+) memory T cells.","2052":"Five human hepatitis viruses cause most of the acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Over the past 25 years, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in particular has received much interest because of its ability to persist in most immunocompetent adults and because of the lack of a protective vaccine. Here we examine innate and adaptive immune responses to HCV infection. Although HCV activates an innate immune response, it employs an elaborate set of mechanisms to evade interferon (IFN)-based antiviral immunity. By comparing innate and adaptive immune responses to HCV with those to hepatitis A and B viruses, we suggest that prolonged innate immune activation by HCV impairs the development of successful adaptive immune responses. Comparative immunology provides insights into the maintenance of immune protection. We conclude by discussing prospects for an HCV vaccine and future research needs for the hepatitis viruses.

Butyrate, a bacterial product from fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, has been implicated in this process. GPR109A (encoded by Niacr1) is a receptor for butyrate in the colon. GPR109A is also a receptor for niacin, which is also produced by gut microbiota and suppresses intestinal inflammation. Here we showed that Gpr109a signaling promoted anti-inflammatory properties in colonic macrophages and dendritic cells and enabled them to induce differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing T cells. Moreover, Gpr109a was essential for butyrate-mediated induction of IL-18 in colonic epithelium. Consequently, Niacr1(-\/-) mice were susceptible to development of colonic inflammation and colon cancer. Niacin, a pharmacological Gpr109a agonist, suppressed colitis and colon cancer in a Gpr109a-dependent manner. Thus, Gpr10a has an essential role in mediating the beneficial effects of gut microbiota and dietary fiber in colon.","2059":null,"2060":"Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases show increased incidence of atherosclerosis. However, the contribution of proatherogenic factors to autoimmunity remains unclear. We found that atherogenic mice (herein referred to as LDb mice) exhibited increased serum interleukin-17, which was associated with increased numbers of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in secondary lymphoid organs. The environment within LDb mice was substantially favorable for Th17 cell polarization of autoreactive T cells during homeostatic proliferation, which was considerably inhibited by antibodies directed against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Moreover, the uptake of oxLDL induced dendritic-cell-mediated Th17 cell polarization by triggering IL-6 production in a process dependent on TLR4, CD36, and MyD88. Furthermore, self-reactive CD4(+) T cells that expanded in the presence of oxLDL induced more profound experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings demonstrate that proatherogenic factors promote the polarization and inflammatory function of autoimmune Th17 cells, which could be critical for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other related autoimmune diseases.","2061":"Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-mediated immunity plays a key role in protection from fungal infections in mice and man. Here, we confirmed that mice deficient in the IL-17 receptor or lacking the ability to secrete IL-17 are highly susceptible to systemic candidiasis, but we found that temporary blockade of the IL-17 pathway during infection in wild-type mice did not impact fungal control. Rather, mice lacking IL-17 receptor signaling had a cell-intrinsic impairment in the development of functional NK cells, which accounted for the susceptibility of these mice to systemic fungal infection. NK cells promoted antifungal immunity by secreting GM-CSF, necessary for the fungicidal activity of neutrophils. These data reveal that NK cells are crucial for antifungal defense and indicate a role for IL-17 family cytokines in NK cell development. The IL-17-NK cell axis may impact immunity against not only fungi but also bacteria, viruses, and tumors.

Alterations in the microbiota drove IL-17C upregulation specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-MyD88-dependent signaling during intestinal tumorigenesis. Microbiota-driven IL-17C induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in IECs in an autocrine manner to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis in both chemically induced and spontaneous intestinal tumor models. Thus, IL-17C promotes cancer development by increasing IEC survival, and the microbiota can mediate cancer pathogenesis through regulation of IL-17C.

Both S100A8-S100A9 and C3 are specifically expressed in lesional psoriatic skin. S100A9 is shown here to function as a chromatin component modulating C3 expression in mouse and human cells by binding to a region upstream of the C3 start site. When S100A9 was genetically deleted in mouse models of skin inflammation, the psoriasis-like skin disease and inflammation were strongly attenuated, with a mild immune infiltrate and decreased amounts of C3. In addition, inhibition of C3 in the mouse model strongly reduced the inflammatory skin disease. Thus, S100A8-S100A9 can regulate C3 at the nuclear level and present potential new therapeutic targets for psoriasis.

Previous studies linked pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-expressing HSCs, EMH, and immune responses to microbial stimuli. However, whether EMH operates in broader immune contexts remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in promoting the population expansion of progenitor cells in the periphery and identify that TSLP-elicited progenitors differentiated into effector cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes and that these cells contributed to type 2 cytokine responses. The frequency of circulating progenitor cells was also increased in allergic patients with a gain-of-function polymorphism in TSLP, suggesting the TSLP-EMH pathway might operate in human disease. These data identify that TSLP-induced EMH contributes to the development of allergic inflammation and indicate that EMH is a conserved mechanism of innate immunity. ","2069":"Upon infection with Shigella flexneri, epithelial cells release ATP through connexin hemichannels. However, the pathophysiological consequence and the regulation of this process are unclear. Here we showed that in intestinal epithelial cell ATP release was an early alert response to infection with enteric pathogens that eventually promoted inflammation of the gut. Shigella evolved to escape this inflammatory reaction by its type III secretion effector IpgD, which blocked hemichannels via the production of the lipid PtdIns5P. Infection with an ipgD mutant resulted in rapid hemichannel-dependent accumulation of extracellular ATP in vitro and in vivo, which preceded the onset of inflammation. At later stages of infection, ipgD-deficient Shigella caused strong intestinal inflammation owing to extracellular ATP. We therefore describe a new paradigm of host-pathogen interaction based on endogenous danger signaling and identify extracellular ATP as key regulator of mucosal inflammation during infection. Our data provide new angles of attack for the development of anti-inflammatory molecules.","2070":null,"2071":null,"2072":null,"2073":"Activation of the complement system has long been known to be regulated by a series of steps involving fluid-phase convertases.

Here we describe that Raptor-mTORC1-dependent metabolic reprogramming is a central determinant of this transitional process. Loss of Raptor abrogated T cell priming and T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation, although Raptor function is less important for continuous proliferation of actively cycling cells. mTORC1 coordinated multiple metabolic programs in T cells including glycolysis, lipid synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation to mediate antigen-triggered exit from quiescence. mTORC1 further linked glucose metabolism to the initiation of Th2 cell differentiation by orchestrating cytokine receptor expression and cytokine responsiveness. Activation of Raptor-mTORC1 integrated T cell receptor and CD28 costimulatory signals in antigen-stimulated T cells. Our studies identify a Raptor-mTORC1-dependent pathway linking signal-dependent metabolic reprogramming to quiescence exit, and this in turn coordinates lymphocyte activation and fate decisions in adaptive immunity.","2079":null,"2080":null,"2081":"This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/locate\/withdrawalpolicy).\n\nThis article has been retracted at the request of the authors.\n\nThis study provided an explanation for why loss of FoxP3 in inducible regulatory T cells results in reduced expression of interleukin (IL)-10 despite the absence of FoxP3 binding sites in the IL-10 promoter. STAT3 binding sites do exist in the promoter, and evidence for a direct molecular interaction between FoxP3 and STAT3 proteins was provided as an explanation of the effect of loss of FoxP3. As supporting evidence, we reported modeling of a structural interaction between these two transcription factors in Figure 4D. As the N-terminal region of FoxP3, which consists of the Exon-2 region, had not been solved at structural resolution, we mistakenly used what we deduced to be a FoxP3 related transcription factor, NFAT, in the modeling. The model depicted in Figure 4D therefore did not represent a putative interaction between FoxP3 and STAT3 as labeled, but rather a putative interaction between NFAT and STAT3. Given the incorrect labeling of Figure 4D, the lack of documentation in the paper describing exactly how the modeling was performed, the lack of evidence shown in the paper for the choice of NFAT as the modeling partner, and the limited supporting evidence for a cooperative interaction between FoxP3 and STAT3, the editors have concluded with the corresponding author that the appropriate course of action is to retract the paper.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) have an important function in the mucosal immune system that we have now shown extends to the induction of CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. We demonstrate that FcRn within dendritic cells (DCs) was critical for homeostatic activation of mucosal CD8(+) T cells that drove protection against the development of colorectal cancers and lung metastases. FcRn-mediated tumor protection was driven by DCs activation of endogenous tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells via the cross-presentation of IgG complexed antigens (IgG IC), as well as the induction of cytotoxicity-promoting cytokine secretion, particularly interleukin-12, both of which were independently triggered by the FcRn-IgG IC interaction in murine and human DCs. FcRn thus has a primary role within mucosal tissues in activating local immune responses that are critical for priming efficient anti-tumor immunosurveillance.","2084":"HIV-2 is less pathogenic for humans than HIV-1 and might provide partial cross-protection from HIV-1-induced pathology. Although both viruses replicate in the T cells of infected patients, only HIV-2 replicates efficiently in dendritic cells (DCs) and activates innate immune pathways. How HIV is sensed in DC is unknown. Capsid-mutated HIV-2 revealed that sensing by the host requires viral cDNA synthesis, but not nuclear entry or genome integration. The HIV-1 capsid prevented viral cDNA sensing up to integration, allowing the virus to escape innate recognition. In contrast, DCs sensed capsid-mutated HIV-1 and enhanced stimulation of T cells in the absence of productive infection. Finally, we found that DC sensing of HIV-1 and HIV-2 required the DNA sensor cGAS. Thus, the HIV capsid is a determinant of innate sensing of the viral cDNA by cGAS in dendritic cells.

A conceptual model has emerged to explain this syndrome of diseases where HIV-mediated destruction of gut mucosa leads to local and systemic inflammation. Translocated microbial products then pass through the liver, contributing to hepatic damage, impaired microbial clearance, and impaired protein synthesis. Chronic activation of monocytes and altered liver protein synthesis subsequently contribute to a hypercoagulable state.

We found that, upon challenge, antigen-experienced IgG1 memory B cells rapidly differentiated into plasma cells, whereas nonexperienced IgG1 B cells did not, suggesting the importance of the stimulation history. In addition, our results suggest that repression of the Bach2 transcription factor, which results from antigen experience, contributes to predisposition of IgG1 memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells.

Here we found that FDCs acquired complement-coated immune complexes (ICs) from noncognate B cells via complement receptors 1 and 2 (CD35 and CD21, respectively) and rapidly internalized them by an actin-dependent pathway. ICs were retained intact within a nondegradative cycling compartment and were displayed periodically on the cell surface where they were accessible to antigen-specific B cells.

Functionally, loss of CD24(+)CD11b(+) DCs abrogated CD4+ T cell-mediated interleukin-17 (IL-17) production in steady state and after Aspergillus fumigatus challenge. Human CD1c+ DCs, the equivalent of murine CD24(+)CD11b(+) DCs, also expressed IRF4, secreted IL-23, and promoted T helper 17 cell responses. Our data revealed heterogeneity in the mouse CD11b+ DC compartment and identifed mucosal tissues IRF4-expressing DCs specialized in instructing IL-17 responses in both mouse and human. The demonstration of mouse and human DC subsets specialized in driving IL-17 responses highlights the conservation of key immune functions across species and will facilitate the translation of mouse in vivo findings to advance DC-based clinical therapies.","2204":"Although it has been appreciated for some years that cytosolic DNA is immune stimulatory, it is only in the past five years that the molecular basis of DNA sensing by the innate immune system has begun to be revealed. In particular it has been described how DNA induces type I interferon, central in antiviral responses and a mediator of autoimmunity. To date more than ten cytosolic receptors of DNA have been proposed, but STING is a key adaptor protein for most DNA-sensing pathways, and we are now beginning to understand the signaling mechanisms for STING. In this review we describe the recent progress in understanding signaling mechanisms activated by DNA and the relevance of DNA sensing to pathogen responses and autoimmunity. We highlight new insights gained into how and why the immune system responds to both pathogen and self DNA and define important questions that now need to be addressed in the field of innate immune activation by DNA.","2205":"Cells are equipped with mechanisms that allow them to rapidly detect and respond to viruses. These defense mechanisms rely partly on receptors that monitor the cytosol for the presence of atypical nucleic acids associated with virus infection. RIG-I-like receptors detect RNA molecules that are absent from the uninfected host. DNA receptors alert the cell to the abnormal presence of that nucleic acid in the cytosol. Signaling by RNA and DNA receptors results in the induction of restriction factors that prevent virus replication and establish cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity. In light of these formidable obstacles, viruses have evolved mechanisms of evasion, masking nucleic acid structures recognized by the host, sequestering themselves away from the cytosol or targeting host sensors, and signaling adaptors for deactivation or degradation.

Thus, the innate response, measured within hours in the peripheral blood, was dominated by an interferon transcriptional signature after influenza vaccination and by an inflammation signature after pneumococcal vaccination.

Distinct metabolic pathways diverge and converge at many levels, and, therefore, cells face choices as to how to achieve their metabolic goals. There is interest in fully understanding how and why immune cells commit to particular metabolic fates and in elucidating the immunologic consequences of reaching a metabolic endpoint by one pathway versus another. This is particularly intriguing, given that metabolic commitment is influenced not only by substrate availability but also by signaling pathways elicited by metabolites.

By using floxed Ptpn6 mice, we dissected the contribution of innate immune cells to the motheaten phenotype. Ptpn6 deletion in neutrophils resulted in cutaneous inflammation, but not autoimmunity, providing an animal model of human neutrophilic dermatoses. By contrast, dendritic cell deletion caused severe autoimmunity, without inflammation. Genetic and biochemical analysis showed that inflammation was caused by enhanced neutrophil integrin signaling through Src-family and Syk kinases, whereas autoimmunity resulted from exaggerated MyD88-dependent signaling in dendritic cells.

In addition, maintenance of the Tfh cell phenotype required sustained antigenic stimulation by GC B cells. In lymphopenic conditions, a strong and prolonged Tfh cell response led to bystander B cell activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of poly- and self-reactive antibodies.

By using superresolution microscopy, we demonstrated that endogenous IgM, IgD, and CD19 exhibited distinct nanoscale organization within the plasma membrane of primary B cells. Upon stimulation, we detect a local convergence of receptors, although their global organization was not dramatically altered. Thus, we postulate that cytoskeleton reorganization releases BCR nanoclusters, which can interact with CD19 held in place by the tetraspanin network. These results not only suggest that receptor compartmentalization regulates antigen-induced activation but also imply a potential role for CD19 in mediating ligand-independent \"tonic\" BCR signaling necessary for B cell survival.","2257":null,"2258":null,"2259":null,"2260":null,"2261":"Endothelial injury and dysfunction (ED) represent a link between cardiovascular risk factors promoting hypertension and atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death in Western populations.

We have identified symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in HDL(CKD) that causes transformation from physiological HDL into an abnormal lipoprotein inducing ED. Furthermore, we report that HDL(CKD) reduced endothelial NO availability via toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), leading to impaired endothelial repair, increased proinflammatory activation, and ABP.

Moreover, messenger RNA levels and localization of most of these TRIMs were found to be altered during viral infection, suggesting that their regulatory activities are highly controlled at both pre- and posttranscriptional levels.

CCR2-deficient mice unexpectedly displayed an exacerbation rather than alleviation of allergic inflammation, in spite of impaired recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to skin lesions.

This involves localized production of interleukin-10 and results in suppressed humoral and cell-mediated responses and bacterial persistence. Therefore, in addition to the previously described role of MCs orchestrating the early innate immunity during bladder infection, they subsequently play a tissue-specific immunosuppressive role.

Loss of TLR7 function caused spontaneous retroviral viremia that coincided with the absence of ERV-specific antibodies. Importantly, additional TLR3 and TLR9 deficiency led to acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, underscoring a prominent role for TLR3 and TLR9 in surveillance of ERV-induced tumors. Experimental ERV infection induced a TLR3-, TLR7-, and TLR9-dependent group of \"acute-phase\" genes previously described in HIV and SIV infections.

While the risk to self-tolerance posed by inadvertent generation of self-reactive GC B cells has long been recognized, it has not previously been possible to identify such cells and study their fate. In the current study, self-reactive B cells generated de novo in the GC failed to survive when their target self-antigen was either expressed ubiquitously or specifically in cells proximal to the GC microenvironment. By contrast, GC B cells that recognized rare or tissue-specific self-antigens were not eliminated, and could instead undergo positive selection by cross-reactive foreign antigen and produce plasma cells secreting high-affinity autoantibodies. These findings demonstrate the incomplete nature of GC self-tolerance and may explain the frequent association of cross-reactive, organ-specific autoantibodies with postinfectious autoimmune disease.","2340":"Mast cells (MCs) are key effector cells in allergic reactions. However, the inhibitory mechanism that prevents excessive activation of MCs remains elusive.

LMIR3 deficiency exacerbated MC-dependent allergic responses in mice, including anaphylaxis, airway inflammation, and dermatitis. Both physical binding and functional reporter assays via an extracellular domain of LMIR3 showed that several extracellular lipids (including ceramide) and lipoproteins were possible ligands for LMIR3. Importantly, MCs were frequently surrounded by extracellular ceramide in vivo. Upon engagement of high-affinity immunoglobulin E receptor, extracellular ceramide-LMIR3 binding inhibited MC activation via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory and switch motifs of LMIR3. Moreover, pretreatment with LMIR3-Fc fusion protein or antibody against either ceramide or LMIR3 interfered with this binding in vivo, thereby exacerbating passive cutaneous anaphylaxis.

Although interleukin-17 (IL-17) has been linked to human lupus and mouse models of this disease, it has not been addressed whether this cytokine plays a critical role in fatal lupus pathology.

Traf3ip2, Act1) critically contributed to lethal pathology in an FcgammaR2b-deficient mouse model of lupus. Mice lacking IL-17 and especially those lacking CIKS showed greatly improved survival and were largely protected from development of glomerulonephritis. Importantly in this model, potential effects of IL-17 cytokines on antibody production could be distinguished from critical local contributions in kidneys, including recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. These findings provide the proof of principle that signaling by IL-17 family cytokines mediated via CIKS presents promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, especially in cases with kidney involvement.","2343":"Carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule like I (CEACAM1) is expressed on activated T cells and signals through either a long (L) cytoplasmic tail containing immune receptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs, which provide inhibitory function, or a short (S) cytoplasmic tail with an unknown role. Previous studies on peripheral T cells show that CEACAM1-L isoforms predominate with little to no detectable CEACAM1-S isoforms in mouse and human. We show here that this was not the case in tissue resident T cells of intestines and gut associated lymphoid tissues, which demonstrated predominant expression of CEACAM1-S isoforms relative to CEACAM1-L isoforms in human and mouse. This tissue resident predominance of CEACAM1-S expression was determined by the intestinal environment where it served a stimulatory function leading to the regulation of T cell subsets associated with the generation of secretory IgA immunity, the regulation of mucosal commensalism, and defense of the barrier against enteropathogens.","2344":"The transcription factor Foxp3 is essential for the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells, yet its expression is insufficient for establishing the Treg cell lineage. Here we showed that Treg cell development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes, i.e., the expression of Foxp3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp3(+) T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity. Thus, those T cells in which the two events have concurrently occurred are developmentally set into the Treg cell lineage. This model explains how Treg cell fate and plasticity is controlled and can be exploited to generate functionally stable Treg cells.","2345":"The TCF-1 and LEF-1 transcription factors are known to play critical roles in normal thymocyte development. Unexpectedly, we found that TCF-1-deficient (Tcf7(-\/-)) mice developed aggressive T cell malignancy, resembling human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LEF-1 was aberrantly upregulated in premalignant Tcf7(-\/-) early thymocytes and lymphoma cells. We further demonstrated that TCF-1 directly repressed LEF-1 expression in early thymocytes and that conditional inactivation of Lef1 greatly delayed or prevented T cell malignancy in Tcf7(-\/-) mice. In human T-ALLs, an early thymic progenitor (ETP) subtype was associated with diminished TCF7 expression, and two of the ETP-ALL cases harbored TCF7 gene deletions. We also showed that TCF-1 and LEF-1 were dispensable for T cell lineage commitment but instead were required for early thymocytes to mature beyond the CD4(-)CD8(-) stage. TCF-1 thus has dual roles, i.e., acting cooperatively with LEF-1 to promote thymocyte maturation while restraining LEF-1 expression to prevent malignant transformation of developing thymocytes.","2346":"The strength of interactions between T cell receptors and the peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) directly modulates T cell fitness, clonal expansion, and acquisition of effector properties. Here we show that asymmetric T cell division is an important mechanistic link between increased signal strength, effector differentiation, and the ability to induce tissue pathology. Recognition of pMHC above a threshold affinity drove responding T cells into asymmetric cell division. The ensuing proximal daughters underwent extensive division and differentiated into short-lived effector cells expressing the integrin VLA-4, allowing the activated T cell to infiltrate and mediate destruction of peripheral target tissues. In contrast, T cells activated by below-threshold antigens underwent symmetric division, leading to abortive clonal expansion and failure to fully differentiate into tissue-infiltrating effector cells. Antigen affinity and asymmetric division are important factors that regulate fate specification in CD8(+) T cells and predict the potential of a self-reactive T cell to mediate tissue pathology.","2347":null,"2348":"The mammalian intestine harbors trillions of beneficial commensal bacteria that are essential for the development of the immune system and for maintenance of physiologic processes in multiple organs. However, numerous chronic infectious, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases in humans have been associated with alterations in the composition or localization of commensal bacteria that result in dysregulated host-commensal bacteria relationships. The mammalian immune system plays an essential role in regulating the acquisition, composition, and localization of commensal bacteria in the intestine. Emerging research has implicated innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) as a critical immune cell population that orchestrates some of these host-commensal bacteria relationships that can impact immunity, inflammation, and tissue homeostasis in the intestine. This review will discuss reciprocal interactions between intestinal commensal bacteria and ILCs in the context of health and disease.","2349":"The contraction of T cell populations after immune responses is poorly understood.

We demonstrate that scratching of human skin and tape stripping of mouse skin cause neutrophil influx. In mice, this influx was largely dependent on the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) by neutrophils and their expression of the LTB4 receptor BLT1. Allergic skin inflammation in response to epicutaneous (EC) application of ovalbumin to tape-stripped skin was severely impaired in Ltb4r1(-\/-) mice and required expression of BLT1 on both T cells and non-T cells. Cotransfer of wild-type (WT) neutrophils, but not neutrophils deficient in BLT1 or the LTB4-synthesizing enzyme LTA4H, restored the ability of WT CD4(+) effector T cells to transfer allergic skin inflammation to Ltb4r1(-\/-) recipients. Pharmacologic blockade of LTB4 synthesis inhibited allergic skin inflammation elicited by cutaneous antigen challenge in previously EC-sensitized mice. Our results demonstrate that a neutrophil-T cell axis reliant on LTB4-BLT1 interaction is required for allergic skin inflammation.","2358":"Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are part of a large family of ILCs that are important effectors in innate immunity, lymphoid organogenesis, and tissue remodeling. ILC2s mediate parasite expulsion but also contribute to airway inflammation, emphasizing the functional similarity between these cells and Th2 cells. Consistent with this, we report that the transcription factor GATA3 was highly expressed by human ILC2s. CRTH2(+) ILC2s were enriched in nasal polyps of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, a typical type 2-mediated disease. Nasal polyp epithelial cells expressed TSLP, which enhanced STAT5 activation, GATA3 expression, and type 2 cytokine production in ILC2s. Ectopic expression of GATA3 in Lin(-)CD127(+)CRTH2(-) cells resulted in induction of CRTH2 and the capacity to produce high amounts of type 2 cytokines in response to TSLP plus IL-33. Hence, we identify GATA3, potently regulated by TSLP, as an essential transcription factor for the function of human ILC2s.","2359":null,"2360":"T helper (Th) cells are critical for defenses against infection and recognize peptides bound to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) molecules.

Here, we showed that the two transcription factors Thpok and LRF share this function. Although disruption of both factors did not prevent the generation of MHC II-specific T cells, these cells failed to express Th cell genes or undergo Th cell differentiation in vivo. In contrast, T cells lacking Thpok, which only displayed LRF-dependent functions, contributed to multiple effector responses, both in vitro and in vivo, with the notable exception of Th2 cell responses that control extracellular parasites. These findings identify the Thpok-LRF pair as a core node of Th cell differentiation and function.","2361":null,"2362":"Lymphocytes provide optimal responses against pathogens with minimal inflammatory pathology.

Egr2- and Egr3-defective B and T cells had hyperactive signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3 while antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factor AP-1 was severely impaired. We discovered that Egr2 and\/or Egr3 directly induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, inhibitors of STAT1 and STAT3, and also blocked the function of Batf, an AP-1 inhibitor, in B and T cells. Thus, Egr2 and Egr3 regulate B and T cell function in adaptive immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and controlling inflammation.","2363":"After an immune response, the expanded population of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells contract to steady state levels. We have found that the contraction is neither cell-autonomous nor mediated by competition for generic trophic factors, but regulated by relatively rare subsets of neighboring CD4(+) T cells not necessarily of a conventional regulatory T cell lineage. These regulators, referred to as deletors, specifically limit the frequency of particular antigen-specific T cells even though they are not reactive to the same agonist as their targets. Instead, an isolated deletor could outcompete the target for recognition of a shared, nonstimulatory endogenous peptide-MHC ligand. This mechanism was sufficient to prevent even agonist-driven autoimmune disease in a lymphopenic environment. Such a targeted regulation of homeostasis within narrow colonies of T cells with related TCR specificities for subthreshold ligands might help to prevent the loss of unrelated TCRs during multiple responses, preserving the valuable diversity of the repertoire.","2364":null,"2365":null,"2366":null,"2367":null,"2368":null,"2369":"Successful vaccine development for infectious diseases has largely been achieved in settings where natural immunity to the pathogen results in clearance in at least some individuals.

Some of the principles of such strategies may also apply for defense against exogenous retroviruses including HIV-1.

Intestinal IL-22 was produced after bone marrow transplant by IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) from the transplant recipients, and intestinal IL-22 increased in response to pretransplant conditioning. However, ILC frequency and IL-22 amounts were decreased by GVHD. Recipient IL-22 deficiency led to increased crypt apoptosis, depletion of ISCs, and loss of epithelial integrity.

In this regard, we have previously described DNGR-1 (CLEC9A) as a DC-restricted receptor specific for an unidentified DAMP that is exposed by necrotic cells and is necessary for efficient priming of cytotoxic T cells against dead cell-associated antigens. Here, we have shown that the DNGR-1 ligand is preserved from yeast to man and corresponds to the F-actin component of the cellular cytoskeleton.

HLA-E alone induced Crk phosphorylation in NKG2A(+) NK cells. At activating synapses with Fc alone, Crk was required for the movement of Fc microclusters and their ability to trigger activation signals. At inhibitory synapses, HLA-E promoted central accumulation of both Fc and phosphorylated Crk and blocked the Fc-induced buildup of F-actin. We propose a unified model for inhibitory receptor function: Crk phosphorylation prevents essential Crk-dependent activation signals and blocks F-actin network formation, thereby reducing constraints on subsequent engagement of activation receptors.","2478":null,"2479":"T helper 17 (Th17) cells play an important role in mucosal host defense through production of the signature cytokines IL-17 and IL-22.

However, when present during Th17 cell differentiation, we found that PGE2 inhibited the transcription factor IRF4 and suppressed production of IL-17 but not IL-22. We show that IRF4 was required for IL-17 expression but inhibited IL-22 expression, highlighting the potential for discordant regulation of these two cytokines in Th17 cells. The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans produces PGE2, and we found that it uses PGE2- and IRF4-dependent mechanisms to specifically inhibit induction of IL-17 during Th17 cell differentiation. Blockade of host PGE2 during infection led to increased IL-17 production from CD4(+) T cells and increased survival of mice.

Toll-7, along with additional uncharacterized Drosophila Tolls, was transcriptionally induced by VSV infection. Furthermore, Toll-7 interacted with VSV at the plasma membrane and induced antiviral autophagy independently of the canonical Toll signaling pathway.

In vivo analysis revealed that lipid binding by dMyD88 was necessary for its antimicrobial and developmental functions as well as for the recruitment of the downstream cytosolic adaptor Tube to the cell surface. These data are reminiscent of the interactions between the mammalian Toll adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP with one major exception. In the mammalian system, MyD88 is the cytosolic adaptor that depends on the phosphoinositide-binding protein TIRAP for its recruitment to the cell surface. We therefore propose that dMyD88 is the functional homolog of TIRAP and that both proteins function as sorting adaptors to recruit downstream signaling adaptors to activated receptors.","2482":"Central tolerance can be mediated by peripheral dendritic cells (DCs) that transport innocuous antigens (Ags) to the thymus for presentation to developing T cells, but the responsible DC subsets remained poorly defined.

We show here that CCR9 mediated efficient thymic entry of endogenous or i.v. transfused pDCs. pDCs activated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands downregulated CCR9 and lost their ability to home to the thymus. Moreover, endogenous pDCs took up subcutaneously injected fluorescent Ag and, in the absence of TLR signals, transported Ag to the thymus in a CCR9-dependent fashion. Injected, Ag-loaded pDCs effectively deleted Ag-specific thymocytes, and this thymic clonal deletion required CCR9-mediated homing and was prevented by infectious signals. Thus, peripheral pDCs can contribute to immune tolerance through CCR9-dependent transport of peripheral Ags and subsequent deletion of Ag-reactive thymocytes.","2483":null,"2484":"Numerous regulatory programs have been identified that contribute to the restoration of homeostasis at the conclusion of immune responses and to safeguarding against the detrimental effects of chronic inflammation and autoimmune pathology.

Here, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating the onset of this transition, HEB and E2A also play a separate role in CD4(+) lineage choice. Deletion of HEB and E2A in DP thymocytes specifically blocked the development of CD4(+) lineage T cells. Furthermore, deletion of the E protein inhibitors Id2 and Id3 allowed CD4(+) T cell development but blocked CD8(+) lineage development. Analysis of the CD4(+) lineage transcriptional regulators ThPOK and Gata3 placed HEB and E2A upstream of CD4(+) lineage specification. These studies identify an important role for E proteins in the activation of CD4(+) lineage differentiation as thymocytes undergo the DP to SP transition.","2492":"The evolutionary conserved Foxo transcription factors are important regulators of quiescence and longevity. Although, Foxo1 is known to be important in regulating CD8(+) T cell trafficking and homeostasis, its role in functional differentiation of antigen-stimulated CD8(+) T cells is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that inactivation of Foxo1 was essential for instructing T-bet transcription factor-mediated effector differentiation of CD8(+) T cells. The Foxo1 inactivation was dependent on mTORC1 kinase, given that blockade of mTORC1 abrogated mTORC2-mediated Akt (Ser473) kinase phosphorylation, resulting in Foxo1-dependent switch from T-bet to Eomesodermin transcription factor activation and increase in memory precursors. Silencing Foxo1 ablated interleukin-12- and rapamycin-enhanced CD8(+) T cell memory responses and restored T-bet-mediated effector functions. These results demonstrate an essential role of Foxo1 in actively repressing effector or terminal differentiation processes to promote memory CD8(+) T cell development and identify the functionally diverse mechanisms utilized by Foxo1 to promote quiescence and longevity.","2493":"Overproduction of cytokines by T helper 2 (Th2) cells in the lung is thought to be a cause of asthma. Here we report that innate lymphocytes termed lung natural helper (LNH) cells are a T cell-independent source of Th2 cell-type cytokines in protease allergen-treated lungs. LNH (Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+\/lo)CD25(+)CD127(+)) cells, when stimulated by IL-33 plus IL-2, IL-7, or thymic stroma lymphopoietin (TSLP), produced large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Intranasal administration of protease allergen papain induced eosinophil infiltration and mucus hyperproduction in the lung of wild-type and Rag1(-\/-) mice, but not in Rag2(-\/-)Il2rg(-\/-) mice that lack LNH cells. LNH cell depletion inhibited papain-induced airway inflammation in Rag1(-\/-) mice whereas adoptive transfer of LNH cells enabled Rag2(-\/-)Il2rg(-\/-) mice to respond to papain. Treatment of lung explants with papain induced IL-33 and TSLP production by stroma cells and IL-5 and IL-13 production by LNH cells. Thus, LNH cells are critical for protease allergen-induced airway inflammation.","2494":null,"2495":null,"2496":"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV-1 replication but cannot eliminate the virus because HIV-1 establishes latent infection. Interruption of HAART leads to a rapid rebound of viremia, so life-long treatment is required. Efforts to purge the latent reservoir have focused on reactivating latent proviruses without inducing global T cell activation. However, the killing of the infected cells after virus reactivation, which is essential for elimination of the reservoir, has not been assessed. Here we show that after reversal of latency in an in vitro model, infected resting CD4(+) T cells survived despite viral cytopathic effects, even in the presence of autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from most patients on HAART. Antigen-specific stimulation of patient CTLs led to efficient killing of infected cells. These results demonstrate that stimulating HIV-1-specific CTLs prior to reactivating latent HIV-1 may be essential for successful eradication efforts and should be considered in future clinical trials.","2497":null,"2498":null,"2499":null,"2500":"Parallels between T cell kinetics in mice and men have fueled the idea that a young mouse is a good model system for a young human, and an old mouse, for an elderly human. By combining in vivo kinetic labeling using deuterated water, thymectomy experiments, analysis of T cell receptor excision circles and CD31 expression, and mathematical modeling, we have quantified the contribution of thymus output and peripheral naive T cell division to the maintenance of T cells in mice and men. Aging affected naive T cell maintenance fundamentally differently in mice and men. Whereas the naive T cell pool in mice was almost exclusively sustained by thymus output throughout their lifetime, the maintenance of the adult human naive T cell pool occurred almost exclusively through peripheral T cell division. These findings put constraints on the extrapolation of insights into T cell dynamics from mouse to man and vice versa.","2501":null,"2502":"A main role for interleukin-4 (IL-4) is in humoral immunity, and follicular helper CD4(+) T (Tfh) cells may be an intrinsic IL-4 source. Here we demonstrate that conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2) is an essential enhancer element for IL-4 expression in Tfh cells but not in Th2 cells. Mice with a CNS2 deletion had a reduction in IgG1 and IgE production and in IL-4 expression in Tfh cells. Tracking of CNS2 activity via a GFP reporter mouse demonstrated that CNS2-active cells expressed several markers of Tfh cells: CXCR5, PD-1, and ICOS; the transcriptional master regulator Bcl6; and the cytokines IL-21 and IL-4. These CNS2-active cells were mainly localized in B cell follicles and germinal centers. The GFP(+) Tfh cells were derived from GFP(-) naive T cells after in vivo systemic immunization. These results indicate that CNS2 is an essential enhancer element required for IL-4 expression in Tfh cells controlling humoral immunity.","2503":"Interferons (IFNs) were discovered as cytokines induced during and protecting from viral infection. They have been documented to play essential roles in numerous physiological processes beyond antiviral and antimicrobial defense, including immunomodulation, cell cycle regulation, cell survival, and cell differentiation. Recent data have also uncovered a potentially darker side to IFN, including roles in inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmunity and diabetes. IFN can have effects in the absence of acute infection, highlighting a physiologic role for constitutive IFN. Type I IFNs are constitutively produced at vanishingly low quantities and yet exert profound effects, mediated in part through modulation of signaling intermediates required for responses to diverse cytokines. We review evidence for a yin-yang of IFN function through its role in modulating crosstalk between multiple cytokines by both feedforward and feedback regulation of common signaling intermediates and postulate a homeostatic role for IFN through tonic signaling in the absence of acute infection.","2504":"In this issue of Immunity, den Braber et al.

Here, we describe transgenic zebrafish lines enabling the in vivo observation of thymopoiesis. The cell-autonomous proliferation of thymic epithelial cells, their morphological transformation into a reticular meshwork upon contact with hematopoietic cells, and the multiple migration routes of thymus-settling cells could be directly visualized. The unexpectedly dynamic thymus homing process is chemokine driven and independent of blood circulation. Thymocyte development appears to be completed in less than 4 days. Our work establishes a versatile model for the in vivo observation and manipulation of thymopoiesis.","2512":"Circadian rhythms refer to biologic processes that oscillate with a period of ~24 hr. These rhythms are sustained by a molecular clock and provide a temporal matrix that ensures the coordination of homeostatic processes with the periodicity of environmental challenges. We demonstrate the circadian molecular clock controls the expression and function of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). In a vaccination model using TLR9 ligand as adjuvant, mice immunized at the time of enhanced TLR9 responsiveness presented weeks later with an improved adaptive immune response. In a TLR9-dependent mouse model of sepsis, we found that disease severity was dependent on the timing of sepsis induction, coinciding with the daily changes in TLR9 expression and function. These findings unveil a direct molecular link between the circadian and innate immune systems with important implications for immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy.","2513":"Janus kinases (JAKs) are key effectors in controlling immune responses and maintaining hematopoiesis. SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3) is a major regulator of JAK signaling and here we investigate the molecular basis of its mechanism of action. We found that SOCS3 bound and directly inhibited the catalytic domains of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 but not JAK3 via an evolutionarily conserved motif unique to JAKs. Mutation of this motif led to the formation of an active kinase that could not be inhibited by SOCS3. Surprisingly, we found that SOCS3 simultaneously bound JAK and the cytokine receptor to which it is attached, revealing how specificity is generated in SOCS action and explaining why SOCS3 inhibits only a subset of cytokines. Importantly, SOCS3 inhibited JAKs via a noncompetitive mechanism, making it a template for the development of specific and effective inhibitors to treat JAK-based immune and proliferative diseases.","2514":"Follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells) are the major producers of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in secondary lymphoid organs where humoral immune responses develop. Il4 regulation in Tfh cells appears distinct from the classical T helper 2 (Th2) cell pathway, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We found that hypersensitivity site V (HS V; also known as CNS2), a 3' enhancer in the Il4 locus, is essential for IL-4 production by Tfh cells. Mice lacking HS V display marked defects in type 2 humoral immune responses, as evidenced by abrogated IgE and sharply reduced IgG1 production in vivo. In contrast, effector Th2 cells that are involved in tissue responses were far less dependent on HS V. HS V facilitated removal of repressive chromatin marks during Th2 and Tfh cell differentiation and increased accessibility of the Il4 promoter. Thus, Tfh and Th2 cells utilize distinct but overlapping molecular mechanisms to regulate Il4, a finding with important implications for understanding the molecular basis of allergic diseases.","2515":null,"2516":"The emerging notion of environment-induced reprogramming of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells into helper T (Th) cells remains controversial.

In contrast, Treg cells did not undergo reprogramming under those conditions irrespective of their thymic or peripheral origins. Moreover, although a few Treg cells transiently lose Foxp3 expression, such \"latent\" Treg cells retained their memory and robustly re-expressed Foxp3 and suppressive function upon activation. This study establishes that Treg cells constitute a stable cell lineage, whose committed state in a changing environment is ensured by DNA demethylation of the Foxp3 locus irrespectively of ongoing Foxp3 expression.","2517":"The Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88 is essential for the regulation of intestinal homeostasis in mammals. In this study, we determined that Myd88-deficient mice are susceptible to colonic damage that is induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration resulting from uncontrolled dissemination of intestinal commensal bacteria. The DSS-induced mortality of Myd88-deficient mice was completely prevented by antibiotic treatment to deplete commensal bacteria. By using cell type-specific Myd88-deficient mice, we established that B cell-intrinsic MyD88 signaling plays a central role in the resistance to DSS-induced colonic damage via the production of IgM and complement-mediated control of intestinal bacteria. Our results indicate that the lack of intact MyD88 signaling in B cells, coupled with impaired epithelial integrity, enables commensal bacteria to function as highly pathogenic organisms, causing rapid host death.","2518":null,"2519":null,"2520":"Epithelial cells of mucosal tissues provide a barrier against environmental stress, and keratinocytes are key decision makers for immune cell function in the skin.

In vivo and in vitro deficiency of ADAM17 dampened Notch signaling, increasing production of the Th2 cell-polarizing cytokine TSLP and myeloid growth factor G-CSF. Ligand-independent Notch activation was identified as a regulator of AP-1 transcriptional activity, with Notch antagonizing c-Fos recruitment to the promoters of Tslp and Csf3 (G-CSF). Further, skin inflammation was rescued and myeloproliferation ameliorated by delivery of active Notch to Adam17(-)(\/-) epidermis. Our findings uncover an essential role of ADAM17 in the adult epidermis, demonstrating a gatekeeper function of the ADAM17-Notch-c-Fos triad in barrier immunity.","2521":"Models of hematopoiesis often depict lymphocyte production as a uniform process in which a homogenous population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generates progenitors from which all types of lymphocytes are derived. However, it is increasingly evident that these schemes are too simplistic and that the lymphoid potential of HSCs and precursors arising in the embryo, fetus, neonate, and adult is remarkably distinct. We review recent findings regarding the development of B lymphocytes, and the B-1 B cell lineage in particular, as a case in point. These studies show that B-1 and B-2 B cells involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively, arise in staggered waves of development from distinct progenitors.

With 3-dimensional principal component analysis (3D-PCA) to display phenotypic diversity, we observed a relatively uniform pattern of variation in all subjects tested, highlighting the interrelatedness of previously described subsets and the continuous nature of CD8(+) T cell differentiation. These data also showed much greater complexity in the CD8(+) T cell compartment than previously appreciated, including a nearly combinatorial pattern of cytokine expression, with distinct niches occupied by virus-specific cells. This large degree of functional diversity even between cells with the same specificity gives CD8(+) T cells a remarkable degree of flexibility in responding to pathogens.","2529":"Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles defending against tumors and pathogens. We show that mice lacking both transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet failed to develop NK cells. Developmental stability of immature NK cells constitutively expressing the death ligand TRAIL depended on T-bet. Conversely, maturation characterized by loss of constitutive TRAIL expression and induction of Ly49 receptor diversity and integrin CD49b (DX5(+)) required Eomes. Mature NK cells from which Eomes was deleted reverted to phenotypic immaturity if T-bet was present or downregulated NK lineage antigens if T-bet was absent, despite retaining expression of Ly49 receptors. Fetal and adult hepatic hematopoiesis restricted Eomes expression and limited NK development to the T-bet-dependent, immature stage, whereas medullary hematopoiesis permitted Eomes-dependent NK maturation in adult mice. These findings reveal two sequential, genetically separable checkpoints of NK cell maturation, the progression of which is metered largely by the anatomic localization of hematopoiesis.","2530":null,"2531":null,"2532":null,"2533":null,"2534":"CD8(+) T cells undergo major metabolic changes upon activation, but how metabolism influences the establishment of long-lived memory T cells after infection remains a key question.

SRC is the extra capacity available in cells to produce energy in response to increased stress or work and as such is associated with cellular survival. We found that interleukin-15 (IL-15), a cytokine critical for CD8(+) memory T cells, regulated SRC and oxidative metabolism by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT1a), a metabolic enzyme that controls the rate-limiting step to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO).

Utilizing a model of mucosal immunization with the encapsulated bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae, we found that B cells, which largely recognized polysaccharide capsular antigens, afforded protection to only the vaccine strain. In contrast, memory Th17 cells proliferated in response to conserved outer membrane proteins and conferred protection against several serotypes of K. pneumoniae, including the recently described multidrug resistant New Dehli metallolactamase strain. Notably, this heterologous, clade-specific protection was antibody independent, demonstrating the Th17 cell lineage confers a host advantage by providing heterologous mucosal immunity independent of serotype-specific antibody.","2537":"Little is known about mechanisms determining the homeostasis of lymphocytes within lymphoid organs. Applying different mouse models, including conditionally proficient Ccr7 gene-targeted mice, we now show that semimature steady state dendritic cells (sDCs) constitutively trafficking into lymph nodes (LNs) were essential contributors to T cell homeostasis in these organs. sDCs provided vascular endothelial growth factor known to support high endothelial venule formation, thus facilitating enhanced homing of T cells to LNs. The presence of sDCs led to increased CCL21 production in T-zone fibroblastic reticular cells. CCL21 is a ligand for CCR7 known to regulate homing as well as retention of T cells in LNs. In addition, we provide evidence that CCL21 binds to the surface of DCs via its heparin-binding domain, further explaining why T cells leave LNs more rapidly in the absence of sDCs. Together, these data reveal multiple roles for sDCs in regulating T cell homeostasis in LNs.","2538":"Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells comprise an important subset of helper T cells; however, their relationship with other helper lineages is incompletely understood. Herein, we showed interleukin-12 acting via the transcription factor STAT4 induced both Il21 and Bcl6 genes, generating cells with features of both Tfh and Th1 cells. However, STAT4 also induced the transcription factor T-bet. With ChIP-seq, we defined the genome-wide targets of T-bet and found that it repressed Bcl6 and other markers of Tfh cells, thereby attenuating the nascent Tfh cell-like phenotype in the late phase of Th1 cell specification. Tfh-like cells were rapidly generated after Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice, but T-bet constrained Tfh cell expansion and consequent germinal center formation and antibody production. Our data argue that Tfh and Th1 cells share a transitional stage through the signal mediated by STAT4, which promotes both phenotypes. However, T-bet represses Tfh cell functionalities, promoting full Th1 cell differentiation.","2539":"Engagement of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 signals two diametrically opposed pathways: survival-inflammation and cell death. An additional switch decides, depending on the cellular context, between caspase-dependent apoptosis and RIP kinase (RIPK)-mediated necrosis, also termed necroptosis. We explored the contribution of both cell death pathways in TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Deletion of apoptotic executioner caspases (caspase-3 or -7) or inflammatory caspase-1 had no impact on lethal SIRS. However, deletion of RIPK3 conferred complete protection against lethal SIRS and reduced the amounts of circulating damage-associated molecular patterns. Pretreatment with the RIPK1 kinase inhibitor, necrostatin-1, provided a similar effect. These results suggest that RIPK1-RIPK3-mediated cellular damage by necrosis drives mortality during TNF-induced SIRS. RIPK3 deficiency also protected against cecal ligation and puncture, underscoring the clinical relevance of RIPK kinase inhibition in sepsis and identifying components of the necroptotic pathway that are potential therapeutic targets for treatment of SIRS and sepsis.","2540":"Pathogen and danger recognition by the inflammasome activates inflammatory caspases that mediate inflammation and cell death.

Deficiency in cIAP1 (encoded by Birc2) or cIAP2 (Birc3) impaired caspase-1 activation after spontaneous or agonist-induced inflammasome assembly, and Birc2(-\/-) or Birc3(-\/-) mice or mice administered with an IAP antagonist had a dampened response to inflammasome agonists and were resistant to peritonitis.

Upon antigenic stimulation and microbial infection, pDCs suppressed the induction of CD4(+) T cell responses and participated in the initiation of CD8(+) T cell responses. Furthermore, Siglec-H appeared to modulate the function of pDCs in vivo.

MYSM1 deficiency results in a block in early B cell commitment and a defect of B cell progenitors in expression of EBF1 and other B lymphoid genes. We further demonstrated that MYSM1 derepresses EBF1 transcription in B cell progenitors by orchestrating histone modifications and transcription factor recruitment to the EBF1 locus. Thus, this study not only uncovers the essential role for MYSM1 in gene transcription during early B cell development but also underscores the biological significance of reversible epigenetic histone H2A ubiquitination.","2553":null,"2554":null,"2555":"STAT3 transcription factor signaling in specific T helper cell differentiation has been well described, although the broader roles for STAT3 in lymphocyte memory are less clear. Patients with autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) carry dominant-negative STAT3 mutations and are susceptible to a variety of bacterial and fungal infections. We found that AD-HIES patients have a cell-intrinsic defect in the number of central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to healthy controls. Naive T cells from AD-HIES patients had lower expression of memory-related transcription factors BCL6 and SOCS3, a primary proliferation defect, and they failed to acquire central memory-like surface phenotypes in vitro. AD-HIES patients showed a decreased ability to control varicella zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency, and T cell memory to both of these viruses was compromised. These data point to a specific role for STAT3 in human central memory T cell formation and in control of certain chronic viruses.","2556":"Memory CD8(+) T cells are critical for long-term immunity, but the genetic pathways governing their formation remain poorly defined. This study shows that the IL-10-IL-21-STAT3 pathway is critical for memory CD8(+) T cell development after acute LCMV infection. In the absence of either interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-21 or STAT3, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells retain terminal effector (TE) differentiation states and fail to mature into protective memory T cells that contain self-renewing central memory T cells. Expression of Eomes, BCL-6, Blimp-1, and SOCS3 was considerably reduced in STAT3-deficient memory CD8(+) T cells, and BCL-6- or SOCS3-deficient CD8(+) T cells also had perturbed memory cell development. Reduced SOCS3 expression rendered STAT3-deficient CD8(+) T cells hyperresponsive to IL-12, suggesting that the STAT3-SOCS3 pathway helps to insulate memory precursor cells from inflammatory cytokines that drive TE differentiation. Thus, memory CD8(+) T cell precursor maturation is an active process dependent on IL-10-IL-21-STAT3 signaling.","2557":"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are key regulators of insect immune responses. In addition to recognition PGRPs, which activate the Toll and Imd pathways, the Drosophila genome encodes six catalytic PGRPs with the capacity to scavenge peptidoglycan. We have performed a systematic analysis of catalytic PGRP function using deletions, separately and in combination. Our findings support the role of PGRP-LB as a negative regulator of the Imd pathway and brought to light a synergy of PGRP-SCs with PGRP-LB in the systemic response. Flies lacking all six catalytic PGRPs were still viable but exhibited deleterious immune responses to innocuous gut infections. Together with recent studies on mammalian PGRPs, our study uncovers a conserved role for PGRPs in gut homeostasis. Analysis of the immune phenotype of flies lacking all catalytic PGRPs and the Imd regulator Pirk reveals that the Imd-mediated immune response is highly constrained by the existence of multiple negative feedbacks.","2558":"The regulation of memory CD4(+) helper T (Th) cell function, such as polarized cytokine production, remains unclear. Here we show that memory T helper 2 (Th2) cells are divided into four subpopulations by CD62L and CXCR3 expression. All four subpopulations produced interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, whereas only the CD62L(lo)CXCR3(lo) population produced IL-5 accompanied by increased H3-K4 methylation at the Il5 gene locus. The transcription factor Eomesodermin (encoded by Eomes) was highly expressed in memory Th2 cells, whereas its expression was selectively downregulated in the IL-5-producing cells. Il5 expression was enhanced in Eomes-deficient cells, and Eomesodermin was shown to interact with the transcription factor GATA3, preventing GATA3 binding to the Il5 promoter. Memory Th2 cell-dependent airway inflammation was attenuated in the absence of the CD62L(lo)CXCR3(lo) population but was enhanced by Eomes-deficient memory Th2 cells. Thus, IL-5 production in memory Th2 cells is regulated by Eomesodermin via the inhibition of GATA3 activity.","2559":"The discovery that Bcl-6 was the transcriptional regulator of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells completed the recognition of this population as an effector subset specialized in the provision of help to B cells. Improved reagents and recent models that allow tracking of Bcl-6-expressing T cells have revealed that the decision to become a Tfh cell occurs soon after T cells are primed by dendritic cells and start dividing, before interaction with B cells. The latter are important for sustaining Bcl-6 expression. Bcl-6 coordinates a signaling program that changes expression or function of multiple guidance receptors, leading to Tfh cell localization within germinal centers. This program is not unique to CD4(+) helper T cells; FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells and NKT cells co-opt the follicular differentiation pathway to enter the follicle and become specialized follicular cells. This review will focus on recent insights into the early events that determine Tfh cell differentiation.","2560":"Defining mast cell (MC) function has been clouded by use of mice with Kit mutations.

Studies in Kit mutant mice suggest key roles for mast cells in certain antibody- and T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. However, Kit mutations affect multiple cell types of both immune and nonimmune origin. Here, we show that targeted insertion of Cre-recombinase into the mast cell carboxypeptidase A3 locus deleted mast cells in connective and mucosal tissues by a genotoxic Trp53-dependent mechanism. Cre-mediated mast cell eradication (Cre-Master) mice had, with the exception of a lack of mast cells and reduced basophils, a normal immune system. Cre-Master mice were refractory to IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and this defect was rescued by mast cell reconstitution. This mast cell-deficient strain was fully susceptible to antibody-induced autoimmune arthritis and to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Differences comparing Kit mutant mast cell deficiency models to selectively mast cell-deficient mice call for a systematic re-evaluation of immunological functions of mast cells beyond allergy.","2567":null,"2568":"T cell receptor (TCR) engagement of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is essential to adaptive immunity, but it is unknown whether TCR signaling responses are influenced by the binding topology of the TCR-peptide-MHC complex. We developed yeast-displayed pMHC libraries that enabled us to identify new peptide sequences reactive with a single TCR. Structural analysis showed that four peptides bound to the TCR with distinct 3D and 2D affinities using entirely different binding chemistries. Three of the peptides that shared a common docking mode, where key TCR-MHC germline interactions are preserved, induced TCR signaling. The fourth peptide failed to induce signaling and was recognized in a substantially different TCR-MHC binding mode that apparently exceeded geometric tolerances compatible with signaling. We suggest that the stereotypical TCR-MHC docking paradigm evolved from productive signaling geometries and that TCR signaling can be modulated by peptides that are recognized in alternative TCR-pMHC binding orientations.","2569":"Neutrophils, critical innate immune effectors, use bacterial-derived chemoattractant-induced G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling for their pursuit of bacteria. Tyrosine phosphorylation pathways and receptor-like tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are rarely considered in chemoattractant-mediated GPCR signaling. Here, we report that two RPTPs, CD45 and CD148, previously shown to share redundant roles in positively regulating Src family kinases (SFKs) in immunoreceptor signaling pathways in B cells and macrophages, are critical in the neutrophil response to S. aureus infection and, surprisingly, in chemoattractant-mediated chemotaxis. Remarkably, deficiency in either of these RPTPs influenced neutrophil GPCR responses in unique ways. Our results reveal that CD45 positively while CD148 positively and negatively regulate GPCR function and proximal signals including Ca(2+), phosphatidylinositol 3'OH kinase (PI3K), and phospho-extracellular regulated kinase (pERK) activity. Moreover, our results suggest that CD45 and CD148 preferentially target different SFK members (Hck and Fgr versus Lyn, respectively) to positively and negatively regulate GPCR pathways.","2570":"Early events in atherosclerosis occur in the aortic intima and involve monocytes that become macrophages. We looked for these cells in the steady state adult mouse aorta, and surprisingly, we found a dominance of dendritic cells (DCs) in the intima. In contrast to aortic adventitial macrophages, CD11c(+)MHC II(hi) DCs were poorly phagocytic but were immune stimulatory. DCs were of two types primarily: classical Flt3-Flt3L signaling-dependent, CD103(+)CD11b(-) DCs and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-dependent, CD14(+)CD11b(+)DC-SIGN(+) monocyte-derived DCs. Both types expanded during atherosclerosis. By crossing Flt3(-\/-) to Ldlr(-\/-) atherosclerosis-prone mice, we developed a selective and marked deficiency of classical CD103(+) aortic DCs, and they were associated with exacerbated atherosclerosis without alterations in blood lipids. Concomitantly, the Flt3(-\/-)Ldlr(-\/-) mice had fewer Foxp3(+) Treg cells and increased inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in the aorta. Therefore, functional DCs are dominant in normal aortic intima and, in contrast to macrophages, CD103(+) classical DCs are associated with atherosclerosis protection.","2571":"Recognition of nucleic acids as a signature of infection by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 exposes the host to potential self-recognition and autoimmunity. It has been proposed that intracellular compartmentalization is largely responsible for reliable self versus nonself discrimination by these receptors. We have previously shown that TLR9 and TLR7 require processing prior to activation, which may further reinforce receptor compartmentalization and tolerance to self, yet this possibility remains untested. Here we report that residues within the TLR9 transmembrane (TM) region conferred the requirement for ectodomain proteolysis. TLR9 TM mutants responded to extracellular DNA, and mice expressing such receptors died from systemic inflammation and anemia. This inflammatory disease did not require lymphocytes and appeared to require recognition of self-DNA by dendritic cells. To our knowledge, these results provide the first demonstration that TLR-intrinsic mutations can lead to a break in tolerance.","2572":"Anergic B cells are characterized by impaired signaling and activation after aggregation of their antigen receptors (BCR). The molecular basis of this impairment is not understood. In studies reported here, Src homology-2 (SH2)-containing inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP-1 and its adaptor Dok-1 were found to be constitutively phosphorylated in anergic B cells, and activation of this inhibitory circuit was dependent on Src-family kinase activity and consequent to biased BCR immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) monophosphorylation. B cell-targeted deletion of SHIP-1 caused severe lupus-like disease. Moreover, absence of SHIP-1 in B cells led to loss of anergy as indicated by restoration of BCR signaling, loss of anergic surface phenotype, and production of autoantibodies. Thus, chronic BCR signals maintain anergy in part via ITAM monophosphorylation-directed activation of an inhibitory signaling circuit involving SHIP-1 and Dok-1.","2573":null,"2574":null,"2575":null,"2576":null,"2577":null,"2578":null,"2579":null,"2580":"Manipulation of cell death pathways has been identified as a common feature of host-microbe interactions. We examine two examples: influenza A as a representative acute infection and cytomegalovirus as an example of chronic infection. From the perspective of viral entry, replication, and transmission, we identify points of interconnection with the host response to infection, namely the induction of host cell death, inflammation, and immunity. Following from this analysis, we argue that the evolution and fine-tuned regulation of death-associated genes may result from constant microbial pressure--past and present--that helped to support and coordinate cell death programs within the host. Interestingly, the delay in host cell death allows time for the virus to replicate while perturbations in cell death allow the host cell to initiate an immune response. This may represent a genetically encoded trade-off ensuring survival of both host and virus, or it may be a part of the complex agenda of infectious microbes.","2581":null,"2582":"The mammalian immune system continually faces death in the form of its own dead and dying cells that arise during normal tissue turnover, infections, cellular damage, and cancer. Complex decisions must then be made that will permit a protective response to pathogens, while at the same time destroying tumors but not attacking vital systems of the host that could lead to autoimmunity. By using an investigative technique termed the five Ws (who, what, when, where, and why), we will examine how the immune system responds to antigens generated via cell death. This analysis will give us a better understanding of the molecular differences fundamental to tolerogenic or immunogenic cell death, the cells that sense and react to the dead cells, and the consequences of these fundamental elements on the maintenance or abrogation of tolerance.","2583":"Prompt and efficient clearance of apoptotic cells is necessary to prevent secondary necrosis of dying cells and to avoid immune responses to autoantigens. Recent studies have shed light on how apoptotic cells through soluble \"find-me\" signals advertise their presence to phagocytes at the earliest stages of cell death. Phagocytes sense the find-me signal gradient, and in turn the presence of dying cells, and migrate to their vicinity. The apoptotic cells also expose specific \"eat-me\" signals on their surface that are recognized by phagocytes through specific engulfment receptors. This review covers the recent progress in the areas of find-me and eat-me signals and how these relate to prompt and immunologically silent clearance of apoptotic cells.","2584":"All cells die, but the manner of death dictates interactions with living cells and consequences for the organism, especially with respect to the immune response.

One possibility is that the immune system senses the level of threat from a microorganism and augments the response accordingly. Here, focusing on cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), an Escherichia coli-derived effector molecule, we showed the host indirectly sensed the pathogen by monitoring for the effector that modified RhoGTPases. CNF1 modified Rac2, which then interacted with the innate immune adaptors IMD and Rip1-Rip2 in flies and mammalian cells, respectively, to drive an immune response. This response was protective and increased the ability of the host to restrict pathogen growth, thus defining a mechanism of effector-triggered immunity that contributes to how metazoans defend against microbes with pathogenic potential.","2588":"Dendritic cells (DCs) in tissues and lymphoid organs comprise distinct functional subsets that differentiate in situ from circulating progenitors. Tissue-specific signals that regulate DC subset differentiation are poorly understood. We report that DC-specific deletion of the Notch2 receptor caused a reduction of DC populations in the spleen. Within the splenic CD11b(+) DC subset, Notch signaling blockade ablated a distinct population marked by high expression of the adhesion molecule Esam. The Notch-dependent Esam(hi) DC subset required lymphotoxin beta receptor signaling, proliferated in situ, and facilitated CD4(+) T cell priming. The Notch-independent Esam(lo) DCs expressed monocyte-related genes and showed superior cytokine responses. In addition, Notch2 deletion led to the loss of CD11b(+)CD103(+) DCs in the intestinal lamina propria and to a corresponding decrease of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells in the intestine. Thus, Notch2 is a common differentiation signal for T cell-priming CD11b(+) DC subsets in the spleen and intestine.","2589":null,"2590":null,"2591":null,"2592":null,"2593":null,"2594":null,"2595":null,"2596":null,"2597":null,"2598":null,"2599":null,"2600":null,"2601":null,"2602":null,"2603":"Recent studies have documented genome-wide binding patterns of transcriptional regulators and their associated epigenetic marks in hematopoietic cell lineages.

Hematopoietic progenitors that express Id2 are multipotent and readily differentiate upon withdrawal of Id2 expression into committed B lineage cells, thus indicating a causative role for E2A (Tcf3) in promoting the B cell fate. Genome-wide analyses revealed that a substantial fraction of lymphoid and myeloid enhancers are premarked by the poised or active enhancer mark H3K4me1 in multipotent progenitors.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) produced by NPCs was responsible for the observed EAE suppression. Through the inducible LIF receptor expression, LIF inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells in EAE mice and that from MS subjects. At the molecular level, LIF exerted an opposing effect on interleukin 6 (IL-6)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation required for Th17 cell differentiation by triggering a signaling cascade that activated extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase (ERK) and upregulated suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression.

Increased localized neutrophil elastase (NE) activity during overt inflammation was observed in Tslp(-\/-) mice and was paralleled by reduced expression of an endogenous inhibitor, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI). Pharmacological inhibition of NE or treatment with rSLPI reduced DSS-induced mortality in Tslp(-\/-) mice. Signaling through TSLPR on nonhematopoietic cells was sufficient for recovery from DSS-induced colitis. Expression of the receptor occurred on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), with stimulation inducing SLPI expression. Therefore, TSLP is critical in mediating mucosal healing after insult and functions in a nonredundant capacity that is independent of restraining T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell cytokine production.","2621":null,"2622":null,"2623":null,"2624":null,"2625":null,"2626":"Vitamin A elicits a broad array of immune responses through its metabolite, retinoic acid (RA).

Substitution of the C-terminal tryptophan residue resulted in retention of perforin in the ER followed by calcium-dependent toxic activity that eliminated host cells. We also found that N-linked glycosylation of perforin was critical for transport from the Golgi to secretory granules.

Importantly, RLRs cooperate in signaling crosstalk networks with Toll-like receptors and other factors to impart innate immunity and to modulate the adaptive immune response. RLR regulation occurs at a variety of levels ranging from autoregulation to ligand and cofactor interactions and posttranslational modifications.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are known to limit microbe-triggered intestinal inflammation and the CD4+ T cell compartment is shaped by the presence of particular microbes or bacterial compounds. It is, however, difficult to distinguish whether these effects reflect true mutualistic immune adaptation to intestinal colonization or rather idiosyncratic immune responses. To investigate truly mutualistic CD4+ T cell adaptation, we used the altered Schaedler flora (ASF). Intestinal colonization resulted in activation and de novo generation of colonic Treg cells. Failure to activate Treg cells resulted in the induction of T helper 17 (Th17) and Th1 cell responses, which was reversed by wild-type Treg cells. Efficient Treg cell induction was also required to maintain intestinal homeostasis upon dextran sulfate sodium-mediated damage in the colon. Thus, microbiota colonization-induced Treg cell responses are a fundamental intrinsic mechanism to induce and maintain host-intestinal microbial T cell mutualism.","2671":null,"2672":"The intracellular sensor Nod2 is activated in response to bacteria, and the impairment of this response is linked to Crohn's disease. However, the function of Nod2 in host defense remains poorly understood. We found that Nod2-\/- mice exhibited impaired intestinal clearance of Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that models human infection by pathogenic Escherichia coli. The increased bacterial burden was preceded by reduced CCL2 chemokine production, inflammatory monocyte recruitment, and Th1 cell responses in the intestine. Colonic stromal cells, but not epithelial cells or resident CD11b+ phagocytic cells, produced CCL2 in response to C. rodentium in a Nod2-dependent manner. Unlike resident phagocytic cells, inflammatory monocytes produced IL-12, a cytokine that induces adaptive immunity required for pathogen clearance. Adoptive transfer of Ly6C(hi) monocytes restored the clearance of the pathogen in infected Ccr2-\/- mice. Thus, Nod2 mediates CCL2-CCR2-dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes, which is important in promoting bacterial eradication in the intestine.","2673":"Infection or vaccination confers heightened resistance to pathogen rechallenge because of quantitative and qualitative differences between naive and primary memory T cells. Herein, we show that secondary (boosted) memory CD8+ T cells were better than primary memory CD8+ T cells in controlling some, but not all acute infections with diverse pathogens. However, secondary memory CD8+ T cells were less efficient than an equal number of primary memory cells at preventing chronic LCMV infection and are more susceptible to functional exhaustion. Importantly, localization of memory CD8+ T cells within lymph nodes, which is reduced by antigen restimulation, was critical for both viral control in lymph nodes and for the sustained CD8+ T cell response required to prevent chronic LCMV infection. Thus, repeated antigen stimulation shapes memory CD8+ T cell populations to either enhance or decrease per cell protective immunity in a pathogen-specific manner, a concept of importance in vaccine design against specific diseases.","2674":null,"2675":null,"2676":null,"2677":"Effector CD4+ T cell subsets, whose differentiation is facilitated by distinct cytokine cues, amplify the corresponding type of inflammatory response.

In this regard, STAT3, a transcription factor essential for T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, is necessary for Treg cell-mediated control of Th17 cell responses. Here, we showed that anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10), and not proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-23 cytokine signaling, endowed Treg cells with the ability to suppress pathogenic Th17 cell responses. Ablation of the IL-10 receptor in Treg cells resulted in selective dysregulation of Th17 cell responses and colitis similar to that observed in mice harboring STAT3-deficient Treg cells.

HP-induced mTOR enhances transcription factor T-bet for functional maturation and CD122 expression, which sensitizes for an IL-15-dependent memory transition by favoring transcription factor Eomesodermin over T-bet. Inhibition of mTOR blocks T-bet and CD122 expression but preserves memory in an IL-15-independent manner by promoting Eomesodermin expression. The ability of rapamycin to augment HP-induced memory was cell-intrinsic given that silencing mTOR in CD8+ T cells generated identical outcomes. Strikingly, HP-induced CD8+ T cell memory generated by IL-15-dependent or -independent mechanisms demonstrated identical tumor efficacy. These results indicate a central role for mTOR in HP-induced CD8+ T cell responses and demonstrate the importance for CD8+ memory in HP-induced tumor efficacy.","2680":"A large numbers of cell surface signaling molecules (CSSMs) have been molecularly identified and functionally characterized in recent years and, via these studies, our knowledge in the control of immune response has increased exponentially. Two major lines of evidence emerge. First, the majority of immune cells rely on one or few CSSMs to deliver a primary triggering signal to sense their environment, leading to initiation of an immune response. Second, both costimulatory CSSMs that promote the response, and coinhibitory CSSMs that inhibit the response, are required to control direction and magnitude of a given immune response. With such tight feedback, immune responses are tuned and returned to baseline. These findings extend well beyond our previous observation in the requirement for lymphocyte activation and argue a revisit of the traditional \"two-signal model\" for activation and tolerance of lymphocytes.

Here, we provide evidence that a lineage-determining transcription factor, T-bet, underwent asymmetric organization in activated T cells preparing to divide and that it was unequally partitioned into the two daughter cells. This unequal acquisition of T-bet appeared to result from its asymmetric destruction during mitosis by virtue of concomitant asymmetric segregation of the proteasome.

We demonstrated that low concentrations of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in the bloodstream drive CCR2-dependent emigration of monocytes from bone marrow. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their progeny, including CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, rapidly expressed MCP1 in response to circulating TLR ligands or bacterial infection and induced monocyte trafficking into the bloodstream. Targeted deletion of MCP1 from MSCs impaired monocyte emigration from bone marrow.

We have solved the crystal structure of the FOXP3 forkhead domain as a ternary complex with the DNA-binding domain of the transcription factor NFAT1 and a DNA oligonucleotide from the interleukin-2 promoter. A striking feature of this structure is that FOXP3 forms a domain-swapped dimer that bridges two molecules of DNA. Structure-guided or autoimmune disease (IPEX)-associated mutations in the domain-swap interface diminished dimer formation by the FOXP3 forkhead domain without compromising FOXP3 DNA binding. These mutations also eliminated T cell-suppressive activity conferred by FOXP3, both in vitro and in a murine model of autoimmune diabetes in vivo. We conclude that FOXP3-mediated suppressor function requires dimerization through the forkhead domain and that mutations in the dimer interface can lead to the systemic autoimmunity observed in IPEX patients.","2693":"It is well established that natural killer (NK) cells confer resistance to many viral diseases, but in only a few instances the molecular mechanisms whereby NK cells recognize virus-infected cells are known.

Ectromelia virus-infected cells expressing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib molecule Qa-1(b) are specifically recognized by the activating receptor formed by CD94 and NKG2E.

Viperin expression was potently induced after TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation and Viperin localized to the cytoplasmic lipid-enriched compartments, lipid bodies, in pDCs. Viperin interacted with the signal mediators IRAK1 and TRAF6 to recruit them to the lipid bodies and facilitated K63-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 to induce the nuclear translocation of transcription factor IRF7. Loss of Viperin reduced TLR7- and TLR9-mediated production of type I IFN by pDCs. However, Viperin was dispensable for the production of type I IFN induced by intracellular nucleic acids.

The dependence of RIP1 cleavage on the same molecular change as that facilitating RIG-I signaling allows for RIG-I signaling to be restricted in its duration without compromising its initial activation.","2707":null,"2708":null,"2709":null,"2710":"Natural killer T (NKT) cells respond to a variety of CD1d-restricted antigens (Ags), although the basis for Ag discrimination by the NKT cell receptor (TCR) is unclear.

The structures of five ternary complexes all revealed similar docking. Acyl chain modifications did not affect the interaction, but reduced NKT cell proliferation, indicating an affect on Ag processing or presentation. Conversely, truncation of the phytosphingosine chain caused an induced fit mode of TCR binding that affected TCR affinity. Modifications in the glycosyl head group had a direct impact on the TCR interaction and associated cellular response, with ligand potency reflecting the t(1\/2) life of the interaction.

Here, we discovered regulatory sequences that are interspersed in the distal V(H) gene region. These conserved repeat elements were characterized by the presence of Pax5 transcription factor-dependent active chromatin by binding of the regulators Pax5, E2A, CTCF, and Rad21, as well as by Pax5-dependent antisense transcription in pro-B cells. The Pax5-activated intergenic repeat (PAIR) elements were no longer bound by Pax5 in pre-B and B cells consistent with the loss of antisense transcription, whereas E2A and CTCF interacted with PAIR elements throughout early B cell development. The pro-B cell-specific and Pax5-dependent activity of the PAIR elements suggests that they are involved in the regulation of distal V(H)-DJ(H) recombination at the Igh locus.","2715":"V(D)J gene segment recombination is linked to the cell cycle by the periodic phosphorylation and destruction of the RAG-2 protein at the G1-to-S cell cycle transition. To examine the function of this coupling, we constructed mice in which the phosphorylation site at threonine 490 of RAG-2 was mutated to alanine. The RAG-2(T490A) mutation uncoupled DNA cleavage from cell cycle and promoted aberrant recombination. Similar aberrant recombination products were observed in mice deficient in the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase subunit, which is required for periodic destruction of RAG-2. On a p53-deficient background, the RAG-2(T490A) mutation induced lymphoid malignancies characterized by clonal chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes. Taken together, these observations provide a direct link between the periodic destruction of RAG-2 and lymphoid tumorigenesis. We infer that cell cycle control of the V(D)J recombinase limits the potential genomic damage that could otherwise result from RAG-mediated DNA cleavage.","2716":null,"2717":null,"2718":null,"2719":"A new report in Immunity shows that, rather than driving the metabolic changes required for proliferation, Akt controls the gene expression programs that determine whether activated CD8+ T cells differentiate into memory or effector cells.","2720":"In this issue of Immunity Ebert et al.

Here we use several mouse models to show that Treg cells, after their generation in lymph nodes, need to home to the gut to undergo local expansion to install oral tolerance. Proliferation of Treg cells in the intestine and production of interleukin-10 by gut-resident macrophages was blunted in mice deficient in the chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (CX3CR1).

Six months after 13 vaginal challenges with simian-HIV (SHIV)-SF162P3, four out of five vaccinated animals remained virus-negative, and the fifth was only transiently infected. None of the five animals seroconverted to p27gag-SIV. In contrast, all 6 placebo-vaccinated animals became infected and seroconverted. All protected animals showed gp41-specific vaginal IgAs with HIV-1 transcytosis-blocking properties and vaginal IgGs with neutralizing and\/or antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity activities. In contrast, plasma IgGs totally lacked virus-neutralizing activity.

Akt can control cell metabolism in many cell types but whether this role is important for CTL function has not been determined. Here we have shown that Akt does not mediate IL-2- or TCR-induced cell metabolic responses; rather, this role is assumed by other Akt-related kinases. There is, however, a nonredundant role for sustained and strong activation of Akt in CTL to coordinate the TCR- and IL-2-induced transcriptional programs that control expression of key cytolytic effector molecules, adhesion molecules, and cytokine and chemokine receptors that distinguish effector versus memory and naive T cells. Akt is thus dispensable for metabolism, but the strength and duration of Akt activity dictates the CTL transcriptional program and determines CTL fate.","2728":null,"2729":null,"2730":null,"2731":null,"2732":null,"2733":null,"2734":null,"2735":null,"2736":null,"2737":"Peripheral peptidolgycan (PGN) is present within antigen-presenting cells in the central nervous system (CNS) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, possibly playing a role in neuroinflammation.

Blood CXCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells comprised three subsets: T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cells. Th2 and Th17 cells within CXCR5(+), but not within CXCR5(-), compartment efficiently induced naive B cells to produce immunoglobulins via interleukin-21 (IL-21). In contrast, Th1 cells from both CXCR5(+) and CXCR5(-) compartments lacked the capacity to help B cells. Patients with juvenile dermatomyositis, a systemic autoimmune disease, displayed a profound skewing of blood CXCR5(+) Th cell subsets toward Th2 and Th17 cells. Importantly, the skewing of subsets correlated with disease activity and frequency of blood plasmablasts.

We demonstrate that after infection with Citrobacter rodentium, CD4(+) LTi cells were a dominant source of interleukin-22 (IL-22) early during infection. Infection-induced CD4(+) LTi cell responses were IL-23 dependent, and ablation of IL-23 impaired innate immunity. Further, depletion of CD4(+) LTi cells abrogated infection-induced expression of IL-22 and antimicrobial peptides, resulting in exacerbated host mortality. LTi cells were also found to be essential for host protective immunity in lymphocyte-replete hosts.

A recent vaccine regimen has shown modest efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. However, inducing long-term T and B cell memory and coping with HIV-1 diversity remain high priorities. Mediators of innate immunity may play pivotal roles in blocking infection and shaping immunity; vaccine strategies to capture these activities are under investigation.

Recent studies have used systems biology approaches to obtain a global picture of the immune responses to vaccination in humans.

We highlight how adjuvants can be used to influence the magnitude and alter the quality of the adaptive response in order to provide maximum protection against specific pathogens. Despite the impressive success of currently approved adjuvants for generating immunity to viral and bacterial infections, there remains a need for improved adjuvants that enhance protective antibody responses, especially in populations that respond poorly to current vaccines.

In some cases, the induction of cellular rather than humoral responses may be more important because the goal is to control and eliminate the existing infection rather than to prevent it. Our increased understanding of the mechanisms of antigen presentation, particularly with the description of DC subsets with distinct functions, as well as their plasticity in responding to extrinsic signals, represent opportunities to develop novel vaccines. In addition, we foresee that this increased knowledge will permit us to design vaccines that will reprogram the immune system to intervene therapeutically in cancer, allergy, and autoimmunity.","2789":"Vaccines work by eliciting an immune response and consequent immunological memory that mediates protection from infection or disease.

Integrins could induce polarization of an isoform of PIP5K1C, PIP5K1C-90, in neutrophils through intracellular vesicle transport independently of exogenous chemoattractant. PIP5K1C-90 polarization was required for polarized RhoA activation at uropods and provided an initial directional cue for neutrophil polarization on the endothelium.

Through direct signaling into T cells, IL-23 drove intestinal T cell proliferation, promoted intestinal Th17 cell accumulation, and enhanced the emergence of an IL-17A(+)IFN-gamma(+) population of T cells. Furthermore, IL-23R signaling in intestinal T cells suppressed the differentiation of Foxp3(+) cells and T cell IL-10 production. Although Il23r(-\/-) T cells displayed unimpaired Th1 cell differentiation, these cells showed impaired proliferation and failed to accumulate in the intestine.

IL-2 also delivers essential signals for thymic development of regulatory T (Treg) cells and later to promote their homeostasis and function. Each of these outcomes on T effector and Treg cells requires distinct amounts of IL-2R signaling, with low IL-2R signaling sufficient for many key aspects of Treg cells. Thus, tolerance is readily maintained and favored with limited IL-2.","2814":"In this issue of Immunity, Ahern et al.

LYP inhibits secondary T cell responses by suppressing Src family protein tyrosine kinases and is implicated in human autoimmunity. To determine the function of PTP-PEST in T cells, we generated mice with a conditionally deleted allele of Ptpn12. By removing PTP-PEST in T cells, we determined that PTP-PEST was not necessary for T cell development or primary responses. However, PTP-PEST was required for secondary T cell responses, anergy prevention, and autoimmunity induction. PTP-PEST specifically regulated the phosphorylation of Pyk2, a substrate of the Src family kinase Fyn. It also promoted the formation of T cell homoaggregates, which are known to enhance T cell activation. Thus, PTP-PEST controls Pyk2 activity and is a positive regulator of secondary T cell activation. These data illustrate the critical role of protein tyrosine phosphatases in T cell regulation.","2820":"Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are lipid-reactive, CD1d-restricted T lymphocytes important in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity. In addition to foreign antigens, NKT cells react with endogenous self lipids. However, in the face of stimulating self antigen, it remains unclear how overstimulation of NKT cells is avoided. We hypothesized that constantly degraded endogenous antigen only accumulates upon inhibition of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal-A) in lysosomes. Here, we show that alpha-Gal-A deficiency caused vigorous activation of NKT cells. Moreover, microbes induced inhibition of alpha-Gal-A activity in antigen-presenting cells. This temporary enzyme block depended on Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and ultimately triggered lysosomal lipid accumulation. Thus, we present TLR-dependent negative regulation of alpha-Gal-A as a mechanistic link between pathogen recognition and self lipid antigen induction for NKT cells.","2821":"T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) is a transcription factor known to act downstream of the canonical Wnt pathway and is essential for normal T cell development. However, its physiological roles in mature CD8(+) T cell responses are unknown. Here we showed that TCF-1 deficiency limited proliferation of CD8(+) effector T cells and impaired their differentiation toward a central memory phenotype. Moreover, TCF-1-deficient memory CD8(+) T cells were progressively lost over time, exhibiting reduced expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 and interleukin-2 receptor beta chain and diminished IL-15-driven proliferation. TCF-1 was directly associated with the Eomes allele and the Wnt-TCF-1 pathway was necessary and sufficient for optimal Eomes expression in naive and memory CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, forced expression of Eomes partly protected TCF-1-deficient memory CD8(+) T cells from time-dependent attrition. Our studies thus identify TCF-1 as a critical player in a transcriptional program that regulates memory CD8 differentiation and longevity.","2822":"A large and diverse array of chemoattractants control leukocyte trafficking, but how these apparently redundant signals collaborate in vivo is still largely unknown. We previously demonstrated an absolute requirement for the lipid chemoattractant leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) and its receptor BLT1 for neutrophil recruitment into the joint in autoantibody-induced arthritis. We now demonstrate that BLT1 is required for neutrophils to deliver IL-1 into the joint to initiate arthritis. IL-1-expressing neutrophils amplify arthritis through the production of neutrophil-active chemokines from synovial tissue cells. CCR1 and CXCR2, two neutrophil chemokine receptors, operate nonredundantly to sequentially control the later phase of neutrophil recruitment into the joint and mediate all neutrophil chemokine activity in the model. Thus, we have uncovered a complex sequential relationship involving unique contributions from the lipid mediator LTB(4), the cytokine IL-1, and CCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine ligands that are all absolutely required for effective neutrophil recruitment into the joint.","2823":"A20 is a ubiquitin modifying enzyme that restricts NF-kappaB signals and protects cells against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced programmed cell death. Given recent data linking A20 (TNFAIP3) with human B cell lymphomas and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we have generated mice bearing a floxed allele of Tnfaip3 to interrogate A20's roles in regulating B cell functions. A20-deficient B cells are hyperresponsive to multiple stimuli and display exaggerated NF-kappaB responses to CD40-induced signals. Mice expressing absent or hypomorphic amounts of A20 in B cells possess elevated numbers of germinal center B cells, autoantibodies, and glomerular immunoglobulin deposits. A20-deficient B cells are resistant to Fas-mediated cell death, probably due to increased expression of NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-x. These findings show that A20 can restrict B cell survival, whereas A20 protects other cells from TNF-induced cell death. Our studies demonstrate how reduced A20 expression predisposes to autoimmunity.","2824":"Effective humoral immunity depends on the support of B cell responses by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Although it has been proposed that Tfh cell differentiation requires T-B interactions, the relative contribution of specific populations of Ag-presenting cells remains unknown. We employed three independent strategies that compromised interactions between CD4(+) T cells and activated B cells in vivo. Whereas the expansion of CD4(+) T cells was relatively unaffected, Tfh cell differentiation was completely blocked in all scenarios. Surprisingly, augmenting antigen presentation by non-B cells rescued Tfh cell differentiation, as determined by surface phenotype, gene expression, and germinal center localization. We conclude that although Ag presentation by responding B cells is typically required for the generation of Tfh cells, this does not result from the provision of a unique B cell-derived signal, but rather because responding B cells rapidly become the primary source of antigen.","2825":"Follicular (FO) and marginal zone (MZ) B cells are maintained in distinct locations within the spleen, but the genetic basis for this separation is still enigmatic. We now report that B cell sequestration requires lineage-specific regulation of migratory receptors by the transcription factor Klf2. Moreover, using gene-targeted mice we show that altered splenic B cell migration confers a significant in vivo gain-of-function phenotype to FO B cells, including the ability to quickly respond to MZ-associated antigens and pathogens in a T cell-dependent manner. This work demonstrates that in wild-type animals, naive FO B cells are actively removed from the MZ, thus restricting their capacity to respond to blood-borne pathogens.","2826":"CD8(+) T cells are selected via low-affinity interaction with MHC class I molecules on thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, compromised T cell receptor signaling was proposed to force CD8(+) T cell selection on hematopoietic cells through a SLAM-associated protein (SAP)-dependent mechanism similar to NKT cells. The outcome is an unconventional CD8(+) T cell with phenotypic and functional characteristics of innate lymphocytes. Here we showed that Id3(-\/-) CD8(+) T cells had an innate-like phenotype and required SAP for their development. However, like conventional CD8(+) T cells, Id3(-\/-) CD8(+) thymocytes were selected on TECs. The requirement for SAP and the innate-like phenotype was not intrinsic to Id3(-\/-) CD8(+) thymocytes. Rather, an expanded population of NKT-like cells induced the innate phenotype on CD8(+) T cells through production of interleukin-4. Our findings reveal that accumulation of NKT-like cells promotes conventional CD8(+) thymocytes to acquire innate lymphocyte characteristics.","2827":"Interferon-regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is essential for the development of T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cells. Herein, we report that IRF4 is also crucial for the development and function of an interleukin-9 (IL-9)-producing CD4(+) T cell subset designated Th9. IRF4-deficient CD4(+) T cells failed to develop into IL-9-producing Th9 cells, and IRF4-specific siRNA inhibited IL-9 production in wild-type CD4(+) T cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed direct IRF4 binding to the Il9 promoter in Th9 cells. In a Th9-dependent asthma model, neutralization of IL-9 substantially ameliorated asthma symptoms. The relevance of these findings is emphasized by the fact that the induction of IL-9 production also occurs in human CD4(+) T cells accompanied by the upregulation of IRF4. Our data clearly demonstrate the central function of IRF4 in the development of Th9 cells and underline the contribution of this T helper cell subset to the pathogenesis of asthma.","2828":"The chemokine sink hypothesis pertaining to erythrocyte Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) during inflammation has received considerable attention, but lacks direct in vivo evidence. Here we demonstrate, using mice with a targeted deletion in CXCL5, that CXCL5 bound erythrocyte DARC and impaired its chemokine scavenging in blood. CXCL5 increased the plasma concentrations of CXCL1 and CXCL2 in part through inhibiting chemokine scavenging, impairing chemokine gradients and desensitizing CXCR2, which led to decreased neutrophil influx to the lung, increased lung bacterial burden and mortality in an Escherichia coli pneumonia model. In contrast, CXCL5 exerted a predominant role in mediating neutrophil influx to the lung during inflammation after LPS inhalation. Platelets and lung resident cells were the sources of homeostatic CXCL5 in blood and inflammatory CXCL5 in the lung respectively. This study presents a paradigm whereby platelets and red cells alter chemokine scavenging and neutrophil-chemokine interaction during inflammation.","2829":"Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized microenvironments where antigen-activated B cells undergo proliferation, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation (SHM), and affinity maturation. Within GCs, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are key players in driving these events via direct interaction with GC B cells. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that FDCs express and upregulate Toll-like-receptor (TLR) 4 in situ during germinal center reactions, confirm that their maturation is driven by TLR4, and associate the role of FDC-expressed TLR4 with quantitative and qualitative affects of GC biology. In iterative cycles of predictions by in silico modeling subsequently verified by in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that TLR4 signaling modulates FDC activation, strongly impacting SHM and generation of Ig class-switched high-affinity plasma and memory B cells. Thus, our data place TLR4 in the heart of adaptive humoral immunity, providing further insight into mechanisms driving GCs arising in both health and disease.","2830":"In the Peyer's patches (PPs), germinal centers (GCs) are chronically induced by bacteria and are the major sites for generation of gut immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune responses. Whether follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within the GCs directly contribute to the IgA production in PPs is unknown. We showed here that direct stimulation of FDCs by bacterial products and retinoic acid synergistically enhanced the expression of the chemokine CXCL13, the survival factor BAFF, and molecules that facilitate the secretion and activation of the cytokine TGF-beta1. A reduced production of these molecules by PP FDCs associated with deficiencies in the Toll-like receptor pathway or vitamin A resulted in decreased numbers of GC B cells and defective generation of IgA(+) B cells within PP GCs. Our data indicate that PP FDCs are conditioned by environmental stimuli to express key factors for B cell migration, survival, and preferential generation of IgA in gut.","2831":"Distal cis-regulatory elements play essential roles in the T lineage-specific expression of cytokine genes. We have mapped interactions of three trans-acting factors-NF-kappaB, STAT4, and T-bet-with cis elements in the Ifng locus. We find that RelA is critical for optimal Ifng expression and is differentially recruited to multiple elements contingent upon T cell receptor (TCR) or interleukin-12 (IL-12) plus IL-18 signaling. RelA recruitment to at least four elements is dependent on T-bet-dependent remodeling of the Ifng locus and corecruitment of STAT4. STAT4 and NF-kappaB therefore cooperate at multiple cis elements to enable NF-kappaB-dependent enhancement of Ifng expression. RelA recruitment to distal elements was similar in T helper 1 (Th1) and effector CD8(+) T (Tc1) cells, although T-bet was dispensable in CD8 effectors. These results support a model of Ifng regulation in which distal cis-regulatory elements differentially recruit key transcription factors in a modular fashion to initiate gene transcription induced by distinct activation signals.","2832":"Cell differentiation entails early lineage choices leading to the activation, and the subsequent maintenance, of the gene expression program characteristic of each cell type. Alternative lineage choices involve the activation of different regulatory and coding regions of the genome, a process instructed by lineage-determining transcription factors, and at least in part mediated by the deposition of chromatin marks that modify functionality and accessibility of the underlying genome. According to classic epigenetics, subsequent maintenance of chromatin marks across mitoses and in spite of environmental perturbations occurs largely through autonomous and unsupervised mechanisms. However, paradigmatic genetic and biochemical studies in immune system and hematopoietic cells strongly point to the concept that both induction and maintenance of the differentiated state require constant supervision by lineage-determining transcription factors, which may act to globally organize the genome in both the one- and the three-dimensional space.","2833":"Little is known about the migration of plasma cell precursors to the lymph node medulla. In this issue of Immunity, Fooksman et al. (2010) propose that this migration is largely independent of chemotactic cues but follows a long linear walk of random orientation.","2834":"The chemokine receptor CXCR2 binds several chemokines, some of them with functions yet to be defined. In this issue of Immunity, Mei et al. (2010) generated CXCL5-deficient mice and described a prominent role of CXCL5 in the regulation of CXCR2-dependent neutrophil trafficking during pulmonary host defense.","2835":"Memory killer T cells contribute to control of secondary viral infection by exhibiting rapid effector function upon reinfection. In this issue of Immunity, Kohlmeier et al. (2010) demonstrate that type I interferon is key for rapid upregulation of effector function within circulating memory T cells, ensuring efficient control of infection.","2836":"Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are key organizers of B cell follicles and germinal centers. In this issue of Immunity, Suzuki et al. (2010) and Garin et al. (2010) identify the roles of Toll-like receptors in the responses of FDCs, providing a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity.","2837":"Induction of gene expression involves deployment of transcription factors. In this issue of Immunity, Farlik et al. (2010) provide a view in which cooperation between transcription factors NF-kappaB and ISGF3 divides the task of transcription by recruiting and activating distinct components of the transcriptional machinery.","2838":"Transcriptional regulation of the Nos2 gene encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) requires type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and additional signals emanating from pattern recognition receptors. Here we showed sequential and cooperative contributions of the transcription factors ISGF3 (a complex containing STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 subunits) and NF-kappaB to the transcriptional induction of the Nos2 gene in macrophages infected with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. NF-kappaB preceded ISGF3 at the Nos2 promoter and generated a transcriptional memory effect by depositing basal transcription factor TFIIH with the associated CDK7 kinase for serine 5 phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) carboxyterminal domain (CTD). Subsequent to TFIIH deposition by NF-kappaB, ISGF3 attracted the pol II enzyme and phosphorylation at CTD S5 occurred. Thus, STATs and NF-kappaB cooperate through pol II promoter recruitment and the phosphorylation of its CTD, respectively, as a prerequisite for productive elongation of iNOS mRNA.","2839":"Tagging the cell surface receptor with ubiquitin is believed to provide a signal for the endocytic pathway. E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Cbl-b and Itch have been implicated in T cell activation and tolerance induction. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We describe that in mice deficient in the E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl-b and Itch, T cell activation was augmented, accompanied by spontaneous autoimmunity. The double-mutant T cells exhibited increased phosphorylation of the T cell receptor-zeta (TCR-zeta) chain, whereas the endocytosis and stability of the TCR complex were not affected. TCR-zeta was polyubiquitinated via a K33-linkage, which affected its phosphorylation and association with the zeta chain-associated protein kinase Zap-70. The juxtamembrane K54 residue in TCR-zeta was identified to be a primary ubiquitin conjugation site, whose mutation increased its phosphorylation and association of TCR-zeta and Zap-70. Thus, the present study reveals unconventional K33-linked polyubiquitination in nonproteolytic regulation of cell-surface-receptor-mediated signal transduction.","2840":"Memory CD8(+) T cells in the lung airways provide protection from secondary respiratory virus challenge by limiting early viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that although airway-resident memory CD8(+) T cells were poorly cytolytic, memory CD8(+) T cells recruited to the airways early during a recall response showed markedly enhanced cytolytic ability. This enhanced lytic activity did not require cognate antigen stimulation, but rather was dependent on STAT1 transcription factor signaling through the interferon-alpha receptor (Ifnar1), resulting in the antigen-independent expression of granzyme B protein in both murine and human virus-specific T cells. Signaling through Ifnar1 was required for the enhanced lytic activity and control of early viral replication by memory CD8(+) T cells in the lung airways. These findings demonstrate that innate inflammatory signals act directly on memory T cells, enabling them to rapidly destroy infected host cells once they enter infected tissues.","2841":"Dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which T helper (Th) cells differentiate to effector Th2 cells is important for understanding the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases, such as asthma and allergy. Because the STAT6 transcription factor is an upstream mediator required for interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced Th2 cell differentiation, its targets include genes important for this process. Using primary human CD4(+) T cells, and by blocking STAT6 with RNAi, we identified a number of direct and indirect targets of STAT6 with ChIP sequencing. The integration of these data sets with detailed kinetics of IL-4-driven transcriptional changes showed that STAT6 was predominantly needed for the activation of transcription leading to the Th2 cell phenotype. This integrated genome-wide data on IL-4- and STAT6-mediated transcription provide a unique resource for studies on Th cell differentiation and, in particular, for designing interventions of human Th2 cell responses.","2842":"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) and STAT6 are key factors in the specification of helper T cells; however, their direct roles in driving differentiation are not well understood. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massive parallel sequencing, we quantitated the full complement of STAT-bound genes, concurrently assessing global STAT-dependent epigenetic modifications and gene transcription by using cells from cognate STAT-deficient mice. STAT4 and STAT6 each bound over 4000 genes with distinct binding motifs. Both played critical roles in maintaining chromatin configuration and transcription of a core subset of genes through the combination of different epigenetic patterns. Globally, STAT4 had a more dominant role in promoting active epigenetic marks, whereas STAT6 had a more prominent role in antagonizing repressive marks. Clusters of genes negatively regulated by STATs were also identified, highlighting previously unappreciated repressive roles of STATs. Therefore, STAT4 and STAT6 play wide regulatory roles in T helper cell specification.","2843":"Commensal microbes can have a substantial impact on autoimmune disorders, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. We report that autoimmune arthritis was strongly attenuated in the K\/BxN mouse model under germ-free (GF) conditions, accompanied by reductions in serum autoantibody titers, splenic autoantibody-secreting cells, germinal centers, and the splenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell population. Neutralization of interleukin-17 prevented arthritis development in specific-pathogen-free K\/BxN mice resulting from a direct effect of this cytokine on B cells to inhibit germinal center formation. The systemic deficiencies of the GF animals reflected a loss of Th17 cells from the small intestinal lamina propria. Introduction of a single gut-residing species, segmented filamentous bacteria, into GF animals reinstated the lamina propria Th17 cell compartment and production of autoantibodies, and arthritis rapidly ensued. Thus, a single commensal microbe, via its ability to promote a specific Th cell subset, can drive an autoimmune disease.","2844":"Among human natural killer (NK) cell intermediates in secondary lymphoid tissue (SLT), stage 3 CD34(-)CD117(+)CD161(+)CD94(-) immature NK (iNK) cells uniquely express aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and interleukin-22 (IL-22), supporting a role in mucosal immunity. The mechanisms controlling proliferation and differentiation of these cells are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the IL-1 receptor IL-1R1 was selectively expressed by a subpopulation of iNK cells that localized proximal to IL-1beta-producing conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) within SLT. IL-1R1(hi) iNK cells required continuous exposure to IL-1beta to retain AHR and IL-22 expression, and they proliferate in direct response to cDC-derived IL-15 and IL-1beta. In the absence of IL-1beta, a substantially greater fraction of IL-1R1(hi) iNK cells differentiated to stage 4 NK cells and acquired the ability to kill and secrete IFN-gamma. Thus, cDC-derived IL-1beta preserves and expands IL-1R1(hi)IL-22(+)AHR(+) iNK cells, potentially influencing human mucosal innate immunity during infection.","2845":"Memory B cells express high-affinity, immunoglobulin GB cell receptors (IgG BCRs) that enhance B cell responses, giving rise to the rapid production of high-affinity, IgG antibodies. Despite the central role of IgG BCRs in memory responses, the mechanisms by which the IgG BCRs function to enhance B cell responses are not fully understood. Using high-resolution live-cell imaging, we showed that IgG1 BCRs dramatically enhanced the earliest BCR-intrinsic events that followed within seconds of B cells' encounter with membrane bound antigen, including BCR oligomerization and BCR microcluster growth, leading to Syk kinase recruitment and calcium responses. The enhancement of these early events was dependent on a membrane proximal region of the IgG1 cytoplasmic tail not previously appreciated to play a role in IgG1 BCR signaling. Thus, intrinsic properties of the IgG1 BCR enhance early antigen-driven events that ultimately translate into heightened signaling.","2846":"The adaptive immune system generates protective T cell responses via a poorly understood selection mechanism that favors expansion of clones with optimal affinity for antigen. Here we showed that upon T cell activation, the proapoptotic molecule Noxa (encoded by Pmaip1) and its antagonist Mcl-1 were induced. During an acute immune response against influenza or ovalbumin, Pmaip1(-\/-) effector T cells displayed decreased antigen affinity and functionality. Molecular analysis of influenza-specific T cells revealed persistence of many subdominant clones in the Pmaip1(-\/-) effector pool. When competing for low-affinity antigen, Pmaip1(-\/-) TCR transgenic T cells had a survival advantage in vitro, resulting in increased numbers of effector cells in vivo. Mcl-1 protein stability was controlled by T cell receptor (TCR) affinity-dependent interleukin-2 signaling. These results establish a role for apoptosis early during T cell expansion, based on antigen-driven competition and survival of the fittest T cells.","2847":"Many functions of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) have been defined, but relatively little is known about the biology of an alternative mTOR complex, mTORC2. We showed that conditional deletion of rictor, an essential subunit of mTORC2, impaired differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells without diversion into FoxP3(+) status or substantial effect on Th17 cell differentiation. mTORC2 promoted phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB, or Akt) and PKC, Akt activity, and nuclear NF-kappaB transcription factors in response to T cell activation. Complementation with active Akt restored only T-bet transcription factor expression and Th1 cell differentiation, whereas activated PKC-theta reverted only GATA3 transcription factor and the Th2 cell defect of mTORC2 mutant cells. Collectively, the data uncover vital mTOR-PKC and mTOR-Akt connections in T cell differentiation and reveal distinct pathways by which mTORC2 regulates development of Th1 and Th2 cell subsets.","2848":"Natural hosts for simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can be, and are often naturally, infected with species-specific SIVs, but do not develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These natural hosts maintain high SIV viral loads, but avoid immunodeficiency. Elucidating the mechanisms that allow natural hosts to coexist with SIV without overt disease may provide crucial information for understanding AIDS pathogenesis. Over the past few years, several key features of natural SIV infections have been described in studies conducted predominantly in sooty mangabeys (SMs), African green monkeys (AGMs), and mandrills. Natural SIV hosts are able to avoid the chronic, generalized immune system activation that is associated with disease progression in HIV-infected individuals and are known to downmodulate the expression of the receptors for SIV. In this perspective we propose that a critical factor that differentiates nonprogressive from progressive HIV or SIV infection is the maintenance of T cell immune competence in the face of a virus that infects and kills CD4(+) T cells. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the preservation of immune function during and after the acute phase of natural SIV infection may lead to the design of novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for treatment of chronic HIV infection.","2849":"The mechanisms that guide the development of mucosal-associated innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) producing IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-gamma are the subject of intense interest. In this issue of Immunity, Hughes et al. (2010) identify a new role for IL-1beta in regulating an IL-22-producing ILC.","2850":"Memory B cells generate rapid recall responses upon re-exposure to antigen. In this issue of Immunity, Liu et al. (2010b) show that for IgG1-expressing B cells the augmented memory response begins with the cytoplasmic tail.","2851":"Whether apoptosis is relevant for interclonal competition of T cells after antigen encounter has remained uncertain. In this issue of Immunity, Wensveen et al. (2010) establish a critical role for the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa in this selection process.","2852":"In this issue of Immunity, Lee et al. (2010) demonstrate that the mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 promotes the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells via the kinase Akt, whereas it independently fosters Th2 cell generation via another kinase, PKC-theta.","2853":"Repetitive antigen stimulation by prime-boost vaccination or pathogen reencounter increases memory CD8(+) T cell numbers, but the impact on memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation is unknown. Here we showed that repetitive antigen stimulations induced accumulation of memory CD8(+) T cells with uniform effector memory characteristics. However, genome-wide microarray analyses revealed that each additional antigen challenge resulted in the differential regulation of several hundred new genes in the ensuing memory CD8(+) T cell populations and, therefore, in stepwise diversification of CD8(+) T cell transcriptomes. Thus, primary and repeatedly stimulated (secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) memory CD8(+) T cells differed substantially in their molecular signature while sharing expression of a small group of genes and biological pathways, which may constitute a core signature of memory differentiation. These results reveal the complex regulation of memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation and identify potential new molecular targets to dissect the function of memory cells generated by repeated antigen stimulation.","2854":"In this study, we imaged the differentiation and migratory behavior of nascent plasma cells (PCs) in mouse lymph nodes by intravital microscopy. Pre-PCs exhibited a unique migration pattern characterized by long, linear paths that were randomly oriented. Although chemotaxis via Galphai coupled-receptors has been implicated in PC migration, treatment with Pertussis toxin (Ptx), which ablates these signals, did not prevent movement of pre-PCs while it arrested other lymphocytes. In vitro, pre-PCs displayed processive amoeboid locomotion on surfaces coated with integrin ligand, whereas fully differentiated PCs moved slowly or were arrested. Both PC arrest and differentiation occurred in the medullary cords. Ptx treatment before PC differentiation blocked their accumulation in the medullary cords but pre-PCs still differentiated in other lymph node regions. Taken together, we suggest pre-PCs undergo a persistent random walk to find the medullary cords, where localized chemokines help retain these cells until they undergo differentiation and arrest in situ.","2855":"Although the cellular concentration of miRNAs is critical to their function, how miRNA expression and abundance are regulated during ontogeny is unclear. We applied miRNA-, mRNA-, and ChIP-Seq to characterize the microRNome during lymphopoiesis within the context of the transcriptome and epigenome. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly controlled by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3 or maintained in a semi-activated epigenetic state prior to full expression. Because of miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we uncover a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is dictated by miRNA gene expression. We confirm that concentration of 5p and 3p miRNA strands depends largely on free energy properties of miRNA duplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that miRNA strand accumulation can be developmentally regulated. Our data provide a comprehensive map of immunity's microRNome and reveal the underlying epigenetic and transcriptional forces that shape miRNA homeostasis.","2856":"Tumor growth is associated with a profound alteration in myelopoiesis, leading to recruitment of immunosuppressive cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We showed that among factors produced by various experimental tumors, the cytokines GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-6 allowed a rapid generation of MDSCs from precursors present in mouse and human bone marrow (BM). BM-MDSCs induced by GM-CSF+IL-6 possessed the highest tolerogenic activity, as revealed by the ability to impair the priming of CD8(+) T cells and allow long term acceptance of pancreatic islet allografts. Cytokines inducing MDSCs acted on a common molecular pathway and the immunoregulatory activity of both tumor-induced and BM-derived MDSCs was entirely dependent on the C\/EBPbeta transcription factor. Adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes resulted in therapy of established tumors only in mice lacking C\/EBPbeta in the myeloid compartment, suggesting that C\/EBPbeta is a critical regulator of the immunosuppressive environment created by growing cancers.","2857":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can influence lineage choice or affect critical developmental checkpoints during hematopoiesis. We examined the role of the p53-induced microRNA miR-34a in hematopoiesis by gain-of-function analysis in murine bone marrow. Constitutive expression of miR-34a led to a block in B cell development at the pro-B-cell-to-pre-B-cell transition, leading to a reduction in mature B cells. This block appeared to be mediated primarily by inhibited expression of the transcription factor Foxp1. Foxp1 was a direct target of miR-34a in a 3'-untranslated region (UTR)-dependent fashion. Knockdown of Foxp1 by siRNA recapitulated the B cell developmental phenotype induced by miR-34a, whereas cotransduction of Foxp1 lacking its 3' UTR with miR-34a rescued B cell maturation. Knockdown of miR-34a resulted in increased amounts of Foxp1 and mature B cells. These findings identify a role for miR-34a in connecting the p53 network with suppression of Foxp1, a known B cell oncogene.","2858":"T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and coreceptor ligation is thought to initiate signal transduction by inducing activation of the kinase Lck. Here we showed that catalytically active Lck was present in unstimulated naive T cells and thymocytes and was readily detectable in these cells in lymphoid organs. In naive T cells up to approximately 40% of total Lck was constitutively activated, part of which was also phosphorylated on the C-terminal inhibitory site. Formation of activated Lck was independent of TCR and coreceptors but required Lck catalytic activity and its maintenance relied on monitoring by the HSP90-CDC37 chaperone complex to avoid degradation. The amount of activated Lck did not change after TCR and coreceptor engagement; however it determined the extent of TCR-zeta phosphorylation. Our findings suggest a dynamic regulation of Lck activity that can be promptly utilized to initiate T cell activation and have implications for signaling by other immune receptors.","2859":"The transcription factor PU.1 plays multiple context and concentration dependent roles in lymphoid and myeloid cell development. Here we showed that PU.1 (encoded by Sfpi1) was essential for dendritic cell (DC) development in vivo and that conditional ablation of PU.1 in defined precursors, including the common DC progenitor, blocked Flt3 ligand-induced DC generation in vitro. PU.1 was also required for the parallel granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor-induced DC pathway from early hematopoietic progenitors. Molecular studies demonstrated that PU.1 directly regulated Flt3 in a concentration-dependent manner, as Sfpi1(+\/-) cells displayed reduced expression of Flt3 and impaired DC formation. These studies identify PU.1 as a critical regulator of both conventional and plasmacytoid DC development and provide one mechanism how altered PU.1 concentration can have profound functional consequences for hematopoietic cell development.","2860":"The concept of an alternative pathway of macrophage activation has stimulated interest in its definition, mechanism, and functional significance in homeostasis and disease. We assess recent research in this field, argue for a restricted definition, and explore pathways by which the T helper 2 (Th2) cell cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 mediate their effects on macrophage cell biology, their biosynthesis, and responses to a normal and pathological microenvironment. The stage is now set to gain deeper insights into the role of alternatively activated macrophages in immunobiology.","2861":"Mechanisms controlling leukocyte adhesion, propulsion and directional migration have not been fully integrated. In this issue of Immunity, Schumann et al. (2010) propose that DCs swarm to T cell zones using immobilized CCL21 for adhesive random migration and soluble CCL21 for steering.","2862":"In this issue of Immunity, Blanchet et al. (2010) report that human immunodeficiency virus-1 inhibits macroautophagy in dendritic cells, attenuating MHC II presentation. Lee et al. (2010) previously revealed the requirement of autophagic machinery for MHC II presentation of herpes viral antigens.","2863":"Is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) required for induction of the transcription factor Foxp3 in developing thymocytes? Ouyang et al. (2010) demonstrate that TGF-beta in the thymus prevents deletion of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.","2864":"Despite the importance of the cytokine receptor flt3 in dendritic cell (DC) homeostasis, little is known about its regulation during DC development. In this issue of Immunity, Carotta et al. (2010) reveal that the transcription factor PU.1 controls Flt3 expression in hematopoietic progenitors in a dose-dependent manner.","2865":"In the periphery, T helper cell differentiation is a key event orchestrating the adaptive immune response yet recent studies demonstrate considerable plasticity in these cell fate decisions. In this issue of Immunity, Mukasa et al. (2010) describe the epigenetic basis underlying this plasticity.","2866":"STAT3, an essential transcription factor with pleiotropic functions, plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Despite recent data linking STAT3 with inflammatory bowel disease, exactly how it contributes to chronic intestinal inflammation is not known. Using a T cell transfer model of colitis, we found that STAT3 expression in T cells was essential for the induction of both colitis and systemic inflammation. STAT3 was critical in modulating the balance of T helper 17 (Th17) and regulatory T (Treg) cells, as well as in promoting CD4(+) T cell proliferation. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation and massive parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to define the genome-wide targets of STAT3 in CD4(+) T cells. We found that STAT3 bound to multiple genes involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cell activation, proliferation, and survival, regulating both expression and epigenetic modifications. Thus, STAT3 orchestrates multiple critical aspects of T cell function in inflammation and homeostasis.","2867":"Dectin-2 (gene symbol Clec4n) is a C-type lectin expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, its functional roles and signaling mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we generated Clec4n(-\/-) mice and showed that this molecule is important for host defense against Candida albicans (C. albicans). Clec4n(-\/-) DCs had virtually no fungal alpha-mannan-induced cytokine production. Dectin-2 signaling induced cytokines through an FcRgamma chain and Syk-CARD9-NF-kappaB-dependent signaling pathway without involvement of MAP kinases. The yeast form of C. albicans induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-23 secretion in a Dectin-2-dependent manner. In contrast, cytokine production induced by the hyphal form was only partially dependent on this lectin. Both yeast and hyphae induced Th17 cell differentiation, in which Dectin-2, but not Dectin-1, was mainly involved. Because IL-17A-deficient mice were highly susceptible to systemic candida infection, this study suggests that Dectin-2 is important in host defense against C. albicans by inducing Th17 cell differentiation.","2868":"T cell activation is tightly regulated to avoid autoimmunity. Gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL, encoded by Rnf128) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with T cell tolerance. Here, we generated and analyzed GRAIL-deficient mice and found they were resistant to immune tolerance induction and exhibited greater susceptibility to autoimmune diseases than wild-type mice. GRAIL-deficient naive T cells, after activation, exhibited increased proliferation and cytokine expression than controls and did not depend on costimulation for effector generation. Moreover, GRAIL-deficient regulatory T (Treg) cells displayed reduced suppressive function, associated with increased Th17 cell-related gene expression. GRAIL-deficient naive and Treg cells were less efficient in downregulating T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 expression after activation and exhibited increased NFATc1 transcription factor expression; GRAIL expression promoted CD3 ubiquitinylation. Our results indicate that GRAIL, by mediating TCR-CD3 degradation, regulates naive T cell tolerance induction and Treg cell function.","2869":"Thymus-derived naturally occurring regulatory T (nTreg) cells are necessary for immunological self-tolerance. nTreg cell development is instructed by the T cell receptor and can be induced by agonist antigens that trigger T cell-negative selection. How T cell deletion is regulated so that nTreg cells are generated is unclear. Here we showed that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling protected nTreg cells and antigen-stimulated conventional T cells from apoptosis. Enhanced apoptosis of TGF-beta receptor-deficient nTreg cells was associated with high expression of proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bax, and Bak and low expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Ablation of Bim in mice corrected the Treg cell development and homeostasis defects. Our results suggest that nTreg cell commitment is independent of TGF-beta signaling. Instead, TGF-beta promotes nTreg cell survival by antagonizing T cell negative selection. These findings reveal a critical function for TGF-beta in control of autoreactive T cell fates with important implications for understanding T cell self-tolerance mechanisms.","2870":"Phenotypic plasticity of T helper 17 (Th17) cells suggests instability of chromatin structure of key genes of this lineage. We identified epigenetic modifications across the clustered Il17a and Il17f and the Ifng loci before and after differential IL-12 or TGF-beta cytokine signaling, which induce divergent fates of Th17 cell precursors. We found that Th17 cell precursors had substantial remodeling of the Ifng locus, but underwent critical additional modifications to enable high expression when stimulated by IL-12. Permissive modifications across the Il17a-Il17f locus were amplified by TGF-beta signaling in Th17 cells, but were rapidly reversed downstream of IL-12-induced silencing of the Rorc gene by the transcription factors STAT4 and T-bet. These findings reveal substantial chromatin instability of key transcription factor and cytokine genes of Th17 cells and support a model of Th17 cell lineage plasticity in which cell-extrinsic factors modulate Th17 cell fates through differential effects on the epigenetic status of Th17 cell lineage factors.","2871":"Chemokines orchestrate immune cell trafficking by eliciting either directed or random migration and by activating integrins in order to induce cell adhesion. Analyzing dendritic cell (DC) migration, we showed that these distinct cellular responses depended on the mode of chemokine presentation within tissues. The surface-immobilized form of the chemokine CCL21, the heparan sulfate-anchoring ligand of the CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), caused random movement of DCs that was confined to the chemokine-presenting surface because it triggered integrin-mediated adhesion. Upon direct contact with CCL21, DCs truncated the anchoring residues of CCL21, thereby releasing it from the solid phase. Soluble CCL21 functionally resembles the second CCR7 ligand, CCL19, which lacks anchoring residues and forms soluble gradients. Both soluble CCR7 ligands triggered chemotactic movement, but not surface adhesion. Adhesive random migration and directional steering cooperate to produce dynamic but spatially restricted locomotion patterns closely resembling the cellular dynamics observed in secondary lymphoid organs.","2872":"Dendritic cells (DCs) in mucosal surfaces are early targets for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). DCs mount rapid and robust immune responses upon pathogen encounter. However, immune response in the early events of HIV-1 transmission appears limited, suggesting that HIV-1 evade early immune control by DCs. We report that HIV-1 induces a rapid shutdown of autophagy and immunoamphisomes in DCs. HIV-1 envelope activated the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in DCs, leading to autophagy exhaustion. HIV-1-induced inhibition of autophagy in DC increased cell-associated HIV-1 and transfer of HIV-1 infection to CD4(+) T cells. HIV-1-mediated downregulation of autophagy in DCs impaired innate and adaptive immune responses. Immunoamphisomes in DCs engulf incoming pathogens and appear to amplify pathogen degradation as well as Toll-like receptor responses and antigen presentation. The findings that HIV-1 downregulates autophagy and impedes immune functions of DCs represent a pathogenesis mechanism that can be pharmacologically countered with therapeutic and prophylactic implications.","2873":"The transcription factor early B cell factor-1 (Ebf1) is a key determinant of B lineage specification and differentiation. To gain insight into the molecular basis of Ebf1 function in early-stage B cells, we combined a genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis with gain- and loss-of-function transcriptome analyses. Among 565 genes that are occupied and transcriptionally regulated by Ebf1, we identified large sets involved in (pre)-B cell receptor and Akt signaling, cell adhesion, and migration. Interestingly, a third of previously described Pax5 targets was found to be occupied by Ebf1. In addition to Ebf1-activated and -repressed genes, we identified targets at which Ebf1 induces chromatin changes that poise the genes for expression at subsequent stages of differentiation. Poised chromatin states on specific targets could also be established by Ebf1 expression in T cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that Ebf1 acts as a \"pioneer\" factor in a hematopoietic chromatin context.","2874":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have previously been shown to play critical roles in the activation of innate immunity. Here, we describe that T cell expression of TLR2 regulates T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. Stimulation with TLR2 agonists promoted Th17 differentiation in vitro and led to more robust proliferation and Th17 cytokine production. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we found that TLR2 regulated Th17 cell-mediated autoimmunity in vivo and that loss of TLR2 in CD4(+) T cells dramatically ameliorated EAE. This study thus reveals a critical role of a TLR in the direct regulation of adaptive immune response and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.","2875":"In this issue of Immunity, Tsai et al. (2010) demonstrate that low-avidity autoantigen-specific regulatory CD8(+) T cells can reverse ongoing autoimmune disease and provide insight into the mechanism by which this is achieved.","2876":"Dendritic cells (DCs) arise from dedicated precursors and monocytes; however, the impact of these differential origins remain unclear. In this issue of Immunity, Siddiqui et al. (2010) describe a population of colitogenic monocyte-derived DCs that propagate intestinal inflammation.","2877":"T helper cell differentiation is controlled by a network of transcription factors. In this issue of Immunity, Yagi et al. (2010) describe the opposing effects of transcription factors Runx3 and GATA3 in the network promoting T helper 1 cell development.","2878":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Many broad-based immunosuppressive and antigen-specific immunoregulatory therapies have been and are currently being evaluated for their utility in the prevention and treatment of T1D. Looking forward, this review discusses the potential therapeutic use of antigen-specific tolerance strategies, including tolerance induced by \"tolerogenic\" antigen-presenting cells pulsed with diabetogenic antigens and transfer of induced or expanded regulatory T cells, which have demonstrated efficacy in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Depending on the time of therapeutic intervention in the T1D disease process, antigen-specific immunoregulatory strategies may be employed as monotherapies, or in combination with short-term tolerance-promoting immunoregulatory drugs and\/or drugs promoting differentiation of insulin-producing beta cells from endogenous progenitors.","2879":"Autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes are complex in their pathogenesis. One approach to improving our understanding of type 1 diabetes is the study of diseases that represent more extreme examples of autoimmunity. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) are relatively rare diseases that often include type 1 diabetes as part of the disease phenotype. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in unraveling some of the underlying mechanisms of APS. Here, we highlight the APS disorders with the perspective of the clues they can offer to the pathogenesis and treatment of type 1 diabetes.","2880":"A combination of genetic and immunological features is useful for prediction of autoimmune diabetes. Patterns of immune response correspond to the progression from a preclinical phase of disease to end-stage islet damage, with biomarkers indicating transition from susceptibility to active autoimmunity, and to a final loss of immune regulation. Here, we review the markers that provide evidence for immunological checkpoint failure and that also provide tools for assessment of individualized disease risk. When viewed in the context of genetic variation that influences immune response thresholds, progression from susceptibility to overt disease displays predictable modalities of clinical presentation resulting from a sequential series of failed homeostatic checkpoints for selection and activation of immunity.","2881":"Recent genetic mapping and gene-phenotype studies have revealed the genetic architecture of type 1 diabetes. At least ten genes so far can be singled out as strong causal candidates. The known functions of these genes indicate the primary etiological pathways of this disease, including HLA class II and I molecules binding to preproinsulin peptides and T cell receptors, T and B cell activation, innate pathogen-viral responses, chemokine and cytokine signaling, and T regulatory and antigen-presenting cell functions. This review considers research in the field of type 1 diabetes toward identifying disease mechanisms using genetic approaches. The expression and functions of these pathways, and, therefore, disease susceptibility, will be influenced by epigenetic and environmental factors. Certain inherited immune phenotypes will be early precursors of type 1 diabetes and could be useful in future clinical trials.","2882":"Type 1 diabetes of man and animal models results from immune-mediated specific beta cell destruction. Multiple islet antigens are targets of autoimmunity and most of these are not beta cell specific. Immune responses to insulin appear to be essential for the development of diabetes of the NOD mouse. In this review, we will emphasize the unusual manner in which selected autoantigenic peptides (particularly the recently discovered target of BDC2.5 T cells [chromagranin A]) are presented and recognized by autoreactive CD4(+) T cell receptors. We hypothesize that \"unusual\" structural interactions of specific trimolecular complexes (MHC class II, peptide, and T cell receptors) are fundamental to the escape from the thymus of autoreactive T cells able to cause type 1 diabetes.","2883":"Autoimmune diseases with high population prevalence such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) develop as a result of ill-defined interactions between putative environmental triggers and a constellation of genetic elements scattered throughout the genome. In T1D, these interactions somehow trigger a loss of tolerance to pancreatic beta cells, manifested in the form of a chronic autoimmune response that mobilizes virtually every cell type of the immune system and progressively erodes the host's beta cell mass. The five accompanying review articles focus on key areas of T1D research, ranging from genetics and pathogenesis to prediction and therapy. Here, I attempt to integrate and bring into focus the most salient points of these reviews in the context of other findings, with an emphasis on identifying knowledge gaps and research opportunities.","2884":"Agonist MHC-peptide complexes in the immunological synapse (IS) signal through T cell receptor (TCR) microclusters (MCs) that converge into a central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). The determinants and function of the cSMAC remain unknown. We demonstrate an essential role for ubiquitin (Ub) and TSG101, but less so for HRS, in signal processing events at the cSMAC. Using siRNA in primary T cells, we show that Ub recognition by TSG101 is required for cSMAC formation, TCR MC signal termination, TCR downregulation, and segregation of TCR-MHC-peptide from PKC-theta-enriched signaling complexes. Weak agonist MHC-peptide induced CD80-dependent TCR MCs that dissociated in the center of the IS without recruiting TSG101. These results support TSG101-dependent recognition of CD80-independent TCR MCs as a molecular checkpoint for TCR downregulation.","2885":"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity in the intestine. Gut conditioned CD103(+) DCs promote regulatory T (Treg) cell responses; however, little is known about DCs that drive inflammation in the intestine. Here, we show that monocyte-derived inflammatory DCs that express E-cadherin, the receptor for CD103, promote intestinal inflammation. E-cadherin(+) DCs accumulated in the inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes and colon, had high expression of toll-like receptors, and produced colitogenic cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-23, after activation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of E-cadherin(+) DCs into T cell-restored immunodeficient hosts increased Th17 cell responses in the intestine and led to exacerbation of colitis. These results identify a monocyte-derived inflammatory DC subset that is associated with the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, providing a therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.","2886":"The transcription factor GATA3 is crucial for the differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Here, we show that deletion of Gata3 allowed the appearance of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing cells in the absence of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IFN-gamma. Such IFN-gamma production was transcription factor T-bet independent. Another T-box-containing transcription factor Eomes, but not T-bet, was induced both in GATA3-deficient CD4(+) T cells differentiated under Th2 cell conditions and in Th2 cells with enforced Runx3 expression, contributing to IFN-gamma production. GATA3 overexpression blocked Runx3-mediated Eomes induction and IFN-gamma production, and GATA3 protein physically interacted with Runx3 protein. Furthermore, we found that Runx3 directly bound to multiple regulatory elements of the Ifng gene and that blocking Runx3 function in either Th1 or GATA3-deficient \"Th2\" cells results in diminished IFN-gamma production by these cells. Thus, the Runx3-mediated pathway, actively suppressed by GATA3, induces IFN-gamma production in a STAT4- and T-bet-independent manner.","2887":"Blunting autoreactivity without compromising immunity remains an elusive goal in the treatment of autoimmunity. We show that progression to autoimmune diabetes results in the conversion of naive low-avidity autoreactive CD8(+) T cells into memory-like autoregulatory cells that can be expanded in vivo with nanoparticles coated with disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC-NP). Treatment of NOD mice with monospecific pMHC-NPs expanded cognate autoregulatory T cells, suppressed the recruitment of noncognate specificities, prevented disease in prediabetic mice, and restored normoglycemia in diabetic animals. pMHC-NP therapy was inconsequential in mice engineered to bear an immune system unresponsive to the corresponding epitope, owing to absence of epitope-experienced autoregulatory T cells. pMHC-NP-expanded autoregulatory T cells suppressed local presentation of autoantigens in an interferon-gamma-, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-, and perforin-dependent manner. Nanoparticles coated with human diabetes-relevant pHLA complexes restored normoglycemia in a humanized model of diabetes. These observations expose a paradigm in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity amenable for therapeutic intervention.","2888":"An important function of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors is cross-regulation of heterologous receptor signaling, but mechanisms of cross-inhibition are poorly understood. We show that high-avidity ligation of ITAM-coupled beta2 integrins and FcgammaRs in macrophages inhibited type I interferon receptor and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and induced expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10); signaling inhibitors SOCS3, ABIN-3, and A20; and repressors of cytokine gene transcription STAT3 and Hes1. Induction of inhibitors was dependent on a pathway composed of signaling molecules DAP12, Syk, and Pyk2 that coupled to downstream kinases p38 and MSKs and required integration of IL-10-dependent and -independent signals. ITAM-induced inhibitors abrogated TLR responses by cooperatively targeting distinct steps in TLR signaling. Inhibitory signaling was suppressed by IFN-gamma and attenuated in inflammatory arthritis synovial macrophages. These results provide an indirect mechanism of cross-inhibition of TLRs and delineate a signaling pathway important for deactivation of macrophages.","2889":"The kinase-phosphatase pair Csk and CD45 reciprocally regulate phosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine of the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn. T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and thymic development require CD45 expression but proceed constitutively in the absence of Csk. Here, we show that relative titration of CD45 and Csk expression reveals distinct regulation of basal and inducible TCR signaling during thymic development. Low CD45 expression is sufficient to rescue inducible TCR signaling and positive selection, whereas high expression is required to reconstitute basal TCR signaling and beta selection. CD45 has a dual positive and negative regulatory role during inducible but not basal TCR signaling. By contrast, Csk titration regulates basal but not inducible signaling. High physiologic expression of CD45 is thus required for two reasons-to downmodulate inducible TCR signaling during positive selection and to counteract Csk during basal TCR signaling.","2890":"Foreign nucleic acids, the signature of invading viruses and certain bacteria, are sensed intracellularly. The nucleic acid-specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect and signal within endolysosomal compartments, triggering the induction of cytokines essential for the innate immune response. These cytokines include proinflammatory molecules produced mainly by macrophages and conventional dendritic cells, as well as type I interferons, which are produced in great quantities by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The cellular and molecular pathways by which nucleic acids and TLRs meet within the endosome assure host protection yet also place the host at risk for the development of autoimmunity. Here, we review the latest findings on the intracellular TLRs, with special emphasis on ligand uptake, receptor trafficking, signaling, and regulation.","2891":"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is crucial for the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this issue of Immunity, Kang et al. (2010) report that neuroectoderm-derived astrocytes are the critical cellular element that responds to IL-17.","2892":"Genetic studies and other experimental data have linked inflammatory bowel diseases with inflammasome activation. In this issue of Immunity, Zaki et al. (2010) and Dupaul-Chicoine et al. (2010) provide a detailed characterization of the regulatory task of the inflammasome in intestinal epithelial cells.","2893":"Macroautophagy was thought to be an unspecific bulk degradation process. However, Ponpuak et al. (2010) show in this issue of Immunity that cytosolic proteins are selectively recruited to autophagosomes to become metabolized to bactericidal peptides.","2894":"In this issue of Immunity, Ghisletti et al. (2010) examined lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced binding of the p300 transcription coactivator to identify inducible enhancers throughout the genome of mouse macrophages, thereby revealing common features of enhancers that contribute to the LPS response and a critical role for PU.1 in enhancer marking.","2895":"An international group of researchers investigating the molecular, cellular, immunological, and clinical aspects of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) met in Bethesda, Maryland on September 21-22, 2009 to discuss advances made over the past 15 years. Their discussions yielded ten broad messages applicable to genetic and immunological investigations of human disease.","2896":"Although essential for T cell function, the identity of the T cell receptor \"inside-out\" pathway for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) adhesion has proved elusive. Here, we define the \"inside-out\" pathway mediated by N-terminal SKAP1 (SKAP-55) domain binding to the C-terminal SARAH domain of RapL. TcR induced Rap1-RapL complex formation and LFA-1 binding failed to occur in Skap1(-\/-) primary T cells. SKAP1 generated a SKAP1-RapL-Rap1 complex that bound to LFA-1, whereas a RapL mutation (L224A) that abrogated SKAP1 binding without affecting MST1 disrupted component colocalization in vesicles as well as T cell-dendritic cell (DC) conjugation. RapL expression also \"slowed\" T cell motility in D011.10 transgenic T cells in lymph nodes (LNs), an effect reversed by the L224A mutation with reduced dwell times between T cells and DCs. Overall, our findings define a TCR \"inside-out\" pathway via N-SKAP1-C-RapL that regulates T cell adhesion, motility, and arrest times with DCs in LNs.","2897":"Inflammatory cytokines have been proposed to regulate epithelial homeostasis during intestinal inflammation. We report here that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulates the crucial homeostatic functions of cell proliferation and apoptosis through serine-threonine protein kinase AKT-beta-catenin and Wingless-Int (Wnt)-beta-catenin signaling pathways. Short-term exposure of intestinal epithelial cells to IFN-gamma resulted in activation of beta-catenin through AKT, followed by induction of the secreted Wnt inhibitor Dkk1. Consequently, we observed an increase in Dkk1-mediated apoptosis upon extended IFN-gamma treatment and reduced proliferation through depletion of the Wnt coreceptor LRP6. These effects were enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), suggesting synergism between the two cytokines. Consistent with these results, colitis in vivo was associated with decreased beta-catenin-T cell factor (TCF) signaling, loss of plasma membrane-associated LRP6, and reduced epithelial cell proliferation. Proliferation was partially restored in IFN-gamma-deficient mice. Thus, we propose that IFN-gamma regulates intestinal epithelial homeostasis by sequential regulation of converging beta-catenin signaling pathways.","2898":"The cellular differentiation pathway originating from the bone marrow leading to early T lymphocytes remains poorly understood. The view that T cells branch off from a lymphoid-restricted pathway has recently been challenged by a model proposing a common progenitor for T cell and myeloid lineages. We generated interleukin-7 receptor alpha (Il7r) Cre recombinase knockin mice and traced lymphocyte development by visualizing the history of Il7r expression. Il7r fate mapping labeled all T cells but few myeloid cells. More than 85% of T cell progenitors were Il7r reporter(+) and, hence, had arisen from an Il7r-expressing pathway. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of myeloid cells in the thymus were derived from Il7r reporter(-) cells. Thus, lymphoid-restricted progenitors are the major route to T cells, and distinct origins of lymphoid and myeloid lineages represent a fundamental hallmark of hematopoiesis.","2899":"Decreased expression of the Nlrp3 protein is associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease. However, the role of Nlrp3 in colitis has not been characterized. Nlrp3 interacts with the adaptor protein ASC to activate caspase-1 in inflammasomes, which are protein complexes responsible for the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18. Here, we showed that mice deficient for Nlrp3 or ASC and caspase-1 were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Defective inflammasome activation led to loss of epithelial integrity, resulting in systemic dispersion of commensal bacteria, massive leukocyte infiltration, and increased chemokine production in the colon. This process was a consequence of a decrease in IL-18 in mice lacking components of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, resulting in higher mortality rates. Thus, the Nlrp3 inflammasome is critically involved in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection against colitis.","2900":"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) secreted by T helper 17 (Th17) cells is essential in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, it remains unclear how IL-17-mediated signaling in different cellular compartments participates in the central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory process. We examined CNS inflammation in mice with specific deletion of Act1, a critical component required for IL-17 signaling, in endothelial cells, macrophages and microglia, and neuroectoderm (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). In Act1-deficient mice, Th17 cells showed normal infiltration into the CNS but failed to recruit lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. Act1 deficiency in endothelial cells or in macrophages and microglia did not substantially impact the development of EAE. However, targeted Act1 deficiency in neuroectoderm-derived CNS-resident cells resulted in markedly reduced severity in EAE. Specifically, Act1-deficient astrocytes showed impaired IL-17-mediated inflammatory gene induction. Thus, astroctyes are critical in IL-17-Act1-mediated leukocyte recruitment during autoimmune-induced inflammation of the CNS.","2901":"To simulate transient B cell activation that is the likely initiator of T-dependent responses, we examined the molecular and functional consequences of a single round of immunoglobulin M (IgM) signaling. This form of activation triggered early cytosolic signaling and the transcription factor NF-kappaB activation indistinguishably from conventional continuous IgM crosslinking but did not induce G1 progression. However, single round IgM signaling changed the expression of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes implicated in initiating T-dependent responses, as well as accentuated responsiveness to CD40 signaling. Several features of single-round IgM signaling in vitro were recapitulated in B cells after short-term exposure to antigen in vivo. We propose that transient BCR signals prime B cells to receive T cell help by increasing the probability of B-T encounter and creating a cellular environment that is hyper-responsive to CD40 signaling.","2902":"Epithelial cells provide the first line of defense against mucosal pathogens; however, their coordination with innate and adaptive immune cells is not well understood. Using mice with conditional gene deficiencies, we found that lymphotoxin (LT) from innate cells expressing transcription factor RORgammat, but not from adaptive T and B cells, was essential for the control of mucosal C. rodentium infection. We demonstrate that the LTbetaR signaling was required for the regulation of the early innate response against infection. Furthermore, we have revealed that LTbetaR signals in gut epithelial cells and hematopoietic-derived cells coordinate to protect the host from infection. We further determined that LTbetaR signaling in intestinal epithelial cells was required for recruitment of neutrophils to the infection site early during infection via production of CXCL1 and CXCL2 chemokines. These results support a model wherein LT from RORgammat(+) cells orchestrates the innate immune response against mucosal microbial infection.","2903":"Inflammatory caspases are essential effectors of inflammation and cell death. Here, we investigated their roles in colitis and colorectal cancer and report a bimodal regulation of intestinal homeostasis, inflammation and tumorigenesis by caspases-1 and -12. Casp1(-\/-) mice exhibited defects in mucosal tissue repair and succumbed rapidly after dextran sulfate sodium administration. This phenotype was rescued by administration of exogenous interleukin-18 and was partially reproduced in mice deficient in the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Casp12(-\/-) mice, in which the inflammasome is derepressed, were resistant to acute colitis and showed signs of enhanced repair. Together with their increased inflammatory response, the enhanced repair response of Casp12(-\/-) mice rendered them more susceptible to colorectal cancer induced by azoxymethane (AOM)+DSS. Taken together, our results indicate that the inflammatory caspases are critical in the induction of inflammation in the gut after injury, which is necessary for tissue repair and maintenance of immune tolerance.","2904":"Autophagy allows cells to self-digest portions of their own cytoplasm for a multitude of physiological purposes, including innate and adaptive immunity functions. In one of its innate immunity manifestations, autophagy, is known to contribute to the killing of intracellular microbes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, although the molecular mechanisms have been unclear. Here, we delineated sequential steps of the autophagic pathway necessary to control intracellular M. tuberculosis and found that in addition to autophagy initiation and maturation, an accessory autophagy-targeting molecule p62 (A170 or SQSTM1) was required for mycobactericidal activity. The p62 adaptor protein delivered specific ribosomal and bulk ubiquitinated cytosolic proteins to autolysosomes where they were proteolytically converted into products capable of killing M. tuberculosis. Thus, p62 brings cytosolic proteins to autolysosomes where they are processed from innocuous precursors into neo-antimicrobial peptides, explaining in part the unique bactericidal properties of autophagic organelles.","2905":"Enhancers determine tissue-specific gene expression programs. Enhancers are marked by high histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) and by the acetyl-transferase p300, which has allowed genome-wide enhancer identification. However, the regulatory principles by which subsets of enhancers become active in specific developmental and\/or environmental contexts are unknown. We exploited inducible p300 binding to chromatin to identify, and then mechanistically dissect, enhancers controlling endotoxin-stimulated gene expression in macrophages. In these enhancers, binding sites for the lineage-restricted and constitutive Ets protein PU.1 coexisted with those for ubiquitous stress-inducible transcription factors such as NF-kappaB, IRF, and AP-1. PU.1 was required for maintaining H3K4me1 at macrophage-specific enhancers. Reciprocally, ectopic expression of PU.1 reactivated these enhancers in fibroblasts. Thus, the combinatorial assembly of tissue- and signal-specific transcription factors determines the activity of a distinct group of enhancers. We suggest that this may represent a general paradigm in tissue-restricted and stimulus-responsive gene regulation.","2906":"Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity toward target cells depends on synergistic coactivation by NK cell receptors such as NKG2D and 2B4. How synergy occurs is not known. Synergistic phosphorylation of phospholipase PLC-gamma2, Ca(2+) mobilization, and degranulation triggered by NKG2D and 2B4 coengagement were blocked by Vav1 siRNA knockdown, but enhanced by knockdown of c-Cbl. c-Cbl inhibited Vav1-dependent signals, given that c-Cbl knockdown did not rescue the Vav1 defect. Moreover, c-Cbl knockdown and Vav1 overexpression each circumvented the necessity for synergy because NKG2D or 2B4 alone became sufficient for activation. Thus, synergy requires not strict complementation but, rather, strong Vav1 signals to overcome inhibition by c-Cbl. Inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity by CD94-NKG2A binding to HLA-E on target cells was dominant over synergistic activation, even after c-Cbl knockdown. Therefore, NK cell activation by synergizing receptors is regulated at the level of Vav1 by a hierarchy of inhibitory mechanisms.","2907":"Understanding heterogeneity in adaptive immune responses is essential to dissect pathways of memory B and T cell differentiation and to define correlates of protective immunity. Traditionally, immunologists have deconvoluted this heterogeneity with flow cytometry--with combinations of markers to define signatures that represent specific lineages, differentiation states, and functions. Genome-scale technologies have become widely available and provide the ability to define expression signatures--sets of genes--that represent discrete biological properties of cell populations. Because genomic signatures can serve as surrogates of a phenotype, function, or cell state, they can integrate phenotypic information between experiments, cell types, and species. Here, we discuss how integration of well-defined expression signatures across experimental conditions together with functional analysis of their component genes could provide new opportunities to dissect the complexity of the adaptive immune response and map the immune response to vaccines and pathogens.","2908":"In this issue of Immunity, Luber et al. (2010) report a comprehensive quantitative proteome of in vivo mouse spleen dendritic cell (DC) subsets: a data set of encyclopedic value already revealing that DC subsets exploit different RNA sensors for virus recognition.","2909":"CD95 has long been viewed as a death receptor regulating apoptosis. In this issue of Immunity, Letellier et al. (2010) tell us a different story, about the capability of CD95L to regulate leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation.","2910":"T cell homeostasis must be tightly controlled. In this issue of Immunity, Cho et al. (2010) describe results that begin to define the roles of the T cell receptor, self-peptide-MHC ligands, cytokines, and membrane rafts in this dynamic process.","2911":"B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated tonic signals are important for B cell survival and development. In this issue of Immunity, Treanor et al. (2010) show that triggering of downstream responses is kept in check with BCR immobilization by actin.","2912":"Does the affinity or half-life of peptide-MHC-T cell receptor (TCR) interactions determine T cell activation? In this issue of Immunity, Aleksic et al. (2010) propose a role for the on rate through multiple rebindings to the same TCR.","2913":"Autophagy is known to be important in presentation of cytosolic antigens on MHC class II (MHC II). However, the role of autophagic process in antigen presentation in vivo is unclear. Mice with dendritic cell (DC)-conditional deletion in Atg5, a key autophagy gene, showed impaired CD4(+) T cell priming after herpes simplex virus infection and succumbed to rapid disease. The most pronounced defect of Atg5(-\/-) DCs was the processing and presentation of phagocytosed antigens containing Toll-like receptor stimuli for MHC class II. In contrast, cross-presentation of peptides on MHC I was intact in the absence of Atg5. Although induction of metabolic autophagy did not enhance MHC II presentation, autophagic machinery was required for optimal phagosome-to-lysosome fusion and subsequent processing of antigen for MHC II loading. Thus, our study revealed that DCs utilize autophagic machinery to optimally process and present extracellular microbial antigens for MHC II presentation.","2914":"Early events of B cell activation after B cell receptor (BCR) triggering have been well characterized. However, little is known about the steady state of the BCR on the cell surface. Here, we simultaneously visualize single BCR particles and components of the membrane skeleton. We show that an ezrin- and actin-defined network influenced steady-state BCR diffusion by creating boundaries that restrict BCR diffusion. We identified the intracellular domain of Igbeta as important in mediating this restriction in diffusion. Importantly, alteration of this network was sufficient to induce robust intracellular signaling and concomitant increase in BCR mobility. Moreover, by using B cells deficient in key signaling molecules, we show that this signaling was most probably initiated by the BCR. Thus, our results suggest the membrane skeleton plays a crucial function in controlling BCR dynamics and thereby signaling, in a way that could be important for understanding tonic signaling necessary for B cell development and survival.","2915":"Dendritic cell (DC) populations consist of multiple subsets that are essential orchestrators of the immune system. Technological limitations have so far prevented systems-wide accurate proteome comparison of rare cell populations in vivo. Here, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics, combined with label-free quantitation algorithms, to determine the proteome of mouse splenic conventional and plasmacytoid DC subsets to a depth of 5,780 and 6,664 proteins, respectively. We found mutually exclusive expression of pattern recognition pathways not previously known to be different among conventional DC subsets. Our experiments assigned key viral recognition functions to be exclusively expressed in CD4(+) and double-negative DCs. The CD8alpha(+) DCs largely lack the receptors required to sense certain viruses in the cytoplasm. By avoiding activation via cytoplasmic receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I, CD8alpha(+) DCs likely gain a window of opportunity to process and present viral antigens before activation-induced shutdown of antigen presentation pathways occurs.","2916":"Injury to the central nervous system initiates an uncontrolled inflammatory response that results in both tissue repair and destruction. Here, we showed that, in rodents and humans, injury to the spinal cord triggered surface expression of CD95 ligand (CD95L, FasL) on peripheral blood myeloid cells. CD95L stimulation of CD95 on these cells activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) via recruitment and activation of Syk kinase, ultimately leading to increased migration. Exclusive CD95L deletion in myeloid cells greatly decreased the number of neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating the injured spinal cord or the inflamed peritoneum after thioglycollate injection. Importantly, deletion of myeloid CD95L, but not of CD95 on neural cells, led to functional recovery of spinal injured animals. Our results indicate that CD95L acts on peripheral myeloid cells to induce tissue damage. Thus, neutralization of CD95L should be considered as a means to create a controlled beneficial inflammatory response.","2917":"CD4(+) T cells deficient in signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) exhibit a selective impairment in adhesion to antigen-presenting B cells but not dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in defective germinal center formation. However, the nature of this selective adhesion defect remained unclear. We found that whereas T cell:DC interactions were primarily integrin dependent, T cell:B cell interactions had both an early integrin-dependent phase and a sustained phase that also required SAP. We further found that the SLAM family member CD84 was required for prolonged T cell:B cell contact, optimal T follicular helper function, and germinal center formation in vivo. Moreover, both CD84 and another SLAM member, Ly108, mediated T cell adhesion and participated in stable T cell:B cell interactions in vitro. Our results reveal insight into the dynamic regulation of T cell:B cell interactions and identify SLAM family members as critical components of sustained T cell:B cell adhesion required for productive humoral immunity.","2918":"Neutrophils rapidly undergo polarization and directional movement to infiltrate the sites of infection and inflammation. Here, we show that an inhibitory MHC I receptor, Ly49Q, was crucial for the swift polarization of and tissue infiltration by neutrophils. During the steady state, Ly49Q inhibited neutrophil adhesion by preventing focal-complex formation, likely by inhibiting Src and PI3 kinases. However, in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, Ly49Q mediated rapid neutrophil polarization and tissue infiltration in an ITIM-domain-dependent manner. These opposite functions appeared to be mediated by distinct use of effector phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2. Ly49Q-dependent polarization and migration were affected by Ly49Q regulation of membrane raft functions. We propose that Ly49Q is pivotal in switching neutrophils to their polarized morphology and rapid migration upon inflammation, through its spatiotemporal regulation of membrane rafts and raft-associated signaling molecules.","2919":"Serine protease cascades are involved in blood coagulation and immunity. In arthropods, they regulate melanization, which plays an important role in immune defense and wound healing. However, the mechanisms underlying melanization pathways are not completely characterized. We found that in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, there are two distinct melanization activation pathways carried out by different modules of serine proteases and their specific inhibitors serpins. Immune melanization proteases (IMP-1 and IMP-2) and Serpin-1 mediate hemolymph prophenoloxidase cleavage and immune response against the malaria parasite. Tissue melanization, exemplified by the formation of melanotic tumors, is controlled by tissue melanization protease (CLIPB8), IMP-1, and Serpin-2. In addition, serine proteases CLIPB5 and CLIPB29 are involved in activation of Toll pathway by fungal infection or by infection-independent manner, respectively. Serpin-2 is implicated in the latter activation of Toll pathway. This study revealed the complexity underlying melanization and Toll pathway in mosquitoes.","2920":"The Notch signaling pathway regulates many aspects of embryonic development, as well as differentiation processes and tissue homeostasis in multiple adult organ systems. Disregulation of Notch signaling is associated with several human disorders, including cancer. In the last decade, it became evident that Notch signaling plays important roles within the hematopoietic and immune systems. Notch plays an essential role in the development of embryonic hematopoietic stem cells and influences multiple lineage decisions of developing lymphoid and myeloid cells. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Notch is an important modulator of T cell-mediated immune responses. In this review, we discuss Notch signaling in hematopoiesis, lymphocyte development, and function as well as in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","2921":"In this issue of Immunity, Hegazy et al. (2010) report that in response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, fully differentiated virus-specific Th2 cells can be reprogrammed into GATA-3(+)T-bet(+) cells capable of producing both interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma.","2922":"In this issue of Immunity, Baaten et al. (2010) describe a previously unknown role for CD44 in counteracting Fas-mediated apoptosis of Th1 effector cells during clonal expansion and allowing their entry into the memory pool.","2923":"The differentiation of peripheral T lymphocytes depends on interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this issue of Immunity, Pipkin et al. (2010) and Kalia et al. (2010) link differential interleukin-2 signaling and inflammation with the transcriptional events leading to the development of effector and memory cells.","2924":"A thymus-specific subunit of the proteasome, beta5t, was previously described and shown to be essential for positive selection of CD8+ T cells. In this issue of Immunity, Nitta et al. (2010) suggest that beta5t is essential because it alters the specific peptide-MHC complexes displayed by cortical epithelial cells.","2925":"","2926":"T cell receptor (TCR) binding to diverse peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligands results in various degrees of T cell activation. Here we analyze which binding properties of the TCR-pMHC interaction are responsible for this variation in pMHC activation potency. We have analyzed activation of the 1G4 cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone by cognate pMHC variants and performed thorough correlation analysis of T cell activation with 1G4 TCR-pMHC binding properties measured in solution. We found that both the on rate (k(on)) and off rate (k(off)) contribute to activation potency. Based on our results, we propose a model in which rapid TCR rebinding to the same pMHC after chemical dissociation increases the effective half-life or \"confinement time\" of a TCR-pMHC interaction. This confinement time model clarifies the role of k(on) in T cell activation and reconciles apparently contradictory reports on the role of TCR-pMHC binding kinetics and affinity in T cell activation.","2927":"T cell receptor (TCR) contact with self ligands keeps T cells alive and is shown here to cause naive CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T cells to be hypersensitive to certain gamma(c) cytokines, notably interleukin (IL)-2, IL-15, and IL-7. Hypersensitivity of CD8(+) T cells to IL-2 was dependent on a low-level TCR signal, associated with high expression of CD5 and GM1, a marker for lipid rafts, and was abolished by disruption of lipid rafts. By contrast, CD4(+) T cells expressed low amounts of GM1 and were unresponsive to IL-2. Physiologically, sensitivity to IL-7 and IL-15 maintains survival of resting CD8(+) T cells, whereas sensitivity to IL-2 may be irrelevant for normal homeostasis but crucial for the immune response. Thus, TCR contact with antigen upregulates GM1 and amplifies responsiveness of naive CD8(+) T cells to IL-2, thereby making the cells highly sensitive to exogenous IL-2 from CD4(+) T helper cells.","2928":"Regulatory T (Treg) cells limit the onset of effective antitumor immunity, through yet-ill-defined mechanisms. We showed the rejection of established ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing MCA101 tumors required both the adoptive transfer of OVA-specific CD8(+) T cell receptor transgenic T cells (OTI) and the neutralization of Foxp3(+) T cells. In tumor-draining lymph nodes, Foxp3(+) T cell neutralization induced a marked arrest in the migration of OTI T cells, increased numbers of dendritic cells (DCs), and enhanced OTI T cell priming. Using an in vitro cytotoxic assay and two-photon live microscopy after adoptive transfer of DCs, we demonstrated that Foxp3(+) T cells induced the death of DCs in tumor-draining lymph nodes, but not in the absence of tumor. DC death correlated with Foxp3(+) T cell-DC contacts, and it was tumor-antigen and perforin dependent. We conclude that Foxp3(+) T cell-dependent DC death in tumor-draining lymph nodes limits the onset of CD8(+) T cell responses.","2929":"CD25, the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha chain, is rapidly upregulated by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells after T cell receptor stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that during an acute viral infection, CD25 expression is quite dynamic-after initial upregulation, a subset of virus-specific T cells sustains CD25 expression longer than the rest. At this time when there is distinct heterogeneity in CD25 expression, examination of the in vivo fate of effector cells revealed that CD25(lo) cells, which are relatively less sensitive to IL-2, preferentially upregulate CD127 and CD62L and give rise to functional long-lived memory cells. In contrast, CD25(hi) cells perceiving prolonged IL-2 signals proliferate more rapidly, are prone to apoptosis, exhibit a more pronounced effector phenotype, and appear to be terminally differentiated. Consistent with this, sustained IL-2 receptor signaling during expansion drove terminal-effector differentiation. These data support the hypothesis that prolonged IL-2 signals during priming promote terminal-effector differentiation.","2930":"Interleukin(IL)-2 and inflammation regulate effector and memory cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) generation during infection. We demonstrate a complex interplay between IL-2 and inflammatory signals during CTL differentiation. IL-2 stimulation induced the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes), upregulated perforin (Prf1) transcription, and repressed re-expression of memory CTL markers Bcl6 and IL-7Ralpha. Binding of Eomes and STAT5 to Prf1 cis-regulatory regions correlated with transcriptional initiation (increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the Prf1 promoter). Inflammation (CpG, IL-12) enhanced expression of IL-2Ralpha and the transcription factor T-bet, but countered late Eomes and perforin induction while preventing IL-7Ralpha repression by IL-2. After infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, IL-2Ralpha-deficient effector CD8(+) T cells expressed more Bcl6 but less perforin and granzyme B, formed fewer KLRG-1(+) and T-bet-expressing CTL, and killed poorly. Thus, inflammation influences both effector and memory CTL differentiation, whereas persistent IL-2 stimulation promotes effector at the expense of memory CTL development.","2931":"Current T cell differentiation models invoke separate T helper 2 (Th2) and Th1 cell lineages governed by the lineage-specifying transcription factors GATA-3 and T-bet. However, knowledge on the plasticity of Th2 cell lineage commitment is limited. Here we show that infection with Th1 cell-promoting lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) reprogrammed otherwise stably committed GATA-3(+) Th2 cells to adopt a GATA-3(+)T-bet(+) and interleukin-4(+)interferon-gamma(+) \"Th2+1\" phenotype that was maintained in vivo for months. Th2 cell reprogramming required T cell receptor stimulation, concerted type I and type II interferon and interleukin-12 signals, and T-bet. LCMV-triggered T-bet induction in adoptively transferred virus-specific Th2 cells was crucial to prevent viral persistence and fatal immunopathology. Thus, functional reprogramming of unfavorably differentiated Th2 cells may facilitate the establishment of protective immune responses. Stable coexpression of GATA-3 and T-bet provides a molecular concept for the long-term coexistence of Th2 and Th1 cell lineage characteristics in single memory T cells.","2932":"The immunosuppressive function of regulatory B cells has been shown in several murine models of chronic inflammation, including collagen-induced arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Despite interest in these cells, their relevance to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance in humans remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that human CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells possessed regulatory capacity. After CD40 stimulation, CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) B cells suppressed the differentiation of T helper 1 cells, partially via the provision of interleukin-10 (IL-10), but not transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and their suppressive capacity was reversed by the addition of CD80 and CD86 mAbs. In addition, CD19(+)CD24(hi)CD38(hi) SLE B cells isolated from the peripheral blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients were refractory to further CD40 stimulation, produced less IL-10, and lacked the suppressive capacity of their healthy counterparts. Altered cellular function within this compartment may impact effector immune responses in SLE and other autoimmune disorders.","2933":"Optimal immunity to microorganisms depends upon the regulated death of clonally expanded effector cells and the survival of a cohort of cells that become memory cells. After activation of naive T cells, CD44, a widely expressed receptor for extracellular matrix components, is upregulated. High expression of CD44 remains on memory cells and despite its wide usage as a \"memory marker,\" its function is unknown. Here we report that CD44 was essential for the generation of memory T helper 1 (Th1) cells by promoting effector cell survival. This dependency was not found in Th2, Th17, or CD8(+) T cells despite similar expression of CD44 and the absence of splice variants in all subsets. CD44 limited Fas-mediated death in Th1 cells and its ligation engaged the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt kinase signaling pathway that regulates cell survival. The difference in CD44-regulated apoptosis resistance in T cell subpopulations has important implications in a broad spectrum of diseases.","2934":"Interaction of hematopoietic progenitors with the thymic microenvironment induces them to proliferate, adopt the T lineage fate, and asymmetrically diverge into multiple functional lineages. Progenitors at various developmental stages are stratified within the thymus, implying that the corresponding microenvironments provide distinct sets of signals to progenitors migrating between them. These differences remain largely undefined. Here we used physical and computational approaches to generate a comprehensive spatial map of stromal gene expression in the thymus. Although most stromal regions were characterized by a unique gene expression signature, the central cortex lacked distinctive features. Instead, a key function of this region appears to be the sequestration of unique microenvironments found at the cortical extremities, thus modulating the relative proximity of progenitors moving between them. Our findings compel reexamination of how cell migration, lineage specification, and proliferation are controlled by thymic architecture and provide an in-depth resource for global characterization of this control.","2935":"Immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans and in mice requires interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Whereas IFN-gamma has been studied extensively for its effects on macrophages in tuberculosis, we determined that protective immunity to tuberculosis also requires IFN-gamma-responsive nonhematopoietic cells. Bone marrow chimeric mice with IFN-gamma-unresponsive lung epithelial and endothelial cells exhibited earlier mortality and higher bacterial burdens than control mice, underexpressed indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (Ido1) in lung endothelium and epithelium, and overexpressed interleukin-17 (IL-17) with massive neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs. We also found that the products of IDO catabolism of tryptophan selectively inhibit IL-17 production by Th17 cells, by inhibiting the action of IL-23. These results reveal a previously unsuspected role for IFN-gamma responsiveness in nonhematopoietic cells in regulation of immunity to M. tuberculosis and illustrate the role of IDO in the inhibition of Th17 cell responses.","2936":"Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pleiotropic cytokine that induces expression of transcription factor BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1), which regulates plasma cell differentiation and T cell homeostasis. We identified an IL-21 response element downstream of Prdm1 that binds the transcription factors STAT3 and IRF4, which are required for optimal Prdm1 expression. Genome-wide ChIP-Seq mapping of STAT3- and IRF4-binding sites showed that most regions with IL-21-induced STAT3 binding also bound IRF4 in vivo and furthermore revealed that the noncanonical TTCnnnTAA GAS motif critical in Prdm1 was broadly used for STAT3 binding. Comparing genome-wide expression array data to binding sites revealed that most IL-21-regulated genes were associated with combined STAT3-IRF4 sites rather than pure STAT3 sites. Correspondingly, ChIP-Seq analysis of Irf4(-\/-) T cells showed greatly diminished STAT3 binding after IL-21 treatment, and Irf4(-\/-) mice showed impaired IL-21-induced Tfh cell differentiation in vivo. These results reveal broad cooperative gene regulation by STAT3 and IRF4.","2937":"Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. Although Foxp3 expression marks the commitment of progenitors to Treg cell lineage, how Treg cells are generated during lymphocyte development remains enigmatic. We report here that the c-Rel transcription factor controlled development of Treg cells by promoting the formation of a Foxp3-specific enhanceosome. This enhanceosome contained c-Rel, p65, NFAT, Smad, and CREB. Although Smad and CREB first bound to Foxp3 enhancers, they later moved to the promoter to form the c-Rel enhanceosome. c-Rel-deficient mice had up to 90% reductions of Treg cells compared to wild-type mice, and c-Rel-deficient T cells were compromised in Treg cell differentiation. Thus, Treg cell development is controlled by a c-Rel enhanceosome, and strategies targeting Rel-NF-kappaB can be effective for manipulating Treg cell function.","2938":"Naturally derived regulatory T (Treg) cells are characterized by stable expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and characteristic epigenetic imprinting at the Foxp3 gene locus. Here, we found that enhancing nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity via a constitutive active inhibitor of kappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) transgene in T cells led to increased number of Foxp3(+) cells in the thymus and can rescue Foxp3 expression in thymocytes deficient in other pleiotropic signaling molecules. Enhancing the signal strength of the NF-kappaB pathway also induced Foxp3 expression in otherwise conventionally selected T cells. NF-kappaB directly promoted the transcription of Foxp3, and upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, c-Rel, a NF-kappaB family member, bound to Foxp3 enhancer region, which is specifically demethylated in natural Treg cells. Hence, NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a key regulator of Foxp3 expression during natural Treg cell development.","2939":"T cells often alloreact with foreign human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Here we showed the LC13 T cell receptor (TCR), selected for recognition on self-HLA-B( *)0801 bound to a viral peptide, alloreacts with B44 allotypes (HLA-B( *)4402 and HLA-B( *)4405) bound to two different allopeptides. Despite extensive polymorphism between HLA-B( *)0801, HLA-B( *)4402, and HLA-B( *)4405 and the disparate sequences of the viral and allopeptides, the LC13 TCR engaged these peptide-HLA (pHLA) complexes identically, accommodating mimicry of the viral peptide by the allopeptide. The viral and allopeptides adopted similar conformations only after TCR ligation, revealing an induced-fit mechanism of molecular mimicry. The LC13 T cells did not alloreact against HLA-B( *)4403, and the single residue polymorphism between HLA-B( *)4402 and HLA-B( *)4403 affected the plasticity of the allopeptide, revealing that molecular mimicry was associated with TCR specificity. Accordingly, molecular mimicry that is HLA and peptide dependent is a mechanism for human T cell alloreactivity between disparate cognate and allogeneic pHLA complexes.","2940":"T cell-mediated immunity requires T cell receptor (TCR) cross-reactivity, the mechanisms behind which remain incompletely elucidated. The alphabeta TCR A6 recognizes both the Tax (LLFGYPVYV) and Tel1p (MLWGYLQYV) peptides presented by the human class I MHC molecule HLA-A2. Here we found that although the two ligands are ideal structural mimics, they form substantially different interfaces with A6, with conformational differences in the peptide, the TCR, and unexpectedly, the MHC molecule. The differences between the Tax and Tel1p ternary complexes could not be predicted from the free peptide-MHC structures and are inconsistent with a traditional induced-fit mechanism. Instead, the differences were attributable to peptide and MHC molecular motion present in Tel1p-HLA-A2 but absent in Tax-HLA-A2. Differential \"tuning\" of the dynamic properties of HLA-A2 by the Tax and Tel1p peptides thus facilitates cross-recognition and impacts how structural diversity can be presented to and accommodated by receptors of the immune system.","2941":"The adaptive immune response meets the needs of the organism to generate effector cells capable of controlling pathogens but also leads to production of memory cells, which mediate more effective protection during rechallenge. In this review, we focus on the generation, maintenance, and function of memory T cells, with a special emphasis on the increasing evidence for great diversity among functional memory T cell subsets.","2942":"In this issue of Immunity, Griffith et al. (2009) define the thymic midcortex as a functionally inert zone between subcapsular and cortico-medullary regions, and Ehrlich et al. (2009) infer that structural features of the cortex and medulla regulate migration of thymocytes.","2943":"The brain-immune axis continues to fascinate. In this issue of Immunity, Shaked et al. (2009) describe how miR-132 mediates an anti-inflammatory effect via the targeting of acetylcholinesterase, leading to an increase in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.","2944":"In this issue of Immunity, reports by Long et al. (2009) and Ruan et al. (2009) suggest that the transcription factor NF-kappaB-c-Rel is an important molecular mechanism by which T cell receptor-specificity for self-antigens instructs the selection of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells.","2945":"The ability of a single T cell to recognize the diverse peptides it encounters is based on T cell receptor crossreactivity. In this issue of Immunity, Macdonald et al. (2009) and Borbulevych et al. (2009) provide new insights into the structural principles underlying this fundamental property of T cells.","2946":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have evolved to recognize lipoproteins from diverse species of bacteria. In this issue of Immunity, Kang et al. (2009) provide insight into the mechanisms by which TLR2-TLR6 heterodimers recognize diacylated liporoteins, whereas TLR2-TLR1 heterodimers recognize triacylated lipopeptides.","2947":"The mechanisms underpinning integration of instructions that program naive CD8+ T cells for effector and\/or memory differentiation are not well understood. Herein, we demonstrate that interleukin-12 (IL-12) enhanced and sustained antigen and costimulatory molecule (B7.1)-induced mTOR kinase activity in naive CD8+ (OT-I) T cells via phosphoinositide 3-kinase and STAT4 transcription factor pathways. Blocking mTOR activity by rapamycin reversed IL-12-induced effector functions because of loss of persistent expression of the transcription factor T-bet. Rapamycin treatment of IL-12-conditioned OT-I cells promoted persistent Eomesodermin expression and produced memory cell precursors that demonstrated enhanced sustenance and antigen-recall responses upon adoptive transfer. The memory cell precursors showed greater tumor efficacy than IL-12-conditioned effector OT-I cells. These results identify mTOR as the central regulator of transcriptional programs that determine effector and\/or memory cell fates in CD8+ T cells. Targeting mTOR activity offers new opportunities to regulate CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity.","2948":"Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-mediated signaling in T cells is essential for T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation. We showed here that SIGIRR, a negative regulator of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling, was induced during Th17 cell lineage commitment and governed Th17 cell differentiation and expansion through its inhibitory effects on IL-1 signaling. The absence of SIGIRR in T cells resulted in increased Th17 cell polarization in vivo upon myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(35-55)) peptide immunization. Recombinant IL-1 promoted a marked increase in the proliferation of SIGIRR-deficient T cells under an in vitro Th17 cell-polarization condition. Importantly, we detected increased IL-1-induced phosphorylation of JNK and mTOR kinase in SIGIRR-deficient Th17 cells compared to wild-type Th17 cells. IL-1-induced proliferation was abolished in mTOR-deficient Th17 cells, indicating the essential role of mTOR activation. Our results demonstrate an important mechanism by which SIGIRR controls Th17 cell expansion and effector function through the IL-1-induced mTOR signaling pathway.","2949":"How self-peptides displayed in the thymus contribute to the development of immunocompetent and self-protective T cells is largely unknown. In contrast, the role of thymic self-peptides in eliminating self-reactive T cells and thereby preventing autoimmunity is well established. A type of proteasome, termed thymoproteasome, is specifically expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells (cTECs) and is required for the generation of optimal cellularity of CD8+ T cells. Here, we show that cTECs displayed thymoproteasome-specific peptide-MHC class I complexes essential for the positive selection of major and diverse repertoire of MHC class I-restricted T cells. CD8+ T cells generated in the absence of thymoproteasomes displayed a markedly altered T cell receptor repertoire that was defective in both allogeneic and antiviral responses. These results demonstrate that thymoproteasome-dependent self-peptide production is required for the development of an immunocompetent repertoire of CD8+ T cells.","2950":"Lymphocyte integrins mediate cell arrest on endothelium during immune surveillance after activation by chemokine-stimulated inside-out signals. Here we show that a Vav1-talin complex in T cells is a key target for chemokine-triggered inside-out signaling leading to integrin alpha4beta1 activation. Thus, Vav1 dissociation from talin was required to generate high-affinity alpha4beta1 conformations. Assembly of the Vav1-talin complex required PtdIns(4,5)P(2), which was provided by talin-bound phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase Igamma. Chemokine-promoted Vav1 dissociation from talin followed an initial increase in talin binding to alpha4beta1. This process was dependent on ZAP-70, which binds to and phosphorylates Vav1 in the complex, leading to further alpha4beta1 activation and cell adhesion strengthening. Moreover, Vav1-talin dissociation was needed for Rac1 activation, thus indicating that alpha4beta1 and Rac1 activation can be coupled by chemokine-stimulated ZAP-70 function. Our data suggest that Vav1 might function as a repressive adaptor of talin that must dissociate from alpha4beta1-talin complexes for efficient integrin activation.","2951":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to both neuronal and immune cell fate, but their involvement in intertissue communication remained unexplored. The brain, via vagal secretion of acetylcholine (ACh), suppresses peripheral inflammation by intercepting cytokine production; therefore, we predicted that microRNAs targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can attenuate inflammation. Here, we report that inflammatory stimuli induced leukocyte overexpression of the AChE-targeting miR-132. Injected locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-132 oligonucleotide depleted miR-132 amounts while elevating AChE in mouse circulation and tissues. In transfected cells, a mutated 3'UTR miR-132 binding site increased AChE mRNA expression, whereas cells infected with a lentivirus expressing pre-miR-132 showed suppressed AChE. Transgenic mice overexpressing 3'UTR null AChE showed excessive inflammatory mediators and impaired cholinergic anti-inflammatory regulation, in spite of substantial miR-132 upregulation in brain and bone marrow. Our findings identify the AChE mRNA-targeting miR-132 as a functional regulator of the brain-to-body resolution of inflammation, opening avenues for study and therapeutic manipulations of the neuro-immune dialog.","2952":"The source, specificity, and plasticity of the forkhead box transcription factor 3 (Foxp3)(+) regulatory T (Treg) and conventional T (Tconv) cell populations active at sites of autoimmune pathology are not well characterized. To evaluate this, we combined global repertoire analyses and functional assessments of isolated T cell receptors (TCR) from TCRalpha retrogenic mice with autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Treg and Tconv cell TCR repertoires were distinct, and autoantigen-specific Treg and Tconv cells were enriched in diseased tissue. Autoantigen sensitivity and fine specificity of these cells intersected, implying that differences in responsiveness were not responsible for lineage specification. Notably, autoreactive Treg and Tconv cells could be fully distinguished by an acidic versus aliphatic variation at a single TCR CDR3 residue. Our results imply that ontogenically distinct Treg and Tconv cell repertoires with convergent specificities for autoantigen respond during autoimmunity and argue against more than limited plasticity between Treg and Tconv cells during autoimmune inflammation.","2953":"T cell development requires sequential localization of thymocyte subsets to distinct thymic microenvironments. To address mechanisms governing this segregation, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize migration of purified thymocyte subsets in defined microenvironments within thymic slices. Double-negative (CD4(-)8(-)) and double-positive (CD4(+)8(+)) thymocytes were confined to cortex where they moved slowly without directional bias. DP cells accumulated and migrated more rapidly in a specialized inner-cortical microenvironment, but were unable to migrate on medullary substrates. In contrast, CD4 single positive (SP) thymocytes migrated directionally toward the medulla, where they accumulated and moved very rapidly. Our results revealed a requisite two-step process governing CD4 SP cell medullary localization: the chemokine receptor CCR7 mediated chemotaxis of CD4 SP cells towards medulla, whereas a distinct pertussis-toxin sensitive pathway was required for medullary entry. These findings suggest that developmentally regulated responses to both chemotactic signals and specific migratory substrates guide thymocytes to specific locations in the thymus.","2954":"In this issue of Immunity, Turtle et al.

In this issue of Immunity, Sepulveda et al. (2009) demonstrate that in dendritic cells, asparaginyl endopeptidase is a key protease that controls TLR9 maturation.","2958":"The immune cell signaling community met in September at the Certosa di Pontignano, a medieval abbey in Tuscany. Its graceful structure and quiet surroundings provided a perfect setting for an informal, cooperative discussion of an impressive body of new largely unpublished data. Here, we summarize the principal findings.","2959":"","2960":"Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) initiates potent immune responses by recognizing diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides. Its ligand specificity is controlled by whether it heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6. We have determined the crystal structures of TLR2-TLR6-diacylated lipopeptide, TLR2-lipoteichoic acid, and TLR2-PE-DTPA complexes. PE-DTPA, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, is a synthetic phospholipid derivative. Two major factors contribute to the ligand specificity of TLR2-TLR1 or TLR2-TLR6 heterodimers. First, the lipid channel of TLR6 is blocked by two phenylalanines. Simultaneous mutation of these phenylalanines made TLR2-TLR6 fully responsive not only to diacylated but also to triacylated lipopeptides. Second, the hydrophobic dimerization interface of TLR2-TLR6 is increased by 80%, which compensates for the lack of amide lipid interaction between the lipopeptide and TLR2-TLR6. The structures of the TLR2-lipoteichoic acid and the TLR2-PE-DTPA complexes demonstrate that a precise interaction pattern of the head group is essential for a robust immune response by TLR2 heterodimers.","2961":"Neutrophils are one of the first lines of defense against microbial pathogens and are rapidly recruited at the infection site upon inflammatory conditions. We show here that after bacterial stimulation, and in contrast to monocytes and macrophages, murine neutrophils contributed poorly to inflammatory responses; however, they secreted high amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in a DAP12 adaptor-Syk kinase and MyD88 adaptor-dependent manner. Cotriggering of TLR-MyD88- and C-type lectin receptor (CLR)-Syk-dependent pathways led to a quick and sustained phosphorylation of p38 MAP and Akt kinases in neutrophils. In vivo, both Gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria induced the recruitment of neutrophils secreting IL-10. In acute mycobacterial infection, neutrophil-derived IL-10 controlled the inflammatory response of dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages in the lung. During a chronic infection, neutrophil depletion promoted inflammation and decreased the mycobacterial burden. Therefore, neutrophils can have a previously unsuspected regulatory role during acute and chronic microbial infections.","2962":"The expression of the chemokine receptor XCR1 and the function of its ligand XCL1 (otherwise referred to as ATAC, lymphotactin, or SCM-1) remained elusive to date. In the present report we demonstrated that XCR1 is exclusively expressed on murine CD8(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and showed that XCL1 is a potent and highly specific chemoattractant for this DC subset. CD8(+) T cells abundantly secreted XCL1 8-36 hr after antigen recognition on CD8(+) DCs in vivo, in a period in which stable T cell-DC interactions are known to occur. Functionally, XCL1 increased the pool of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells and their capacity to secrete IFN-gamma. Absence of XCL1 impaired the development of cytotoxicity to antigens cross-presented by CD8(+) DCs. The XCL1-XCR1 axis thus emerges as an integral component in the development of efficient cytotoxic immunity in vivo.","2963":"Interleukin-15 receptor alpha (IL-15R alpha) is a pleiotropically expressed molecule that chaperones and trans-presents IL-15 to NK and T cells. To investigate whether IL-15R alpha presented by different cells perform distinct physiological functions, we have generated four lines of mice lacking IL-15R alpha in various cell types. We find that IL-15R alpha expression on macrophages but not dendritic cells (DCs) supports the early transition of antigen specific effector CD8(+) T cells to memory cells. After memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation, IL-15R alpha expression on DCs selectively supports central memory CD8(+) T cells, whereas IL-15R alpha expression on macrophages supports both central and effector memory CD8(+) T cells. By contrast, mice lacking IL-15R alpha on macrophages, DCs, or both, exhibit equivalent defects in NK cell homeostasis and activation. These studies define unique roles for macrophage expression of IL-15R alpha and show that NK cells rely upon distinct IL-15R alpha dependent IL-15 signals than memory CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, they demonstrate the diversity, specification, and geographic restriction of cytokine signals.","2964":"Using a model of lethal oral infection with Toxoplasma gondii, we examined the fate of both induced and natural regulatory T (Treg) cells in the face of strong inflammatory responses occurring in a tolerogenic-prone environment. We found that during highly T helper 1 (Th1) cell-polarized mucosal immune responses, Treg cell numbers collapsed via multiple pathways, including blockade of Treg cell induction and disruption of endogenous Treg cell homeostasis. In particular, shutdown of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in the highly Th1 cell-polarized environment triggered by infection directly contributes to Treg cell incapacity to suppress effector responses and eventually leads to immunopathogenesis. Furthermore, we found that environmental cues provided by both local dendritic cells and effector T cells can induce the expression of T-bet transcription factor and IFN-gamma by Treg cells. These data reveal a mechanism for Th1 cell pathogenicity that extends beyond their proinflammatory program to limit Treg cell survival.","2965":"Anergy is a critical physiologic mechanism to sensor self-reactive B cells. However, a biochemical understanding of how anergy is achieved and maintained is lacking. Herein, we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) lipid product PI(3,4,5)P(3) in B cell anergy. We found reduced generation of PI(3,4,5)P(3) in anergic B cells, which was attributable to reduced phosphorylation of the PI3K membrane adaptor CD19, as well as increased expression of the inositol phosphatase PTEN. Sustained production of PI(3,4,5)P(3) in B cells, achieved through conditional deletion of Pten, resulted in failed tolerance induction and abundant autoantibody production. In contrast to wild-type immature B cells, B cell receptor engagement of PTEN-deficient immature B cells resulted in activation and proliferation, indicating a central defect in early B cell responsiveness. These findings establish repression of the PI3K signaling pathway as a necessary condition to avert the generation, activation, and persistence of self-reactive B cells.","2966":"Intracellular Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), TLR7, and TLR9 localize in endosomes and recognize single-stranded RNA and nucleotides from viruses and bacteria. This interaction induces their conformational changes resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of cell surface molecules. TLR9 requires a proteolytic cleavage for its signaling. Here, we report that myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) deficient for the asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), a cysteine lysosomal protease, showed a decrease in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to TLR9 stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Upon stimulation, full-length TLR9 was cleaved into a 72 kDa fragment and this processing was strongly reduced in DCs lacking AEP. Processed TLR9 coeluted with the adaptor molecule MyD88 and AEP after size exclusion chromatography. When expressed in AEP-deficient DCs, the 72 kDa proteolytic fragment restored TLR9 signaling. Thus, our results identify an endocytic protease playing a critical role in TLR processing and signaling in DCs.","2967":"The mechanisms that maintain human T cell memory during normal and perturbed homeostasis are not fully understood. The repeated induction of profound lymphocytopenia in patients undergoing multiple cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy infrequently results in severe infections with viruses controlled by memory T cells, suggesting that some memory T cells survive chemotherapy and restore immunity. Here, we identified a distinct subpopulation of memory CD8(+) T cells with the ability to rapidly efflux and survive exposure to chemotherapy drugs in vitro and in vivo. T cells with high efflux capacity shared expression of molecules with hematopoietic stem cells, were quiescent in nonlymphocytopenic individuals, and were induced to proliferate in patients rendered lymphocytopenic after chemotherapy. Effluxing T cells differentiated into noneffluxing subsets in response to antigen stimulation and inflammatory signals, thereby contributing to repopulation of memory cells after chemotherapy.","2968":"Although T helper 17 (Th17) cells have been found in tumor tissues, their function in cancer immunity is unclear. We found that interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-deficient mice were more susceptible to developing lung melanoma. Conversely, adoptive T cell therapy with tumor-specific Th17 cells prevented tumor development. Importantly, the Th17 cells retained their cytokine signature and exhibited stronger therapeutic efficacy than Th1 cells. Unexpectedly, therapy using Th17 cells elicited a remarkable activation of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells, which were necessary for the antitumor effect. Th17 cells promoted dendritic cell recruitment into the tumor tissues and in draining lymph nodes increased CD8 alpha(+) dendritic cells containing tumor material. Moreover, Th17 cells promoted CCL20 chemokine production by tumor tissues, and tumor-bearing CCR6-deficient mice did not respond to Th17 cell therapy. Thus, Th17 cells elicited a protective inflammation that promotes the activation of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. These findings have important implications in antitumor immunotherapies.","2969":"The importance of T helper type 1 (Th1) cell immunity in host resistance to the intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis is well established. However, the relative roles of interleukin (IL)-12-Th1 and IL-23-Th17 cell responses in immunity to F. tularensis have not been studied. The IL-23-Th17 cell pathway is critical for protective immunity against extracellular bacterial infections. In contrast, the IL-23-Th17 cell pathway is dispensable for protection against intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacteria. Here we show that the IL-23-Th17 pathway regulates the IL-12-Th1 cell pathway and was required for protective immunity against F.tularensis live vaccine strain. We show that IL-17A, but not IL-17F or IL-22, induced IL-12 production in dendritic cells and mediated Th1 responses. Furthermore, we show that IL-17A also induced IL-12 and interferon-gamma production in macrophages and mediated bacterial killing. Together, these findings illustrate a biological function for IL-17A in regulating IL-12-Th1 cell immunity and host responses to an intracellular pathogen.","2970":"Strong evidence is emerging that the nervous and immune systems share mechanisms of gene regulation, signaling, cell communication, and supracellular organization. This brings to the fore many questions, not least of which is the developmental and evolutionary origin of the commonalities between the two systems. By providing answers to these questions, immunologists and neurobiologists increasingly expose the mechanistic and conceptual affinities of their respective fields and facilitate the understanding of fundamental principles that govern the organization of complex cellular systems. The current essay and reviews in Immunity and Neuron attempt to communicate to the wider scientific community a series of examples relating to commonalities between the immune and nervous system and enhance the dialog and exchange of ideas between the two fields.","2971":"There are several molecular entities common to the immune and nervous systems. Salient among them are the chemokines and their receptors, which play remarkably varied and potent roles in immunobiology and neurobiology. This review limns several illustrative examples and presents general principles of chemokine action that are manifest in both systems. These include the following: (1) chemokines tend equally to arrest cells and to make them move, in the process of positioning target cells with spatiotemporal precision; (2) signaling and nonsignaling receptors collaborate to adjust the chemokine environment for maximal efficacy; and (3) expression of a single chemokine receptor on circulating blood cells and parenchymal cells is often used to coordinate complex tissue responses. The challenge is to integrate knowledge of the roles of key receptors (as well as their ligands) into a coherent account of events during pathologic processes, in order to guide therapeutic development.","2972":"In order to protect itself from a diverse set of environmental pathogens and toxins, the body has developed a number of barrier mechanisms to limit the entry of potential hazards. Here, we compare two such barriers: the gut immune barrier, which is the primary barrier against pathogens and toxins ingested in food, and the blood-brain barrier, which protects the central nervous system from pathogens and toxins in the blood. Although each barrier provides defense in very different environments, there are many similarities in their mechanisms of action. In both cases, there is a physical barrier formed by a cellular layer that tightly regulates the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between two tissue spaces. These barrier cells interact with different cell types, which dynamically regulate their function, and with a different array of immune cells that survey the physical barrier and provide innate and adaptive immunity.","2973":"Microbiota-induced cytokine responses participate in gut homeostasis, but the cytokine balance at steady-state and the role of individual bacterial species in setting the balance remain elusive. Herein, systematic analysis of gnotobiotic mice indicated that colonization by a whole mouse microbiota orchestrated a broad spectrum of proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and regulatory T cell responses whereas most tested complex microbiota and individual bacteria failed to efficiently stimulate intestinal T cell responses. This function appeared the prerogative of a restricted number of bacteria, the prototype of which is the segmented filamentous bacterium, a nonculturable Clostridia-related species, which could largely recapitulate the coordinated maturation of T cell responses induced by the whole mouse microbiota. This bacterium, already known as a potent inducer of mucosal IgA, likely plays a unique role in the postnatal maturation of gut immune functions. Changes in the infant flora may thus influence the development of host immune responses.","2974":"Cytolytic granules mediate killing of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We show here that the granules can take long or short paths to the secretory domain. Both paths utilized the same intracellular molecular events, which have different spatial and temporal arrangements and are regulated by the kinetics of Ca(2+)-mediated signaling. Rapid signaling caused swift granule concentration near the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and subsequent delivery by the polarized MTOC directly to the secretory domain-the shortest path. Indolent signaling led to late recruitment of granules that moved along microtubules to the periphery of the synapse and then moved tangentially to fuse at the outer edge of the secretory domain-a longer path. The short pathway is associated with faster granule release and more efficient killing than the long pathway. Thus, the kinetics of early signaling regulates the quality of the T cell cytolytic response.","2975":"Killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is mediated by the secretion of lytic granules. The centrosome plays a key role in granule delivery, polarizing to the central supramolecular activation complex (cSMAC) within the immunological synapse upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Although stronger TCR signals lead to increased target cell death than do weaker signals, it is not known how the strength of TCR signal controls polarization of the centrosome and lytic granules. By using TCR transgenic OT-I CTLs, we showed that both high- and low-avidity interactions led to centrosome polarization to the cSMAC. However, only high-avidity interactions, which induced a higher threshold of intracellular signaling, gave rise to granule recruitment to the polarized centrosome at the synapse. By controlling centrosome and granule polarization independently, the centrosome is able to respond rapidly to weak signals so that CTLs are poised and ready for the trigger for granule delivery.","2976":"alphabeta and gammadelta T cells arise from a common thymocyte progenitor during development in the thymus. Emerging evidence suggests that the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) and gammadelta T cell receptor (gammadeltaTCR) play instructional roles in specifying the alphabeta and gammadelta T-lineage fates, respectively. Nevertheless, the signaling pathways differentially engaged to specify fate and promote the development of these lineages remain poorly understood. Here, we show that differential activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-early growth response gene (Egr)-inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (Id3) pathway plays a defining role in this process. In particular, Id3 expression served to regulate adoption of the gammadelta fate. Moreover, Id3 was both necessary and sufficient to enable gammadelta-lineage cells to differentiate independently of Notch signaling and become competent IFNgamma-producing effectors. Taken together, these findings identify Id3 as a central player that controls both adoption of the gammadelta fate and its maturation in the thymus.","2977":"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is an important mediator of immunity and inflammation that utilizes the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to activate the STAT1 transcription factor. Many functions of IFN-gamma have been ascribed to direct STAT1-mediated induction of immune effector genes, but recently it has become clear that key IFN-gamma functions are mediated by cross-regulation of cellular responses to other cytokines and inflammatory factors. Here, we review mechanisms by which IFN-gamma and STAT1 regulate signaling by Toll-like receptors, inflammatory factors, tissue-destructive cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and cytokines that activate opposing STATs. These signaling mechanisms reveal insights about how IFN-gamma regulates macrophage activation, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and helper and regulatory T cell differentiation and how Th1 and Th17 cell responses are integrated in autoimmune diseases.","2978":"Microbes appear to modulate homeostatic plasticity of T helper and T regulatory cells. In this issue of Immunity, Gaboriau-Routhiau et al. (2009) now reveal that segmented filamentous bacteria uniquely coordinate the intestinal T cell profile. The potential implications of this process to various immune functions are discussed.","2979":"It has been widely hypothesized that pancreatic islet infiltrates include both islet-antigen-specific and nonspecific T cells. In this issue of Immunity, Lennon et al. (2009) demonstrate that islet-antigen specificity is required for accumulation in the islets.","2980":"In this issue of Immunity, Beal et al. (2009) and Jenkins et al. (2009) demonstrate that relatively weak stimuli support synapse formation and microtubule polarization, but fail to trigger efficient killing because of their inability to recruit lytic granules to the synaptic cleft.","2981":"In this issue of Immunity, Gomez-Rodriguez et al. (2009) demonstrate that signaling via the Itk kinase, a component of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, is required for interleukin-17A but not interleukin-17F expression in T helper 17 cells.","2982":"Immunotherapy, especially therapeutic vaccination, has a great deal of potential in the treatment of cancer and certain infectious diseases such as HIV (Allison et al., 2006; Fauci et al., 2008; Feldmann and Steinman, 2005). Numerous vaccine candidates have been tested in patients with a variety of tumor types and chronic viral diseases. Often, the best way to assess the clinical potential of these vaccines is to monitor the induced T cell response, and yet there are currently no standards for reporting these results. This letter is an effort to address this problem.","2983":"Type 1 diabetes is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets. It is currently thought that islet antigen specificity is not a requirement for islet entry and that diabetogenic T cells can recruit a heterogeneous bystander T cell population. We tested this assumption directly by generating T cell receptor (TCR) retrogenic mice expressing two different T cell populations. By combining diabetogenic and nondiabetogenic or nonautoantigen-specific T cells, we demonstrate that bystander T cells cannot accumulate in the pancreatic islets. Autoantigen-specific T cells that accumulate in islets, but do not cause diabetes, were also unaffected by the presence of diabetogenic T cells. Additionally, 67% of TCRs cloned from nonobese diabetic (NOD) islet-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells were able to mediate cell-autonomous islet infiltration and\/or diabetes when expressed in retrogenic mice. Therefore, islet entry and accumulation appears to be a cell-autonomous and tightly regulated event and is governed by islet antigen specificity.","2984":"How cell type-specific differences in chromatin conformation are achieved and their contribution to gene expression are incompletely understood. Here we identify a cryptic upstream orchestrator of interferon-gamma (IFNG) transcription, which is embedded within the human IL26 gene, compromised of a single CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding site and retained in all mammals, even surviving near-complete evolutionary deletion of the equivalent gene encoding IL-26 in rodents. CTCF and cohesins occupy this element in vivo in a cell type-nonspecific manner. This element is juxtaposed to two other sites located within the first intron and downstream of Ifng, where CTCF, cohesins, and the transcription factor T-bet bind in a T helper 1 (Th1) cell-specific manner. These interactions, close proximity of other elements within the locus to each other and to the gene encoding interferon-gamma, and robust murine Ifng expression are dependent on CTCF and T-bet. The results demonstrate that cooperation between architectural (CTCF) and transcriptional enhancing (T-bet) factors and the elements to which they bind is required for proper Th1 cell-specific expression of Ifng.","2985":"The transcription factor PU.1, encoded by the Sfpi1 gene, functions in a graded manner to regulate macrophage versus B cell generation; its higher concentration favors the macrophage fate. We demonstrated that Gfi1 reciprocally promoted B cell fate choice at the expense of myeloid progeny. Gfi1(-\/-) multipotential progenitors (MPPs) were unable to constrain the expression of PU.1 because Gfi1 functioned to repress the Sfpi1 gene by displacing PU.1 from positive autoregulatory elements. Attenuating a transcriptional module composed of PU.1 and Egr suppressed the B lineage developmental defects of Gfi1(-\/-) MPPs. Finally Ikaros, a transcription factor required for B cell development, promoted Gfi1 and antagonized PU.1 expression in MPPs. Our results reveal that a core transcriptional regulatory network used for directing cell fate choice in the innate immune system has been co-opted by Ikaros to orchestrate B lymphocyte generation. These findings have important implications for the evolution of the adaptive immune system.","2986":"CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are known to control the progression of autoimmune diabetes, but when, where, and how they exert their influence in this context are questions still under vigorous debate. Exploiting a transgene encoding the human diphtheria toxin receptor, we punctually and specifically ablated Foxp3(+) cells in the BCD2.5\/NOD mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. Strikingly, overt disease developed within 3 days. The earliest detectable event was the activation of natural killer (NK) cells directly within the insulitic lesion, particularly the induction of Ifng gene expression within 7 hours of Treg cell ablation. Interferon-gamma had a strong impact on the gene-expression program of the local CD4(+) T effector cell population, unleashing it to aggressively attack the islets, which was required for the development of diabetes. Thus, Treg cells regulate pancreatic autoimmunity in situ through control of a central innate immune system player, NK cells.","2987":"The characteristics, importance, and molecular requirements for interactions between mast cells (MCs) and CD8(+) T cells have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that MCs induced antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell activation and proliferation. This process required direct cell contact and MHC class I-dependent antigen cross-presentation by MCs and induced the secretion of interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha by CD8(+) T cells. MCs regulated antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell cytotoxicity by increasing granzyme B expression and by promoting CD8(+) T cell degranulation. Because MCs also upregulated their expression of costimulatory molecules (4-1BB) and released osteopontin upon direct T cell contact, MC-T cell interactions probably are bidirectional. In vivo, adoptive transfer of antigen-pulsed MCs induced MHC class I-dependent, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation, and MCs regulated CD8(+) T cell-specific priming in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, MCs are important players in antigen-specific regulation of CD8(+) T cells.","2988":"Certain cell-surface receptors engage ligands expressed on juxtaposed cells and ligands on the same cell. The structural basis for trans versus cis binding is not known. Here, we showed that Ly49 natural killer (NK) cell receptors bound two MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules in trans when the two ligand-binding domains were backfolded onto the long stalk region. In contrast, dissociation of the ligand-binding domains from the stalk and their reorientation relative to the NK cell membrane allowed monovalent binding of MHC-I in cis. The distinct conformations (backfolded and extended) define the structural basis for cis-trans binding by Ly49 receptors and explain the divergent functional consequences of cis versus trans interactions. Further analyses identified specific stalk segments that were not required for MHC-I binding in trans but were essential for inhibitory receptor function. These data identify multiple distinct roles of stalk regions for receptor function.","2989":"T helper 17 (Th17) cells play major roles in autoimmunity and bacterial infections, yet how T cell receptor (TCR) signaling affects Th17 cell differentiation is relatively unknown. We demonstrate that CD4(+) T cells lacking Itk, a tyrosine kinase required for full TCR-induced phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma1) activation, exhibit decreased interleukin-17A (IL-17A) expression in vitro and in vivo, despite relatively normal expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-gammaT (ROR-gammaT) and IL-17F. IL-17A expression was rescued by pharmacologically induced Ca(2+) influx or constitutively activated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Conversely, decreased TCR stimulation or calcineurin inhibition preferentially reduced IL-17A expression. We further found that the promoter of Il17a but not Il17f has a conserved NFAT binding site that bound NFATc1 in wild-type but not Itk-deficient cells, even though both exhibited open chromatin conformations. Finally, Itk(-\/-) mice also showed differential regulation of IL-17A and IL-17F in vivo. Our results suggest that Itk specifically couples TCR signaling to Il17a expression and the differential regulation of Th17 cell cytokines through NFATc1.","2990":"Naturally arising regulatory T (Treg) cells express the transcription factor FoxP3, which critically controls the development and function of Treg cells. FoxP3 interacts with another transcription factor Runx1 (also known as AML1). Here, we showed that Treg cell-specific deficiency of Cbfbeta, a cofactor for all Runx proteins, or that of Runx1, but not Runx3, induced lymphoproliferation, autoimmune disease, and hyperproduction of IgE. Cbfb-deleted Treg cells exhibited impaired suppressive function in vitro and in vivo, with altered gene expression profiles including attenuated expression of FoxP3 and high expression of interleukin-4. The Runx complex bound to more than 3000 gene loci in Treg cells, including the Foxp3 regulatory regions and the Il4 silencer. In addition, knockdown of RUNX1 showed that RUNX1 is required for the optimal regulation of FoxP3 expression in human T cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Runx1-Cbfbeta heterodimer is indispensable for in vivo Treg cell function, in particular, suppressive activity and optimal expression of FoxP3.","2991":"Gut lamina propria dendritic cell (DC) subsets have specialized functions. In this issue of Immunity, Varol et al. (2009) and Bogunovic et al. (2009) describe the different blood precursors for CD103(+) and CD103(-) DC subsets.","2992":"In this issue of Immunity, Andrews et al. (2009) used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that the IgE receptor FcepsilonRI in the plasma membrane can signal in a mobile state.","2993":"Among other genes, expression of the Bcl-6 transcriptional repressor distinguishes follicular helper T (Tfh) cells from other helper T cell subsets. In this issue of Immunity, Yu et al. (2009) demonstrate that Bcl-6 directs Tfh cell differentiation.","2994":"Asthma is characterized by T helper cell 2 (Th2) type inflammation, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness and tissue remodeling. Th2 cell-driven inflammation is likely to represent an abnormal response to harmless airborne particles. These reactions are normally suppressed by regulatory T cells, which maintain airway tolerance. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is likely to play a central role. The role of the cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is more complex, with evidence for immune suppression and remodeling in the airways. In asthmatic individuals there is a breakdown in these regulatory mechanisms. There is emerging evidence that early life events, including exposure to allergen and infections, are critical in programming effective regulatory pathways to maintain pulmonary homeostasis. In this review we examine the clinical and experimental evidence for T regulatory cell function in the lung and discuss the events that might influence the functioning of these cells. Ultimately, the ability to enhance regulatory function in affected individuals may represent an effective treatment for asthma.","2995":"Activated mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils infiltrate the airways of asthmatics as a result of an overexuberant T helper 2 (Th2) cell immune response that drives the production of IgE, primes mast cells and basophils, and promotes tissue eosinophilia and mast cell hyperplasia. Recent evidence demonstrates that these innate effectors can be activated outside of this classical Th2 cell paradigm and that they have additional roles in promoting the development of innate and adaptive pulmonary inflammation. There is also an appreciation for the role of airway epithelial cells in orchestrating allergic pulmonary inflammation. Emerging data from basic research highlight the involvement of many unique pathways in the inflammation triggered by complex native allergens and microbes at the airway mucosal surface. Here, we review the role of effector cells and airway epithelial cells in augmenting and, at times, bypassing traditional Th2 cell-mediated allergic inflammation.","2996":"Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate and maintain adaptive T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses to inhaled allergens in asthma. Various functions like antigen uptake, migration to the draining LNs, and induction of tolerance and adaptive immunity are not equally shared by all subsets of DCs, adding considerable complexity to understanding the immunology of allergic sensitization. Whereas the epithelium was initially considered solely as a physical barrier, it is now seen as a central player in controlling the function of lung DCs through release of Th2 cell-promoting cytokines. Although DCs are sufficient and necessary for induction of Th2 cell responses to many antigens, some allergens might require antigen presentation by basophils. Clinically relevant allergens, as well as environmental and genetic risk factors for allergy and asthma, often interfere directly or indirectly with the innate immune functions of airway epithelial cells, basophils, and DCs. This review summarizes the recent progress on our understanding how DCs control Th2 cell immunity in the lung.","2997":"Regulatory T cells help maintain intestinal homeostasis by preventing inappropriate innate and adaptive immune responses. CD4(+) T cells that express Foxp3 and Tr1-like cells that produce IL-10 comprise the major regulatory populations in the intestine. CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells play an important functional role in promoting tolerance of the flora and dietary proteins. Tr1-like cells can be generated in conditions that also promote effector T cell responses and may serve a similar function. In this review, we discuss the signals specific to the gastrointestinal tract that support both regulatory cell types and their distinct modes of action in the mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal tissues. Dysregulation of intestinal immune homeostasis occurs in inflammatory bowel disease and can also be observed in graft-versus-host disease, tumor immunotherapy regimens, and acute HIV infection.","2998":"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of chronic relapsing inflammatory disorders of the human intestines collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though a complex set of autoinflammatory disorders that can be precipitated by diverse genetic and environmental factors, a feature that appears common to IBD pathogenesis is a dysregulated effector T cell response to the commensal microbiota. Due to the heightened effector T cell activity in IBD, developmental and functional pathways that give rise to these cells are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of effector T cell biology in the context of intestinal immune regulation and speculate on their potential clinical significance.","2999":"Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the complex interactions between components of the mucosal microflora and the mucosal immune system can involve either direct contact with dendritic cells in the lamina propria or, alternatively, contact with epithelial cells lining the mucosa that then influence the function of dendritic cells. Although in some cases these interactions involve signaling specific to particular organisms and in others, to classes of organisms, a common theme is that signaling is invariably channeled through receptors that address many organisms or all organisms such as the pattern-recognition receptors TLR and NLR. Here, I review this information with the intention of identifying how the mucosal microflora influences specific functions of the mucosal immune system such the production of particular cytokines as well as broader functions such as the maintenance of mucosal immune homeostasis and host defense.","3000":"The mammalian intestinal mucosal surface is continuously exposed to a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms. These microbes establish symbiotic relationships with their hosts, making important contributions to metabolism and digestive efficiency. The intestinal epithelial surface is the primary interface between the vast microbiota and internal host tissues. Given the enormous numbers of enteric bacteria and the persistent threat of opportunistic invasion, it is crucial that mammalian hosts monitor and regulate microbial interactions with intestinal epithelial surfaces. Here we discuss recent insights into how the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system collaborate to maintain homeostasis at the luminal surface of the intestinal host-microbial interface. These findings are also yielding a better understanding of how symbiotic host-microbial relationships can break down in inflammatory bowel disease.","3001":"Asthma research has focused primarily on allergic pathways on the basis that the majority of asthma is associated with atopy, the recruitment of the Th2-type T cell, the cytokines, and the chemokines that are released on exposure to allergens, and the IgE pathway. However, despite considerable investment by industry, targeting these pathways has not resulted in new treatments being developed beyond blockade of cysteinyl leukotrienes and IgE and improvements in inhaled corticosteroids and beta(2)-adrenoceptor bronchodilators. Increasingly, it is recognized that asthma is a heterogeneous disorder, and while important, allergen sensitization is only one component of the disease, with many other environmental and genetic factors playing a role. In addition, these factors act locally on a susceptible airway epithelium that is both structurally and functionally deficient. It may be worthwhile to focus on increasing the resilience of the airways to environmental insults in addition to improving strategies that modify adaptive immunity or suppress inflammation.","3002":"Recent studies have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The development of new therapeutic agents has been triggered by basic research and studies in mouse models of IBD. It is expected that improved translational research will lead to optimized therapy and new individualized treatment options.","3003":"Crosslinking of IgE-bound FcepsilonRI triggers mast cell degranulation. Previous fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and phosphorescent anisotropy studies suggested that FcepsilonRI must immobilize to signal. Here, single quantum dot (QD) tracking and hyperspectral microscopy methods were used for defining the relationship between receptor mobility and signaling. QD-IgE-FcepsilonRI aggregates of at least three receptors remained highly mobile over extended times at low concentrations of antigen that induced Syk kinase activation and near-maximal secretion. Multivalent antigen, presented as DNP-QD, also remained mobile at low doses that supported secretion. FcepsilonRI immobilization was marked at intermediate and high antigen concentrations, correlating with increases in cluster size and rates of receptor internalization. The kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked secretion without affecting immobilization or internalization. We propose that immobility is a feature of highly crosslinked immunoreceptor aggregates and a trigger for receptor internalization, but is not required for tyrosine kinase activation leading to secretion.","3004":"The lineage fate of developing thymocytes is determined by the persistence or cessation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling during positive selection, with persistent TCR signaling required for CD4 lineage choice. We show here that transcriptional upregulation of CD4 expression is essential for error-free lineage choice during major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-specific positive selection and is critical for error-free lineage choice in TCR-transgenic mice whose thymocytes compete for the identical selecting ligand. CD4 upregulation occurred for endogenously encoded CD4 coreceptors, but CD4 transgenes were downregulated during positive selection, disrupting MHC II-specific TCR signaling and causing lineage errors regardless of the absolute number or signaling strength of transgenic CD4 proteins. Thus, the kinetics of CD4 coreceptor expression during MHC II-specific positive selection determines the integrity of CD4 lineage choice, revealing an elegant symmetry between coreceptor kinetics and lineage choice.","3005":"CX(3)CR1(+) and CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in intestinal lamina propria play a key role in mucosal immunity. However, the origin and the developmental pathways that regulate their differentiation in the lamina propria remain unclear. We showed that monocytes gave rise exclusively to CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) lamina propria DCs under the control of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) and Fms-like thyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligands. In contrast, common DC progenitors (CDP) and pre-DCs, which give rise to lymphoid organ DCs but not to monocytes, differentiated exclusively into CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) lamina propria DCs under the control of Flt3 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR) ligands. CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) DCs but not CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) DCs in the lamina propria constitutively expressed CCR7 and were the first DCs to transport pathogenic Salmonella from the intestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Altogether, these results underline the diverse origin of the lamina propria DC network and identify mucosal DCs that arise from pre-DCs as key sentinels of the gut immune system.","3006":"The intestinal immune system discriminates between tolerance toward the commensal microflora and robust responses to pathogens. Maintenance of this critical balance is attributed to mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) residing in organized lymphoid tissue and dispersed in the subepithelial lamina propria. In situ parameters of lamina propria DCs (lpDCs) remain poorly understood. Here, we combined conditional cell ablation and precursor-mediated in vivo reconstitution to establish that lpDC subsets have distinct origins and functions. CD103(+) CX(3)CR1(-) lpDCs arose from macrophage-DC precursors (MDPs) via DC-committed intermediates (pre-cDCs) through a Flt3L growth-factor-mediated pathway. CD11b(+) CD14(+) CX(3)CR1(+) lpDCs were derived from grafted Ly6C(hi) but not Ly6C(lo) monocytes under the control of GM-CSF. Mice reconstituted exclusively with CX(3)CR1(+) lpDCs when challenged in an innate colitis model developed severe intestinal inflammation that was driven by graft-derived TNF-alpha-secreting CX(3)CR1(+) lpDCs. Our results highlight the critical importance of the lpDC subset balance for robust gut homeostasis.","3007":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells represent a recently defined CD4(+) T cell subset characterized by the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and an enhanced ability to support B cells to mount antibody responses. Here, we demonstrate that lymph-node-resident CXCR5(+) Tfh cells and gut-homing integrin alpha(4)beta(7)-expressing T helper cells are generated as separate subsets in the gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes. Type I interferon signaling in dendritic cells and in nonhematopoietic cells selectively stimulates Tfh cell development in response to antigen in conjunction with Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 or TLR4 agonists. Consistent with this, the ability of dendritic cells to produce the cytokine IL-6, required for in vivo Tfh differentiation, and antibody affinity maturation are both reduced in absence of type I interferon signaling. Thus, our results identify type I interferon as a natural adjuvant that selectively supports the generation of lymph node resident Tfh cells.","3008":"","3009":"Memory T cells circulate through lymph nodes where they are poised to respond rapidly upon re-exposure to a pathogen; however, the dynamics of memory T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and pathogen interactions during recall responses are largely unknown. We used a mouse model of infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, in conjunction with two-photon microscopy, to address this question. After challenge, memory T cells migrated more rapidly than naive T cells, relocalized toward the subcapsular sinus (SCS) near invaded macrophages, and engaged in prolonged interactions with infected cells. Parasite invasion of T cells occurred by direct transfer of the parasite from the target cell into the T cell and corresponded to an antigen-specific increase in the rate of T cell invasion. Our results provide insight into cellular interactions during recall responses and suggest a mechanism of pathogen subversion of the immune response.","3010":"Dendritic cells (DCs) have the striking ability to cross-present exogenous antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I to CD8(+) T cells. However, the intracellular pathways underlying cross-presentation remain ill defined. Current models involve cytosolic proteolysis of antigens by the proteasome and peptide import into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or phagosomal lumen by the transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and TAP2). Here, we show that DCs expressed an ER-resident 47 kDa immune-related GTPase, Igtp (Irgm3). Igtp resides on ER and lipid body (LB) membranes where it binds the LB coat component ADFP. Inactivation of genes encoding for either Igtp or ADFP led to defects in LB formation in DCs and severely impaired cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens to CD8(+) T cells but not antigen presentation to CD4(+) T cells. We thus define a new role for LB organelles in regulating cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to CD8(+) T lymphocytes in DCs.","3011":"MicroRNAs regulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) target genes that contribute to the inflammatory phenotype. Here, we showed that the protein kinase Akt1, which is activated by LPS, positively regulated miRNAs let-7e and miR-181c but negatively regulated miR-155 and miR-125b. In silico analyses and transfection studies revealed that let-7e repressed Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), whereas miR-155 repressed SOCS1, two proteins critical for LPS-driven TLR signaling, which regulate endotoxin sensitivity and tolerance. As a result, Akt1(-\/-) macrophages exhibited increased responsiveness to LPS in culture and Akt1(-\/-) mice did not develop endotoxin tolerance in vivo. Overexpression of let-7e and suppression of miR-155 in Akt1(-\/-) macrophages restored sensitivity and tolerance to LPS in culture and in animals. These results indicate that Akt1 regulates the response of macrophages to LPS by controlling miRNA expression.","3012":"The investigation of gammadelta T cells has identified a rapid lymphoid stress-surveillance response to microbial and nonmicrobial tissue perturbation. In addition to providing local protection, this response provides an immediate source of cytokines, chemokines, and other functions that can substantially affect downstream, adaptive immunity. Recent studies have identified striking mechanisms by which gammadelta cells meet the requirements of stress surveillance. For example, high response frequencies can reflect a unique nature of antigen engagement by the T cell receptor (TCR), developmental focusing of the repertoire by selection events, or the use of nonclonotypic receptors to initiate responses. Likewise, rapid functional deployment can be facilitated by the preprogramming of gammadelta cells during development. Additionally, gammadelta cells can directly influence adaptive immunity by functioning as antigen-presenting cells. With lymphoid stress surveillance likely to underpin numerous aspects of inflammation, tumor immunology, infectious disease, and autoimmunity, this perspective considers its properties and its emerging potential for clinical manipulation.","3013":"In this issue of Immunity, the studies by Sutton et al. (2009) and Martin et al. (2009) indicate that gammadelta T cells are innate cells that rapidly produce interleukin (IL)-17 in response to cytokines or pathogens without the need for T cell receptor engagement.","3014":"The functions of T lymphocytes are regulated by transcription factors controlling gene expression. Three studies in this issue of Immunity (Kallies et al., 2009; Rutishauser et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2009) indicate that the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 promotes the development of short-lived effector cells and regulates clonal exhaustion.","3015":null,"3016":"Mutations in the adaptor molecule LAT can lead to autoimmunity. In this issue of Immunity, Mingueneau et al. (2009) describe how this may not be a failure of central tolerance.","3017":"Despite compromised T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, mice in which tyrosine 136 of the adaptor linker for activation of T cells (LAT) was constitutively mutated (Lat(Y136F) mice) accumulate CD4(+) T cells that trigger autoimmunity and inflammation. Here we show that equipping postthymic CD4(+) T cells with LATY136F molecules or rendering them deficient in LAT molecules triggers a lymphoproliferative disorder dependent on prior TCR engagement. Therefore, such disorders required neither faulty thymic T cell maturation nor LATY136F molecules. Unexpectedly, in CD4(+) T cells recently deprived of LAT, the proximal triggering module of the TCR induced a spectrum of protein tyrosine phosphorylation that largely overlapped the one observed in the presence of LAT. The fact that such LAT-independent signals result in lymphoproliferative disorders with excessive cytokine production demonstrates that LAT constitutes a key negative regulator of the triggering module and of the LAT-independent branches of the TCR signaling cassette.","3018":"Th17 cells, CD4(+) T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (IL-17), are pathogenic in autoimmune diseases and their development and expansion is driven by the cytokines IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-21, IL-1, and IL-23. However, there are also innate sources of IL-17. Here, we show that gammadelta T cells express IL-23R and the transcription factor RORgammat and produce IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 in response to IL-1beta and IL-23, without T cell receptor engagement. IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells were found at high frequency in the brain of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 promoted IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and increased susceptibility to EAE, suggesting that gammadelta T cells act in an amplification loop for IL-17 production by Th17 cells. Our findings demonstrate that gammadelta T cells activated by IL-1beta and IL-23 are an important source of innate IL-17 and IL-21 and provide an alternative mechanism whereby IL-1 and IL-23 may mediate autoimmune inflammation.","3019":"Gammadelta T cells are an innate source of interleukin-17 (IL-17), preceding the development of the adaptive T helper 17 (Th17) cell response. Here we show that IL-17-producing T cell receptor gammadelta (TCRgammadelta) T cells share characteristic features with Th17 cells, such as expression of chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6), retinoid orphan receptor (RORgammat), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and IL-23 receptor. AhR expression in gammadelta T cells was essential for the production of IL-22 but not for optimal IL-17 production. In contrast to Th17 cells, CCR6(+)IL-17-producing gammadelta T cells, but not other gammadelta T cells, express Toll-like receptors TLR1 and TLR2, as well as dectin-1, but not TLR4 and could directly interact with certain pathogens. This process was amplified by IL-23 and resulted in expansion, increased IL-17 production, and recruitment of neutrophils. Thus, innate receptor expression linked with IL-17 production characterizes TCRgammadelta T cells as an efficient first line of defense that can orchestrate an inflammatory response to pathogen-derived as well as environmental signals long before Th17 cells have sensed bacterial invasion.","3020":"T cell exhaustion is common during chronic infections and can prevent optimal immunity. Although recent studies have demonstrated the importance of inhibitory receptors and other pathways in T cell exhaustion, the underlying transcriptional mechanisms are unknown. Here, we define a role for the transcription factor Blimp-1 in CD8(+) T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection. Blimp-1 repressed key aspects of normal memory CD8(+) T cell differentiation and promoted high expression of inhibitory receptors during chronic infection. These cardinal features of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion were corrected by conditionally deleting Blimp-1. Although high expression of Blimp-1 fostered aspects of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion, haploinsufficiency indicated that moderate Blimp-1 expression sustained some effector function during chronic viral infection. Thus, we identify Blimp-1 as a transcriptional regulator of CD8(+) T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection and propose that Blimp-1 acts as a transcriptional rheostat balancing effector function and T cell exhaustion.","3021":"In response to viral infection, naive CD8(+) T cells proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic and cytokine-producing effector cells. Here we showed that the transcription factor Blimp-1, a crucial regulator of plasma cell differentiation, was required for CD8(+) T cells to differentiate into functional killer T cells in response to influenza virus. Blimp-1 was not essential for the generation of memory T cells but was crucial for their efficient recall response upon reinfection. Antigen-specific Blimp-1-deficient CD8(+) T cells failed to appropriately regulate the transcriptional program essential for killer T cell responses and showed impaired migration to the site of infection. This study identifies Blimp-1 as a master regulator of the terminal differentiation of CD8(+) effector T cells and uncovers a conservation of the pathways that regulate the terminal differentiation of T and B cells.","3022":"During acute infections, a small population of effector CD8(+) T cells evades terminal differentiation and survives as long-lived memory T cells. We demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 enhanced the formation of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, and Blimp-1 deficiency promoted the acquisition of memory cell properties by effector cells. Blimp-1 expression was preferentially increased in terminally differentiated effector and \"effector memory\" (Tem) CD8(+) T cells, and gradually decayed after infection as central memory (Tcm) cells developed. Blimp-1-deficient effector CD8(+) T cells showed some reduction in effector molecule expression, but primarily developed into memory precursor cells that survived better and more rapidly acquired several Tcm cell attributes, including CD62L and IL-2 expression and enhanced proliferative responses. These results reveal a critical role for Blimp-1 in controlling terminal differentiation and suppressing memory cell developmental potential in effector CD8(+) T cells during viral infection.","3023":"Effective clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages is essential for immune homeostasis. The transcriptional pathways that allow macrophages to sense and respond to apoptotic cells are poorly defined. We found that liver X receptor (LXR) signaling was important for both apoptotic cell clearance and the maintenance of immune tolerance. Apoptotic cell engulfment activated LXR and thereby induced the expression of Mer, a receptor tyrosine kinase critical for phagocytosis. LXR-deficient macrophages exhibited a selective defect in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and an aberrant proinflammatory response to them. As a consequence of these defects, mice lacking LXRs manifested a breakdown in self-tolerance and developed autoantibodies and autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Treatment with an LXR agonist ameliorated disease progression in a mouse model of lupus-like autoimmunity. Thus, activation of LXR by apoptotic cells engages a virtuous cycle that promotes their own clearance and couples engulfment to the suppression of inflammatory pathways.","3024":"CD4(+) T cells producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) are reported in chronic infections. However, the signals that direct the development of IL-10-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells are undefined. We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation. Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL-10 production by Th1 cells, and continued IL-12 action and high-dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets. IL-10 expression also correlated with c-maf expression. Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL-10 production.","3025":"Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells provide selection signals to germinal center B cells, which is essential for long-lived antibody responses. High CXCR5 and low CCR7 expression facilitates their homing to B cell follicles and distinguishes them from T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cells. Here, we showed that Bcl-6 directs Tfh cell differentiation: Bcl-6-deficient T cells failed to develop into Tfh cells and could not sustain germinal center responses, whereas forced expression of Bcl-6 in CD4(+) T cells promoted expression of the hallmark Tfh cell molecules CXCR5, CXCR4, and PD-1. Bcl-6 bound to the promoters of the Th1 and Th17 cell transcriptional regulators T-bet and RORgammat and repressed IFN-gamma and IL-17 production. Bcl-6 also repressed expression of many microRNAs (miRNAs) predicted to control the Tfh cell signature, including miR-17-92, which repressed CXCR5 expression. Thus, Bcl-6 positively directs Tfh cell differentiation, through combined repression of miRNAs and transcription factors.","3026":"NKG2D is a potent activating receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and acts as a molecular sensor for stressed cells expressing NKG2D ligands such as infected or tumor-transformed cells. Although NKG2D is expressed on NK cell precursors, its role in NK cell development is not known. We have generated NKG2D-deficient mice by targeting the Klrk1 locus. Here we provide evidence for an important regulatory role of NKG2D in the development of NK cells. The absence of NKG2D caused faster division of NK cells, perturbation in size of some NK cell subpopulations, and their augmented sensitivity to apoptosis. As expected, Klrk1(-\/-) NK cells are less responsive to tumor targets expressing NKG2D ligands. Klrk1(-\/-) mice, however, showed an enhanced NK cell-mediated resistance to mouse cytomegalovirus infection as a consequence of NK cell dysregulation. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for regulatory function of NKG2D in NK cell physiology.","3027":"Humoral immunity depends on both rapid and long-term antibody production against invading pathogens. This is achieved by the generation of spatially distinct extrafollicular plasmablast and follicular germinal center (GC) B cell populations, but the signals that guide responding B cells to these alternative compartments have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that expression of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) by activated B cells was essential for their movement to extrafollicular sites and induction of early plasmablast responses. Conversely, downregulation of EBI2 enabled B cells to access the center of follicles and promoted efficient GC formation. EBI2 therefore provides a previously uncharacterized dimension to B cell migration that is crucial for coordinating rapid versus long-term antibody responses.","3028":"Although deficient CD8(+) T cell responses have long been associated with chronic viral infections, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Here we report that sustained transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) expression and phosphorylation of its signaling mediator, Smad-2, were distinctive features of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells during chronic versus acute viral infections in vivo. The result was TGF-beta-dependent apoptosis of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells that related to upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim during chronic infection. Moreover, selective attenuation of TGF-beta signaling in T cells increased the numbers and multiple functions of antiviral CD8(+) T cells and enabled rapid eradication of the persistence-prone virus and memory generation. Finally, we found that cell-intrinsic TGF-beta signaling was responsible for virus-specific-CD8(+) T cell apoptosis and decreased numbers but was not necessary for their functional exhaustion. Our findings reveal persisting TGF-beta-Smad signaling as a hallmark and key regulator of CD8(+) T cell responses during chronic viral infections in vivo.","3029":"An effective immune response against infectious agents involves massive expansion of CD8(+) T cells. Once the infection is cleared, the majority of these effector cells die through unknown mechanisms. How is expansion controlled to maximize pathogen clearance and minimize immunopathology? We found, after Listeria infection, plasma transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) titers increased concomitant with the expansion of effector CD8(+) T cells. Blocking TGF-beta signaling did not affect effector function of CD8(+) T cells. However, TGF-beta controlled effector cell number by lowering Bcl-2 amounts and selectively promoting the apoptosis of short-lived effector cells. TGF-beta-mediated apoptosis of this effector subpopulation occurred during clonal expansion and contraction, whereas interleukin-15 (IL-15) promoted their survival only during contraction. We demonstrate that the number of effector CD8(+) T cells is tightly controlled by multiple extrinsic signals throughout effector differentiation; this plasticity should be exploited during vaccine design and immunotherapy against tumors and autoimmune diseases.","3030":"The cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by inhibitory receptors that detect the absence of self molecules on target cells. Structural studies of missing self recognition have focused on NK receptors that bind MHC. However, NK cells also possess inhibitory receptors specific for non-MHC ligands, notably cadherins, which are downregulated in metastatic tumors. We determined the structure of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) in complex with E-cadherin. KLRG1 mediates missing self recognition by binding to a highly conserved site on classical cadherins, enabling it to monitor expression of several cadherins (E-, N-, and R-) on target cells. This site overlaps the site responsible for cell-cell adhesion but is distinct from the integrin alpha(E)beta(7) binding site. We propose that E-cadherin may coengage KLRG1 and alpha(E)beta(7) and that KLRG1 overcomes its exceptionally weak affinity for cadherins through multipoint attachment to target cells, resulting in inhibitory signaling.","3031":"Blood, lymphoid tissues, and placenta contain diverse subpopulations of natural killer (NK) cells that possess distinct immune functions. Recent studies have shown that human and mouse gut-associated lymphoid tissues harbor a unique NK cell subset that specializes in production of interleukin (IL)-22. This cytokine plays a role in host defense of mucosal barriers, although dysregulated secretion may cause autoimmune disease. In parallel, human fetal lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and mouse adult LTi-like cells in secondary lymphoid tissues were found to release IL-22, as well as IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that mediates host defense against extracellular pathogens. Here, we compare these recently identified immune cells, reviewing what is known about their anatomical location, differentiation requirements, function, and potential involvement in host defense and autoimmunity. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced in furthering our understanding of the developmental relationships and role of NK and LTi-like cells in mucosal immune responses.","3032":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for generating humoral immune responses. In this issue of Immunity, Schmitt et al. (2009) reveal the differentiation of human Tfh cells is dependent on dendritic cell-derived interleukin-12.","3033":"The transcription factor KLF2 directs expression of receptors involved in trafficking of naive T cells. In this issue of Immunity, Weinreich et al. (2009) demonstrate that KLF2 additionally represses IL-4 production, which otherwise induces CXCR3 expression.","3034":"Adenoviral vectors used in gene therapy induce inflammation, although the underlying mechanisms are currently unknown. In this issue of Immunity, Di Paolo et al. (2009) implicate interleukin-1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) in virus-induced inflammation and identify the beta 3 integrin as the key receptor regulating IL-1 alpha activity.","3035":null,"3036":"In this issue of Immunity, Schlee et al. (2009) defines key RNA structures recognized by a cellular viral sensor, RIG-I. This and another recent report by Schmidt et al. (2009) provide new insights into the mechanism of antiviral innate immunity.","3037":"","3038":"The transcription factor KLF2 regulates T cell trafficking by promoting expression of the lipid-binding receptor S1P(1) and the selectin CD62L. Recently, it was proposed that KLF2 also represses the expression of chemokine receptors. We confirmed the upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on KLF2-deficient T cells. However, we showed that this was a cell-nonautonomous effect, as revealed by CXCR3 upregulation on wild-type bystander cells in mixed bone-marrow chimeras with KLF2-deficient cells. Furthermore, KLF2-deficient T cells overproduced IL-4, leading to the upregulation of CXCR3 through an IL-4-receptor- and eomesodermin-dependent pathway. Consistent with the increased IL-4 production, we found high concentrations of serum IgE in mice with T cell-specific KLF2 deficiency. Our findings support a model where KLF2 regulates T cell trafficking by direct regulation of S1P(1) and CD62L and restrains spontaneous cytokine production in naive T cells.","3039":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells help development of antibody responses via interleukin-21 (IL-21). Here we show that activated human dendritic cells (DCs) induced naive CD4(+) T cells to become IL-21-producing Tfh-like cells through IL-12. CD4(+) T cells primed with IL-12 induced B cells to produce immunoglobulins in a fashion dependent on IL-21 and inducible costimulator (ICOS), thus sharing fundamental characteristics with Tfh cells. The induction of Tfh-like cells by activated DCs was inhibited by neutralizing IL-12. IL-12 induced two different IL-21-producers: IL-21(+)IFN-gamma(+)T-bet(+) Th1 cells and IL-21(+)IFN-gamma(-)T-bet(-) non-Th1 cells, in a manner dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). IL-12 also regulated IL-21 secretion by memory CD4(+) T cells. Thus, IL-12 produced by activated DCs regulates antibody responses via developing IL-21-producing Tfh-like cells and inducing IL-21 secretion from memory CD4(+) T cells. These data suggest that the developmental pathway of Tfh cells differs between mice and humans, which have considerable implications for vaccine development.","3040":"The semi-invariant natural killer T cell receptor (NKT TCR) recognizes CD1d-lipid antigens. Although the TCR alpha chain is typically invariant, the beta chain expression is more diverse, where three V beta chains are commonly expressed in mice. We report the structures of V alpha 14-V beta 8.2 and V alpha 14-V beta 7 NKT TCRs in complex with CD1d-alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) and the 2.5 A structure of the human NKT TCR-CD1d-alpha-GalCer complex. Both V beta 8.2 and V beta 7 NKT TCRs and the human NKT TCR ligated CD1d-alpha-GalCer in a similar manner, highlighting the evolutionarily conserved interaction. However, differences within the V beta domains of the V beta 8.2 and V beta 7 NKT TCR-CD1d complexes resulted in altered TCR beta-CD1d-mediated contacts and modulated recognition mediated by the invariant alpha chain. Mutagenesis studies revealed the differing contributions of V beta 8.2 and V beta 7 residues within the CDR2 beta loop in mediating contacts with CD1d. Collectively we provide a structural basis for the differential NKT TCR V beta usage in NKT cells.","3041":"Mouse type I natural killer T cell receptors (iNKT TCRs) use a single V alpha 14-J alpha 18 sequence and V beta s that are almost always V beta 8.2, V beta 7, or V beta 2, although the basis of this differential usage is unclear. We showed that the V beta bias occurred as a consequence of the CDR2 beta loops determining the affinity of the iNKT TCR for CD1d-glycolipids, thus controlling positive selection. Within a conserved iNKT-TCR-CD1d docking framework, these inherent V beta-CD1d affinities are further modulated by the hypervariable CDR3 beta loop, thereby defining a functional interplay between the two iNKT TCR CDR beta loops. These V beta biases revealed a broadly hierarchical response in which V beta 8.2 &gt; V beta 7 &gt; V beta 2 in the recognition of diverse CD1d ligands. This restriction of the iNKT TCR repertoire during thymic selection paradoxically ensures that each peripheral iNKT cell recognizes a similar spectrum of antigens.","3042":"The molecular process underlying T cell anergy is incompletely understood. Deltex1 (DTX1) is a Notch target with unknown physiological function. Here we show that Dtx1 was a transcription target of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and participated in T cell anergy. DTX1 protein was upregulated during T cell anergy, and transgenic expression of Dtx1 attenuated T cell activation. DTX1 inhibited T cell activation by both E3-dependent and E3-independent mechanisms. In addition, DTX1 suppressed T cell activation in the absence of its Notch-binding domain. Importantly, DTX1 regulated the expression of two anergy-associated molecules, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45 beta) and Cbl-b. DTX1 interacted with early growth response 2 (Egr-2) for optimum expression of Cbl-b. Furthermore, deficiency of DTX1 augmented T cell activation, conferred resistance to anergy induction, enhanced autoantibody generation, and increased inflammation. DTX1 therefore represents a component downstream of calcium-NFAT signaling that regulates T cell anergy.","3043":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill target cells by releasing the content of secretory lysosomes at the immune synapse. To understand the dynamics and control of cytotoxic immune synapses, we imaged human primary, live natural killer cells on lipid bilayers carrying ligands of activation receptors. Formation of an organized synapse was dependent on the presence of the beta2 integrin ligand ICAM-1. Ligands of coactivation receptors 2B4 and NKG2D segregated into central and peripheral regions, respectively. Lysosomal protein LAMP-1 that was exocytosed during degranulation accumulated in a large and spatially stable cluster, which overlapped with a site of membrane internalization. Lysosomal compartments reached the plasma membrane at focal points adjacent to centrally accumulated LAMP-1. Imaging of fixed cells revealed that perforin-containing granules were juxtaposed to an intracellular compartment where exocytosed LAMP-1 was retrieved. Thus, cytotoxic immune synapses include a central region of bidirectional vesicular traffic, which is controlled by integrin signaling.","3044":"The recognition of viral components by host pattern-recognition receptors triggers the induction of the antiviral innate immune response. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and NLRP3 inflammasome were shown to be the principal specific sensors of viral double-stranded DNA. Here we present evidence that macrophages in vivo activated an innate immune response to a double-stranded DNA virus, adenovirus (Ad), independently of TLR9 or NLRP3 inflammasome. In response to Ad, macrophage-derived IL-1 alpha triggered IL-1RI-dependent production of a defined set of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The IL-1 alpha-mediated response required a selective interaction of virus arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motifs with macrophage beta(3) integrins. Thus, these data identify IL-1 alpha-IL-1RI as a key pathway allowing for the activation of proinflammatory responses to the virus, independently of its genomic nucleic acid recognition.","3045":"Antiviral immunity is triggered by immunorecognition of viral nucleic acids. The cytosolic helicase RIG-I is a key sensor of viral infections and is activated by RNA containing a triphosphate at the 5' end. The exact structure of RNA activating RIG-I remains controversial. Here, we established a chemical approach for 5' triphosphate oligoribonucleotide synthesis and found that synthetic single-stranded 5' triphosphate oligoribonucleotides were unable to bind and activate RIG-I. Conversely, the addition of the synthetic complementary strand resulted in optimal binding and activation of RIG-I. Short double-strand conformation with base pairing of the nucleoside carrying the 5' triphosphate was required. RIG-I activation was impaired by a 3' overhang at the 5' triphosphate end. These results define the structure of RNA for full RIG-I activation and explain how RIG-I detects negative-strand RNA viruses that lack long double-stranded RNA but do contain blunt short double-stranded 5' triphosphate RNA in the panhandle region of their single-stranded genome.","3046":"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a member of the IL-1 family and is involved in polarization of T cells toward a T helper 2 (Th2) cell phenotype. IL-33 is thought to be activated via caspase-1-dependent proteolysis, similar to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-18, but this remains unproven. Here we showed that IL-33 was processed by caspases activated during apoptosis (caspase-3 and -7) but was not a physiological substrate for caspases associated with inflammation (caspase-1, -4, and -5). Furthermore, caspase-dependent processing of IL-33 was not required for ST2 receptor binding or ST2-dependent activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. Indeed, caspase-dependent proteolysis of IL-33 dramatically attenuated IL-33 bioactivity in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that IL-33 does not require proteolysis for activation, but rather, that IL-33 bioactivity is diminished through caspase-dependent proteolysis within apoptotic cells. Thus, caspase-mediated proteolysis acts as a switch to dampen the proinflammatory properties of IL-33.","3047":"CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells (NKT cells) possess a wide range of effector and regulatory activities that are related to their ability to secrete both T helper 1 (Th1) cell- and Th2 cell-type cytokines. We analyzed presentation of NKT cell activating alpha galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer) analogs that give predominantly Th2 cell-type cytokine responses to determine how ligand structure controls the outcome of NKT cell activation. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for alphaGalCer-CD1d complexes to visualize and quantitate glycolipid presentation, we found that Th2 cell-type cytokine-biasing ligands were characterized by rapid and direct loading of cell-surface CD1d proteins. Complexes formed by association of these Th2 cell-type cytokine-biasing alphaGalCer analogs with CD1d showed a distinctive exclusion from ganglioside-enriched, detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains of antigen-presenting cells. These findings help to explain how subtle alterations in glycolipid ligand structure can control the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities of NKT cells.","3048":"Effector T cell differentiation requires the simultaneous integration of multiple, and sometimes opposing, cytokine signals. We demonstrated mTOR's role in dictating the outcome of T cell fate. mTOR-deficient T cells displayed normal activation and IL-2 production upon initial stimulation. However, such cells failed to differentiate into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, or Th17 effector cells. The inability to differentiate was associated with decreased STAT transcription factor activation and failure to upregulate lineage-specific transcription factors. Under normally activating conditions, T cells lacking mTOR differentiated into Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. This was associated with hyperactive Smad3 activation in the absence of exogenous TGF-beta. Surprisingly, T cells selectively deficient in TORC1 do not divert to a regulatory T cell pathway, implicating both TORC1 and TORC2 in preventing the generation of regulatory T cells. Overall, our studies suggest that mTOR kinase signaling regulates decisions between effector and regulatory T cell lineage commitment.","3049":"The pattern recognition theory proposed by the late Charles Janeway, Jr. 20 years ago provided a conceptual framework for our current understanding of the innate immune recognition and its role in the activation of adaptive immunity. Discovery of several families of pattern recognition receptors and their roles in mammalian immunity provided experimental support for the Janeway's theory. In addition to pattern recognition, there are other forms of innate immune sensing, which presumably work in specific combinations depending on the pathogen class and the type of the immune response they elicit. Here, the development of the Janeway's theory is discussed in the context of the advances made in field of innate immune recognition over the past two decades.","3050":"In this issue of Immunity, Miyara et al. (2009) demonstrate that FoxP3(+) cells in human peripheral blood are heterogeneous in function, and CD45RA expression defines their different stages of differentiation.","3051":"Mutations in the human NLRP3 gene cause interleukin-1beta-related autoinflammatory syndromes.

In this issue of Immunity, Delgoffe et al. (2009) use genetic approaches and demonstrate that mTOR kinase plays a critical role in this decision-making process.","3053":"In this issue of Immunity, Xu et al. (2009) find that the transcription factor PLZF activates interferon-stimulated genes and facilitates natural killer cell functions. Interferon-induced PLZF phosphorylation and histone deacetylase 1 recruitment probably mediates the repressor-to-activator conversion.","3054":"NOD1 and 2 are intracellular sentinels critical to innate immunity. In this issue of Immunity, Bertrand et al. (2009) fill in a gap in the NOD signaling cascade by demonstrating that cIAP1 and 2 function as E3 ubiquitin ligases for the RIP2 signaling molecule.","3055":"Dendritic cell (DC) differentiation is regulated by stroma via a network of soluble and cell-bound factors. Notch is one of the major elements of this network. Its role in DC differentiation, however, is controversial. Here, we demonstrate that activation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) promoted differentiation of conventional DCs via activation of the canonical Wingless (Wnt) pathway. Inhibition of the Wnt pathway abrogated the effect of Notch on DC differentiation. The fact that activation of the Wnt pathway in Notch-1-deficient embryonic stem cells restored DC differentiation indicates that Wnt signaling is downstream of the Notch pathway in regulating DC differentiation. Notch signaling activated the Wnt pathway in HPCs via expression of multiple members of the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors, which was directly regulated by the CSL (RPB-Jkappa) transcription factor. Thus, these data suggest a model of DC differentiation via cooperation between Wnt and Notch pathways.","3056":"Memory lymphocytes are characterized by their ability to exhibit a rapid response to the recall antigen, in which differential transcription is important, yet the underlying mechanism is not understood. We report here a genome-wide analysis of histone methylation on two histone H3 lysine residues (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and gene expression profiles in naive and memory CD8(+) T cells. We found that specific correlation exists between gene expression and the amounts of H3K4me3 (positive correlation) and H3K27me3 (negative correlation) across the gene body. These correlations displayed four distinct modes (repressive, active, poised, and bivalent), reflecting different functions of these genes in CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, a permissive chromatin state of each gene was established by a combination of different histone modifications. Our findings reveal a complex regulation by histone methylation in differential gene expression and suggest that histone methylation may be responsible for memory CD8(+) T cell function.","3057":"Interferons (IFNs) direct innate and acquired immune responses and, accordingly, are used therapeutically to treat a number of diseases, yet the diverse effects they elicit are not fully understood. Here, we identified the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulated an association of PLZF with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice had a specific ISG expression defect and as a result were more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlated with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFN signaling and the induction of innate antiviral immunity.","3058":"Missense mutations of the gene encoding NLRP3 are associated with autoinflammatory disorders characterized with excessive production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Here we analyzed the immune responses of gene-targeted mice carrying a mutation in the Nlrp3 gene equivalent to the human mutation associated with Muckle-Wells Syndrome. We found that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from such mice produced massive amounts of IL-1beta upon stimulation with microbial stimuli in the absence of ATP. This was likely due to a diminished inflammasome activation threshold that allowed a response to the small amount of agonist. Moreover, the Nlrp3 gene-targeted mice exhibited skin inflammation characterized by neutrophil infiltration and a Th17 cytokine-dominant response, which originated from hematopoietic cells. The inflammation of Nlrp3 gene-targeted mice resulted from excess IL-1beta production from APCs, which augmented Th17 cell differentiation. These results demonstrate that the NLRP3 mutation leads to inflammasome hyperactivation and consequently Th17 cell-dominant immunopathology in autoinflammation.","3059":"NLRP3 nucleates the inflammasome, a protein complex responsible for cleavage of prointerleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) to its active form. Mutations in the NLRP3 gene cause the autoinflammatory disease spectrum cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). The central role of IL-1beta in CAPS is supported by the response to IL-1-targeted therapy. We developed two Nlrp3 mutant knockin mouse strains to model CAPS to examine the role of other inflammatory mediators and adaptive immune responses in an innate immune-driven disease. These mice had systemic inflammation and poor growth, similar to some human CAPS patients, and demonstrated early mortality, primarily mediated by myeloid cells. Mating these mutant mice to various gene mutant backgrounds showed that the mouse disease phenotype required an intact inflammasome, was only partially dependent on IL-1beta, and was independent of T cells. These data suggest that CAPS are true inflammasome-mediated diseases and provide insight for more common inflammatory disorders.","3060":"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has multiple functions in both the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) and is regulated at many levels. We identified an isoform of the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) accessory protein (termed AcPb) that is expressed exclusively in the CNS. AcPb interacted with IL-1 and the IL-1R but was unable to mediate canonical IL-1 responses. AcPb expression, however, modulated neuronal gene expression in response to IL-1 treatment in vitro. Animals lacking AcPb demonstrated an intact peripheral IL-1 response and developed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) similarly to wild-type mice. AcPb-deficient mice were instead more vulnerable to local inflammatory challenge in the CNS and suffered enhanced neuronal degeneration as compared to AcP-deficient or wild-type mice. These findings implicate AcPb as an additional component of the highly regulated IL-1 system and suggest that it may play a role in modulating CNS responses to IL-1 and the interplay between inflammation and neuronal survival.","3061":"Milky spots are located in the omentum of the peritoneal cavity and their classification as lymphoid organs has been debated. In this issue of Immunity, Rangel-Moreno et al. (2009) provide compelling data to consider them as unique secondary lymphoid organs.","3062":"Perforation of membranes and pore formation is mediated by polymerization of proteins of the immune system, complement C9 and Perforin, which share the conserved MACPF domain. In this issue of Immunity, Baran et al. (2009) identify the molecular mechanism initiating polymerization as charge interactions in the MACPF domain.","3063":"In this issue of Immunity, Schulz et al. (2009) use mathematical modeling to elucidate a signaling network controlling Ifng gene expression, thereby showing the importance of an Interleukin-12-dependent, Interferon-gamma-independent second phase of inducing the transcription factor T-bet.","3064":"Immune system regulation is of paramount importance to host survival. In settings of autoimmunity and alloimmunity, control is lost, resulting in injury to vital organs and tissues. Naturally occurring, thymic-derived T regulatory (Treg) cells that express CD4, CD25, and the forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) are potent suppressors of these adverse immune responses. Preclinical studies have shown that either freshly isolated or ex vivo expanded Treg cells can prevent both local and systemic organ and tissue destruction. Although promising, human Treg cell infusion therapy has heretofore been difficult to implement in the clinic, and relatively few clinical trials have been initiated. This review will focus on the preclinical models that provide the rationale for current trials and it will address both the challenges and opportunities in human Treg cell therapy.","3065":"The differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells into lineages with distinct effector functions has been considered to be an irreversible event. T helper type 1 (Th1) cells stably express IFN-gamma, whereas Th2 cells express IL-4. The discovery and investigation of two other CD4(+) T cell subsets, induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells and Th17 cells, has led to a rethinking of the notion that helper T cell subsets represent irreversibly differentiated endpoints. Accumulating evidence suggests that CD4(+) T cells, particularly iTreg and Th17 cells, are more plastic than previously appreciated. It appears that expression of Foxp3 by iTreg cells or IL-17 by Th17 cells may not be stable and that there is a great degree of flexibility in their differentiation options. Here, we will discuss recent findings that demonstrate the plasticity of CD4(+) T cell differentiation and the biological implications of this flexibility.","3066":"Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells control all aspects of the immune response. Here, I will review the in vitro model systems that have been developed to define the mechanisms used by Treg cells to suppress a large number of distinct target cell types. These mechanisms can be broadly divided into those that target T cells (suppressor cytokines, IL-2 consumption, cytolysis) and those that primarily target antigen-presenting cells (decreased costimulation or decreased antigen presentation). Although multiple mechanisms for Treg cell suppression have been shown in vitro, it is unclear whether the same or different mechanisms are used by Treg cells in vivo. An increase in our understanding of Treg cell suppressor mechanisms will offer an insight into how Treg cell function can be manipulated either positively or negatively in vivo.","3067":"Adaptive Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T (iTreg) cells develop outside the thymus under subimmunogenic antigen presentation, during chronic inflammation, and during normal homeostasis of the gut. iTreg cells are essential in mucosal immune tolerance and in the control of severe chronic allergic inflammation, and most likely are one of the main barriers to the eradication of tumors. The Foxp3(+) iTreg cell repertoire is drawn from naive conventional CD4(+) T cells, whereas natural Treg (nTreg) cells are selected by high-avidity interactions in the thymus. The full extent of differences and similarities between iTreg and nTreg cells is yet to be defined. We speculate that iTreg cell development is driven by the need to maintain a noninflammatory environment in the gut, to suppress immune responses to environmental and food allergens, and to decrease chronic inflammation, whereas nTreg cells prevent autoimmunity and raise the activation threshold for all immune responses.","3068":"Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress pathology mediated by immune responses against self and foreign antigens and commensal microorganisms. Sustained expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, a key distinguishing feature of Treg cells, is required for their differentiation and suppressor function. In addition, Foxp3 expression prevents deviation of Treg cells into effector T cell lineages and confers dependence of Treg cell survival and expansion on growth factors, foremost interleukin-2, provided by activated effector T cells. In this review we discuss Treg cell differentiation and maintenance with a particular emphasis on molecular regulation of Foxp3 expression, arguably a key to mechanistic understanding of biology of regulatory T cells.","3069":"Regulatory T cells are important for ensuring that the immune system does not attack self and does not overreact to external antigens. Understanding how these cells develop and maintain stable function provides general insights into cellular differentiation in general, as well as new opportunities for therapeutic manipulation.","3070":"Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs) block apoptosis, but their physiological functions are still under investigation. Here, we report that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that are required for receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2) ubiquitination and for nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NOD) signaling. Macrophages derived from Birc2(-\/-) or Birc3(-\/-) mice, or colonocytes depleted of cIAP1 or cIAP2 by RNAi, were defective in NOD signaling and displayed sharp attenuation of cytokine and chemokine production. This blunted response was observed in vivo when Birc2(-\/-) and Birc3(-\/-) mice were challenged with NOD agonists. Defects in NOD2 signaling are associated with Crohn's disease, and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) activation of NOD2 signaling protects mice from experimental colitis. Here, we show that administration of MDP protected wild-type but not Ripk2(-\/-) or Birc3(-\/-) mice from colitis, confirming the role of the cIAPs in NOD2 signaling in vivo. This discovery provides therapeutic opportunities in the treatment of NOD-dependent immunologic and inflammatory diseases.","3071":"Ligation of the alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR) by a specific peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule initiates T cell signaling via the CD3 complex. However, the initial events that link antigen recognition to T cell signal transduction remain unclear. Here we show, via fluorescence-based experiments and structural analyses, that MHC-restricted antigen recognition by the alphabeta TCR results in a specific conformational change confined to the A-B loop within the alpha chain of the constant domain (Calpha). The apparent affinity constant of this A-B loop movement mirrored that of alphabeta TCR-pMHC ligation and was observed in two alphabeta TCRs with distinct pMHC specificities. The Ag-induced A-B loop conformational change could be inhibited by fixing the juxtapositioning of the constant domains and was shown to be reversible upon pMHC disassociation. Notably, the loop movement within the Calpha domain, although specific for an agonist pMHC ligand, was not observed with a pMHC antagonist. Moreover, mutagenesis of residues within the A-B loop impaired T cell signaling in an in vitro system of antigen-specific TCR stimulation. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the earliest molecular events that underlie Ag-induced T cell triggering.","3072":"FoxP3 is a key transcription factor for the development and function of natural CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Here we show that human FoxP3(+)CD4(+) T cells were composed of three phenotypically and functionally distinct subpopulations: CD45RA(+)FoxP3(lo) resting Treg cells (rTreg cells) and CD45RA(-)FoxP3(hi) activated Treg cells (aTreg cells), both of which were suppressive in vitro, and cytokine-secreting CD45RA(-)FoxP3(lo) nonsuppressive T cells. The proportion of the three subpopulations differed between cord blood, aged individuals, and patients with immunological diseases. Terminally differentiated aTreg cells rapidly died whereas rTreg cells proliferated and converted into aTreg cells in vitro and in vivo. This was shown by the transfer of rTreg cells into NOD-scid-common gamma-chain-deficient mice and by TCR sequence-based T cell clonotype tracing in peripheral blood in a normal individual. Taken together, the dissection of FoxP3(+) cells into subsets enables one to analyze Treg cell differentiation dynamics and interactions in normal and disease states, and to control immune responses through manipulating particular FoxP3(+) subpopulations.","3073":"The full set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the human genome is not known. Because presently known miRNAs have been identified by virtue of their abundant expression in a few cell types, many tissue-specific miRNAs remain unrevealed. To understand the role of miRNAs in B cell function and lymphomagenesis, we generated short-RNA libraries from normal human B cells at different stages of development (naive, germinal center, memory) and from a Burkitt lymphoma cell line. A combination of cloning and computational analysis identified 178 miRNAs (miRNome) expressed in normal and\/or transformed B cell libraries. Most notably, the B cell miRNome included 75 miRNAs which to our knowledge have not been previously reported and of which 66 have been validated by RNA blot and\/or RT-PCR analyses. Numerous miRNAs were expressed in a stage- or transformation-specific fashion in B cells, suggesting specific functional or pathologic roles. These results provide a resource for studying the role of miRNAs in B cell development, immune function, and lymphomagenesis.","3074":"Perforin, a pore-forming protein secreted by cytotoxic lymphocytes, is indispensable for destroying virus-infected cells and for maintaining immune homeostasis. Perforin polymerizes into transmembrane channels that inflict osmotic stress and facilitate target cell uptake of proapoptotic granzymes. Despite this, the mechanism through which perforin monomers self-associate remains unknown. Our current study establishes the molecular basis for perforin oligomerization and pore assembly. We show that after calcium-dependent membrane binding, direct ionic attraction between the opposite faces of adjacent perforin monomers was necessary for pore formation. By using mutagenesis, we identified the opposing charges on residues Arg213 (positive) and Glu343 (negative) to be critical for intermolecular interaction. Specifically, disrupting this interaction had no effect on perforin synthesis, folding, or trafficking in the killer cell, but caused a marked kinetic defect of oligomerization at the target cell membrane, severely disrupting lysis and granzyme B-induced apoptosis. Our study provides important insights into perforin's mechanism of action.","3075":"CD4(+) T lymphocytes are key to immunological memory. Here we show that in the memory phase of specific immune responses, most of the memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes had relocated into the bone marrow (BM) within 3-8 weeks after their generation-a process involving integrin alpha2. Antigen-specific memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes highly expressed Ly-6C, unlike most splenic CD44(hi)CD62L(-) CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In adult mice, more than 80% of Ly-6C(hi)CD44(hi)CD62L(-) memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes were in the BM. In the BM, they associated to IL-7-expressing VCAM-1(+) stroma cells. Gene expression and proliferation were downregulated, indicating a resting state. Upon challenge with antigen, they rapidly expressed cytokines and CD154 and efficiently induced the production of high-affinity antibodies by B lymphocytes. Thus, in the memory phase of immunity, memory helper T cells are maintained in BM as resting but highly reactive cells in survival niches defined by IL-7-expressing stroma cells.","3076":"The omentum is a site of B1 cell lymphopoiesis and immune responsiveness to T cell-independent antigens. However, it is unknown whether it supports immune responses independently of conventional lymphoid organs. We showed that the omentum collected antigens and cells from the peritoneal cavity and supported T cell-dependent B cell responses, including isotype switching, somatic hypermutation, and limited affinity maturation, despite the lack of identifiable follicular dendritic cells. The omentum also supported CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to peritoneal antigens and recruited effector T cells primed in other locations. Unlike conventional lymphoid organs, milky spots in the omentum developed in the absence of lymphoid tissue-inducer cells, but required the chemokine CXCL13. Although the lymphoid architecture of milky spots was disrupted in lymphotoxin-deficient mice, normal architecture was restored by reconstitution with lymphotoxin-sufficient hematopoietic cells. These results indicate that the milky spots of the omentum function as unique secondary lymphoid organs that promote immunity to peritoneal antigens.","3077":"Differentiation of naive T lymphocytes into type I T helper (Th1) cells requires interferon-gamma and interleukin-12. It is puzzling that interferon-gamma induces the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, whereas interleukin-12 mediates Th1 cell lineage differentiation. We use mathematical modeling to analyze the expression kinetics of T-bet, interferon-gamma, and the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain (IL-12Rbeta2) during Th1 cell differentiation, in the presence or absence of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma signaling. We show that interferon-gamma induced initial T-bet expression, whereas IL-12Rbeta2 was repressed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The termination of TCR signaling permitted upregulation of IL-12Rbeta2 by T-bet and interleukin-12 signaling that maintained T-bet expression. This late expression of T-bet, accompanied by the upregulation of the transcription factors Runx3 and Hlx, was required to imprint the Th cell for interferon-gamma re-expression. Thus initial polarization and subsequent imprinting of Th1 cells are mediated by interlinked, sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-interferon-gamma-Stat1-T-bet and interleukin-12-Stat4-T-bet signaling.","3078":"Integrin-mediated adhesion plays a central role in T cell trafficking and activation. Genetic inactivation of the guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein alpha-subunits Galpha(12) and Galpha(13) resulted in an increased activity of integrin leukocyte-function-antigen-1 in murine CD4(+) T cells. The interaction with allogeneic dendritic cells was enhanced, leading to an abnormal proliferative response in vitro. In vivo, T cell-specific inactivation of Galpha(12) and Galpha(13) caused lymphadenopathy due to increased lymph node entry and enhanced T cell proliferation, and the susceptibility toward T cell-mediated diseases was enhanced. Mechanistically, we show that in the absence of Galpha(12) and Galpha(13) the activity of the small GTPases Rac1 and Rap1 was increased, whereas signaling of the small GTPase RhoA was strongly reduced. Our data indicate that locally produced mediators signal through Galpha(12)- and Galpha(13)-coupled receptors to negatively regulate cell polarization and adhesiveness, thereby fine-tuning T cell trafficking, proliferation, and susceptibility toward T cell-mediated diseases.","3079":"T cell development depends on the coordinated interplay between receptor signaling and transcriptional regulation. Through a genetic complementation screen a transcriptional repressor, NKAP, was identified. NKAP associated with the histone deacetylase HDAC3 and was shown to be part of a DNA-binding complex, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. NKAP also associated with the Notch corepressor complex. The expression of NKAP during T cell development inversely correlated with the expression of Notch target genes, implying that NKAP may modulate Notch-mediated transcription. To examine the function of NKAP in T cell development, we ablated NKAP by Lck(cre). Loss of NKAP blocked development of alphabeta but not gammadelta T cells, and Nkap(fl\/o)Lck(cre) DP T cells expressed 8- to 20-fold higher amounts of Hes1, Deltex1, and CD25 mRNA. Thus, NKAP functions as a transcriptional repressor, acting on Notch target genes, and is required for alphabeta T cell development.","3080":"","3081":"","3082":"","3083":"Protein kinase D (PKD) mediates signal transduction downstream from phospholipase C and diacylglycerol (DAG). PKDs are activated by hormones and stress in cell lines, but little is known about PKD functions and regulation in vivo. Here, we show that DKF-2, a C. elegans PKD, regulates innate immunity. Animals lacking DKF-2 were hypersensitive to killing by bacteria that are pathogens of C. elegans and humans. DKF-2 induced 85 mRNAs, which encode antimicrobial peptides and proteins that sustain intestinal epithelium. Induction of immune effector mRNAs by DKF-2 proceeded via PMK-1 (p38 Map-kinase)-dependent and -independent pathways. TPA-1, a PKCdelta homolog, regulated activation and functions of DKF-2 in vivo. Therefore, DKF-2 provides a molecular link that couples DAG signaling to regulation of immunity. This intersection between DAG-TPA-1-DKF-2 and PMK-1 pathways enables integrated immune responses to multiple stimuli. Thus, a PKD mobilizes activation of host immune defenses against pathogens by previously unappreciated signaling pathways and mechanisms.","3084":"Classical alphabeta T cells protect the host by monitoring intracellular and extracellular proteins in a two-step process. The first step is protein degradation and combination with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, leading to surface expression of this amalgam (antigen processing). The second step is the interaction of the T cell receptor with the MHC-peptide complex, leading to signaling in the T cells (antigen recognition). The context for this interaction is a T cell-antigen presenting cell junction, known as an immunological synapse if symmetric and stable and as a kinapse if asymmetric and mobile. The physiological recognition of a ligand takes place most efficiently in the F-actin-rich lamellipodium and is F-actin dependent in stages of formation and triggering and myosin II dependent for signal amplification. This review discusses how these concepts emerged from early studies on adhesion, signaling, and cell biology of T cells.","3085":"Autophagy has many roles in immunity, including the control of intracellular microbes by a cell-autonomous mechanism. In this issue of Immunity, Shelly et al. (2009) use VSV infection in Drosophila to show the role of autophagy genes in controlling viruses.","3086":"A wide variety of stimuli induce the inflammasome, but little is known about its role in immune protection against viruses. In this issue of Immunity, Allen et al. (2009) and Thomas et al. (2009) describe a critical role for NLRP3 induction of the inflammasome and protection against influenza virus infection.","3087":"In this issue of Immunity, Ng et al. (2009) show that lymphoid-lineage priming occurs in hematopoietic stem cells and is dependent on the Ikaros transcription factor, as is repression of self-renewal genes during lymphoid differentiation.","3088":"","3089":"Virus-induced interlukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18 production in macrophages are mediated via caspase-1 pathway. Multiple microbial components, including viral RNA, are thought to trigger assembly of the cryopyrin inflammasome resulting in caspase-1 activation. Here, we demonstrated that Nlrp3(-\/-) and Casp1(-\/-) mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice after infection with a pathogenic influenza A virus. This enhanced morbidity correlated with decreased neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and reduced cytokine and chemokine production. Despite the effect on innate immunity, cryopyrin-deficiency was not associated with any obvious defect in virus control or on the later emergence of the adaptive response. Early epithelial necrosis was, however, more severe in the infected mutants, with extensive collagen deposition leading to later respiratory compromise. These findings reveal a function of the cryopyrin inflammasome in healing responses. Thus, cryopyrin and caspase-1 are central to both innate immunity and to moderating lung pathology in influenza pneumonia.","3090":"T helper (Th) 17 cells have been recently discovered in both mouse and human. Here we show that interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling on T cells is critically required for the early programming of Th17 cell lineage and Th17 cell-mediated autoimmunity. IL-1 receptor1 expression in T cells, which was induced by IL-6, was necessary for the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and for early Th17 cell differentiation in vivo. Moreover, IL-1 signaling in T cells was required in dendritic cell-mediated Th17 cell differentiation from naive or regulatory precursors and IL-1 synergized with IL-6 and IL-23 to regulate Th17 cell differentiation and maintain cytokine expression in effector Th17 cells. Importantly, IL-1 regulated the expression of the transcription factors IRF4 and RORgammat during Th17 cell differentiation; overexpression of these two factors resulted in IL-1-independent Th17 cell polarization. Our data thus indicate a critical role of IL-1 in Th17 cell differentiation and this pathway may serve as a unique target for Th17 cell-mediated immunopathology.","3091":"Intrinsic innate immune mechanisms are the first line of defense against pathogens and exist to control infection autonomously in infected cells. Here, we showed that autophagy, an intrinsic mechanism that can degrade cytoplasmic components, played a direct antiviral role against the mammalian viral pathogen vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in the model organism Drosophila. We found that the surface glycoprotein, VSV-G, was likely the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that initiated this cell-autonomous response. Once activated, autophagy decreased viral replication, and repression of autophagy led to increased viral replication and pathogenesis in cells and animals. Lastly, we showed that the antiviral response was controlled by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-signaling pathway, which normally regulates autophagy in response to nutrient availability. Altogether, these data uncover an intrinsic antiviral program that links viral recognition to the evolutionarily conserved nutrient-signaling and autophagy pathways.","3092":"The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) family of pattern-recognition molecules mediate host immunity to various pathogenic stimuli. However, in vivo evidence for the involvement of NLR proteins in viral sensing has not been widely investigated and remains controversial. As a test of the physiologic role of the NLR molecule NLRP3 during RNA viral infection, we explored the in vivo role of NLRP3 inflammasome components during influenza virus infection. Mice lacking Nlrp3, Pycard, or caspase-1, but not Nlrc4, exhibited dramatically increased mortality and a reduced immune response after exposure to the influenza virus. Utilizing analogs of dsRNA (poly(I:C)) and ssRNA (ssRNA40), we demonstrated that an NLRP3-mediated response could be activated by RNA species. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome activation by the influenza virus was dependent on lysosomal maturation and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of ROS induction eliminated IL-1beta production in animals during influenza infection. Together, these data place the NLRP3 inflammasome as an essential component in host defense against influenza infection through the sensing of viral RNA.","3093":"T helper 1 (Th1)-Th2 cell balance is key to host defense and its dysregulation has pathophysiological consequences. Basophils are important in Th2 cell differentiation. However, the factors controlling the onset and extent of basophil-mediated Th2 cell differentiation are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Lyn kinase dampened basophil expression of the transcription factor GATA-3 and the initiation and extent of Th2 cell differentiation. Lyn-deficient mice had a marked basophilia, a constitutive Th2 cell skewing that was exacerbated upon in vivo challenge of basophils, produced antibodies to a normally inert antigen, and failed to appropriately respond to a Th1 cell-inducing pathogen. The Th2 cell skewing was dependent on basophils, immunoglobulin E, and interleukin-4, but was independent of mast cells. Our findings demonstrate that basophil-expressed Lyn kinase exerts regulatory control on Th2 cell differentiation and function.","3094":"Pax5 is an essential regulator of B cell identity and function. Here, we used transgenesis and deletion mapping to identify a potent enhancer in intron 5 of the Pax5 locus. This enhancer in combination with the promoter region was sufficient to recapitulate the B lymphoid expression of Pax5. The enhancer was silenced by DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells, but became activated in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. It contained functional binding sites for the transcription factors PU.1, IRF4, IRF8, and NF-kappaB, suggesting that these regulators contribute to sequential enhancer activation in hematopoietic progenitors and during B cell development. In contrast, the promoter region was repressed by Polycomb group proteins in non-B cells and was activated only at the onset of pro-B cell development through induction of chromatin remodeling by the transcription factor EBF1. These experiments demonstrate a stepwise activation of Pax5 in early lymphopoiesis and provide mechanistic insights into the process of B cell commitment.","3095":"The mechanisms regulating lineage potential during early hematopoiesis were investigated. First, a cascade of lineage-affiliated gene expression signatures, primed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and differentially propagated in lineage-restricted progenitors, was identified. Lymphoid transcripts were primed as early as the HSC, together with myeloid and erythroid transcripts. Although this multilineage priming was resolved upon subsequent lineage restrictions, an unexpected cosegregation of lymphoid and myeloid gene expression and potential past a nominal myeloid restriction point was identified. Finally, we demonstrated that whereas the zinc finger DNA-binding factor Ikaros was required for induction of lymphoid lineage priming in the HSC, it was also necessary for repression of genetic programs compatible with self-renewal and multipotency downstream of the HSC. Taken together, our studies provide new insight into the priming and restriction of lineage potentials during early hematopoiesis and identify Ikaros as a key bivalent regulator of this process.","3096":"A unique subpopulation of spleen dendritic cells (DCs) that express the CD8 surface marker efficiently present phagocytosed antigens to CD8(+) T lymphocytes in a process called \"crosspresentation,\" which initiates cytotoxic immune responses. We now show that the small GTPase Rac2 plays a critical role in antigen crosspresentation selectively in this DC subpopulation. In CD8(+) DCs, Rac2 determines the subcellular assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex (NOX2) to phagosomes, whereas in CD8(-) DCs, Rac1 mediates the assembly of NOX2 at the plasma membrane. In the absence of Rac2, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in DC-phagosomes was abolished, the phagosomal pH dropped, and the efficiency of antigen crosspresentation was reduced. We conclude that the activity of Rac1 and 2 control crosspresentation in DC subpopulations through the regulation of phagosomal oxidation and pH.","3097":"To determine the site and mechanism of suppression by regulatory T (Treg) cells, we investigated their migration and function in an islet allograft model. Treg cells first migrated from blood to the inflamed allograft where they were essential for the suppression of alloimmunity. This process was dependent on the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR4, and CCR5 and P- and E-selectin ligands. In the allograft, Treg cells were activated and subsequently migrated to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) in a CCR2, CCR5, and CCR7 fashion; this movement was essential for optimal suppression. Treg cells inhibited dendritic cell migration in a TGF-beta and IL-10 dependent fashion and suppressed antigen-specific T effector cell migration, accumulation, and proliferation in dLNs and allografts. These results showed that sequential migration from blood to the target tissue and to dLNs is required for Treg cells to differentiate and execute fully their suppressive function.","3098":"The lymphotoxin LTalpha(1)beta(2) supports the development and maintenance of several aspects of spleen structure, but its significance for marginal sinus (MS) vascular organization is unclear. We showed here that, in early postnatal lymphotoxin-deficient mice, the developing Flk-1+ white pulp vessels failed to organize or upregulate MAdCAM-1, leading to altered spatial rearrangement of both the white pulp endothelial cells and the smooth muscle actin-expressing cells. In vitro, MAdCAM-1 directed the reorganization of LTbeta receptor+ endothelial cells grown on Matrigel. LTalpha(1)beta(2) also regulated the maintenance of both MAdCAM-1 expression and mature MS structure in adult mice, contributing importantly to normal trafficking of CD11b+ cells in response to bacterial antigens. Together, our studies demonstrate that LTalpha(1)beta(2) and LTbeta receptor signals control proper development and maintenance of the mature MS structure and implicate MAdCAM-1 in the structuring of the MS endothelial cells that is important for the movement of immune cells within the spleen.","3099":"Environmental factors account for 75% of the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Numerous infections have been suspected as environmental disease triggers, but none of them has consistently been incriminated, and it is unclear how so many different infections may play a role. We show that a microbial peptide, common to several major classes of bacteria, can induce MS-like disease in humanized mice by crossreacting with a T cell receptor (TCR) that also recognizes a peptide from myelin basic protein, a candidate MS autoantigen. Structural analysis demonstrates this crossreactivity is due to structural mimicry of a binding hotspot shared by self and microbial antigens, rather than to degenerate TCR recognition. Biophysical studies reveal that the autoreactive TCR binding affinity is markedly lower for the microbial (mimicry) peptide than for the autoantigenic peptide. Thus, these data suggest a possible explanation for the difficulty in incriminating individual infections in the development of MS.","3100":"Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are the class of effector T helper cells that regulates the step-wise development of antigen-specific B cell immunity in vivo. Deployment of CXCR5+ Tfh cells to B cell zones of lymphoid tissues and stable cognate interactions with B cells are central to the delivery of antigen-specific Tfh cell function. Here, we review recent advances that have helped to unravel distinctive elements of developmental programming for Tfh cells and unique effector Tfh cell functions focused on antigen-primed B cells. Understanding the regulatory functions of Tfh cells in the germinal center and the subsequent regulation of memory B cell responses to antigen recall represent the frontiers of this research area with the potential to alter fundamentally the design of future vaccines.","3101":"In this issue of Immunity, Zhang et al. (2009) propose that Treg cells, in order to efficiently control alloimmune response, need to be educated first in the target tissue before entering the draining lymph node.","3102":"Interleukin 7 (IL-7), which is required for T cell survival, was previously found in lymphoid tissues. In this issue of Immunity, Sawa et al. (2009) have identified the liver as a new source of IL-7.","3103":"In this issue of Immunity, Wojciechowski et al. (2009) demonstrate that in addition to producing antibodies, B cells play pivotal roles in specific-antigen presentation and cytokine production for optimal T helper 2 responses required for protection against Heligmosomoides polygyrus.","3104":"In this issue of Immunity, Shulman et al. (2009) describe shear-facilitated chemokine-induced adhesive filopodia on crawling T lymphocytes that scan the endothelial surface for potential sites of transendothelial migration. These filopodia facilitate a novel millipede-like mode of lymphocyte locomotion over endothelial cells prior to extravasation.","3105":"In this issue of Immunity, Chalifour et al. (2009) show that for natural killer (NK) cells to achieve their full effector potential, NK inhibitory receptors must developmentally interact with MHC-I ligands expressed in cis.","3106":"Current models of the germinal center (GC) response propose that after stimulation at the edges of T cell zones, pre-GC B cells directly migrate to the center of follicles and proliferate to form GCs. We followed the interrelationship of proliferation, differentiation, and microenvironmental locale in populations of pre-GC B cells responding to antigen. In contrast to the predictions of current models, after accumulation at the T-B interface, these cells appeared at the perimeter of follicles adjacent to the marginal zone. There, they rapidly proliferated for several days but underwent no V gene hypermutation and little heavy-chain class switching. Their chemokine receptor expression pattern indicated that these cells were sessile, yet they had begun to acquire many phenotypic characteristics of GC B cells. The expanded clones were subsequently observed in the center of follicles, suggesting that GCs are created by coalescence of B cells from this follicular perimeter response.","3107":"Viral infection activates transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF3, which collaborate to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and elicit innate antiviral response. MITA (also known as STING) has recently been identified as an adaptor that links virus-sensing receptors to IRF3 activation. Here, we showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 interacted with MITA in a viral-infection-dependent manner. Overexpression of RNF5 inhibited virus-triggered IRF3 activation, IFNB1 expression, and cellular antiviral response, whereas knockdown of RNF5 had opposite effects. RNF5 targeted MITA at Lys150 for ubiquitination and degradation after viral infection. Both MITA and RNF5 were located at the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and viral infection caused their redistribution to the ER and mitochondria, respectively. We further found that virus-induced ubiquitination and degradation of MITA by RNF5 occurred at the mitochondria. These findings suggest that RNF5 negatively regulates virus-triggered signaling by targeting MITA for ubiquitination and degradation at the mitochondria.","3108":"Members of the Forkhead box O (Foxo) family of transcription factors are key regulators of cellular responses, but their function in the immune system remains incompletely understood. Here we showed that T cell-specific deletion of Foxo1 gene in mice led to spontaneous T cell activation, effector T cell differentiation, autoantibody production, and the induction of inflammatory bowel disease in a transfer model. In addition, Foxo1 was critical for the maintenance of naive T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs. Transcriptome analyses of T cells identified Foxo1-regulated genes encoding, among others, cell-surface molecules, signaling proteins, and nuclear factors that control gene expression. Functional studies validated interleukin-7 receptor-alpha as a Foxo1 target gene essential for Foxo1 maintenance of naive T cells. These findings reveal crucial functions of Foxo1-dependent transcription in control of T cell homeostasis and tolerance.","3109":"Systemic cytokine activity in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces the expression of various proteins in the liver after infections. Here we show that Interleukin-7 (IL-7), the production of which was thought to occur at a constant rate in vivo, was a hepatically expressed protein that directly controled T cell responses. Depletion of IL-7 expression in the liver abrogated several TLR-mediated T cell events, including enhanced CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell survival, augmented CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity, and the development of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, a Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Thus, T cell responses are regulated by hepatocyte-derived IL-7, which is expressed in response to TLR signaling in vivo. We suggested that TLR-induced IL-7 expression in the liver, which is an acute-phase response, may be a good diagnostic and therapeutic target for efficient vaccine developments and for conditions characterized by TLR-mediated T cell dysregulation, including autoimmune diseases.","3110":"Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) suppresses innate immunity by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production from monocytic cells. Enhanced expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been suggested to be the mechanism of suppression. However, cAMP is still capable of suppressing production of the cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-12 in IL-10-deficient dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we demonstrated that the transcription factor c-Fos was responsible for the cAMP-mediated suppression of inflammatory cytokine production. c-Fos accumulated at high amounts in response to cAMP and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Overexpression of c-Fos suppressed LPS-induced cytokine production, whereas cAMP-mediated suppression of TNF-alpha and IL-12 was impaired in Fos(-\/-) DCs or in RAW264.7 cells treated with c-Fos siRNA. c-Fos physically interacted with p65 protein and reduced the recruitment of p65 to the Tnf promoter. Multiple sites of c-Fos were phosphorylated by the IKKbeta protein. Thus, we propose that c-Fos is a substrate of IKKbeta and is responsible for the immunosuppressive effect of cAMP.","3111":"Endothelial chemokines are instrumental for integrin-mediated lymphocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration (TEM). By dissecting how chemokines trigger lymphocyte integrins to support shear-resistant motility on and across cytokine-stimulated endothelial barriers, we found a critical role for high-affinity (HA) LFA-1 integrin in lymphocyte crawling on activated endothelium. Endothelial-presented chemokines triggered HA-LFA-1 and adhesive filopodia at numerous submicron dots scattered underneath crawling lymphocytes. Shear forces applied to endothelial-bound lymphocytes dramatically enhanced filopodia density underneath crawling lymphocytes. A fraction of the adhesive filopodia invaded the endothelial cells prior to and during TEM and extended large subluminal leading edge containing dots of HA-LFA-1 occupied by subluminal ICAM-1. Memory T cells generated more frequent invasive filopodia and transmigrated more rapidly than their naive counterparts. We propose that shear forces exerted on HA-LFA-1 trigger adhesive and invasive filopodia at apical endothelial surfaces and thereby promote lymphocyte crawling and probing for TEM sites.","3112":"Natural killer (NK) cells show enhanced functional competence when they express inhibitory receptors specific for inherited major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. Current models imply that NK cell education requires an interaction of inhibitory receptors with MHC-I expressed on other cells. However, the inhibitory Ly49A receptor can also bind MHC-I ligand on the NK cell itself (in cis). Here we describe a Ly49A variant, which can engage MHC-I expressed on other cells but not in cis. Even though this variant inhibited NK cell effector function, it failed to educate NK cells. The association with MHC-I in cis sequestered wild-type Ly49A, and this was found to relieve NK cells from a suppressive effect of unengaged Ly49A. These data explain how inhibitory MHC-I receptors can facilitate NK cell activation. They dissociate classical inhibitory from educating functions of Ly49A and suggest that cis interaction of Ly49A is necessary for NK cell education.","3113":"Immunity to the intestinal parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus is dependent on the successful generation of T helper 2 (Th2) memory cells. We showed that B cells contribute to immunity against H. polygyrus by producing antibody (Ab) and by promoting expansion and differentiation of primary and memory Th2 cells. We also demonstrated that cytokine-producing effector B cells were essential for effective immunity to H. polygyrus. Tumor necrosis factor alpha production by B cells was necessary for sustained Ab production, whereas interleukin 2 production by B cells was necessary for Th2 cell expansion and differentiation. These results show that B cells mediate protection from pathogens not only by presenting antigen and secreting antibody but also by producing cytokines that regulate the quality and magnitude of humoral and cellular immune responses.","3114":"FAS belongs to the subgroup of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family that contains an intracellular \"death domain\" and triggers apoptosis. Its physiological ligand FASL is a member of the TNF cytokine family. Studies with mutant mice and cells from human patients have shown that FAS plays critical roles in the immune system, including the killing of pathogen-infected cells and the death of obsolete and potentially dangerous lymphocytes. Fas thereby functions as a guardian against autoimmunity and tumor development. FAS triggers apoptosis through FADD-mediated recruitment and activation of caspase-8. In certain cells such as hepatocytes, albeit not lymphocytes, FAS-induced apoptosis requires amplification through proteolytic activation of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BID. Curiously, several components of the FAS signaling machinery have been implicated in nonapoptotic processes, including cellular activation, differentiation, and proliferation. This review describes current understanding of Fas-induced apoptosis signaling and proposes experimental strategies for future advances.","3115":"In this issue of Immunity, Roozendaal et al. (2009) visualize a conduit system within the lymph node follicle that allows transport of small antigens and chemokines from the subcapsular sinus to follicular B cells.","3116":"The Notch2 ligand DL1 is required for marginal zone B cell development. In this issue of Immunity, Tan et al. (2009) show that modification of Notch2 by Fringe enzymes is critical to maturing B cells for accessing DL1 on vascular endothelial cells.","3117":"In this issue of Immunity, Town et al. (2009) show the interplay between Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytokines during West Nile virus infection and define a role for TLR-mediated production of interleukin-23 in immune cell homing and pathogenesis.","3118":"CD40L expressed on T cells plays an important role in stimulating the function of dendritic cells (DCs). In this issue of Immunity, Johnson et al. (2009) demonstrate a role for DC-expressed CD40L in priming CD8(+) T cell responses.","3119":"In this issue of Immunity, Gras et al. (2009) provide structural hints on how acquisition of tolerance to a coexpressed MHC class I allele can deflect an antiviral response away from the immunodominant response.","3120":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) helps mediate lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, yet many mechanistic questions remain. Here, we show the presence of B lymphocyte egress sites located in the lymph node cortex close to lymph node follicles. B cells exited lymph nodes by squeezing through apparent portals in the lymphatic endothelium of these sinusoids. Treatment with the S1P receptor agonist FTY720 emptied the cortical sinusoids of lymphocytes, blocked lymphatic endothelial penetration, and displaced B lymphocytes into the T cell zone. S1pr3(-\/-) B cells, which lack chemoattractant responses to S1P, transited lymph nodes normally, whereas Gnai2(-\/-) B cells, which have impaired responses to chemokines and S1P, transited more rapidly than did wild-type cells. This study identifies a major site of B lymphocyte lymph node egress, shows that FTY720 treatment blocks passage through the cortical lymphatic endothelium, and argues against a functional role for S1P chemotaxis in B lymphocyte egress.","3121":"Notch2 activation induced by Delta-like-1 (DL1) drives development of splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells, an innate-like lineage that protects against sepsis. DL1 interacts with Notch2 weakly, but it is not known whether enhancement of DL1-induced Notch2 activation by Fringe glycosyltransferases is important for MZ B cell development. Furthermore, DL1-expressing cells that promote MZ B cell development have not been identified. We show that Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) and Manic Fringe (Mfng) cooperatively enhanced the DL1-Notch2 interaction to promote MZ B cell development. We also identified radio-resistant red pulp endothelial cells in the splenic MZ that express high amounts of DL1 and promoted MZ B generation. Finally, MZ B cell precursor competition for DL1 homeostatically regulated entry into the MZ B cell pool. Our study has revealed that the Fringe-Notch2 interaction has important functions in vivo and provides insights into mechanisms regulating MZ B cell development.","3122":"During evolutionary adaptation in the immune system, host defense is traded off against autoreactivity. Signals through the costimulatory receptor CD28 enable T cells to respond specifically to pathogens, whereas those through the related costimulatory receptor, ICOS, which arose by gene duplication, are critical for affinity maturation and memory antibody responses. ICOS ligand, unlike the pathogen-inducible CD28 ligands, is widely and constitutively expressed in the immune system. Here, we show that crosstalk between these two pathways provides a mechanism for obviating the normal T cell dependence on CD28. Several CD28-mediated responses-generation of follicular helper T cells, germinal center formation, T helper 1 cell-dependent extrafollicular antibody responses to Salmonella and bacterial clearance, and regulatory T cell homeostasis-became independent of CD28 and dependent on ICOS when the E3 ubiquitin ligase Roquin was mutated. Mechanisms to functionally compartmentalize ICOS and CD28 signals are thus critical for two-signal control of normal immune reactions.","3123":"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells promote immune responses to various pathogens, but exactly how iNKT cells control antiviral responses is unclear. Here, we showed that iNKT cells induced tissue-specific antiviral effects in mice infected by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Indeed, iNKT cells inhibited viral replication in the pancreas and liver but not in the spleen. In the pancreas, iNKT cells expressed the OX40 molecule and promoted type I interferon (IFN) production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) through OX40-OX40 ligand interaction. Subsequently, this iNKT cell-pDC cooperation attenuated the antiviral adaptive immune response in the pancreas but not in the spleen. The dampening of pancreatic anti-LCMV CD8(+) T cell response prevented tissue damage in transgenic mice expressing LCMV protein in islet beta cells. Thus, this study identifies pDCs as an essential partner of iNKT cells for mounting an efficient, nondeleterious antiviral response in peripheral tissue.","3124":"West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-transmitted single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) flavivirus, causes human disease of variable severity. We investigated Toll-like receptor 7-deficient (Tlr7(-\/-)) and myeloid differentiation factor 88-deficient (Myd88(-\/-)) mice, which both have defective recognition of ssRNA, and found increased viremia and susceptibility to lethal WNV infection. Despite increased tissue concentrations of most innate cytokines, CD45(+) leukocytes and CD11b(+) macrophages failed to home to WNV-infected cells and infiltrate into target organs of Tlr7(-\/-) mice. Tlr7(-\/-) mice and macrophages had reduced interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 responses after WNV infection, and mice deficient in IL-12 p40 and IL-23 p40 (Il12b(-\/-)) or IL-23 p19 (Il23a(-\/-)), but not IL-12 p35 (Il12a(-\/-)), responded similarly to Tlr7(-\/-) mice, with increased susceptibility to lethal WNV encephalitis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TLR7 and IL-23-dependent WNV responses represent a vital host defense mechanism that operates by affecting immune cell homing to infected target cells.","3125":"CD40L (CD154) on CD4(+) T cells has been shown to license dendritic cells (DCs) via CD40 to prime cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. We found that the converse (CD40L on DCs) was also important. Anti-CD40L treatment decreased endogenous CTL responses to both ovalbumin and influenza infection even in the absence of CD4(+) T cells. DCs expressed CD40L upon stimulation with agonists to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR9. Moreover, influenza infection, which stimulates CTLs without help, upregulated CD40L on DCs, but herpes simplex infection, which elicits CTLs through help, did not. CD40L-deficient (Cd40lg(-\/-)) DCs are suboptimal both in vivo in bone marrow chimera experiments and in vitro in mixed lymphocyte reactions. In contrast, Cd40lg(-\/-) CD8(+) T cells killed as effectively as wild-type cells. Thus, CD40L upregulation on DCs promoted optimal priming of CD8(+) T cells without CD4(+) T cells, providing a mechanism by which pathogens may elicit helper-independent CTL immunity.","3126":"Effector (Teff) and regulatory (Treg) T cells produce cytokines that balance immunity and immunopathology at sites of infection. It is not known how this balance is achieved. Here, we show that Treg and Teff cells specific for the same foreign peptide:major histocompatibility complex II (pMHCII) ligand accumulated preferentially in a subcutaneous site injected with the relevant antigen plus an adjuvant. Some of the Treg cells in this site were producing IL-10 12 days after injection, whereas a similar fraction of the Teff cells were producing IFN-gamma. Acute ablation of Treg cells increased the fraction of IFN-gamma-producing Teff cells, indicating that Teff function was limited by the Treg cells. Production of cytokines by both populations was driven by pMHCII presentation by local CD11b(hi) dermal dendritic cells. Therefore, balanced production of microbicidal and suppressive cytokines in inflamed skin is achieved by simultaneous dendritic cell antigen presentation to Teff and Treg cells.","3127":"Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling is essential for T regulatory (Treg) cell development and homeostasis. Here, we show that expression of IL-2Rbeta chains that lack tyrosine residues important for the association of the adaptor Shc and the transcription factor STAT5 in IL-2Rbeta-deficient mice resulted in production of a normal proportion of natural Treg cells that suppressed severe autoimmunity related with deficiency in IL-2 or IL-2R. These mutant IL-2Rbeta chains supported suboptimal and transient STAT5 activation that upregulate the transcription factor Foxp3 to normal amounts in natural, but not induced, Treg cells. Nevertheless, gene expression profiling revealed many targets in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2 dependent and a substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent targets is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2.","3128":"To track drainage of lymph-borne small and large antigens (Ags) into the peripheral lymph nodes and subsequent encounter by B cells and follicular dendritic cells, we used the approach of multiphoton intravital microscopy. We find a system of conduits that extend into the follicles and mediate delivery of small antigens to cognate B cells and follicular dendritic cells. The follicular conduits provide an efficient and rapid mechanism for delivery of small antigens and chemokines such as CXCL13 to B cells that directly contact the conduits. By contrast, large antigens were bound by subcapsular sinus macrophages and subsequently transferred to follicular B cells as previously reported. In summary, the findings identify a unique pathway for the channeling of small lymph-borne antigens and chemoattractants from the subcapsular sinus directly to the B cell follicles. This pathway could be used for enhancing delivery of vaccines or small molecules for improvement of humoral immunity.","3129":"During selection of the T cell repertoire, the immune system navigates the subtle distinction between self-restriction and self-tolerance, yet how this is achieved is unclear. Here we describe how self-tolerance toward a trans-HLA (human leukocyte antigen) allotype shapes T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) determinant (FLRGRAYGL). The recognition of HLA-B8-FLRGRAYGL by two archetypal TCRs was compared. One was a publicly selected TCR, LC13, that is alloreactive with HLA-B44; the other, CF34, lacks HLA-B44 reactivity because it arises when HLA-B44 is coinherited in trans with HLA-B8. Whereas the alloreactive LC13 TCR docked at the C terminus of HLA-B8-FLRGRAYGL, the CF34 TCR docked at the N terminus of HLA-B8-FLRGRAYGL, which coincided with a polymorphic region between HLA-B8 and HLA-B44. The markedly contrasting footprints of the LC13 and CF34 TCRs provided a portrait of how self-tolerance shapes the specificity of TCRs selected into the immune repertoire.","3130":"To understand lymphocyte behavior in the brain, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize effector CD8(+) T cells during toxoplasmic encephalitis. These cells displayed multiple behaviors with two distinct populations of cells apparent: one with a constrained pattern of migration and one with a highly migratory subset. The proportion of these populations varied over time associated with changes in antigen availability as well as T cell expression of the inhibitory receptor PD1. Unexpectedly, the movement of infiltrating cells was closely associated with an infection-induced reticular system of fibers. This observation suggests that, whereas in other tissues pre-existing scaffolds exist that guide lymphocyte migration, in the brain specialized structures are induced by inflammation that guide migration of T cells in this immune-privileged environment.","3131":"Multipotential naive CD4(+) T cells differentiate into distinct lineages including T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and inducible T regulatory (iTreg) cells. The remarkable diversity of CD4(+) T cells begs the question whether the observed changes reflect terminal differentiation with heritable epigenetic modifications or plasticity in T cell responses. We generated genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation maps in naive, Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, and natural Treg (nTreg) cells. We found that although modifications of signature-cytokine genes (Ifng, Il4, and Il17) partially conform to the expectation of lineage commitment, genes encoding transcription factors like Tbx21 exhibit a broad spectrum of epigenetic states, consistent with our demonstration of T-bet and interferon-gamma induction in nTreg cells. Our data suggest an epigenetic mechanism underlying the specificity and plasticity of effector and regulatory T cells and also provide a framework for understanding complexity of CD4(+) T helper cell differentiation.","3132":"The ability of macrophages to clear pathogens and elicit a sustained immune response is regulated by various cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which IFN-gamma modulates phagosome functions, we profiled the changes in composition, abundance, and phosphorylation of phagosome proteins in resting and activated macrophages by using quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. We identified 2415 phagosome proteins together with 2975 unique phosphorylation sites with a high level of sensitivity. Using network analyses, we determined that IFN-gamma delays phagosomal acquisition of lysosomal hydrolases and peptidases for the gain of antigen presentation. Furthermore, this gain in antigen presentation is dependent on phagosomal networks of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle-trafficking proteins, as well as Src kinases and calpain proteases. Major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-presentation assays validated the molecular participation of these networks in the enhanced capacity of IFN-gamma-activated macrophages to crosspresent exogenous antigens to CD8(+) T cells.","3133":"Mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) secreted by local plasma cells (PCs) is a critical component of mucosal immunity. Although IgA class switching can occur at mucosal sites, high-affinity PCs are optimally generated in germinal centers (GCs) in a T cell-dependent fashion. However, how CD4(+) helper T cells induce mucosal-homing IgA-PCs remains unclear. Here, we show that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and interleukin 21 (IL-21), produced by follicular helper T cells (Tfh), synergized to generate abundant IgA-plasmablasts (PBs). In the presence of IL-21, TGFbeta1 promoted naive B cell proliferation and differentiation and overrode IL-21-induced IgG class switching in favor of IgA. Furthermore, TGFbeta1 and IL-21 downregulated CXCR5 while upregulating CCR10 on plasmablasts, enabling their exit from GCs and migration toward local mucosa. This was supported by the presence of CCR10(+)IgA(+)PBs in tonsil GCs. These findings show that Tfh contribute to mucosal IgA. Thus, mucosal vaccines should aim to induce robust Tfh responses.","3134":"Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a cytokine produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells and plays important roles in the development of inflammatory diseases. Although IL-17F is highly homologous to IL-17A and binds the same receptor, the functional roles of this molecule remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated with Il17a(-\/-), Il17f(-\/-), and Il17a(-\/-)Il17f(-\/-) mice that IL-17F played only marginal roles, if at all, in the development of delayed-type and contact hypersensitivities, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, and arthritis in Il1rn(-\/-) mice. In contrast, both IL-17F and IL-17A were involved in host defense against mucoepithelial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter rodentium. IL-17A was produced mainly in T cells, whereas IL-17F was produced in T cells, innate immune cells, and epithelial cells. Although only IL-17A efficiently induced cytokines in macrophages, both cytokines activated epithelial innate immune responses. These observations indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F have overlapping yet distinct roles in host immune and defense mechanisms.","3135":"Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells limit pathogenic immune responses to self-antigens and foreign antigens. An essential role for microRNA (miRNA) in the maintenance and function of Treg cells, revealed by the Treg cell-specific Dicer ablation, raised a question as to a specific miRNA contribution. We found that Foxp3 controlled the elevated miR155 expression required for maintaining Treg cell proliferative activity and numbers under nonlymphopenic conditions. Moreover, miR155 deficiency in Treg cells resulted in increased suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) expression accompanied by impaired activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) transcription factor in response to limiting amounts of interleukin-2. Our studies suggest that Foxp3-dependent regulation of miR155 maintains competitive fitness of Treg cell subsets by targeting SOCS1, and they provide experimental support for a proposed role for miRNAs in ensuring the robustness of cellular phenotypes.","3136":"It is well established that sustained increases in cyclic AMP (cAMP) such as those triggered by forskolin inhibit T cell activation. We describe here an unexpected phenomenon: in T cells, a transient cAMP increase triggered by the interaction with a dendritic cell strongly potentiates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We discovered this effect by examining the molecular basis of the adhesion-dependent sensitization of T cells. T cell adhesion caused extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which was necessary for the sensitization process. T cell sensitization could be mimicked in suspended cells by the uncaging of caged cAMP upon ultraviolet illumination. Calcium responses occurring in T cells upon interaction with dendritic cells were strongly inhibited when protein kinase A activation was blocked. Thus, whereas sustained cAMP increases are well known to inhibit TCR signaling, transient cAMP increases occurring physiologically upon formation of an immunological synapse facilitate antigen detection.","3137":"The role of basophils, the rarest of blood granulocytes, in host immunity has been a mystery. Long considered the poor relative of mast cells, basophils have received much recent attention because of the availability of new reagents and models that reveal unique properties of these cells. Basophils are known to have distinct roles in allergic hypersensitivity reactions and in the immune response to intestinal helminthes. In this review, we highlight these advances and summarize our current understanding of the repertoire of functions attributed to these cells. Despite these recent insights, we are likely only beginning to gain a full understanding of how and where these cells lend effector functions to vertebrate immunity. Advances are likely to come only with the development of specific reagents that enable the finer study of basophil lineage and function. Although many fundamental aspects of basophil biology remain unanswered, the prospects remain bright for unmasking new contributions by these unusual cells.","3138":"In this issue of Immunity, Ishigame et al. (2009) show that interleukin-17A (IL-17A) mediates autoimmunity whereas both IL-17A and IL-17F are required for mucosal immunity. IL-17A may be more pathologic by inducing proinflammatory cytokines.","3139":"In this issue of Immunity,Lee et al. (2009) and Wei et al.

Antigen binding results in BCR microclustering and signaling; however, the molecular nature of the signaling-active BCR clusters is not well understood. Using single-molecule imaging techniques, we provide evidence that within microclusters, the binding of monovalent membrane antigens results in the assembly of immobile signaling-active BCR oligomers. The oligomerization depends on interactions between the membrane-proximal Cmicro4 domains of the membrane immunoglobulin that are both necessary and sufficient for assembly. Antigen-bound BCRs that lacked the Cmicro4 domain failed to cluster and signal, and conversely, Cmicro4 domains alone clustered spontaneously and activated B cells. These results support a unique mechanism for the initiation of BCR signaling in which antigen binding induces a conformational change in the Fc portion of the BCR, revealing an interface that promotes BCR clustering.","3144":"Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are important for the induction of protective T cell-dependent humoral responses, but their contribution to autoimmunity remains elusive. Here, gene-targeted interruption of FDC development was combined with the K\/BxN mouse model of arthritis. We found that FDCs were essential for autoantibody production through two distinct but cooperative functions. In a T cell-independent fashion, FDCs loaded with autoantigen-containing immune complexes supported germinal center (GC) B cell development. Additionally, the integrity of FDC networks was required for the recruitment of arthritogenic follicular helper T cells, a process that drove T-B cell interactions and productive GC reactivity. Importantly, pharmacological interference in the maintenance of FDCs ameliorated disease development, suggesting the FDC as a potential target for dampening autoimmunity.","3145":"Tapasin is a glycoprotein critical for loading major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules with high-affinity peptides. It functions within the multimeric peptide-loading complex (PLC) as a disulfide-linked, stable heterodimer with the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57, and this covalent interaction is required to support optimal PLC activity. Here, we present the 2.6 A resolution structure of the tapasin-ERp57 core of the PLC. The structure revealed that tapasin interacts with both ERp57 catalytic domains, accounting for the stability of the heterodimer, and provided an example of a protein disulfide isomerase family member interacting with substrate. Mutational analysis identified a conserved surface on tapasin that interacted with MHC class I molecules and was critical for peptide loading and editing functions of the tapasin-ERp57 heterodimer. By combining the tapasin-ERp57 structure with those of other defined PLC components, we present a molecular model that illuminates the processes involved in MHC class I peptide loading.","3146":"Development of T helper (Th) 17 cells requires transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-6 and is independent of the Th1 pathway. Although T cells that produce interferon (IFN)-gamma are a recognized feature of Th17 cell responses, mice deficient for STAT4 and T-bet-two prototypical Th1 transcription factors-are protected from autoimmunity associated with Th17 pathogenesis. To examine the fate and pathogenic potential of Th17 cells and origin of IFN-gamma-producing T cells that emerge during Th17 immunity, we developed IL-17F reporter mice that identify cells committed to expression of IL-17F and IL-17A. Th17 cells required TGF-beta for sustained expression of IL-17F and IL-17A. In the absence of TGF-beta, both IL-23 and IL-12 acted to suppress IL-17 and enhance IFN-gamma production in a STAT4- and T-bet-dependent manner, albeit with distinct efficiencies. These results support a model of late Th17 developmental plasticity with implications for autoimmunity and host defense.","3147":"Apoptotic death of hepatocytes, a contributor to many chronic and acute liver diseases, can be a consequence of overactivation of the immune system and is often mediated by TNFalpha. Injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus the transcriptional inhibitor D(+)-galactosamine (GalN) or mitogenic T cell activation causes fatal hepatocyte apoptosis in mice, which is mediated by TNFalpha, but the effector mechanisms remain unclear. Our analysis of gene-targeted mice showed that caspase-8 is essential for hepatocyte killing in both settings. Loss of Bid, the proapoptotic BH3-only protein activated by caspase-8 and essential for Fas ligand-induced hepatocyte killing, resulted only in a minor reduction of liver damage. However, combined loss of Bid and another BH3-only protein, Bim, activated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protected mice from LPS+GalN-induced hepatitis. These observations identify caspase-8 and the BH3-only proteins Bid and Bim as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of inflammatory liver diseases.","3148":"Notch1 signaling is required for T cell development and has been implicated in fate decisions in the thymus. We showed that Notch1 deletion in progenitor T cells (pro-T cells) revealed their latent developmental potential toward becoming conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In addition, Notch1 deletion in pro-T cells resulted in large numbers of thymic B cells, previously explained by T-to-B cell fate conversion. Single-cell genotyping showed, however, that the majority of these thymic B cells arose from Notch1-sufficient cells by a cell-extrinsic pathway. Fate switching nevertheless exists for a subset of thymic B cells originating from Notch1-deleted pro-T cells. Chimeric mice lacking the Notch ligand delta-like 4 (Dll4) in thymus epithelium revealed an essential role for Dll4 in T cell development. Thus, Notch1-Dll4 signaling fortifies T cell commitment by suppressing non-T cell lineage potential in pro-T cells, and normal Notch1-driven T cell development repels excessive B cells in the thymus.","3149":"Prior to invading the nervous system, prions frequently colonize lymphoid organs and sites of inflammatory lymphoneogenesis, where they colocalize with Mfge8+ follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Here, we report that soft-tissue granulomas, a frequent feature of chronic inflammation, expressed the cellular prion protein (PrPC, encoded by Prnp) and the lymphotoxin receptor (LTbetaR), even though they lacked FDCs and did not display lymphoneogenesis. After intraperitoneal prion inoculation, granulomas of Prnp(+\/+) mice, but not Prnp(-\/-) granulomas or unaffected Prnp(+\/+) skin, accumulated prion infectivity and disease-associated prion protein. Bone-marrow transfers between Prnp(+\/+) and Prnp(-\/-) mice and administration of lymphotoxin signaling antagonists indicated that prion replication required radioresistant PrPC-expressing cells and LTbetaR signaling. Granulomatous PrPC was mainly expressed by stromal LTbetaR+ mesenchymal cells that were absent from unaffected subcutis. Hence, granulomas can act as clinically silent reservoirs of prion infectivity. Furthermore, lymphotoxin-dependent prion replication can occur in inflammatory stromal cells that are distinct from FDCs.","3150":"Although T lymphocytes are constitutively nonadherent cells, they undergo facultative polarity during migration and upon interaction with cells presenting cognate antigen, suggesting that cell polarity might be critical for target cell destruction. Using two-photon imaging of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, we found that CD44, a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins and glycosaminoglycans, was crucial for interstitial T cell navigation and, consequently, efficient tumor cell screening. CD44 functioned as a critical regulator of intratumoral movement by stabilizing cell polarity in migrating T cells, but not during target cell interactions. Stable anterior-posterior asymmetry was maintained by CD44 independently of its extracellular domain. Instead, migratory polarity depended on the recruitment of ezrin, radixin, moesin (ERM) proteins by the intracellular domain of CD44 to the posterior cellular protrusion. Our results formally demonstrate that CD44-dependent T lymphocyte locomotion within target sites represents an essential immunologic checkpoint that determines the potency of T cell effector functions.","3151":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease thought to be mediated by dysfunctional innate and\/or adaptive immunity. This aberrant immune response leads to the secretion of harmful cytokines that destroy the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and thus cause further inflammation. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a T helper 17 (Th17) T cell-associated cytokine that is bifunctional in that it has both proinflammatory and protective effects on tissues depending on the inflammatory context. We show herein that IL-22 protected mice from IBD. Interestingly, not only was this protection mediated by CD4+ T cells, but IL-22-expressing natural killer (NK) cells also conferred protection. In addition, IL-22 expression was differentially regulated between NK cell subsets. Thus, both the innate and adaptive immune responses have developed protective mechanisms to counteract the damaging effects of inflammation on tissues.","3152":"Differentiation of memory cells involves DNA-sequence changes in B lymphocytes but is less clearly defined in T cells. RNA rearrangement is identified here as a key event in memory T cell differentiation by analysis of a mouse mutation that altered the proportions of naive and memory T cells and crippled the process of Ptprc exon silencing needed to generate CD45RO in memory T cells. A single substitution in a memory-induced RNA-binding protein, hnRNPLL, destabilized an RNA-recognition domain that bound with micromolar affinity to RNA containing the Ptprc exon-silencing sequence. Hnrpll mutation selectively diminished T cell accumulation in peripheral lymphoid tissues but not proliferation. Exon-array analysis of Hnrpll mutant naive and memory T cells revealed an extensive program of alternative mRNA splicing in memory T cells, coordinated by hnRNPLL. A remarkable overlap with alternative splicing in neural tissues may reflect a co-opted strategy for diversifying memory T cells.","3153":"The peripheral mature T cell pool is regulated by complex homeostatic mechanisms. Naive T cells are maintained by interleukin-7 (IL-7) and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling from contact with major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which sustain expression of antiapoptotic molecules and allow the cells to survive in interphase. Competition for these ligands declines when T cell numbers are reduced and causes residual naive T cells to proliferate and differentiate into memory-like cells. This memory cell population is thus heterogeneous and comprised of cells derived from responses to both foreign and self-antigens. Typical memory cells are kept alive and induced to divide intermittently by a mixture of IL-7 and IL-15. This review highlights recent advances in how naive and memory T cell homeostasis is regulated.","3154":"Rare HIV-1-infected individuals are able to control viral replication without antiretroviral therapy. In this issue of Immunity, Migueles et al. (2008) show that HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells from these individuals effectively suppress viral replication by granzyme B-mediated killing of target cells.","3155":"In this issue of Immunity, Mrass et al. (2008) report that CD44 critically contributes to the stabilization of polarity in migrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes by anchoring cytoskeletal proteins to the cell membrane at their uropods.","3156":"The transcription factor IRF-4 is necessary for Th17 cell differentiation. In this issue of Immunity, Chen et al. (2008) show that IRF-4-binding protein is a critical negative regulator of IRF-4 function, regulating production of the cytokines IL-21 and IL-17.","3157":"Mechanisms underlying the regulated splicing of CD45 RNA have been long-standing puzzles. In this issue of Immunity, Wu et al. (2008) identify hnRNPLL as a critical regulator of both signal-induced exon skipping in CD45 and global alternative-transcript expression in memory T cells.","3158":"Inbred mice have been an extremely successful tool for basic immunology, but much less so as models of disease. Thus, to maximize the use of immunologic approaches to improve human health, we need more strategically directed efforts in human immunology. This would also open up new opportunities for basic research.","3159":"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with spontaneous antitumor activity, and they produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) that primes immune responses. Whereas T helper cell subsets differentiate from naive T cells via specific transcription factors, evidence for NK cell diversification is limited. In this report, we characterized intestinal lymphocytes expressing the NK cell natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. Gut NKp46+ cells were distinguished from classical NK cells by limited IFN-gamma production and absence of perforin, whereas several subsets expressed the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor t (RORgammat) and interleukin-22 (IL-22). Intestinal NKp46+IL-22+ cells were generated via a local process that was conditioned by commensal bacteria and required RORgammat. Mice lacking IL-22-producing NKp46+ cells showed heightened susceptibility to the pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, consistent with a role for intestinal NKp46+ cells in immune protection. RORgammat-driven diversification of intestinal NKp46+ cells thereby specifies an innate cellular defense mechanism that operates at mucosal surfaces.","3160":"The majority of early immature B cells express autoreactive B cell receptors (BCRs) that are, according to the current view, negatively selected to avoid the production of self-reactive antibodies. Here, we show that polyreactive BCRs, which recognize multiple self-antigens, induced autonomous signaling and selective expansion of B cell precursors in a manner comparable to the pre-BCR. We found that the pre-BCR was capable of recognizing multiple self-antigens and that a signaling-deficient pre-BCR lacking the non-Ig region of the surrogate-light-chain component lambda5 was rescued by the complementarity-determining region 3 derived from heavy chains of polyreactive receptors. Importantly, bone marrow B cells from mice carrying Ig transgenes for an autoreactive BCR showed increased cell-cycle activity, which could not be detected in cells lacking the transgenic BCR. Together, the pre-BCR has evolved to ensure self-recognition because autoreactivity is required for positive selection of B cell precursors.","3161":"How CD4-CD8 differentiation is maintained in mature T cells is largely unknown. The present study has examined the role in this process of the zinc finger protein Zbtb7b, a critical factor for the commitment of MHC II-restricted thymocytes to the CD4+ lineage. We showed that Zbtb7b acted in peripheral CD4+ T cells to suppress CD8-lineage gene expression, including that of CD8 and cytotoxic effector genes perforin and Granzyme B, and was important for the proper repression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) during effector differentiation. The inappropriate expression of IFN-gamma by Zbtb7b-deficient CD4+ T cells required the activities of Eomesodermin and Runx transcription factors. Runx activity was needed for Granzyme B expression, indicating that Runx proteins control expression of the cytotoxic program. We conclude that a key function of Zbtb7b in the mature CD4+ T cell compartment is to repress CD8-lineage gene expression.","3162":"Dendritic cells are critically involved in the promotion and regulation of T cell responses. Here, we report a mouse strain that lacks conventional CD11c(hi) dendritic cells (cDCs) because of constitutive cell-type specific expression of a suicide gene. As expected, cDC-less mice failed to mount effective T cell responses resulting in impaired viral clearance. In contrast, neither thymic negative selection nor T regulatory cell generation or T cell homeostasis were markedly affected. Unexpectedly, cDC-less mice developed a progressive myeloproliferative disorder characterized by prominent extramedullary hematopoiesis and increased serum amounts of the cytokine Flt3 ligand. Our data identify a critical role of cDCs in the control of steady-state hematopoiesis, revealing a feedback loop that links peripheral cDCs to myelogenesis through soluble growth factors, such as Flt3 ligand.","3163":"Steady-state dendritic cells (DCs) maintain peripheral T cell tolerance, whereas mature DCs generate immunity. CD70 is a costimulatory ligand acquired upon DC maturation. To determine its impact on T cell fate, we have generated mice that constitutively express CD70 in conventional DCs (cDCs). In these mice, naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells spontaneously convert into effector cells. Administration of peptide without adjuvant, which is ordinarily tolerogenic, elicited tumor-eradicating CD8+ T cell responses and robust CD4+ T cell-independent memory. CD70 was also constitutively expressed in cDCs that inducibly present viral epitopes. In this case, tolerance induction was prevented as well. The antigen-presenting DCs generated protective immunity to virus infection and broke a pre-existing state of CD8+ T cell tolerance. Thus, the sole expression of CD70 by otherwise immature cDCs sufficed to convert CD8+ T cell tolerance into immunity, defining the importance of CD27-CD70 interactions at the interface between T cell and DC.","3164":"Virus-specific CD8+ T cells probably mediate control over HIV replication in rare individuals, termed long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) or elite controllers. Despite extensive investigation, the mechanisms responsible for this control remain incompletely understood. We observed that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs persisted at higher frequencies than those of treated progressors with equally low amounts of HIV. Measured on a per-cell basis, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells of LTNPs efficiently eliminated primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. This function required lytic granule loading of effectors and delivery of granzyme B to target cells. Defective cytotoxicity of progressor effectors could be restored after treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. These results establish an effector function and mechanism that clearly segregate with immunologic control of HIV. They also demonstrate that lytic granule contents of memory cells are a critical determinant of cytotoxicity that must be induced for maximal per-cell killing capacity.","3165":"The T helper 17 (Th17) cell lineage is important in inflammatory and autoimmune responses, via its ability to produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-21. Given the potentially deleterious effects of Th17 cells, their generation needs to be strictly controlled. IRF-4 is a transcription factor that has recently emerged as a key regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. Here, we showed that mice deficient in a previously isolated protein, IBP (IRF-4-binding protein), rapidly developed rheumatoid arthritis-like joint disease and large-vessel vasculitis. The pathology was associated with an enhanced responsiveness of T cells to low levels of stimulation and with the inappropriate synthesis of IL-17 and IL-21. IBP sequestered IRF-4 and prevented it from targeting the transcriptional regulatory regions of the genes that encode IL-17 and IL-21. Thus, IBP appears to be important in preventing T cell-mediated autoimmunity by ensuring that the production of IL-17 and IL-21 does not occur in response to self-antigens.","3166":"Precise intrathymic cell migration is important for thymocyte maturation and organ architecture. The orchestration of thymocyte trafficking, however, is not well understood at a molecular level. Here, we described highly regulated plexinD1 expression on CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. PlexinD1 expression was further affected by the engagement of T cell receptor complex. Activation of plexinD1 via the ligand, semaphorin 3E, repressed CCL25 chemokine signaling via its receptor CCR9 in CD69+ thymocytes. In the absence of plexinD1, CD69+ thymocytes remained in the cortex, maturing to form ectopic single positive (SP) thymocyte clusters in Plxnd1-deficient fetal liver cell-transplanted mice. As a consequence, the boundary between DP and SP thymocytes at corticomedullary junctions was disrupted and medullary structures formed under the thymic capsule. These results demonstrate the importance of plexinD1 in directing migration of maturing thymocytes via modulation of biological responses to chemokine gradients.","3167":"Mice with mutations in the gene encoding Fas ligand (FasL) develop lymphoproliferation and systemic autoimmune diseases. However, the cellular subset responsible for the prevention of autoimmunity in FasL-deficient mice remains undetermined. Here, we show that mice with FasL loss on either B or T cells had identical life span as littermates, and both genotypes developed signs of autoimmunity. In addition, we show that T cell-dependent death was vital for the elimination of aberrant T cells and for controlling the numbers of B cells and dendritic cells that dampen autoimmune responses. Furthermore, we show that the loss of FasL on T cells affected the follicular dentritic cell network in the germinal centers, leading to an impaired recall response to exogenous antigen. These results disclose the distinct roles of cellular subsets in FasL-dependent control of autoimmunity and provide further insight into the role of FasL in humoral immunity.","3168":"An early granulomatous response, characterized by collections of white blood cells at foci surrounding pathogens, occurs after infection by many intracellular organisms, including Listeria, but how these clusters become organized and for what purpose remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that dendritic cell (DC) activation by Listeria nucleated rapid clustering of innate cells, including granulocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes, to sites of bacteria propagation where interleukin-12 was expressed in the spleen. Clustered NK cells expressed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which was necessary for the activation and maturation of colocalized monocytes to tumor necrosis factor- and inducible nitric oxide synthase-producing DCs (TipDCs). NK cell clustering was necessary for IFN-gamma production and required pertussis-toxin-sensitive recruitment, in part mediated by the chemokine receptor CCR5, and MyD88 adaptor-mediated signaling. Thus, spatial organization of the immune response by DCs between 6 and 24 hr ensures functional activation of innate cells, which restricts pathogens before adaptive immunity is fully activated.","3169":"Chronic viral infections of the hematopoietic system are associated with bone marrow dysfunction, to which both virus-mediated and immune-mediated effects may contribute. Using unresolving noncytopathic Friend virus (FV) infection in mice, we showed that unregulated CD4(+) T cell response to FV caused IFN-gamma-mediated bone marrow pathology and anemia. Importantly, bone marrow pathology was triggered by relative insufficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells and was prevented by added Treg cells, which suppressed the local IFN-gamma production by FV-specific CD4(+) T cells. We further showed that the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of transgenic Treg cells expressing the beta chain of an FV-specific TCR was virtually devoid of FV-specific clones. Moreover, anemia induction by virus-specific CD4(+) T cells was efficiently suppressed by virus-nonspecific Treg cells. Thus, sufficient numbers of polyclonal Treg cells may provide substantial protection against bone marrow pathology in chronic viral infections.","3170":"CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells originate primarily from thymic differentiation, but conversion of mature T lymphocytes to Foxp3 positivity can be elicited by several means, including in vitro activation in the presence of TGF-beta. Retinoic acid (RA) increases TGF-beta-induced expression of Foxp3, through unknown molecular mechanisms. We showed here that, rather than enhancing TGF-beta signaling directly in naive CD4(+) T cells, RA negatively regulated an accompanying population of CD4(+) T cells with a CD44(hi) memory and effector phenotype. These memory cells actively inhibited the TGF-beta-induced conversion of naive CD4(+) T cells through the synthesis of a set of cytokines (IL-4, IL-21, IFN-gamma) whose expression was coordinately curtailed by RA. This indirect effect was evident in vivo and required the expression of the RA receptor alpha. Thus, cytokine-producing CD44(hi) cells actively restrain TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 expression in naive T cells, and this balance can be shifted or fine-tuned by RA.","3171":"Most autoreactive B cells are normally counterselected during early B cell development. To determine whether Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate the removal of autoreactive B lymphocytes, we tested the reactivity of recombinant antibodies from single B cells isolated from patients deficient for interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and UNC-93B. Indeed, all TLRs except TLR3 require IRAK-4 and MyD88 to signal, and UNC-93B-deficient cells are unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9. All patients suffered from defective central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints, resulting in the accumulation of large numbers of autoreactive mature naive B cells in their blood. Hence, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may prevent the recruitment of developing autoreactive B cells in healthy donors. Paradoxically, IRAK-4-, MyD88-, and UNC-93B-deficient patients did not display autoreactive antibodies in their serum or develop autoimmune diseases, suggesting that IRAK-4, MyD88, and UNC-93B pathway blockade may thwart autoimmunity in humans.","3172":"Paired receptors are families of membrane proteins containing similar extracellular regions but differing in their potential for signaling with one type able to give inhibitory signals and the other activating. Inhibitory receptors could be good targets for pathogens to restrict immune responses against them. Here we suggest that activating members may have evolved to counterbalance pathogens utilizing the inhibitory pathway. Thus, if a pathogen utilizes any part of the inhibitory receptor to downregulate responses against itself, it may, because of similarities in structure, also bind the activating receptor and give an opposing signal. We evaluate recent structural data on SIRPalpha (signal regulatory protein) and LILRB1 (leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 1) showing evidence of pathogen pressure in nonligand-binding regions of these receptors together with data on pathogen binding to PIRs (paired Ig-like receptors) to provide support for this theory.","3173":"The mechanisms underlying innate immune cell trafficking and activation during infection remain incompletely defined. In this issue of Immunity, Kang et al. (2008) begin to reveal the cytokine and chemokine cascades that coordinate cellular responses induced by microbial pathogens.","3174":"Uric acid (UA) crystals are a potent stimulator of inflammation, but how they activate immune cells is not known. In this issue of Immunity, Ng et al. (2008) provide evidence suggesting that UA activates the Syk kinase via membrane cholesterol.","3175":"Self-reactive B cells are eliminated during development by antibody-affinity selection and receptor-editing mechanisms. Work by Isnardi et al. (2008) in this issue of Immunity suggests that removal of autoreactivity from the immature B cell pool also requires innate immunity pathways.","3176":"In this issue of Immunity, Metkar et al. (2008) present evidence that granzyme A plays a role in inflammatory signaling and that contrary to previous studies, it is incapable of inducing target cell death. The work challenges us to reconsider the broader biological roles of all the granzymes.","3177":"Two cell response pathways, Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Notch, conserved from Drosophila to mammals are well characterized for distinct roles in innate immunity and cell development, respectively. In this issue of Immunity, Hu et al. (2008) describe and characterize the direct cooperation of these two pathways.","3178":"Transcriptional regulatory networks direct the development of specialized cell types. The transcription factors signal tranducer and activator of transcription 4 (Stat4) and T-bet are required for the interleukin-12 (IL-12)-stimulated development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, although the hierarchy of activity by these factors has not been clearly defined. In this report, we show that these factors did not function in a linear pathway and that each factor played a unique role in programming chromatin architecture for Th1 gene expression, with subsets of genes depending on Stat4, T-bet, or both for expression in Th1 cells. T-bet was not able to transactivate expression of Stat4-dependent genes in the absence of endogenous Stat4 expression. Thus, T-bet requires Stat4 to achieve complete IL-12-dependent Th1 cell-fate determination. These data provide a basis for understanding how transiently activated and lineage-specific transcription factors cooperate in promoting cellular differentiation.","3179":"Immature double-positive (CD4(+)CD8(+)) thymocytes respond to negatively selecting peptide-MHC ligands by forming an immune synapse that sustains contact with the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Using fluorescently labeled peptides, we showed that as few as two agonist ligands could promote APC contact and subsequent apoptosis in reactive thymocytes. Furthermore, we showed that productive signaling for positive selection, as gauged by nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled NFATc construct, did not involve formation of a synapse between thymocytes and selecting epithelial cells in reaggregate thymus cultures. Antibody blockade of endogenous positively selecting ligands prevented NFAT nuclear accumulation in such cultures and reversed NFAT accumulation in previously stimulated thymocytes. Together, these data suggest a \"gauntlet\" model in which thymocytes mature by continually acquiring and reacquiring positively selecting signals without sustained contact with epithelial cells, thereby allowing them to sample many cell surfaces for potentially negatively selecting ligands.","3180":"T regulatory (Treg) cells play a role in the suppression of immune responses, thus serving to induce tolerance and control autoimmunity. Here, we explored whether Treg cells influence the immediate hypersensitivity response of mast cells (MCs). Treg cells directly inhibited the FcvarepsilonRI-dependent MC degranulation through cell-cell contact involving OX40-OX40L interactions between Treg cells and MCs, respectively. When activated in the presence of Treg cells, MCs showed increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations and reduced Ca(2+) influx, independently of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma2 or Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Antagonism of cAMP in MCs reversed the inhibitory effects of Treg cells, restoring normal Ca(2+) responses and degranulation. Importantly, the in vivo depletion or inactivation of Treg cells caused enhancement of the anaphylactic response. The demonstrated crosstalk between Treg cells and MCs defines a previously unrecognized mechanism controlling MC degranulation. Loss of this interaction may contribute to the severity of allergic responses.","3181":"Binding of particulate antigens by antigen-presenting cells is a critical step in immune activation. Previously, we demonstrated that uric acid crystals are potent adjuvants, initiating a robust adaptive immune response. However, the mechanisms of activation are unknown. By using atomic force microscopy as a tool for real-time single-cell activation analysis, we report that uric acid crystals could directly engage cellular membranes, particularly the cholesterol components, with a force substantially stronger than protein-based cellular contacts. Binding of particulate substances activated Syk kinase-dependent signaling in dendritic cells. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby immune cell activation can be triggered by solid structures via membrane lipid alteration without the requirement for specific cell-surface receptors, and a testable hypothesis for crystal-associated arthropathies, inflammation, and adjuvanticity.","3182":"Toll-like receptor (TLR) responses are regulated to avoid toxicity and achieve coordinated responses appropriate for the cell environment. We found that Notch and TLR pathways cooperated to activate canonical Notch target genes, including transcriptional repressors Hes1 and Hey1, and to increase production of canonical TLR-induced cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-12. Cooperation by these pathways to increase target gene expression was mediated by the Notch-pathway component and transcription factor RBP-J, which also contributed to lethality after endotoxin injection. TLR- and Notch-induced Hes1 and Hey1 attenuated IL-6 and IL-12 production. This Hes1- and Hey1-mediated feedback inhibitory loop was abrogated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which blocked TLR-induced activation of canonical Notch target genes by inhibiting Notch2 signaling and downstream transcription. These findings identify new immune functions for RBP-J, Hes, and Hey proteins and provide insights into mechanisms by which Notch, TLR, and IFN-gamma signals are integrated to modulate specific effector functions in macrophages.","3183":"SWAP-70-like adaptor of T cells (SLAT) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases that regulates the development of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell inflammatory responses by controlling the Ca(2+)-NFAT signaling pathway. However, the mechanism used by SLAT to regulate these events is unknown. Here, we report that the T cell receptor (TCR)-induced translocation of SLAT to the immunological synapse required Lck-mediated phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues located in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-like sequence but was independent of the SLAT PH domain. This subcellular relocalization was coupled to, and necessary for, activation of the NFAT pathway. Furthermore, membrane targeting of the SLAT Dbl-homology (catalytic) domain was sufficient to trigger TCR-mediated NFAT activation and Th1 and Th2 differentiation in a Cdc42-dependent manner. Therefore, tyrosine-phosphorylation-mediated relocalization of SLAT to the site of antigen recognition is required for SLAT to exert its pivotal role in NFAT-dependent CD4(+) T cell differentiation.","3184":"During persistent murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection, the T cell response is maintained at extremely high intensity for the life of the host. These cells closely resemble human CMV-specific cells, which compose a major component of the peripheral T cell compartment in most people. Despite a phenotype that suggests extensive antigen-driven differentiation, MCMV-specific T cells remain functional and respond vigorously to viral challenge. We hypothesized that a low rate of antigen-driven proliferation would account for the maintenance of this population. Instead, we found that most of these cells divided only sporadically in chronically infected hosts and had a short half-life in circulation. The overall population was supported, at least in part, by memory T cells primed early in infection, as well as by recruitment of naive T cells at late times. Thus, these data show that memory inflation is maintained by a continuous replacement of short-lived, functional cells during chronic MCMV infection.","3185":"The physiologic control of cytokine receptor activation is primarily mediated by reciprocal activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, we show that immediately after ligand-dependent activation, interleukin (IL)-4 receptor generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX)1 and NOX5L. ROS, in turn, promoted IL-4 receptor activation by oxidatively inactivating PTP1B that physically associated with and deactivated IL-4 receptor. However, ROS were not required for the initiation of IL-4 receptor activation. ROS generated by other cytokine receptors, including those for erythropoietin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or IL-3, also promoted IL-4 signaling. These data indicate that inactivation of receptor-associated PTP activity by cytokine-generated ROS is a physiologic mechanism for the amplification of cytokine receptor activation in both cis and trans, revealing a role for ROS in cytokine crosstalk.","3186":"Inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity leads to a reduction in numbers of CD8(+) single-positive (SP) thymocytes, suggesting a selective role for NF-kappaB in these cells. To further explore the role of NF-kappaB in SP thymocytes, we utilized transgenic models that allowed either inhibition or activation of NF-kappaB. We showed that activation of NF-kappaB played an important role in the selection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, NF-kappaB was not activated in positively selected CD4(+) thymocytes, and inhibition of NF-kappaB did not perturb positive or negative selection of CD4(+) cells. However, enforced activation of NF-kappaB via a constitutively active inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) kinase transgene led to a nearly complete deletion of CD4 cells by pushing positively selecting CD4(+) cells into negative selection. These studies therefore revealed a surprising difference of NF-kappaB activation in CD4(+) and CD8(+) thymocytes and suggested that NF-kappaB contributes to the establishment of thresholds of signaling that determine positive or negative selection of thymocytes.","3187":"The CD8(+) T cell responses to CMV gradually increase in magnitude over time-so-called memory \"inflation.\" In this issue of Immunity, Snyder et al. (2008) examine the dynamics of memory inflation and demonstrate continuous turnover of inflating T cells, drawing on both memory cells and naive cells to replace them.","3188":"In this issue of Immunity, Hall et al. (2008) demonstrate that commensal bacterial DNA can suppress Treg cell conversion via TLR9-mediated activation of lamina propria dendritic cells and thus potentially disrupt intestinal homeostasis.","3189":"Natural killer cell inhibitory receptors block effector responses by recruiting phosphatases that dephosphorylate molecules involved in activation. However, in this issue of Immunity, Peterson and Long show that inhibitory receptors also signal tyrosine phosphorylation, an event usually indicating cellular activation.","3190":"Two recent papers, one in this issue of Immunity (Zhong et al., 2008), report the identification of a membrane protein, termed MITA or STING, that activates the transcription factor IRF3 to induce type-I interferons to mitigate viral infection.","3191":"","3192":"Granzyme A (GzmA) is considered a major proapoptotic protease. We have discovered that GzmA-induced cell death involves rapid membrane damage that depends on the synergy between micromolar concentrations of GzmA and sublytic perforin (PFN). Ironically, GzmA and GzmB, independent of their catalytic activity, both mediated this swift necrosis. Even without PFN, lower concentrations of human GzmA stimulated monocytic cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta [IL-1beta], TNFalpha, and IL-6) that were blocked by a caspase-1 inhibitor. Moreover, murine GzmA and GzmA(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) induce IL-1beta from primary mouse macrophages, and GzmA(-\/-) mice resist lipopolysaccharide-induced toxicity. Thus, the granule secretory pathway plays an unexpected role in inflammation, with GzmA acting as an endogenous modulator.","3193":"To initiate an adaptive immune response, rare antigen-specific naive CD4(+) T cells must interact with equally rare dendritic cells (DCs) bearing cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes. Lymph nodes (LNs) draining the site of antigen entry are populated by lymphoid-resident DCs as well as DCs that have immigrated from tissues, although the requirement for each population in initiating the T cell response remains unclear. Here, we show that antigen processing and presentation by both lymphoid-resident and migratory DCs was required for clonal selection and expansion of CD4(+) T cells after subcutaneous immunization. Early antigen presentation by lymphoid-resident DCs initiated activation and trapping of antigen-specific T cells in the draining LN, without sufficing for clonal expansion. Migratory DCs, however, interacted with the CD4(+) T cells retained in the LN to induce proliferation. Therefore, distinct DC subsets cooperate to alert and trap the appropriate cell and then license its expansion and differentiation.","3194":"Dysregulated cytokine expression and signaling are major contributors to a number of autoimmune diseases. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-6 are important in many disorders characterized by immune self-recognition, and IL-6 is known to induce the differentiation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Here we described an IL-17A-triggered positive-feedback loop of IL-6 signaling, which involved the activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in fibroblasts. Importantly, enhancement of this loop caused by disruption of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)-dependent negative regulation of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130 contributed to the development of arthritis. Because this mechanism also enhanced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in wild-type mice, it may be a general etiologic process underlying other Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.","3195":"The innate inflammatory immune response must be tightly controlled to avoid damage to the host. Here, we showed that the tuberous sclerosis complex-mammalian target of rapamycin (TSC-mTOR) pathway regulated inflammatory responses after bacterial stimulation in monocytes, macrophages, and primary dendritic cells. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin promoted production of proinflammatory cytokines via the transcription factor NF-kappaB but blocked the release of interleukin-10 via the transcription factor STAT3. Conversely, deletion of TSC2, the key negative regulator of mTOR, diminished NF-kappaB but enhanced STAT3 activity and reversed this proinflammatory cytokine shift. Rapamycin-hyperactivated monocytes displayed a strong T helper 1 (Th1) cell- and Th17 cell-polarizing potency. Inhibition of mTOR in vivo regulated the inflammatory response and protected genetically susceptible mice against lethal Listeria monocytogenes infection. These data identify the TSC2-mTOR pathway as a key regulator of innate immune homeostasis with broad clinical implications for infectious and autoimmune diseases, vaccination, cancer, and transplantation.","3196":"T cell activation is mediated by microclusters (MCs) containing T cell receptors (TCRs), kinases, and adaptors. Although TCR MCs translocate to form a central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) of the immunological synapse at the interface of a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell, the role of MC translocation in T cell signaling remains unclear. Here, we found that the accumulation of MCs at cSMAC was important for T cell costimulation. Costimulatory receptor CD28 was initially recruited coordinately with TCR to MCs, and its signals were mediated through the assembly with the kinase PKCtheta. The accumulation of MCs at the cSMAC was accompanied by the segregation of CD28 from the TCR, which resulted in the translocation of both CD28 and PKCtheta to a spatially unique subregion of cSMAC. Thus, costimulation is mediated by the generation of a unique costimulatory compartment in the cSMAC via the dynamic regulation of MC translocation.","3197":"Effector memory T (Tem) cells are essential mediators of autoimmune disease and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a convenient model for two-photon imaging of Tem cell participation in an inflammatory response. Shortly (3 hr) after entry into antigen-primed ear tissue, Tem cells stably attached to antigen-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs). After 24 hr, enlarged Tem cells were highly motile along collagen fibers and continued to migrate rapidly for 18 hr. Tem cells rely on voltage-gated Kv1.3 potassium channels to regulate calcium signaling. ShK-186, a specific Kv1.3 blocker, inhibited DTH and suppressed Tem cell enlargement and motility in inflamed tissue but had no effect on homing to or motility in lymph nodes of naive and central memory T (Tcm) cells. ShK-186 effectively treated disease in a rat model of multiple sclerosis. These results demonstrate a requirement for Kv1.3 channels in Tem cells during an inflammatory immune response in peripheral tissues. Targeting Kv1.3 allows for effector memory responses to be suppressed while central memory responses remain intact.","3198":"The intestinal tract is in intimate contact with the commensal microflora. Nevertheless, how commensals communicate with cells to ensure immune homeostasis is still unclear. In this study, we found that gut flora DNA (gfDNA) plays a major role in intestinal homeostasis through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. Tlr9(-\/-) mice displayed increased frequencies of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells within intestinal effector sites and reduced constitutive IL-17- and IFN-gamma-producing effector T (Teff) cells. Complementing this, gfDNA limited lamina propria dendritic cell-induced Treg cell conversion in vitro. Further, Treg\/Teff cell disequilibrium in Tlr9(-\/-) mice led to impaired immune responses to oral infection and to oral vaccination. Impaired intestinal immune responses were recapitulated in mice treated with antibiotics and were reversible after reconstitution with gfDNA. Together, these data point to gfDNA as a natural adjuvant for priming intestinal responses via modulation of Treg\/Teff cell equilibrium.","3199":"Fas is highly expressed in activated and germinal center (GC) B cells but can potentially be inactivated by misguided somatic hypermutation. We employed conditional Fas-deficient mice to investigate the physiological functions of Fas in various B cell subsets. B cell-specific Fas-deficient mice developed fatal lymphoproliferation due to activation of B cells and T cells. Ablation of Fas specifically in GC B cells reproduced the phenotype, indicating that the lymphoproliferation initiates in the GC environment. B cell-specific Fas-deficient mice also showed an accumulation of IgG1(+) memory B cells expressing high amounts of CD80 and the expansion of CD28-expressing CD4(+) Th cells. Blocking T cell-B cell interaction and GC formation completely prevented the fatal lymphoproliferation. Thus, Fas-mediated selection of GC B cells and the resulting memory B cell compartment is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of both T and B lymphocytes.","3200":"Many cellular responses, such as autoimmunity and cytotoxicity, are controlled by receptors with cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs). Here, we showed that binding of inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptors to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I on target cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor Crk, concomitant with dephosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor Vav1. Furthermore, Crk dissociated from the guanine exchange factor C3G and bound to the tyrosine kinase c-Abl during inhibition. Membrane targeting of a tyrosine-mutated form of Crk could overcome inhibition of NK cell cytotoxicity, providing functional evidence that Crk phosphorylation contributes to inhibition. The specific phosphorylation of Crk and its dissociation from a signaling complex, observed here with two types of inhibitory receptors, expands the signaling potential of the large ITIM-receptor family and reveals an unsuspected component of the inhibitory mechanism.","3201":"Viral infection triggers activation of transcription factors such as NF-kappaB and IRF3, which collaborate to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and elicit innate antiviral response. Here, we identified MITA as a critical mediator of virus-triggered type I IFN signaling by expression cloning. Overexpression of MITA activated IRF3, whereas knockdown of MITA inhibited virus-triggered activation of IRF3, expression of type I IFNs, and cellular antiviral response. MITA was found to localize to the outer membrane of mitochondria and to be associated with VISA, a mitochondrial protein that acts as an adaptor in virus-triggered signaling. MITA also interacted with IRF3 and recruited the kinase TBK1 to the VISA-associated complex. MITA was phosphorylated by TBK1, which is required for MITA-mediated activation of IRF3. Our results suggest that MITA is a critical mediator of virus-triggered IRF3 activation and IFN expression and further demonstrate the importance of certain mitochondrial proteins in innate antiviral immunity.","3202":"Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are specialized for inducing central immunological tolerance to self-antigens. To accomplish this, mTECs must adopt a mature phenotype characterized by expression of the autoimmune regulator Aire, which activates the transcription of numerous genes encoding tissue-restricted self-antigens. The mechanisms that control mature Aire(+) mTEC development in the postnatal thymus remain poorly understood. We demonstrate here that, although either CD4(+) or CD8(+) thymocytes are sufficient to sustain formation of a well-defined medulla, expansion of the mature mTEC population requires autoantigen-specific interactions between positively selected CD4(+) thymocytes bearing autoreactive T cell receptor (TCR) and mTECs displaying cognate self-peptide-MHC class II complexes. These interactions also involve the engagement of CD40 on mTECs by CD40L induced on the positively selected CD4(+) thymocytes. This antigen-specific TCR-MHC class II-mediated crosstalk between CD4(+) thymocytes and mTECs defines a unique checkpoint in thymic stromal development that is pivotal for generating a mature mTEC population competent for ensuring central T cell tolerance.","3203":"The thymic medulla provides a microenvironment where medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) express autoimmune regulator and diverse tissue-restricted genes, contributing to launching self-tolerance. Positive selection is essential for thymic medulla formation via a previously unknown mechanism. Here we show that the cytokine RANK ligand (RANKL) was produced by positively selected thymocytes and regulated the cellularity of mTEC by interacting with RANK and osteoprotegerin. Forced expression of RANKL restored thymic medulla in mice lacking positive selection, whereas RANKL perturbation impaired medulla formation. These results indicate that RANKL produced by positively selected thymocytes is responsible for fostering thymic medulla formation, thereby establishing central tolerance.","3204":"Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) establish T cell self-tolerance through the expression of autoimmune regulator (Aire) and peripheral tissue-specific self-antigens. However, signals underlying mTEC development remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate crucial regulation of mTEC development by receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and CD40 signals. Whereas only RANK signaling was essential for mTEC development during embryogenesis, in postnatal mice, cooperation between CD40 and RANK signals was required for mTEC development to successfully establish the medullary microenvironment. Ligation of RANK or CD40 on fetal thymic stroma in vitro induced mTEC development in a tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-, NF-kappaB inducing kinase (NIK)-, and IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta)-dependent manner. These results show that developmental-stage-dependent cooperation between RANK and CD40 promotes mTEC development, thereby establishing self-tolerance.","3205":"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in responding to pathogens. In this issue of Immunity, Aoshi et al. (2008) highlight the fact that the migratory route DCs take to drive T cell activation is independent of the architecture of lymphoid tissues.","3206":"Three papers in this issue of Immunity (Akiyama et al., 2008; Hikosaka et al., 2008; Irla et al., 2008) together reveal coordinating roles for autoreactive T cells and TNF receptor superfamily members in the development of medullary thymic epithelial cells.","3207":"The functional role of molecular clustering in the center of the immunological synapse is controversial. In this issue of Immunity, Cemerski et al. (2008) report that the synapse center can serve as a major site of sustained signal transduction.","3208":"Cancerous lesions promote tumor growth, motility, invasion, and angiogenesis via oncogene-driven immunosuppressive leukocyte infiltrates, mainly myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and immature dendritic cells (DCs). In addition, many tumors express or induce immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-beta and IL-10. As a result, tumor-antigen crosspresentation by DCs induces T cell anergy or deletion and regulatory T cells instead of antitumor immunity. Tumoricidal effector cells can be generated after vigorous DC activation by Toll-like receptor ligands or CD40 agonists. However, no single immunotherapeutic modality is effective in established cancer. Rather, chemotherapies, causing DC activation, enhanced crosspresentation, lymphodepletion, and reduction of immunosuppressive leukocytes, act synergistically with vaccines or adoptive T cell transfer. Here, I discuss the considerations for generating promising therapeutic antitumor vaccines that use DCs.","3209":"The body requires the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells to preserve its integrity. Each microenvironment is controlled by a specific set of regulatory elements that have to be finefrly and constantly tuned to maintain local homeostasis. These environments could be site specific, such as the gut environment, or induced by chronic exposure to microbes or tumors. Various populations of dendritic cells (DCs) are central to the orchestration of this control. In this review, we will discuss some new findings associating DCs from defined compartments with the induction of antigen-specific Treg cells.","3210":"One of the remaining enigmas of the dendritic cell (DC) network is the potential contribution of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) to antigen presentation. Although the antigen-presentation capacity of conventional DCs (cDCs) is clearly defined, pDCs are generally attributed as having little, if any, antigen-presentation function. Instead, pDCs are regarded as immunomodulating cells, capable of directing the immune response through their secretion of large amounts of type I interferons. In this review, we examine the evidence for a potential role of pDC in antigen capture, processing, and presentation to T cells at sites of infection and in the lymph nodes.","3211":"Specific defense mechanisms against pathogens are fulfilled by different subsets of nonmucosal conventional dendritic cells (DCs), including migratory Langerhans cells (LCs), dermal DCs, and resident CD8(+) and CD8(-) DCs found in lymphoid organs. Dermal DCs capture antigens in the skin and migrate to lymph nodes, where they can transfer the antigens to CD8(+) DCs and activate CD4(+) T cells. Differential antigen-processing machinery grants CD8(+) DCs a high efficiency in activating CD8(+) T cells through crosspresentation, whereas CD8(-) DCs preferentially trigger CD4(+) T cell responses. Recent findings have revealed the important role played by monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs), newly formed during infection, in activating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, regulating immunoglobulin production, and killing pathogens. However, a number of controversial issues regarding the function of different DC subsets during viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections remain to be resolved.","3212":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for adaptive immunity and tolerance. Most DCs are strategically positioned as immune sentinels poised to respond to invading pathogens in tissues throughout the body. Differentiated DCs and their precursors also circulate in blood and can get rapidly recruited to sites of challenge. Within peripheral tissues, DCs collect antigenic material and then traffic to secondary lymphoid organs, where they communicate with lymphocytes to orchestrate adaptive immune responses. Hence, the migration and accurate positioning of DCs is indispensable for immune surveillance. Here, we review the molecular traffic signals that govern the migration of DCs throughout their life cycle.","3213":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the antigen presenting cells that initiate and regulate immunity. By studying these cells in vivo, we will be able to move beyond standard approaches and design vaccines that directly harness the elaborate properties of DCs to control immunity.","3214":"Oral tolerance prevents oral sensitization to dietary antigens (Ags), including proteins and haptens, and development of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. We showed here that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) prevented oral T cell priming and were responsible for systemic tolerance to CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell-mediated DTH responses induced by Ag feeding. Systemic depletion of pDCs prevented induction of tolerance by antigen feeding. Transfer of oral Ag-loaded liver pDCs to naive recipient mice induced Ag-specific suppression of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to protein and hapten, respectively. Liver is a site of oral Ag presentation, and pDCs appeared to induce anergy or deletion of Ag-specific T cells in the liver relatively rapidly via a CD4(+) T cell-independent mechanism. These data demonstrate that oral tolerance relies on Ag presentation by pDC to T cells and suggest that pDC could represent a key therapeutic target for intestinal and systemic inflammatory diseases.","3215":"Little is known about the functional differences between the human skin myeloid dendritic cell (DC) subsets, epidermal CD207(+) Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal CD14(+) DCs. We showed that CD14(+) DCs primed CD4(+) T cells into cells that induce naive B cells to switch isotype and become plasma cells. In contrast, LCs preferentially induced the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells secreting T helper 2 (Th2) cell cytokines and were efficient at priming and crosspriming naive CD8(+) T cells. A third DC population, CD14(-)CD207(-)CD1a(+) DC, which resides in the dermis, could activate CD8(+) T cells better than CD14(+) DCs but less efficiently than LCs. Thus, the human skin displays three DC subsets, two of which, i.e., CD14(+) DCs and LCs, display functional specializations, the preferential activation of humoral and cellular immunity, respectively.","3216":"Oxidative stress leads to impaired T cell activation. A central integrator of T cell activation is the actin-remodelling protein cofilin. Cofilin is activated through dephosphorylation at Ser3. Activated cofilin enables actin dynamics through severing and depolymerization of F-actin. Binding of cofilin to actin is required for formation of the immune synapse and T cell activation. Here, we showed that oxidatively stressed human T cells were impaired in chemotaxis- and costimulation-induced F-actin modulation. Although cofilin was dephosphorylated, steady-state F-actin levels increased under oxidative stress conditions. Mass spectrometry revealed that cofilin itself was a target for oxidation. Cofilin oxidation induced formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge and loss of its Ser3 phosphorylation. Importantly, dephosphorylated oxidized cofilin, although still able to bind to F-actin, did not mediate F-actin depolymerization. Impairing actin dynamics through oxidation of cofilin provides a molecular explanation for the T cell hyporesponsiveness caused by oxidative stress.","3217":"The role of the center of the immunological synapse (the central supramolecular activation cluster or cSMAC) is controversial. One model suggests that the role of the cSMAC depends on antigen quality and can both enhance signaling and receptor downregulation, whereas a second model proposes that the sole function of the cSMAC is to downregulate signaling. An important distinction between the models is whether signaling occurs in the cSMAC. Here, we demonstrate that at early time points, signaling occurs outside the cSMAC, but occurs in the cSMAC at later time points. Additionally, we show that cSMAC formation enhances the stimulatory potency of weak agonists for the TCR. Combined with previous studies showing that cSMAC formation decreases the signaling by strong agonists, our data support a model proposing that signaling and receptor degradation both occur in the cSMAC and that the balance between signaling and degradation in the synapse is determined by antigen quality.","3218":"The spleen plays an important role in host-protective responses to bacteria. However, the cellular dynamics that lead to pathogen-specific immunity remain poorly understood. Here we examined Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection in the mouse spleen via in situ fluorescence microscopy. We found that the redistribution of Lm from the marginal zone (MZ) to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS) was inhibited by pertussis toxin and required the presence of CD11c(+) cells. As early as 9 hr after infection, we detected infected dendritic cells in the peripheral regions of the PALS and clustering of Lm-specific T cells by two-photon microscopy. Pertussis toxin inhibited both Lm entry into the PALS and antigen presentation to CD8(+) T cells. Our study suggests that splenic dendritic cells rapidly deliver intracellular bacteria to the T cell areas of the white pulp to initiate CD8(+) T cell responses.","3219":"Although the signals that control neutrophil migration from the blood to sites of infection have been well characterized, little is known about their migration patterns within lymph nodes or the strategies that neutrophils use to find their local sites of action. To address these questions, we used two-photon scanning-laser microscopy to examine neutrophil migration in intact lymph nodes during infection with an intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. We found that neutrophils formed both small, transient and large, persistent swarms via a coordinated migration pattern. We provided evidence that cooperative action of neutrophils and parasite egress from host cells could trigger swarm formation. Neutrophil swarm formation coincided in space and time with the removal of macrophages that line the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. Our data provide insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying neutrophil swarming and suggest new roles for neutrophils in shaping immune responses.","3220":"The transcriptional control of CD1d-restricted NKT cell development has remained elusive. We report that PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, Zbtb16), a member of the BTB\/POZ-ZF family of transcription factors that includes the CD4-lineage-specific c-Krox (Th-POK), is exquisitely specific to CD1d-restricted NKT cells and human MR1-specific MAIT cells. PLZF was induced immediately after positive selection of NKT cell precursors, and PLZF-deficient NKT cells failed to undergo the intrathymic expansion and effector differentiation that characterize their lineage. Instead, they preserved a naive phenotype and were directed to lymph nodes. Conversely, transgenic expression of PLZF induced CD4(+) thymocytes to acquire effector differentiation and migrate to nonlymphoid tissues. We suggest that PLZF is a transcriptional signature of NKT cells that directs their innate-like effector differentiation during thymic development.","3221":"Natural killer (NK) cells play a well-recognized role in early pathogen containment and in shaping acquired cell-mediated immunity. However, indirect evidence in humans and experimental models has suggested that NK cells also play negative regulatory roles during chronic disease. To formally test this hypothesis, we employed a well-defined experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis. Our data demonstrated that NKp46(+)CD49b(+)CD3(-) NK cells were recruited to the spleen and into hepatic granulomas, where they inhibited host protective immunity in an interleukin-10 (IL-10)-dependent manner. Although IL-10 mRNA could be detected in activated NK cells 24 hr after infection, the inhibitory function of NK cells was only acquired later during infection, coincident with increased IL-10 mRNA stability and an enhanced capacity to secrete IL-10 protein. Our data support a growing body of literature that implicates NK cells as negative regulators of cell-mediated immunity and suggest that NK cells, like CD4(+) T helper 1 cells, may acquire immunoregulatory functions as a consequence of extensive activation.","3222":"The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine-threonine kinases plays a central role in T lymphocyte activation. Here, we identify NR2F6, a nuclear zinc-finger orphan receptor, as a critical PKC substrate and essential regulator of CD4(+) T cell activation responses. NR2F6 potently antagonized the ability of T helper 0 (Th0) and Th17 CD4(+) T cells to induce expression of key cytokine genes such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-17. Mechanistically, NR2F6 directly interfered with the DNA binding of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT):activator protein 1 (AP-1) but not nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) and, subsequently, transcriptional activity of the NF-AT-dependent IL-17A cytokine promoter. Consistent with our model, Nr2f6-deficient mice had hyperreactive lymphocytes, developed a late-onset immunopathology, and were hypersusceptible to Th17-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our study establishes NR2F6 as a transcriptional repressor of IL-17 expression in Th17-differentiated CD4(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo.","3223":"T cell receptor (TCR) engagement in the absence of costimulation induces the calcium-dependent upregulation of a program of gene expression that leads to the establishment of T cell anergy. Casp3 is one of the genes activated during anergy induction. Here we show that caspase 3 is required for the induction of T cell unresponsiveness. Suboptimal T cell stimulation induced caspase 3 activation, which did not result in cell death. Furthermore, caspase 3-deficient T cells showed impaired responses to anergizing stimuli. In anergic T cells, activated caspase 3 associated to the plasma membrane, where it cleaved and inactivated proteins such as the Grb2-related adaptor downstream of shc (GADS) and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Vav1, causing a blockade in TCR signaling. Our results identify a role for caspase 3 in nonapoptotic T cells and support that caspase 3-dependent proteolytic inactivation of signaling proteins is essential to maintain T cell tolerance.","3224":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play central roles in the innate immune response by recognizing conserved structural patterns in diverse microbial molecules. Here, we discuss ligand binding and activation mechanisms of the TLR family. Hydrophobic ligands of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 interact with internal protein pockets. In contrast, dsRNA, a hydrophilic ligand, interacts with the solvent-exposed surface of TLR3. Binding of agonistic ligands, lipopeptides or dsRNA, induces dimerization of the ectodomains of the various TLRs, forming dimers that are strikingly similar in shape. In these \"m\"-shaped complexes, the C termini of the extracellular domains of the TLRs converge in the middle. This observation suggests the hypothesis that dimerization of the extracellular domains forces the intracellular TIR domains to dimerize, and this initiates signaling by recruiting intracellular adaptor proteins.","3225":"Cytoplasmic nonself RNA, such as that generated by invading viruses, is recognized by a family of sensory molecules termed RIG-I-like Receptors (RLRs). Here, we discuss the mechanism of the RLRs' sensing of nonself RNA. Our findings define three functional domains of RLRs and provide insights into how RLRs function as a molecular switch through interactions with virus-specific RNA ligands.","3226":"TNF clearly contributes to immunity to intracellular pathogens, but how it does so is incompletely understood. In this issue of Immunity, Clay et al. (2008) provide unique insights, using intravital microscopy and the zebrafish-embryo model of tuberculosis.","3227":"In this issue of Immunity, Hou et al. (2008) describe the generation of mice that selectively lack the adaptor protein MyD88 in dendritic cells (DCs). These mice demonstrate that the requirement for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in DCs is dependent on the physical form of the TLR ligand.","3228":"Published work links adult lymphoid tissue-inducer cells (LTi) with T cell-dependent antibody responses. In this issue of Immunity, Tsuji et al. (2008) associate LTi with T cell-independent IgA antibody responses in the gut.","3229":"How do hematopoietic stem cells choose to be lymphocytes? In this issue of Immunity, Dias et al. (2008) uncover the requirement for E2A during lymphoid-lineage priming in the multipotent progenitor population.","3230":"In this issue of Immunity, Hermann-Kleiter et al. (2008) identify a nuclear orphan receptor, NR2F6, as a negative regulator of the T helper 17 cell subset and report that NR2F6-deficient mice develop late-onset autoimmune disease.","3231":"On the lupus-prone MRL-lpr\/lpr (MRL-lpr) background, AM14 rheumatoid factor (RF) B cells are activated, differentiate into plasmablasts, and undergo somatic hypermutation outside of follicles. Using multiple strategies to impair T cells, we found that such AM14 B cell activation did not require T cells but could be modulated by them. In vitro, the signaling adaptor MyD88 is required for IgG anti-chromatin to stimulate AM14 B cell proliferation when T cells are absent. However, the roles of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in AM14 B cell activation in vivo have not been investigated. We found that activation, expansion, and differentiation of AM14 B cells depended on MyD88; however, mice lacking either TLR7 or TLR9 displayed partial defects, indicating complex roles for these receptors. T cell-independent activation of certain autoreactive B cells, which gain stimuli via endogenous TLR ligands instead of T cells, may be the initial step in the generation of canonical autoantibodies.","3232":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key effector in controlling tuberculosis, is thought to exert protection by directing formation of granulomas, organized aggregates of macrophages and other immune cells. Loss of TNF signaling causes progression of tuberculosis in humans, and the increased mortality of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice is associated with disorganized necrotic granulomas, although the precise roles of TNF signaling preceding this endpoint remain undefined. We monitored transparent Mycobacterium marinum-infected zebrafish live to conduct a stepwise dissection of how TNF signaling operates in mycobacterial pathogenesis. We found that loss of TNF signaling caused increased mortality even when only innate immunity was operant. In the absence of TNF, intracellular bacterial growth and granuloma formation were accelerated and was followed by necrotic death of overladen macrophages and granuloma breakdown. Thus, TNF is not required for tuberculous granuloma formation, but maintains granuloma integrity indirectly by restricting mycobacterial growth within macrophages and preventing their necrosis.","3233":"The enteric pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is controlled by a vigorous innate T helper 1 (Th1) cell response in the murine model. We demonstrated that after oral infection, the parasite rapidly recruited inflammatory monocytes [Gr1(+) (Ly6C(+), Ly6G(-)) F4\/80(+)CD11b(+)CD11c(-)], which established a vital defensive perimeter within the villi of the ileum in the small intestine. Mice deficient of the chemokine receptor CCR2 or the ligand CCL2 failed to recruit Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes, whereas dendritic cells and resident tissue macrophages remained unaltered. The selective lack of Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes resulted in an inability of mice to control replication of the parasite, high influx of neutrophils, extensive intestinal necrosis, and rapid death. Adoptive transfer of sorted Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes demonstrated their ability to home to the ileum in infected animals and protect Ccr2(-\/-) mice, which were otherwise highly susceptible to oral toxoplasmosis. Collectively, these findings illustrate the critical importance of inflammatory monocytes as a first line of defense in controlling intestinal pathogens.","3234":"Novel immune-type receptors (NITRs) comprise an exceptionally large, diversified family of activating and inhibitory receptors that has been identified in bony fish. Here, we characterized the structure of an activating NITR that is expressed by a cytotoxic natural killer (NK)-like cell line and that specifically binds an allogeneic B cell target. A single amino acid residue within the NITR immunoglobulin variable (V)-type domain accounts for specificity of the interaction. Structures solved by X-ray crystallography revealed that the V-type domains of NITRs form homodimers resembling rearranging antigen-binding receptor heterodimers. CDR1 elements of both subunits of NITR dimers form ligand-binding surfaces that determine specificity for the nonself target. In the evolution of immune function, it appears that a specific NK type of innate recognition may be mediated by a complex germline multigene family of V structures resembling those that are somatically diversified in adaptive immunological responses.","3235":"T cells slow their motility, increase adherence, and arrest after encounters with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) bearing peptide-MHC complexes. Here, we analyzed the cell-cell communication among activating T cells. In vivo and in vitro, activating T cells associated in large clusters that collectively persisted for &gt;30 min, but they also engaged in more transient interactions, apparently distal to APCs. Homotypic aggregation was driven by LFA-1 integrin interactions. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cell-cell contacts between activating T cells were organized as multifocal synapses, and T cells oriented both the microtubule-organizing complex and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion toward this synapse. T cells engaged in homotypic interactions more effectively captured IL-2 relative to free cells. T cells receiving paracrine synaptic IL-2 polarized their IL-2 signaling subunits into the synaptic region and more efficiently phosphorylated the transcription factor STAT5, likely through a synapse-associated signaling complex. Thus, synapse-mediated cytokine delivery accelerates responses in activating T cells.","3236":"The first lymphoid-restricted progeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs), which have little erythromyeloid potential but retain lymphoid, granulocyte, and macrophage differentiation capacity. Despite recent advances in the identification of LMPPs, the transcription factors essential for their generation remain to be identified. Here, we demonstrated that the E2A transcription factors were required for proper development of LMPPs. Within HSCs and LMPPs, E2A proteins primed expression of a subset of lymphoid-associated genes and prevented expression of genes that are not normally prevalent in these cells, including HSC-associated and nonlymphoid genes. E2A proteins also restricted proliferation of HSCs, MPPs, and LMPPs and antagonized differentiation of LMPPs toward the myeloid fate. Our results reveal that E2A proteins play a critical role in supporting lymphoid specification from HSCs and that the reduced generation of LMPPs underlies the severe lymphocyte deficiencies observed in E2A-deficient mice.","3237":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play prominent roles in initiating immune responses to infection, but their roles in particular cell types in vivo are not established. Here we report the generation of mice selectively lacking the crucial TLR-signaling adaptor MyD88 in dendritic cells (DCs). In these mice, the early production of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-12, was substantially reduced after TLR stimulation. Whereas the innate interferon-gamma response of natural killer cells and of natural killer T cells and the Th1 polarization of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells were severely compromised after treatment with a soluble TLR9 ligand, they were largely intact after administration of an aggregated TLR9 ligand. These results demonstrate that the physical form of a TLR ligand affects which cells can respond to it and that DCs and other innate immune cells can respond via TLRs and collaborate in promoting Th1 adaptive immune responses to an aggregated stimulus.","3238":"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is generated in the gut by both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent processes. The sites and the mechanisms for T cell-independent IgA synthesis remain elusive. Here we show that isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) were sites where induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and IgA class switching of B cells took place in the absence of T cells. We also show that formation of ILFs was regulated by interactions between lymphoid tissue-inducer cells expressing the nuclear receptor ROR gamma t (ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells) and stromal cells (SCs). Activation of SCs by ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells through lymphotoxin (LT)-beta receptor (LT beta R) and simultaneously by bacteria through TLRs induced recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and formation of ILFs. These findings provide insight into the crosstalk between bacteria, ROR gamma t(+)LTi cells, SCs, DCs, and B cells required for ILF formation and establish a critical role of ILFs in T cell-independent IgA synthesis in gut.","3239":"The analysis of patient blood transcriptional profiles offers a means to investigate the immunological mechanisms relevant to human diseases on a genome-wide scale. In addition, such studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant biomarker signatures. We designed a strategy for microarray analysis that is based on the identification of transcriptional modules formed by genes coordinately expressed in multiple disease data sets. Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, this work describes the implementation and application of a methodology designed to support systems-scale analysis of the human immune system in translational research settings.","3240":"The mammalian immune system discriminates between modes of cell death; necrosis often results in inflammation and adaptive immunity, whereas apoptosis tends to be anti-inflammatory and promote immune tolerance. We have examined apoptosis for the features responsible for tolerance; specifically, we looked at the roles of caspases and mitochondria. Our results show that caspase activation targeted the mitochondria to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were critical to tolerance induction by apoptotic cells. ROS oxidized the potential danger signal high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) released from dying cells and thereby neutralized its stimulatory activity. Apoptotic cells failed to induce tolerance and instead stimulated immune responses by scavenging or by mutating a mitochondrial caspase target protein when ROS activity was prohibited. Similarly, blocking sites of oxidation in HMGB1 prevented tolerance induction by apoptotic cells. These results suggest that caspase-orchestrated mitochondrial events determine the impact of apoptotic cells on the immune response.","3241":"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is subjected to crosstalk from other signals, with a resulting positive or negative effect. There is complex crosstalk between the NLR family of immune-regulatory molecules and TLRs, and C-type lectin receptors such as Dectin-1 synergize with TLR2 via the tyrosine kinase Syk. Bruton's tyrosine kinase plays an important positive role in TLR signaling, whereas the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases is inhibitory. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 has been shown to positively regulate induction of interferon-beta, whereas SHP2 inhibits the kinase TBK1, limiting this response. K63-linked polyubiquination has also been shown to be critical for the initiation of TLR signaling. Finally, glucocorticoids affect TLR signaling by inducing the phosphatase MKP1 and inhibiting TBK1 activation. These recent findings emphasize the importance of considering TLR signaling in the context of other signaling pathways, as is likely to occur in vivo during infection and inflammation.","3242":"In this issue of Immunity, Chaussabel et al.

(2008) suggests that T cell-receptor engagement during development affects gammadelta T cell polarization toward either interferon-gamma or interleukin-17 production. This might underlie their unique innate ability to regulate inflammation.","3246":"Necrotic cells release HMGB1 as a danger signal to activate the immune system. In this issue of Immunity, Kazama et al. (2008) identify a mechanism that determines whether HMGB1 is tolerogenic or immunogenic.","3247":"Modulation of surface T cell antigen receptor (TCR) expression is an important mechanism for the regulation of immune responses and the prevention of T cell hyperactivation and autoimmunity. The TCR is rapidly internalized after antigen stimulation and then degraded in lysosomes. However, few of the molecules involved in this process have been identified. We demonstrate that the lysosomal protein LAPTM5 negatively regulated surface TCR expression by specifically interacting with the invariant signal-transducing CD3zeta chain and promoting its degradation without affecting other CD3 proteins, CD3epsilon, CD3delta, or CD3gamma. TCR downmodulation required the polyproline-tyrosine motifs and the ubiquitin-interacting motif of LAPTM5. LAPTM5 deficiency resulted in elevated TCR expression on both CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and spleen T cells after CD3 stimulation, as well as enhanced T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. These results identify a lysosomal protein important for CD3zeta degradation and illustrate a unique mechanism for the control of surface TCR expression and T cell activation.","3248":"Mechanisms that prevent inappropriate or excessive interleukin-17-producing T helper (Th17) cell responses after microbial infection may be necessary to avoid autoimmunity. Here, we define a pathway initiated by engagement of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) expressed by dendritic cells (DC) that culminated in suppression of Th17 cell differentiation. IFNAR-dependent inhibition of an intracellular translational isoform of Osteopontin, termed Opn-i, derepressed interleukin-27 (IL-27) secretion and prevented efficient Th17 responses. Moreover, Opn-i expression in DC and microglia regulated the type and intensity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice containing DC deficient in Opn-i produced excessive amounts of IL-27 and developed a delayed disease characterized by an enhanced Th1 response compared with the dominant Th17 response of Opn-sufficient mice. Definition of the IFNAR-Opn-i axis that controls Th17 development provides insight into regulation of Th cell sublineage development and the molecular basis of type I interferon therapy for MS and other autoimmune diseases.","3249":"Innate recognition of invading pathogens in peripheral tissues results in the recruitment of circulating memory CD8(+) T cells to sites of localized inflammation during the early phase of a recall response. However, the mechanisms that control the rapid recruitment of these cells to peripheral sites are poorly understood, particularly in relation to influenza and parainfluenza infections of the respiratory tract. In this study, we demonstrate a crucial role for C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the accelerated recruitment of memory CD8(+) T cells to the lung airways during virus challenge. Most importantly, CCR5 deficiency resulted in decreased recruitment of memory T cells expressing key effector molecules and impaired control of virus replication during the initial stages of a secondary response. These data highlight the critical importance of early memory T cell recruitment for the efficacy of cellular immunity in the lung.","3250":"Adaptive Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells develop during induction of mucosal tolerance and after immunization. Large numbers of Foxp3(+) T cells have been found in inflamed tissues. We investigated the role of adaptive Foxp3(+) Treg cells in mucosal tolerance and in chronic allergic lung inflammation. We used two strains of mice that are devoid of naturally occurring Treg cells; one is capable of generating adaptive Foxp3(+) Treg cells upon exposure to antigen, whereas the other is deficient in both naturally occurring and adaptive Foxp3(+) Treg cells. We found that adaptive Foxp3(+) Treg cells were essential for establishing mucosal tolerance and for suppressing IL-4 production and lymphoid neogenesis in chronic inflammation, whereas IL-5 production and eosinophilia could be controlled by Foxp3-independent, IFN-gamma-dependent mechanisms. Thus, whereas adaptive Foxp3(+) Treg cells regulate sensitization to allergens and the severity of chronic inflammation, IFN-gamma-producing cells can play a beneficial role in inflammatory conditions involving eosinophils.","3251":"Despite studies based on deletion or activation of intracellular components of the canonical Wingless related (Wnt) pathway, the role of Wnts in hematolymphopoiesis remains controversial. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function models, we found that Wnt4 differentially affected diverse subsets of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Bone-marrow and thymic Lin(-)Sca1(+)Kit(hi) cells (LSKs) were the key targets of Wnt4. In adult mice, Wnt4-induced expansion of Flt3(+) bone-marrow LSKs (lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors) led to a sizeable accumulation of the most immature thymocyte subsets (upstream of beta-selection) and a major increase in thymopoiesis. Conversely, Wnt4(-\/-) neonates showed low frequencies of bone-marrow LSKs and thymic hypocellularity. We provide compelling evidence that Wnt4 activates noncanonical (beta-catenin-independent) signaling and that its effects on hematopoietic cells are mainly non-cell-autonomous. Our work shows that Wnt4 overexpression has a unique ability to expand Flt3(+) LSKs in adults and demonstrates that noncanonical Wnt signaling regulates thymopoiesis.","3252":"T cell help to B cells is a fundamental property of adaptive immunity, yet only recently have many of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of T cell help emerged. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are the CD4(+) T helper cells that provide cognate help to B cells for high-affinity antibody production in germinal centers (GC). Tfh cells produce interleukin-21 (IL-21), and we show that IL-21 was necessary for GC formation. However, the central role of IL-21 in GC formation reflected its effects on Tfh cell generation rather than on B cells. Expression of the inducible costimulator (ICOS) was necessary for optimal production of IL-21, indicative of interplay between these two Tfh cell-expressed molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that IL-21's costimulatory capacity for T helper cell differentiation operated at the level of the T cell receptor signalosome through Vav1, a signaling molecule that controls T cell helper function. This study reveals a previously unappreciated role for Tfh cells in the formation of the GC and isotype switching through a CD4(+) T cell-intrinsic requirement for IL-21.","3253":"After activation, CD4(+) helper T (Th) cells differentiate into distinct effector subsets. Although chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5-expressing T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important in humoral immunity, their developmental regulation is unclear. Here we show that Tfh cells had a distinct gene expression profile and developed in vivo independently of the Th1 or Th2 cell lineages. Tfh cell generation was regulated by ICOS ligand (ICOSL) expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). However, unlike Th17 cells, differentiation of Tfh cells did not require transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or Th17-specific orphan nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma in vivo. Finally, naive T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but not TGF-beta signaling preferentially acquired Tfh gene expression and promoted germinal-center reactions in vivo. This study thus demonstrates that Tfh is a distinct Th cell lineage.","3254":"Regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells were recently proposed to be reciprocally regulated during differentiation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we utilized a Th17 reporter mouse with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) sequence inserted into the interleukin-17F (IL-17F) gene. Using IL-17F-RFP together with a Foxp3 reporter, we found that the development of Th17 and Foxp3(+) Treg cells was associated in immune responses. Although TGF-beta receptor I signaling was required for both Foxp3 and IL-17 induction, SMAD4 was only involved in Foxp3 upregulation. Foxp3 inhibited Th17 differentiation by antagonizing the function of the transcription factors RORgammat and ROR*. In contrast, IL-6 overcame this suppressive effect of Foxp3 and, together with IL-1, induced genetic reprogramming in Foxp3(+) Treg cells. STAT3 regulated Foxp3 downregulation, whereas STAT3, RORgamma, and ROR* were required for IL-17 expression in Treg cells. Our data demonstrate molecular antagonism and plasticity of Treg and Th17 cell programs.","3255":"gammadelta T cells uniquely contribute to host immune defense, but how this is accomplished remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex class I T10 and T22-specific gammadelta T cells in mice and found that encountering antigen in the thymus was neither required nor inhibitory for their development. But when triggered through the T cell receptor, ligand-naive lymphoid-gammadelta T cells produced IL-17, whereas ligand-experienced cells made IFN-gamma. Immediately after immunization, a large fraction of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells were found in the draining lymph nodes days before the appearance of antigen-specific IL-17(+) *beta T cells. Thus, thymic selection determines the effector fate of gammadelta T cells rather than constrains their antigen specificities. The swift IL-17 response mounted by antigen-naive gammadelta T cells suggests a critical role for these cells at the onset of an acute inflammatory response to novel antigens.","3256":"DR3 (TRAMP, LARD, WSL-1, TNFRSF25) is a death-domain-containing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-family receptor primarily expressed on T cells. TL1A, the TNF-family ligand for DR3, can costimulate T cells, but the physiological function of TL1A-DR3 interactions in immune responses is not known. Using DR3-deficient mice, we identified DR3 as the receptor responsible for TL1A-induced T cell costimulation and dendritic cells as the likely source for TL1A during T cell activation. Despite its role in costimulation, DR3 was not required for in vivo T cell priming, for polarization into T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, or Th17 effector cell subtypes, or for effective control of infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Instead, DR3 expression was required on T cells for immunopathology, local T cell accumulation, and cytokine production in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and allergic lung inflammation, disease models that depend on distinct effector T cell subsets. DR3 could be an attractive therapeutic target for T cell-mediated autoimmune and allergic diseases.","3257":"Antibody responses are critical components of protective immune responses to many pathogens, but parameters determining which proteins are targeted remain unclear. Vaccination with individual MHC-II-restricted vaccinia virus (VACV, smallpox vaccine) epitopes revealed that CD4(+) T cell help to B cells was surprisingly nontransferable to other virion protein specificities. Many VACV CD4(+) T cell responses identified in an unbiased screen targeted antibody virion protein targets, consistent with deterministic linkage between specificities. We tested the deterministic linkage model by efficiently predicting new vaccinia MHC II epitopes (830% improved efficiency). Finally, we showed CD4(+) T cell help was limiting for neutralizing antibody development and protective immunity in vivo. In contrast to the standard model, these data indicate individual proteins are the unit of B cell-T cell recognition for a large virus. Therefore, MHC restriction is a key selective event for the antiviral antibody response and is probably important for vaccine development to large pathogens.","3258":null,"3259":"Antigen-dependent T cell activation drives the formation of signaling microclusters containing the adaptor SLP-76. Costimulatory integrins regulate SLP-76 phosphorylation and could influence SLP-76 microclusters in the integrin-rich periphery of the immune synapse. We report that costimulation by the integrin VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) required SLP-76 domains implicated in microcluster assembly. Pro-adhesive ligands enlarged the contact and increased the number of SLP-76 microclusters regardless of their costimulatory potential. Costimulatory VLA-4 ligands also prevented the centralization of SLP-76, promoted microcluster persistence, prolonged lateral interactions between SLP-76 and its upstream kinase, ZAP-70, and retained SLP-76 in tyrosine-phosphorylated peripheral structures. SLP-76 centralization was driven by dynamic actin polymerization and was correlated with inward actin flows. VLA-4 ligation retarded these flows, even in the absence of SLP-76. These data suggest a widely applicable model of costimulation, in which integrins promote sustained signaling by attenuating cytoskeletal movements that drive the centralization and inactivation of SLP-76 microclusters.","3260":"The nature of crosspriming immunogens for CD8(+) T cell responses is highly controversial. By using a panel of T cell receptor-like antibodies specific for viral peptides bound to mouse D(b) major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, we show that an exceptional peptide (PA(224-233)) expressed as a viral minigene product formed a sizeable cytosolic pool continuously presented for hours after protein synthesis was inhibited. PA(224-233) pool formation required active cytosolic heat-shock protein 90 but not ER g96 and uniquely enabled crosspriming by this peptide. These findings demonstrate that exceptional class I binding oligopeptides that escape proteolytic degradation are potent crosspriming agents. Thus, the feeble immunogenicity of natural proteasome products in crosspriming can be attributed to their evanescence in donor cells and not an absolute inability of cytosolic oligopeptides to be transferred to and presented by professional antigen-presenting cells.","3261":"Differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into T helper type 1 (Th1) effector cells requires both T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and cytokines such as interleukin-12 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Here, we report that a third cytokine signal, mediated by the Janus family tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway, is also required for Th1 cell differentiation. In the absence of Jak3-dependent signals, naive CD4+ T cells proliferate robustly but produce little IFN-gamma after Th1 cell polarization in vitro. This defect is not due to reduced activation of STAT1 or STAT4 or to impaired upregulation of the transcription factor T-bet. Instead, we find that T-bet binding to the Ifng promoter is greatly diminished in the absence of Jak3-dependent signals, correlating with a decrease in Ifng promoter accessibility and histone acetylation. These data indicate that Jak3 regulates epigenetic modification and chromatin remodeling of the Ifng locus during Th1 cell differentiation.","3262":"The gut mucosa is exposed to a large community of commensal bacteria that are required for the processing of nutrients and the education of the local immune system. Conversely, the gut immune system generates innate and adaptive responses that shape the composition of the local microbiota. One striking feature of intestinal adaptive immunity is its ability to generate massive amounts of noninflammatory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies through multiple follicular and extrafollicular pathways that operate in the presence or absence of cognate T-B cell interactions. Here we discuss the role of intestinal IgA in host-commensal mutualism, immune protection, and tolerance and summarize recent advances on the role of innate immune cells in intestinal IgA production.","3263":"Mitochondrial antiviral immunity involves the detection of viral RNA by intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) belonging to the RIG-I-like helicase family. The convergence of these and other signaling molecules to the outer mitochondrial membrane results in the rapid induction of antiviral cytokines including type-1 interferon. Here, we discuss recent studies describing new molecules implicated in the regulation of this antiviral response.","3264":"Integrin engagement costimulates T cell receptor signaling, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this issue of Immunity, Nguyen et al.

(2008) identify a previously unknown requirement in T helper cell differentiation, showing that Jak3 and STAT5 are needed to generate chromatin that is permissive to the activating effects of T-bet.","3268":"The transcription factor E2A controls the initiation of B lymphopoiesis, which is arrested at the pre-pro-B cell stage in E2A-deficient mice. Here, we demonstrate by conditional mutagenesis that E2A is essential for the development of pro-B, pre-B, and immature B cells in the bone marrow. E2A is, however, dispensable for the generation of mature B cells and plasma cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. In contrast, germinal center B cell development is impaired in the absence of E2A despite normal AID expression and class-switch recombination. Molecular analysis revealed that E2A is required not only for initiating but also for maintaining the expression of Ebf1, Pax5, and the B cell gene program in pro-B cells. Notably, precocious Pax5 transcription from the Ikzf1 locus promotes pro-B cell development in E2A-deficient mice, demonstrating that ectopic Pax5 expression is sufficient to activate the B lymphoid transcription program in vivo in the absence of E2A.","3269":"As CD1 proteins recycle between the cell surface and endosomes, they show altered receptiveness to lipid antigen loading. We hypothesized that changes in proton concentration encountered within distinct endosomal compartments influence the charge state of residues near the entrance to the CD1 groove and thereby control antigen loading. Molecular dynamic models identified flexible areas of the CD1b heavy chain in the superior and lateral walls of the A' pocket. In these same areas, residues that carry charge in a pH-dependent manner (D60, E62) were found to tether the rigid alpha1 helix to flexible areas of the alpha2 helix and the 50-60 loop. After disruption of these tethers with acid pH or mutation, we observed increased association and dissociation of lipids with CD1b and preferential presentation of antigens with bulky lipid tails. We propose that ionic tethers act as molecular switches that respond to pH fluxes during endosomal recycling and regulate the conformation of the CD1 heavy chain to control the size and rate of antigens captured.","3270":"Inflammation mediated by antibody-antigen complexes contributes to autoimmune diseases. Mice deficient in the common Fcgamma-chain are protected from IgG-mediated glomerulonephritis and the reverse passive Arthus (RPA) reaction and FcR-bearing macrophages, and mast cells have been assigned primary roles in these processes. Here we demonstrate that neutrophil-selective transgenic expression of the two uniquely human neutrophil Fc gamma receptors (FcgammaRs), FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIB, in Fcgamma-chain-deficient mice restored susceptibility to progressive glomerulonephritis and the cutaneous RPA reaction. FcgammaRIIIB and FcgammaRIIA mediated neutrophil accumulation, whereas FcgammaRIIA alone promoted organ injury. In a model of soluble immune complexes deposited within the vasculature, FcgammaRIIIB was responsible for neutrophil slow rolling and adhesion whereas in the cremaster RPA, induced by both vascular and tissue soluble immune complexes, FcgammaRIIA predominated. Thus, human FcgammaRs on neutrophils serve as molecular links between antibody and immunological disease, with FcgammaRIIA promoting tissue injury and FcgammaRIIIB and FcgammaRIIA displaying specialized context-dependent functions in neutrophil recruitment.","3271":"Previous studies suggest that thymus produces a homogenous population of natural regulatory T (Treg) cells that express a transcriptional factor FOXP3 and control autoimmunity through a cell-contact-dependent mechanism. We found two subsets of FOXP3+ natural Treg cells defined by the expression of the costimulatory molecule ICOS in the human thymus and periphery. Whereas the ICOS+FOXP3+ Treg cells used interleukin-10 to suppress dendritic cell function and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta to suppress T cell function, the ICOS-FOXP3+ Treg cells used TGF-beta only. The survival and proliferation of the two subsets of Treg cells were differentially regulated by signaling through ICOS or CD28, respectively. We suggest that the selection of natural Treg cells in thymus is coupled with Treg cell differentiation into two subsets imprinted with different cytokine expression potentials and use both cell-contact-dependent and independent mechanisms for immunosuppression in periphery.","3272":"Synergistic engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in response to DNA-containing antigens underlies the production of many autoantibodies in systemic autoimmune diseases. However, the molecular basis of this synergistic engagement is not known. Given that these receptors are spatially segregated, with the BCR on the cell surface and TLR9 in endocytic vesicles, achieving synergy must involve unique mechanisms. We show that upon antigen binding, the BCR initiates signaling at the plasma membrane and continues to signal to activate MAP kinases as it traffics to autophagosome-like compartments. The internalized BCR signals through a phospholipase-D-dependent pathway to recruit TLR9-containing endosomes to the autophagosome via the microtubular network. The recruitment of TLR9 to the autophagosomes was necessary for hyperactivation of MAP kinases. This unique mechanism for BCR-induced TLR9 recruitment resulting in B cells hyperresponses may provide new targets for therapeutics for autoimmune diseases.","3273":"","3274":"Through genetic recombination, the adaptive immune system generates a diverse T cell repertoire allowing recognition of a vast spectrum of foreign antigens. Any given CD8+ T cell specificity is thought to be rare, but none have been directly quantified. Here, major histocompatibility complex tetramer and magnetic-bead technology were coupled to quantitate naive antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and the early response to infection. Among six specificities measured, the number of naive antigen-specific precursors ranged from approximately 80 to 1200 cells\/mouse. After vesicular stomatitis virus infection, the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response occurred in discrete phases: prolonged activation of a subset of cells over the first 72 hr followed by a rapid proliferative burst. Naive precursor frequency altered response kinetics and regulated immunodominance, as well as the time required for the responding population to shift toward CD62L(hi) memory cells. Thus, initial endogenous precursor frequencies were surprisingly diverse and not only regulated initial immune response characteristics but also controlled memory CD8+ T cell lineage decisions.","3275":"B cells mediate multiple functions that influence immune and inflammatory responses. In this study, T cell-mediated inflammation was exaggerated in CD19-deficient (Cd19(-\/-)) mice and wild-type mice depleted of CD20(+) B cells, whereas inflammation was substantially reduced in mice with hyperactive B cells as a result of CD19 overexpression (hCD19Tg). These inflammatory responses were negatively regulated by a unique CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cell subset that was absent in Cd19(-\/-) mice, represented only 1%-2% of spleen B220(+) cells in wild-type mice, but was expanded to approximately 10% of spleen B220(+) cells in hCD19Tg mice. Adoptive transfer of these CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cells normalized inflammation in wild-type mice depleted of CD20(+) B cells and in Cd19(-\/-) mice. Remarkably, IL-10 production was restricted to this CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cell subset, with IL-10 production diminished in Cd19(-\/-) mice, yet increased in hCD19Tg mice. Thereby, CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cells represent a unique subset of potent regulatory B cells.","3276":"The appropriate activation of B cells is critical for the development and operation of immune responses and is dependent on the extensive coordination of intra- and intercellular communications in response to antigen stimulation. An accurate description of the B cell-activation process requires investigation of these interactions within their correct cellular context both at high resolution and in real time. Here, we discuss a number of recent studies that have offered insight into the early molecular events of B cell activation. We suggest that segregation within the B cell membrane triggers localized cytoskeleton reorganisation and signaling, allowing the formation of B cell receptor (BCR) microclusters. These BCR microclusters are the sites for the coordinated recruitment of the signalosome and are propagated during B cell spreading. We discuss the recent identification of a critical role for CD19 in the B cell response to membrane-bound antigen and suggest a mechanism involving BCR microclusters by which it mediates its stimulatory function. Finally, we consider research that has taken advantage of recent technological advances in multiphoton microscopy that have allowed its application to the investigation of the dynamics of membrane-bound antigen presentation and subsequent B cell activation in lymph nodes in vivo.","3277":"Hanna et al.

Our results demonstrated a progressive decrease in the Treg cell:Teff cell ratio in inflamed islets but not in pancreatic lymph nodes. Intra-islet Treg cells expressed reduced amounts of CD25 and Bcl-2, suggesting that their decline was due to increased apoptosis. Additionally, administration of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoted Treg cell survival and protected mice from developing diabetes. Together, these results suggest intra-islet Treg cell dysfunction secondary to defective IL-2 production is a root cause of the progressive breakdown of self-tolerance and the development of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice.","3285":"To explore the human T cell response to acute viral infection, we performed a longitudinal analysis of CD8(+) T cells responding to the live yellow fever virus and smallpox vaccines--two highly successful human vaccines. Our results show that both vaccines generated a brisk primary effector CD8(+) T cell response of substantial magnitude that could be readily quantitated with a simple set of four phenotypic markers. Secondly, the vaccine-induced T cell response was highly specific with minimal bystander effects. Thirdly, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells passed through an obligate effector phase, contracted more than 90% and gradually differentiated into long-lived memory cells. Finally, these memory cells were highly functional and underwent a memory differentiation program distinct from that described for human CD8(+) T cells specific for persistent viruses. These results provide a benchmark for CD8(+) T cell responses induced by two of the most effective vaccines ever developed.","3286":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate vast networks of genes that share miRNA target sequences. To examine the physiologic effects of an individual miRNA-mRNA interaction in vivo, we generated mice that carry a mutation in the putative microRNA-155 (miR-155) binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), designated Aicda(155) mice. AID is required for immunoglobulin gene diversification in B lymphocytes, but it also promotes chromosomal translocations. Aicda(155) caused an increase in steady-state Aicda mRNA and protein amounts by increasing the half-life of the mRNA, resulting in a high degree of Myc-Igh translocations. A similar but more pronounced translocation phenotype was also found in miR-155-deficient mice. Our experiments indicate that miR-155 can act as a tumor suppressor by reducing potentially oncogenic translocations generated by AID.","3287":"How T cell receptor (TCR) specificity evolves in vivo after protein vaccination is central to the development of helper T (Th) cell function. Most models of clonal selection in the Th cell compartment favor TCR affinity-based thresholds. Here, we demonstrated that depot-forming vaccine adjuvants did not require Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to induce clonal dominance in antigen-specific Th cell responses. However, readily dispersible adjuvants using TLR-9 and TLR-4 agonists skewed TCR repertoire usage by increasing TCR selection thresholds and enhancing antigen-specific clonal expansion. In this manner, vaccine adjuvants control the local accumulation of Th cells expressing TCR with the highest peptide MHC class II binding. Clonal composition was altered by mechanisms that blocked the local propagation of clonotypes independently of antigen dose and not as a consequence of interclonal competition. This capacity of adjuvants to modify antigen-specific Th cell clonal composition has fundamental implications for the design of future protein subunit vaccines.","3288":"B lymphocytes perform somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination (CSR) of the immunoglobulin locus to generate an antibody repertoire diverse in both affinity and function. These somatic diversification processes are catalyzed by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a potent DNA mutator whose expression and function are highly regulated. Here we show that AID was regulated posttranscriptionally by a lymphocyte-specific microRNA, miR-155. We found that miR-155 was upregulated in murine B lymphocytes undergoing CSR and that it targeted a conserved site in the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA encoding AID. Disruption of this target site in vivo resulted in quantitative and temporal deregulation of AID expression, along with functional consequences for CSR and affinity maturation. Thus, miR-155, which has recently been shown to play important roles in regulating the germinal-center reaction, does so in part by directly downmodulating AID expression.","3289":"Upon detection of viral RNA, the helicases RIG-I and\/or MDA5 trigger, via their adaptor Cardif (also known as IPS-1, MAVS, or VISA), the activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF3, which collaborate to induce an antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response. FADD and RIP1, known as mediators of death-receptor signaling, are implicated in this antiviral pathway; however, the link between death-receptor and antiviral signaling is not known. Here we showed that TRADD, a crucial adaptor of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRI), was important in RIG-like helicase (RLH)-mediated signal transduction. TRADD is recruited to Cardif and orchestrated complex formation with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 and TANK and with FADD and RIP1, leading to the activation of IRF3 and NF-kappaB. Loss of TRADD prevented Cardif-dependent activation of IFN-beta, reduced the production of IFN-beta in response to RNA viruses, and enhanced vesicular stomatitis virus replication. Thus, TRADD is not only an essential component of proinflammatory TNFRI signaling, but is also required for RLH-Cardif-dependent antiviral immune responses.","3290":"CD8(+) T cell tolerance, although essential for preventing autoimmunity, poses substantial obstacles to eliciting immune responses to tumor antigens, which are generally overexpressed normal proteins. Development of effective strategies to overcome tolerance for clinical applications would benefit from elucidation of the immunologic mechanism(s) regulating T cell tolerance to self. To examine how tolerance is maintained in vivo, we engineered dual-T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice in which CD8(+) T cells recognize two distinct antigens: a foreign viral-protein and a tolerizing self-tumor protein. Encounter with peripheral self-antigen rendered dual-TCR T cells tolerant to self, but these cells responded normally through the virus-specific TCR. Moreover, proliferation induced by virus rescued function of tolerized self-tumor-reactive TCR, restoring anti-tumor activity. These studies demonstrate that peripheral CD8(+) T cell tolerance to self-proteins can be regulated at the level of the self-reactive TCR complex rather than by central cellular inactivation and suggest an alternate strategy to enhance adoptive T cell immunotherapy.","3291":"The action of type I interferons in the central nervous system (CNS) during autoimmunity is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate elevated interferon beta concentrations in the CNS, but not blood, of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for CNS autoimmunity. Furthermore, mice devoid of the broadly expressed type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) developed exacerbated clinical disease accompanied by a markedly higher inflammation, demyelination, and lethality without shifting the T helper 17 (Th17) or Th1 cell immune response. Whereas adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cells led to enhanced disease in Ifnar1(-\/-) mice, newly created conditional mice with B or T lymphocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed normal EAE. The engagement of IFNAR on neuroectodermal CNS cells had no protective effect. In contrast, absence of IFNAR on myeloid cells led to severe disease with an enhanced effector phase and increased lethality, indicating a distinct protective function of type I IFNs during autoimmune inflammation of the CNS.","3292":"Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It orchestrates innate and T cell-mediated inflammatory pathways and can promote T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses. Utilizing a T cell transfer model, we showed that IL-23-dependent colitis did not require IL-17 secretion by T cells. Furthermore, IL-23-independent intestinal inflammation could develop if immunosuppressive pathways were reduced. The frequency of naive T cell-derived Foxp3+ cells in the colon increased in the absence of IL-23, indicating a role for IL-23 in controlling regulatory T cell induction. Foxp3-deficient T cells induced colitis when transferred into recipients lacking IL-23p19, showing that IL-23 was not essential for intestinal inflammation in the absence of Foxp3. Taken together, our data indicate that overriding immunosuppressive pathways is an important function of IL-23 in the intestine and could influence not only Th17 cell activity but also other types of immune responses.","3293":"In this issue of Immunity, Tsujimura et al. (2008) report that the release of platelet-activating factor by basophils stimulated with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-antigen immune complexes contributes substantially to the expression of an IgG1-dependent alternative pathway of systemic anaphylaxis in mice.","3294":"The idea of cancer immunosurveillance has regained interest in recent years. In this issue of Immunity, Guerra et al. (2008) present the first genetic evidence for surveillance of primary tumors by a natural killer cell-associated receptor.","3295":"Dendritic cells are a heterogeneous group of antigen presenting cells. In this issue of Immunity, Esashi et al. (2008) demonstrate how cytokine-receptor-regulated downstream transcription factors direct dendritic cell subpopulation differentiation from hematopoietic progenitor cells.","3296":"The B cell receptor (BCR) activates the ERK kinases, but what does ERK do? In this issue of Immunity, Yasuda et al. (2008) show that ERK controls a transcription factor network by which the pre-BCR drives early B cell development.","3297":"Cytokine signaling via a restricted number of Jak-Stat pathways positively and negatively regulates all cell types involved in the initiation, propagation, and resolution of inflammation. Here, we focus on Jak-Stat signaling in three major cell types involved in inflammatory responses: T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. We summarize how the Jak-Stat pathways in these cells are negatively regulated by the Suppressor of cytokine signaling (Socs) proteins. We emphasize that common Jak-Stat-Socs signaling modules can have diverse developmental, pro- and anti-inflammatory outcomes depending on the cytokine receptor activated and which genes are accessible at a given time in a cell's life. Because multiple components of Jak-Stat-Socs pathways are mutated or closely associated with human inflammatory diseases, and cytokine-based therapies are increasingly deployed to treat inflammation, understanding cytokine signaling will continue to advance our ability to manipulate chronic and acute inflammatory diseases.","3298":"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are regulatory cytokines with pleiotropic roles in the immune system. The prominent function of TGF-beta is to maintain T cell tolerance to self or innocuous environmental antigens via its direct effects on the differentiation and homeostasis of effector and regulatory T cells. A critical route for the regulation of T cells by TGF-beta is via activation of a T cell-produced latent form of TGF-beta1 by dendritic cell-expressed avbeta8 integrin. IL-10 operates primarily as a feedback inhibitor of exuberant T cell responses to microbial antigens. T cells are also the principal producers of IL-10, the expression of which is regulated by IL-27, IL-6, and TGF-beta. The collective activity of TGF-beta and IL-10 ensures a controlled inflammatory response specifically targeting pathogens without evoking excessive immunopathology to self-tissues.","3299":"T helper 17 (Th17) cells belong to a recently identified T helper subset, in addition to the traditional Th1 and Th2 subsets. These cells are characterized as preferential producers of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22. Th17 cells and their effector cytokines mediate host defensive mechanisms to various infections, especially extracellular bacteria infections, and are involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. The receptors for IL-17 and IL-22 are broadly expressed on various epithelial tissues. The effector cytokines of Th17 cells, therefore, mediate the crucial crosstalk between immune system and tissues, and play indispensable roles in tissue immunity.","3300":"The characterization of the new lineage of IL-17-producing CD4+ T helper (Th17) cells has revolutionized our current understanding of T cell-mediated immunity. Over the past five years, there have been many twists and turns as the pathways that lead to Th17 cell differentiation have been elucidated. Not least of these was the discovery that TGF-beta is a crucial cytokine for Th17 cell development, suggesting that Th17 and regulatory T cell subsets share reciprocal developmental pathways during the pathogenesis or control of inflammation. This review aims to bring together the observations that have formed current opinion on factors that promote and contain Th17 cell development, in both mouse and man. Unresolved controversies in this field are also discussed: For example, IL-23 is absolutely required for disease pathogenesis in many models of Th17-cell-mediated autoimmunity, yet its role in Th17 cell development is relatively unclear.","3301":"Biological therapies targeting cytokines, T cells, or B cells have improved outcomes of inflammatory diseases. However, many issues remain open: What is the best target? How well can response be predicted? How can cure be achieved?","3302":"New cell types and cytokines have emerged as key participants in the elaboration of and recovery from inflammation. A collection of reviews covers recent advances in our understanding of this crucial component of host defense.","3303":"Ligands for the NKG2D stimulatory receptor are frequently upregulated on tumor lines, rendering them sensitive to natural killer (NK) cells, but the role of NKG2D in tumor surveillance has not been addressed in spontaneous cancer models. Here, we provided the first characterization of NKG2D-deficient mice, including evidence that NKG2D was not necessary for NK cell development but was critical for immunosurveillance of epithelial and lymphoid malignancies in two transgenic models of de novo tumorigenesis. In both models, we detected NKG2D ligands on the tumor cell surface ex vivo, providing needed evidence for ligand expression by primary tumors. In a prostate cancer model, aggressive tumors arising in NKG2D-deficient mice expressed higher amounts of NKG2D ligands than did similar tumors in wild-type mice, suggesting an NKG2D-dependent immunoediting of tumors in this model. These findings provide important genetic evidence for surveillance of primary tumors by an NK receptor.","3304":"Immature dendritic cells (DCs) sample tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) and process them for \"crosspresentation\" via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. Findings with adoptively transferred T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic CD8+ T cells in transgenic mice expressing model TSA indicate that this process contributes to tolerance induction of CD8+ T cells, a phenomenon termed \"crosstolerance.\" However, up to now it has been unknown whether \"crosstolerance\" can also control autoimmune T cells specific for physiological nontransgenic TSA. Here, we showed that a DC-specific deficiency in uptake of apoptotic material inhibits crosspresentation in vivo. This defect allowed the accumulation of fully functional autoreactive CD8+ T cells that could be activated for autoimmune attack in peripheral lymphoid organs. Thus, our data demonstrate the importance of crosstolerance induction by DCs as a vital instrument for controlling self-reactive T cells from the peripheral repertoire and preventing autoimmune disease.","3305":"The regulatory T (Treg) cells restrain immune responses through suppressor-function elaboration that is dependent upon expression of the transcription factor Foxp3. Despite a critical role for Treg cells in maintaining lympho-myeloid homeostasis, it remains unclear whether a single mechanism or multiple mechanisms of Treg cell-mediated suppression are operating in vivo and how redundant such mechanisms might be. Here we addressed these questions by examining the role of the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 in Treg cell-mediated suppression. Analyses of mice in which the Treg cell-specific ablation of a conditional IL-10 allele was induced by Cre recombinase knocked into the Foxp3 gene locus showed that although IL-10 production by Treg cells was not required for the control of systemic autoimmunity, it was essential for keeping immune responses in check at environmental interfaces such as the colon and lungs. Our study suggests that Treg cells utilize multiple means to limit immune responses. Furthermore, these mechanisms are likely to be nonredundant, in that a distinct suppressor mechanism most likely plays a prominent and identifiable role at a particular tissue and inflammatory setting.","3306":"Requirements for CD4+ T cell memory differentiation were analyzed with adoptively transferred SMARTA T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic cells specific for alymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) epitope. LCMV-induced effector and memory differentiation of SMARTA cells mimicked the endogenous CD4+ T cell response. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Listeria expressing the LCMV epitope, although resulting initially in massive SMARTA expansion, led to loss of effector function and rapid cell death characterized by high expression of the apoptosis regulator Bim. Defective memory differentiation was seen after stimulation of naive but not memory SMARTA cells, was independent of precursor frequency, and correlated with a lower TCR avidity compared to endogenous responders. In addition, long-lived endogenous CD4+ memory T cells skewed to a higher functional avidity over time. These results support a model in which CD4+ T cell memory differentiation and longevity depend on the strength of the TCR signal during the primary response.","3307":"The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) plays a crucial role in the development of immature B cells. Although certain aspects of proximal pre-BCR signaling have been studied, the intermediate signal transducers and the distal transcription modulators are poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of both Erk1 and Erk2 kinases was associated with defective pre-BCR-mediated cell expansion as well as a block in the transition of pro-B to pre-B cells. Phosphorylation of transcription factors Elk1 and CREB was mediated by Erk, and a dominant-negative mutation in the Erk-mediated phosphorylation sites of Elk1 or CREB suppressed pre-BCR-mediated cell expansion as well as expression of genes including Myc, which is involved in the cell-cycle progression. Together, our results identify a crucial role for Erk kinases in regulating B cell development by initiating transcriptional regulatory network and thereby pre-BCR-mediated cell expansion.","3308":"Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, and potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction. Immunoglobulin E (IgE), mast cells, and histamine have long been associated with anaphylaxis, but an alternative pathway mediated by IgG has been suggested to be more important in the elicitation of anaphylaxis. Here, we showed that basophils, the least common blood cells, were dispensable for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis but played a critical role in IgG-mediated, passive and active systemic anaphylaxis in mice. In vivo depletion of basophils but not macrophages, neutrophils, or NK cells ameliorated IgG-mediated passive anaphylaxis and rescued mice from death in active anaphylaxis. Upon capture of IgG-allergen complexes, basophils released platelet-activating factor (PAF), leading to increased vascular permeability. These results highlight a pivotal role for basophils in vivo and contrast two major, distinct pathways leading to allergen-induced systemic anaphylaxis: one mediated by basophils, IgG, and PAF and the other \"classical\" pathway mediated by mast cells, IgE, and histamine.","3309":"The development of distinct dendritic cell (DC) subsets is regulated by cytokines. The ligand for the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3L) is necessary for plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC (cDC) maturation. The cytokine GM-CSF inhibits Flt3L-driven pDC production while promoting cDC growth. We show that GM-CSF selectively utilized its signal transducer STAT5 to block Flt3L-dependent pDC development from the lineage-negative, Flt3+ (lin- Flt3+) bone-marrow subset. The signaling molecule STAT3, by contrast, was necessary for expansion of DC progenitors but not pDC maturation. In vivo, STAT5 suppressed pDC formation during repopulation of the DC compartment after bone-marrow ablation. GM-CSF-dependent STAT5 signaling rapidly extinguished pDC-related gene expression in lin- Flt3+ progenitors. Inspection of the Irf8 promoter revealed that STAT5 was recruited during GM-CSF-mediated suppression, indicating that STAT5 directly inhibited transcription of this critical pDC gene. Our results therefore show that GM-CSF controls the production of pDCs by employing STAT5 to suppress IRF8 and the pDC transcriptional network in lin- Flt3+ progenitors.","3310":"For several days after antigenic stimulation, human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones exhibit a decrease in their effector activity and in their binding to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptide tetramers. We observed that, when in this state, CTLs lose the colocalization of the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD8. Effector function and TCR-CD8 colocalization were restored with galectin disaccharide ligands, suggesting that the binding of TCR to galectin plays a role in the distancing of TCR from CD8. These findings appear to be applicable in vivo, as TCR was observed to be distant from CD8 on human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which were anergic. These lymphocytes recovered effector functions and TCR-CD8 colocalization after ex vivo treatment with galectin disaccharide ligands. The separation of TCR and CD8 molecules could be one major mechanism of anergy in tumors and other chronic stimulation conditions.","3311":"Muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a product of bacterial cell-wall peptidoglycan, activates innate immune cells by stimulating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) -dependent activation of the transcription factor NFkappaB and transcription of proinflammatory genes. A20 is a ubiquitin-modifying enzyme that restricts tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and Toll-like receptor (TLR) -induced signals. We now show that MDP induces ubiquitylation of receptor- interacting protein 2 (RIP2) in primary macrophages. A20-deficient cells exhibit dramatically amplified responses to MDP, including increased RIP2 ubiquitylation, prolonged NFkappaB signaling, and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, in vivo responses to MDP are exaggerated in A20-deficient mice and in chimeric mice bearing A20-deficient hematopoietic cells. These exaggerated responses occur independently of the TLR adaptors MyD88 and TRIF as well as TNF signals. These findings indicate that A20 directly restricts NOD2 induced signals in vitro and in vivo, and provide new insights into how these signals are physiologically restricted.","3312":"The adaptor protein SLP76 directs signaling downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) and is essential for thymocyte development. SLP76 contains three N-terminal tyrosines that are critical for its function. To define the role of these residues in thymocyte development, we generated two lines of \"knock-in\" mice, one expressing a mutation in tyrosine 145 (Y145F) and a second harboring two point mutations at tyrosines 112 and 128 (Y112-128F). We show here that although thymocyte development requires both Y145- and Y112-128-generated signals, selection was more dependent upon Y145. Although several proximal TCR signaling events were defective in both mutant mice, phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Vav1, and activation of Itk-dependent pathways were differentially affected by mutations at Y112-128 and Y145, respectively. Analysis of mice expressing one Y145F and one Y112-128F allele revealed that these mutants could complement one another in trans, demonstrating cooperativity between two or more SLP76 molecules. Thus, the N-terminal tyrosines of SLP76 are required for thymocyte selection but can function on separate molecules to support TCR signaling.","3313":"The transcription factor ThPOK is necessary and sufficient to trigger adoption of the CD4 lymphocyte fate. Here we investigate the regulation of ThPOK expression and its subsequent control of CD4+ T cell commitment. Treatment of immature thymocytes with anti-TCR (T cell receptor) showed that TCR signals were important in ThPOK induction and that the CD4+8lo stage was the likely target of the inductive TCR signal. We identified at the ThPOK locus a key distal regulatory element (DRE) that mediated its differential expression in class I- versus II-restricted CD4+8lo thymocytes. The DRE was both necessary for suppression of ThPOK expression in class I-restricted thymocytes and sufficient for its induction in class II-restricted thymocytes. Mutagenesis analysis defined an essential 80bp core DRE sequence and its potential regulatory motifs. We propose a silencer-dependent model of lineage choice, whereby inactivation of the DRE silencer by a strong TCR signal leads to CD4 commitment, whereas continued silencer activity leads to CD8 commitment.","3314":"CpG motifs within phosphorothioate (PS)-modified DNA drive Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation, but the rules governing recognition of natural phosphodiester (PD) DNA are less understood. Here, we showed that the sugar backbone determined DNA recognition by TLR9. Homopolymeric, base-free PD 2' deoxyribose acted as a basal TLR9 agonist as it bound to and activated TLR9. This effect was enhanced by DNA bases, even short of CpG motifs. In contrast, PS-modified 2' deoxyribose homopolymers acted as TLR9 and TLR7 antagonists. They displayed high affinity to both TLRs and did not activate on their own, but they competitively inhibited ligand-TLR interaction and activation. Although addition of random DNA bases to the PS 2' deoxyribose backbone did not alter these effects, CpG motifs transformed TLR9-inhibitory to robust TLR9-stimulatory activity. Our results identified the PD 2' deoxyribose backbone as an important determinant of TLR9 activation by natural DNA, restrict CpG-motif dependency of TLR9 activation to synthetic PS-modified ligands, and define PS-modified 2' deoxyribose as a prime effector of TLR9 and TLR7 inhibition.","3315":"Although there are multiple structures showing how alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) specifically recognize antigenic peptides bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (pMHC-I and pMHC-II), we have little data on how TCRs interact with lipid-based antigens presented by members of the CD1 family. Here, we review recent findings in the field of TCR recognition, including TCR-pMHC complexes and the structure of a TCR in complex with CD1d-glycolipid. Collectively, these studies have revealed the versatility of the TCR in recognizing the distinct yet evolutionarily related proteinaceous and lipid-presenting molecules of the immune system.","3316":"The interaction between dendritic cells and regulatory T cells is critical for the maintenance of self-tolerance. In this issue of Immunity, Sarris et al. (2008) find that Neuropilin-1 contributes to the prolonged interaction of regulatory T cells with dendritic cells.","3317":"In this issue, Gardham et al.

Previous studies suggested that signaling required unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, but in this issue of Immunity, Haas et al. (2008) challenge this view, showing that DNA can activate TLR9 in a sequence-independent manner.","3321":"Amid the flurry of grant writing and experimentation, statistical analysis sometimes gets less attention than it requires. Here, we describe fully the considerations that should go into the employment of the statistical two-sample t test.","3322":"","3323":"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is characterized by a deficiency of mature neutrophils, leading to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Although mutations in Elastase-2, neutrophil (ELA2) predominate in human SCN, mutation of Ela2 in mice does not recapitulate SCN. The growth factor independent-1 (GFI1) transcription factor regulates ELA2. Mutations in GFI1 are associated with human SCN, and genetic deletion of Gfi1 results in murine neutropenia. We examined whether human SCN-associated GFI1N382S mutant proteins are causal in SCN and found that GFI1 functions as a rate-limiting granulopoietic molecular switch. The N382S mutation inhibited GFI1 DNA binding and resulted in a dominant-negative block to murine granulopoiesis. Moreover, Gfi1N382S selectively derepressed the monopoietic cytokine CSF1 and its receptor. Gfi1N382S-expressing Csf1-\/- cells formed neutrophils. These results reveal a common transcriptional program that underlies both human and murine myelopoiesis, and that is central to the pathogenesis of SCN associated with mutations in GFI1. This shared transcriptional pathway may provide new avenues for understanding SCN caused by mutations in other genes and for clinical intervention into human neutropenias.","3324":"The interaction of T cells with dendritic cells (DCs) determines whether an immune response is launched or not. Recognition of antigen leads to formation of immunological synapses at the interface between the cells. The length of interaction is likely to determine the functional outcome, because it limits the number of MHC class II-peptide complexes that can be recruited into the synapse. Here, we show that regulatory T (Treg) cells and naive helper T (Th) cells interact differently with DCs in the absence of proinflammatory stimuli. Although differences in T cell receptor repertoire might contribute, Foxp3-induced phenotypic differences play a major role. We found that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), which is expressed by most Treg cells but not naive Th cells, promoted prolonged interactions with immature DCs (iDCs), resulting in higher sensitivity to limiting amounts of antigen. This is likely to give Treg cells an advantage over naive Th cells, with the same specificity leading to a \"default\" suppression of immune responses in the absence of \"danger signals.\"","3325":"Costimulatory signals are critical to T cell activation, but how their effects are mediated remains incompletely characterized. Here, we demonstrate that locally produced C5a and C3a anaphylatoxins interacting with their G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), C5aR and C3aR, on APCs and T cells both upstream and downstream of CD28 and CD40L signaling are integrally involved in T cell proliferation and differentiation. Disabling these interactions reduced MHC class II and costimulatory-molecule expression and dramatically diminished T cell responses. Importantly, impaired T cell activation by Cd80-\/-Cd86-\/- and Cd40-\/- APCs was reconstituted by added C5a or C3a. C5aR and C3aR mediated their effects via PI-3 kinase-gamma-dependent AKT phosphorylation, providing a link between GPCR signaling, CD28 costimulation, and T cell survival. These local paracrine and autocrine interactions thus operate constitutively in naive T cells to maintain viability, and their amplification by cognate APC partners thus is critical to T cell costimulation.","3326":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 3 (TRAF2 and TRAF3) were shown to function in a cooperative and nonredundant manner to suppress nuclear factor-kappaB2 (NF-kappaB2) activation, gene expression, and survival in mature B cells. In the absence of this suppressive activity, B cells developed independently of the obligatory B cell survival factor, BAFF (B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family). However, deletion of either TRAF2 or TRAF3 from the T cell lineage did not promote T cell survival, despite causing extensive NF-kappaB2 activation. This constitutive, lineage-specific suppression of B cell survival by TRAF2 and TRAF3 determines the requirement for BAFF to sustain B cell development in vivo. Binding of BAFF to BAFF receptor reversed TRAF2-TRAF3-mediated suppression of B cell survival by triggering the depletion of TRAF3 protein. This process was TRAF2 dependent, revealing dual roles for TRAF2 in regulating B cell homeostasis.","3327":"To test whether highly crossreactive alphabeta T cell receptors (TCRs) produced during limited negative selection best illustrate evolutionarily conserved interactions between TCR and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, we solved the structures of three TCRs bound to the same MHC II peptide (IAb-3K). The TCRs had similar affinities for IAb-3K but varied from noncrossreactive to extremely crossreactive with other peptides and MHCs. Crossreactivity correlated with a shrinking, increasingly hydrophobic TCR-ligand interface, involving fewer TCR amino acids. A few CDR1 and CDR2 amino acids dominated the most crossreactive TCR interface with MHC, including Vbeta8 48Y and 54E and Valpha4 29Y, arranged to impose the familiar diagonal orientation of TCR on MHC. These interactions contribute to MHC binding by other TCRs using related V regions, but not usually so dominantly. These data show that crossreactive TCRs can spotlight the evolutionarily conserved features of TCR-MHC interactions and that these interactions impose the diagonal docking of TCRs on MHC.","3328":"Productive rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus triggers a major developmental checkpoint that promotes limited clonal expansion of pre-B cells, thereby culminating in cell-cycle arrest and rearrangement of light-chain loci. By using Irf4-\/-Irf8-\/- pre-B cells, we demonstrated that two pathways converge to synergistically drive light-chain rearrangement, but not simply as a consequence of cell-cycle exit. One pathway was directly dependent on transcription factor IRF-4, whose expression was elevated by pre-B cell receptor signaling. IRF-4 targeted the immunoglobulin 3'Ekappa and Elambda enhancers and positioned a kappa allele away from pericentromeric heterochromatin. The other pathway was triggered by attenuation of IL-7 signaling and activated the iEkappa enhancer via binding of the transcription factor E2A. IRF-4 also regulated expression of chemokine receptor Cxcr4 and promoted migration of pre-B cells in response to the chemokine ligand CXCL12. We propose that IRF-4 coordinates the two pathways regulating light-chain recombination by positioning pre-B cells away from IL-7-expressing stromal cells.","3329":"The initiation of cytotoxic immune responses requires the direct interaction between naive CD8+ T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs). Multiphoton imaging in intact lymph nodes (LNs) showed that during priming, naive T cells and DCs establish sequentially brief (i.e., minutes) and long (hours) antigen-specific contacts. We show here that the expression of the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by mature DCs is critical for long-lasting contacts with CD8+ T cells but dispensable for short-lived antigen-specific interactions. Serial brief DC-T cell contacts induced early CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the first few days after immunization. ICAM-1-deficient mature DCs, however, failed to induce fully effective priming, because CD8+ T cells produced reduced amounts of interferon gamma and were clonally depleted after 2 weeks. In addition, Icam1(-\/-) mice failed to respond to rechallenge. We conclude that ICAM-1-dependent long-lasting interactions between mature DCs and naive CD8+ T cells determine the survival of activated CD8+ T cells and the establishment of effective memory.","3330":"Thymocytes undergo massive proliferation before T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, ensuring the diversification of the TCR repertoire. Because activated cells are more susceptible to damage, cell-death restraint as well as promotion of cell-cycle progression is considered important for adequate cell growth. Although the molecular mechanism of pre-TCR-induced proliferation has been examined, the mechanisms of protection against cell death during the proliferation phase remain unknown. Here we show that the survival of activated pre-T cells induced by pre-TCR signaling required the Polycomb group (PcG) gene product Bmi-1-mediated repression of Cdkn2A, and that p19Arf expression resulted in thymocyte cell death and inhibited the transition from CD4(-)CD8(-) (DN) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) stage upstream of the transcriptional factor p53 pathway. The expression of Cdkn2A (the gene encoding p19Arf) in immature thymocytes was directly regulated by PcG complex containing Bmi-1 and M33 through the maintenance of local trimethylated histone H3K27. Our results indicate that this epigenetic regulation critically contributes to the survival of the activated pre-T cells, thereby supporting their proliferation during the DN-DP transition.","3331":"Throughout most of adult life, lymphocyte number remains constant because of a balance of proliferation and apoptosis. Mutation of Bim, a proapoptotic protein in the intrinsic death pathway, or Fas, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily member of the extrinsic pathway, results in late-onset autoimmunity and increased antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses during viral infection. However, virus-specific immune responses eventually return to amounts comparable to those for nonmutant mice. Here, we show that loss of both Bim and Fas function resulted in a synergistic disruption of lymphoid homeostasis, rapid-onset autoimmunity, and organ-specific blocks on contraction of antiviral immune responses. When lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific immune responses were quantitated, double-mutant mice had 100-fold more antigen-specific memory CD8(+) T cells in their lymph nodes than wild-type mice. Our results demonstrate that multiple death pathways function concurrently to prevent autoimmunity and downsize T cell responses.","3332":"Alterations in the stoichiometric balance between members of Bcl-2 and Fas apoptotic pathway could lead to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed that patients with SLE displayed increased expression in antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 and Fas apoptotic pathways in isolated mononuclear cells. Further, mice (Bcl2l11(-\/-)Fas(lpr\/lpr)) lacking the Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic member, Bim (Bcl2l11(-\/-)) and and with an lpr mutation in the gene encoding Fas (Fas(lpr\/lpr)) developed severe SLE-like disease by 16 weeks of age unlike Bcl2l11(-\/-) or Fas(lpr\/lpr) mice. Bcl2l11(-\/-)Fas(lpr\/lpr) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) were markedly activated, and their numbers were increased in lymphoid tissues and in kidneys, yet numerous TUNEL-positive cells were observed in glomeruli of Bcl2l11(-\/-)Fas(lpr\/lpr) mice. These data demonstrate that dysregulation of the Bcl-2 or Fas pathways can alter the function of APCs, thereby leading to SLE pathogenesis.","3333":"Apoptotic death of T lymphocytes is critical for shutdown of immune responses and hemopoietic cell homeostasis. Both death receptor (Fas) activation and mitochondrial apoptosis triggered by the BH3-only protein Bim have been implicated in the killing of antigen-stimulated T cells. We examined mice lacking the gene encoding Bim (Bcl2l11) and with the inactivating lpr mutation in the gene encoding Fas (Fas), designated Bcl2l11(-\/-)Fas(lpr\/lpr) mice. Shutdown of an acute T cell response to herpes simplex virus involved only Bim with no contribution by Fas, whereas both pathways synergized in killing antigen-stimulated T cells in chronic infection with murine gamma-herpesvirus. Bcl2l11(-\/-)Fas(lpr\/lpr) mice developed remarkably enhanced and accelerated fatal lymphadenopathy and autoimmunity compared to mice lacking only one of these apoptosis inducers. These results identify critical overlapping roles for Fas and Bim in T cell death in immune response shutdown and prevention of immunopathology and thereby resolve a long-standing controversy.","3334":"Immunodominant and public T cell receptor (TCR) usage is relatively common in many viral diseases yet surprising in the context of the large naive TCR repertoire. We examined the highly conserved Vbeta17:Valpha10.2 JM22 T cell response to the influenza matrix peptide (58-66)-HLA-A*0201 (HLA-A2-flu) through extensive kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analyses. We found several conformational adjustments that accompany JM22-HLA-A2-flu binding and identified a binding \"hotspot\" within the Vbeta domain of the TCR. Within this hotspot, key germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loop residues and a crucial but commonly coded residue in the hypervariable region of CDR3 provide the basis for the substantial bias in the selection of the germline-encoded Vbeta17 domain. The chances of having a substantial number of T cells in the naive repertoire that have HLA-A2-flu-specific Vbeta17 receptors may consequently be relatively high, thus explaining the immunodominant usage of this clonotype.","3335":null,"3336":"What is happening inside the tuberculous granuloma?

Perinodal adipose tissue may provide not only a specific lipid resource but also fatty acids, dendritic cells, and soluble mediators that modulate local immunity.","3341":"The recombining sequence (RS) of mouse and its human equivalent, the immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa deleting element (IGKDE), are sequences found at the 3' end of the Ig kappa locus (Igk) that rearrange to inactivate Igk in developing B cells. RS recombination correlates with Ig lambda (Iglambda) light (L) chain expression and likely plays a role in receptor editing by eliminating Igk genes encoding autoantibodies. A mouse strain was generated in which the recombination signal of RS was removed, blocking RS-mediated Igk inactivation. In RS mutant mice, receptor editing and self-tolerance were impaired, in some cases leading to autoantibody formation. Surprisingly, mutant mice also made fewer B cells expressing lambda chain, whereas lambda versus kappa isotype exclusion was only modestly affected. These results provide insight into the mechanism of L chain isotype exclusion and indicate that RS has a physiological role in promoting the formation of lambda L chain-expressing B cells.","3342":"The cytosolic sensors Nod1 and Nod2 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) activate defense signaling pathways in response to microbial stimuli. However, the role of Nod1 and Nod2 and their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to Nod1 and Nod2 stimulation. Furthermore, Nod1- and Nod2-mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on Nod1 and Nod2 and their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L. monocytogenes was critically dependent on Nod1 and Nod2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, Nod1 and Nod2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation.","3343":"Granulomas play a key role in host protection against mycobacterial pathogens, with their breakdown contributing to exacerbated disease. To better understand the initiation and maintenance of these structures, we employed both high-resolution multiplex static imaging and intravital multiphoton microscopy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG-induced liver granulomas. We found that Kupffer cells directly capture blood-borne bacteria and subsequently nucleate formation of a nascent granuloma by recruiting both uninfected liver-resident macrophages and blood-derived monocytes. Within the mature granuloma, these myeloid cell populations formed a relatively immobile cellular matrix that interacted with a highly dynamic effector T cell population. The efficient recruitment of these T cells was highly dependent on TNF-alpha-derived signals, which also maintained the granuloma structure through preferential effects on uninfected macrophage populations. By characterizing the migration of both innate and adaptive immune cells throughout the process of granuloma development, these studies provide a new perspective on the cellular events involved in mycobacterial containment and escape.","3344":"The receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) CD148 is thought to have an inhibitory function in signaling and proliferation in nonhematopoietic cells. However, its role in the immune system has not been thoroughly studied. Our analysis of CD148 loss-of-function mice showed that CD148 has a positive regulatory function in B cells and macrophages, similar to the role of CD45 as a positive regulator of Src family kinases (SFKs). Analysis of CD148 and CD45 doubly deficient B cells and macrophages revealed hyperphosphorylation of the C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine of SFKs accompanied by substantial alterations in B and myeloid lineage development and defective immunoreceptor signaling. Because these findings suggest the C-terminal tyrosine of SFKs is a common substrate for both CD148 and CD45 phosphatases and imply a level of redundancy not previously appreciated, a reassessment of the function of CD45 in the B and myeloid lineages based on prior data from the CD45-deficient mouse is warranted.","3345":"Appropriate development of regulatory T (Treg) cells is necessary to prevent autoimmunity. Neonatal mice, unlike adults, lack factors required for Treg cell development. It is unclear what these missing factors are. However, signals emanating from the T cell receptor (TCR), the costimulatory receptor CD28, and the family of gammac-dependent cytokine receptors are required for Treg cell development. Herein we demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active Stat5b transgene (Stat5b-CA) allowed for Treg cell development in neonatal mice and restored Treg cell numbers in Cd28(-\/-) mice. Sequence analysis of TCR genes in Stat5b-CA Treg cells indicated that ectopic STAT5 activation resulted in a TCR repertoire that more closely resembled that of naive T cells. Using MHCII tetramers to identify antigen-specific T cells, we showed that STAT5 signals diverted thymocytes normally destined to become naive T cells into the Treg cell lineage. Our data support a two-step model of Treg cell differentiation in which TCR and CD28 signals induce cytokine responsiveness and STAT5-inducing cytokines then complete the program of Treg cell differentiation.","3346":"Recognition of self-antigens is required for regulatory T (Treg) cells to exert dominant tolerance. However, the mechanism by which self-reactive thymocytes are diverted into the Treg cell subset is unclear. To address this question, we looked for the immediate precursors to Treg cells within Foxp3(-)CD4+CD8(-) thymocytes. By using intrathymic transfer, we found that the CD25hi subset is highly enriched in Treg cell precursors. This was supported by tracking of thymocyte development via analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in a TCR-beta transgenic model. These Treg cell precursors exist at a developmental stage where they are poised to express Foxp3 without further TCR engagement, requiring only stimulation by interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15. Thus, we propose that the selection of self-reactive thymocytes into the Treg cell subset occurs via an instructive rather than stochastic-selective model whereby TCR signals result in the expression of proximal IL-2 signaling components facilitating cytokine-mediated induction of Foxp3.","3347":"Here, we show that a lupus-suppressing locus is caused by a nonsense mutation of the filamentous actin-inhibiting Coronin-1A gene. This mutation was associated with developmental and functional alterations in T cells including reduced migration, survival, activation, and Ca2+ flux. T-dependent humoral responses were impaired, but no intrinsic B cell defects were detected. By transfer of T cells, it was shown that suppression of autoimmunity could be accounted for by the presence of the Coro1a(Lmb3) mutation in T cells. Our results demonstrate that Coronin-1A is required for the development of systemic lupus and identify actin-cytoskeleton regulatory proteins as potential targets for modulating autoimmune diseases.","3348":"B cells are essential for the development and pathogenesis of both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Autoreactive B cells are typically thought of as sources of autoantibody, but their most important pathogenetic roles may be to present autoantigens to T cells and to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. A rate-limiting step in the genesis of autoimmunity then is the activation of autoreactive B cells. Here, mechanisms are discussed that normally prevent such activation and how they break down during disease. Integrating classic work with recent insights, emphasis is placed on efforts to pinpoint the precursor cells for autoantibody-secreting cells and the unique stimuli and pathways by which they are activated.","3349":"The lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate has been identified as a key exit signal for lymph nodes.

(2007) to be a surprising disease-susceptibility gene that contributes to the spontaneous systemic autoimmunity in the MRL mouse, a model of systemic lupus erythematosus.","3353":"T cells that produce IL-17 (T helper 17 cells) are implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. In this issue of Immunity, Yang et al. (2008) report that the closely related orphan nuclear receptors ROR alpha and ROR gamma t work together to regulate T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation.","3354":"C57BL\/6 genetically modified mouse models are the accepted gold standard in biological studies. However, an increasing failure of translating the findings to human (patho)physiology casts doubt on using a single strain to address many questions.","3355":"Although rarely elicited during natural human infection, the most broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) against diverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 strains target the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of viral gp41. To gain insight into MPER antigenicity, immunogenicity, and viral function, we studied its structure in the lipid environment by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. The analyses revealed a tilted N-terminal alpha helix (aa 664-672) connected via a short hinge to a flat C-terminal helical segment (675-683). This metastable L-shaped structure is immersed in viral membrane and, therefore, less accessible to immune attack. Nonetheless, the 4E10 BNAb extracts buried W672 and F673 after initial encounter with the surface-embedded MPER. The data suggest how BNAbs may perturb tryptophan residue-associated viral fusion involving the mobile N-terminal MPER segment and, given conservation of MPER sequences in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV, have important implications for structure-guided vaccine design.","3356":"Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) during antigen presentation initiates a coordinated action of a large number of signaling proteins and ion channels. AHNAK1 is a scaffold protein, highly expressed by CD4+ T cells, and is a critical component for calcium signaling. We showed that AHNAK1-deficient mice were highly susceptible to Leishmania major infection. AHNAK1-deficient CD4+ T cells responded poorly to TCR stimulation in vitro with low proliferation and low Interleukin-2 production. Furthermore, AHNAK1 deficiency resulted in a reduced calcium influx upon TCR crosslinking and subsequent poor activation of the transcription factor NFAT. AHNAK1 was required for plasma membrane expression of L-type calcium channels alpha 1S (Cav1.1), probably through its interaction with the beta regulatory subunit. Thus, AHNAK1 plays an essential role in T cell Ca2+ signaling through Cav1 channels, triggered via TCR activation; therefore, AHNAK1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","3357":"B lymphocytes spread and extend membrane processes when searching for antigens and form immune synapses upon contacting cells that display antigens on their surface. Although these dynamic morphological changes facilitate B cell activation, the signaling pathways underlying these processes are not fully understood. We found that activation of the Rap GTPases was essential for these changes in B cell morphology. Rap activation was important for B cell receptor (BCR)- and lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-induced spreading, for BCR-induced immune-synapse formation, and for particulate BCR ligands to induce localized F-actin assembly and membrane-process extension. Rap activation and F-actin assembly were also required for optimal BCR signaling in response to particulate antigens but not soluble antigens. Thus by controlling B cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization, Rap might play a key role in the activation of B cells by particulate and cell-associated antigens.","3358":"The integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is important in the promotion of B cell adhesion, thereby facilitating immunological synapse (IS) formation and B cell activation. Despite this significance, the associated signaling mechanisms regulating LFA-1 activation remain elusive. Here, we show that both isoforms of the small GTPase Rac expressed by primary B cells, Rac1 and Rac2, were activated rapidly downstream of Src-family kinases, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors Vav1 and Vav2, and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) after BCR engagement. We identify Rac2, but not Rac1, as critical for B cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and IS formation. Furthermore, B cells expressing constitutively active Rac2 are highly adhesive. We observe that Rac2-deficient B cells exhibit lower amounts of Rap1-GTP and severe actin polymerization defects, identifying a potential mechanism underlying their behavior. We postulate that this critical role for Rac2 in mediating B cell adhesion and IS formation might apply in all lymphocytes.","3359":"T cell functional differentiation is mediated by lineage-specific transcription factors. T helper 17 (Th17) has been recently identified as a distinct Th lineage mediating tissue inflammation. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR gamma) was shown to regulate Th17 differentiation; ROR gamma deficiency, however, did not completely abolish Th17 cytokine expression. Here, we report Th17 cells highly expressed another related nuclear receptor, ROR alpha, induced by transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Overexpression of ROR alpha promoted Th17 differentiation, possibly through the conserved noncoding sequence 2 in Il17-Il17f locus. ROR alpha deficiency resulted in reduced IL-17 expression in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, ROR alpha and ROR gamma coexpression synergistically led to greater Th17 differentiation. Double deficiencies in ROR alpha and ROR gamma globally impaired Th17 generation and completely protected mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Therefore, Th17 differentiation is directed by two lineage-specific nuclear receptors, ROR alpha and ROR gamma.","3360":"The mechanism by which sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) acts to promote lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs is not defined. Here, we showed that CCR7-deficient T cells left lymph nodes more rapidly than wild-type cells did, whereas CCR7-overexpressing cells were retained for longer. After treatment with FTY720, an agonist that causes downmodulation of lymphocyte S1P1, CCR7-deficient T cells were less effectively retained than wild-type T cells. Moreover, treatment with pertussis toxin to inactivate signaling via G alpha i-protein-coupled receptors restored egress competence to S1P1-deficient lymphocytes. We also found that T cell accumulation in lymph node cortical sinusoids required intrinsic S1P1 expression and was antagonized by CCR7. These findings suggest a model where S1P1 acts in the lymphocyte to promote lymph node egress by overcoming retention signals mediated by CCR7 and additional G alpha i-coupled receptors. Furthermore, by simultaneously upregulating S1P1 and downregulating CCR7, T cells that have divided multiple times switch to a state favoring egress over retention.","3361":"Production of interleukin (IL)-10, a major immunoregulatory cytokine, by phagocytes during clearance of apoptotic cells is critical to ensuring cellular homeostasis and suppression of autoimmunity. Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms in this fundamental process. We report that IL-10 production stimulated by apoptotic cells was regulated at the point of transcription in a manner dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, partially on the scavenger receptor CD36, and required cell-cell contact but not phagocytosis. By using a reporter assay, we mapped the apoptotic-cell-response element (ACRE) in the human IL10 promoter and provide biochemical and physiological evidence that ACRE mediates the transcriptional activation of IL10 by pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-1b and another Hox cofactor Pbx-regulating protein 1 in response to apoptotic cells. This study establishes a role of two developmentally critical factors (Pbx1 and Prep-1) in the regulation of homeostasis in the immune system.","3362":"Null mutations that cripple T cell receptor (TCR) signaling explain rare primary immunodeficiencies, but it is not understood why more common polymorphisms that lead to subtle TCR signaling defects are paradoxically associated with autoimmunity. Here we analyzed how a series of Zap70 variants with step-wise decreases in TCR signaling impacted upon opposing TCR functions of immunity and tolerance. One Zap70 variant, murdock, moderately decreased TCR signaling and thymic selection without compromising immunological tolerance, whereas a more severe Zap70 defect, mrtless, abolished thymic-positive selection and led to immunodeficiency. Signaling capacities between these two thresholds disproportionately compromised negative selection and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell formation, creating a cellular imbalance between immunogenic and tolerogenic functions that resulted in the excessive production of autoantibodies and immunoglobulin E (IgE). The pleiotropic functions of ZAP-70 and their differential response to graded variation provide a paradigm for understanding the complex outcomes of human genetic variation.","3363":"Allelic exclusion of antigen-receptor genes is ensured primarily by monoallelic locus activation upon rearrangement and subsequently by feedback inhibition of continued rearrangement. Here, we demonstrated that the basic helix-loop-helix protein, E47, promoted T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) gene rearrangement by directly binding to target gene segments to increase chromatin accessibility in a dosage-sensitive manner. Feedback signaling abrogated E47 binding, leading to a decline in accessibility. Conversely, enforced expression of E47 induced TCRbeta gene rearrangement by antagonizing feedback inhibition. Thus, the abundance of E47 is rate limiting in locus activation, and feedback signaling downregulates E47 activity to ensure allelic exclusion.","3364":"The T cell receptor (TCR) is required for positive selection and the subsequent transition from the CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) to the CD4(+) or CD8(+) single-positive (SP) stage of alphabeta T cell development. The molecular mechanism that maintains DP fate prior to the acquisition of a functional TCR is not clear. We have shown here that the structurally and functionally related transcription factors HEB and E2A work together to maintain DP fate and to control the DP to SP transition. Simultaneous deletion of HEB and E2A in DP thymocytes was sufficient for DP to SP transition independent of TCR. Loss of HEB and E2A allowed DP cells to bypass the requirement for TCR-mediated positive selection, downregulate DP-associated genes, and upregulate SP-specific genes. These results identify HEB and E2A as the gatekeepers that maintain cells at the DP stage of development until a functional alphabetaTCR is produced.","3365":"Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) provide invaluable insight into immune system, notably in vivo immune responses to microorganisms as based on the variable vulnerability to pathogens and opportunistic agents. PID are also very informative in defining key checkpoints controlling immunity to self. Despite a Mendelian inheritance of most PID, mutations of a given gene can lead to a vast array of phenotypes as a function of the type of mutations, environmental factors, the occurrence of additional somatic mutations, or regulatory factors, which add considerable but hitherto underestimated complexity. Understanding the molecular pathophysiology of PID is not only contributing to a better knowledge of the immune system but may also favor new therapeutic approaches.","3366":"Specific immunity is a layer of defense exquisitely broad, terrifyingly thin, and yet remarkably durable on challenge.

(2007) report (in this issue of Immunity) that B cells require microRNA (miR)-155 for normal production of isotype-switched, high-affinity antibodies and for a memory response. They identify transcriptional regulator Pu.1 as a functionally important target of miR-155 in B cells.","3370":"Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) represents a first line of defense against mucosal pathogens by limiting their entrance. By using different strains of Salmonella typhimurium that target the two mechanisms of bacterial entry (microfold cell [M cell]- or dendritic cell-mediated), we demonstrated here that the distribution of bacteria after oral infection directed the type of induced immune response. M cell-penetrating invasive, but not noninvasive, S. typhimurium was found in large numbers in Peyer's patches (PPs), leading to the activation of immune cells and the release of fecal IgA. In contrast, both strains of bacteria were equally capable of reaching the mesenteric lymph node and the spleen and inducing IgG responses. These data suggest that PPs are absolutely required for the initiation of an IgA response to Salmonella, whereas they are dispensable for a systemic response. This compartmentalization could allow the fast generation of both mucosal and systemic acquired immunity to pathogens.","3371":"The CD94-NKG2 receptor family that regulates NK and T cells is unique among the lectin-like receptors encoded within the natural killer cell complex. The function of the CD94-NKG2 receptors is dictated by the pairing of the invariant CD94 polypeptide with specific NKG2 isoforms to form a family of functionally distinct heterodimeric receptors. However, the structural basis for this selective pairing and how they interact with their ligand, HLA-E, is unknown. We describe the 2.5 A resolution crystal structure of CD94-NKG2A in which the mode of dimerization contrasts with that of other homodimeric NK receptors. Despite structural homology between the CD94 and NKG2A subunits, the dimer interface is asymmetric, thereby providing a structural basis for the preferred heterodimeric assembly. Structure-based sequence comparisons of other CD94-NKG2 family members, combined with extensive mutagenesis studies on HLA-E and CD94-NKG2A, allows a model of the interaction between CD94-NKG2A and HLA-E to be established, in which the invariant CD94 chain plays a more dominant role in interacting with HLA-E in comparison to the variable NKG2 chain.","3372":"The T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) proteins are important regulators of T cell responses. Crystal structures of the murine TIM-4 identified a metal-ion-dependent ligand binding site (MILIBS) in the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of the TIM family. The characteristic CC' loop of the TIM domain and the hydrophobic FG loop shaped a narrow cavity where acidic compounds penetrate and coordinate to a metal ion bound to conserved residues in the TIM proteins. The structure of phosphatidylserine bound to the Ig domain showed that the hydrophilic head penetrates into the MILIBS and coordinates with the metal ion, whereas the aromatic residues on the tip of the FG loop interacted with the fatty acid chains and could insert into the lipid bilayer. Our results also revealed an important role of the MILIBS in the trafficking of TIM-1 to the cell surface.","3373":"Little is known about the structure of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules outside of mammals. Only one class I molecule in the chicken MHC is highly expressed, leading to strong genetic associations with infectious pathogens. Here, we report two structures of the MHC class I molecule BF2*2101 from the B21 haplotype, which is known to confer resistance to Marek's disease caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus. The binding groove has an unusually large central cavity, which confers substantial conformational flexibility to the crucial residue Arg9, allowing remodeling of key peptide-binding sites. The coupled variation of anchor residues from the peptide, utilizing a charge-transfer system unprecedented in MHC molecules, allows peptides with conspicuously different sequences to be bound. This promiscuous binding extends our understanding of ways in which MHC class I molecules can present peptides to the immune system and might explain the resistance of the B21 haplotype to Marek's disease.","3374":"The T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) proteins regulate T cell activation and tolerance. Here we showed that TIM-4 is expressed on human and mouse macrophages and dendritic cells, and both TIM-4 and TIM-1 specifically bound phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells but not any other phospholipid tested. TIM-4(+) peritoneal macrophages, TIM-1(+) kidney cells, and TIM-4- or TIM-1-transfected cells efficiently phagocytosed apoptotic cells, and phagocytosis could be blocked by TIM-4 or TIM-1 monoclonal antibodies. Mutations in the unique cavity of TIM-4 eliminated PS binding and phagocytosis. TIM-4 mAbs that blocked PS binding and phagocytosis mapped to epitopes in this binding cavity. These results show that TIM-4 and TIM-1 are immunologically restricted members of the group of receptors whose recognition of PS is critical for the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells and prevention of autoimmunity.","3375":"Upon first antigen encounter, naive CD8(+) T cells get activated, clonally expand, and can develop into very distinct subsets, such as short-living effector cells or different memory subpopulations. The origin of subset diversification is currently unknown, but qualitative and quantitative differences in early signals received by individual precursor cells have been suggested as a major determinant. We show that transfer of a single antigen-specific naive T cell into a normal recipient mouse allowed recovery of clonally expanded daughter cells upon immunization. With this experimental approach, we conclusively demonstrated that a wide range of diversity could develop out of a single precursor cell, including different types of effector and memory T cells. Interestingly, single-cell-derived subset diversification resembled that of polyclonal T cell responses in the same individual mouse, although differentiation patterns differed between immunization strategies. These data implicate that subset diversification is both shaped and synchronized during the expansion phase.","3376":"microRNA-155 (miR-155) is expressed by cells of the immune system after activation and has been shown to be required for antibody production after vaccination with attenuated Salmonella. Here we show the intrinsic requirement for miR-155 in B cell responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens. B cells lacking miR-155 generated reduced extrafollicular and germinal center responses and failed to produce high-affinity IgG1 antibodies. Gene-expression profiling of activated B cells indicated that miR-155 regulates an array of genes with diverse function, many of which are predicted targets of miR-155. The transcription factor Pu.1 is validated as a direct target of miR155-mediated inhibition. When Pu.1 is overexpressed in wild-type B cells, fewer IgG1 cells are produced, indicating that loss of Pu.1 regulation is a contributing factor to the miR-155-deficient phenotype. Our results implicate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression for establishing the terminal differentiation program of B cells.","3377":"The activity of natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by surface receptors, which direct target cell recognition. NKp30 (Natural Cytotoxicity Receptor 3) induces target cell lysis and is also crucial for the interaction with dendritic cells. So far, the cellular ligands for NKp30 have remained elusive. Here we show that the nuclear factor HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) was released from tumor cells, bound directly to NKp30, and engaged NKp30 on NK cells. BAT3 triggered NKp30-mediated cytotoxicity and was necessary for tumor rejection in a multiple myeloma model. These data identify BAT3 as a cellular ligand for NKp30. We propose a concept for target cell recognition by NK cells beyond \"missing self\" and \"induced self,\" mediated through a tumor cell-derived extracellular factor.","3378":"The chemokine CXCL12 induces prolonged focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and sustained proadhesive responses in progenitor bone-marrow (BM) B cells, but not in mature peripheral B cells. Here we demonstrate that suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) regulated CXCL12-induced FAK phosphorylation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. CXCL12 triggered increased FAK ubiquitination in mature B cells, but not in progenitor B cells. Accordingly, SOCS3 expression was low in progenitor B cells, increased in immature B cells, and highest in mature B cells. SOCS3 overexpression in pro-B cells impaired CXCL12-induced FAK phosphorylation and proadhesive responses. Conversely, SOCS3-deficient mature B cells from Cre(MMTV)Socs3(fl\/fl) mice exhibited prolonged FAK phosphorylation and adhesion to VCAM-1. In contrast to wild-type mice, Cre(MMTV)Socs3(fl\/fl) mice had a 2-fold increase in immature B cells, which were evenly distributed in endosteal and perisinusoidal BM compartments. We propose that the developmental regulation of CXCR4-FAK signaling by SOCS3 is an important mechanism to control the lodgement of B cell precursors in the BM microenvironment.","3379":"Mice deficient in the Tec kinase Itk develop a large population of CD8(+) T cells with properties, including expression of memory markers, rapid production of cytokines, and dependence on Interleukin-15, resembling NKT and other innate T cell lineages. Like NKT cells, these CD8(+) T cells can be selected on hematopoietic cells. We demonstrate that these CD8(+) T cell phenotypes resulted from selection on hematopoietic cells-forcing selection on the thymic stroma reduced the number and innate phenotypes of mature Itk-deficient CD8(+) T cells. We further show that, similar to NKT cells, selection of innate-type CD8(+) T cells in Itk(-\/-) mice required the adaptor SAP. Acquisition of their innate characteristics, however, required CD28. Our results suggest that SAP and Itk reciprocally regulate selection of innate and conventional CD8(+) T cells on hematopoietic cells and thymic epithelium, respectively, whereas CD28 regulates development of innate phenotypes resulting from selection on hematopoietic cells.","3380":"MHC class II-expressing double-positive thymocytes induce progression of CD4(+) T cell development as efficiently as cortical thymic epithelial cells do. Because double-positive thymocytes expressing CD1d select natural killer T (NKT) cells, we investigated whether thymocyte-selected CD4(+) (T-CD4) T cells require the same signaling components as NKT cells. Using bone-marrow chimeras, we found that the signaling molecules SAP, Fyn, and PKCtheta were essential for T-CD4 T cell generation, whereas mutations in the Ly108 receptor, interleukin-15 receptor alpha, or the transcription factor T-bet had a marginal effect. Furthermore, SAP was critical for IL-4 production by T-CD4 T cells, but the PKCtheta deficiency did not alter the ability of T-CD4 T cells to produce cytokines. T-bet was necessary to produce the maximum amount of IFN-gamma for CD4(+) T cells regardless of the selection pathway. Thus, in contrast to epithelial cell-selected CD4(+) T cells, the two distinct lineages of T cells selected by thymocytes--i.e., T-CD4 and NKT cells--both utilize the SAP-Fyn-PKCtheta pathway for their development and function.","3381":"Commitment to the T and natural killer T (NKT) cell lineages is determined during alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated interactions of common precursors with ligand-expressing cells in the thymus. Whereas mainstream thymocyte precursors recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands expressed by stromal cells, NKT cell precursors interact with CD1d ligands expressed by cortical thymocytes. Here, we demonstrated that such homotypic T-T interactions generated \"second signals\" mediated by the cooperative engagement of the homophilic receptors Slamf1 (SLAM) and Slamf6 (Ly108) and the downstream recruitment of the adaptor SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and the Src kinase Fyn, which are essential for the lineage expansion and differentiation of the NKT cell lineage. These receptor interactions were required during TCR engagement and therefore only occurred when selecting ligands were presented by thymocytes rather than epithelial cells, which do not express Slamf6 or Slamf1. Thus, the topography of NKT cell ligand recognition determines the availability of a cosignaling pathway that is essential for NKT cell lineage development.","3382":"Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors mediate important regulatory signals in immune cells, as a result of their exquisite ability to associate with members of the SLAM-associated protein (SAP) family of adaptors. As discussed herein, recent findings show that the SLAM and SAP families carry out pivotal functions in innate-like and conventional lymphocytes. They are critically needed for the development of innate-like lymphocytes such as NKT cells. In addition, they influence several of the functions of conventional lymphocytes, including the ability of CD4(+) T cells to secrete certain cytokines and mediate B cell help; CD8(+) T cell proliferation and cytokine production; NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity; and B cell antibody production. These unique functional properties appear to be facilitated by the ability of SLAM-related receptors to serve as self-ligands during homotypic interactions between immune cells. The importance of the SLAM-SAP pathway in normal immunity is highlighted by the finding that SAP is mutated in humans suffering from the immunodeficiency X-linked lymphoproliferative disease.","3383":"Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) detects viral RNA, but can be activated inappropriately by self-RNA, leading to autoimmunity. Deane et al. (2007) show that Tlr7 gene dosage is directly related to the risk of lupus in a mouse model.","3384":"The regulatory T (Treg) cell transcriptional program is formed of distinct genetic networks that respond to different activators. In this issue of Immunity, Hill et al. (2007) provide insights into the interactions among the different networks and the overall role of Foxp3 in shaping the Treg cell transcriptosome.","3385":"Specificity of T cell receptors (TCRs) to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) might be intrinsic or imposed by thymic selection. Van Laethem et al. (2007) propose that the sequestration of the kinase Lck by coreceptors prevents the selection of non-MHC-reactive TCRs.","3386":"In this Commentary, McKee et al. highlight the properties of extrinsic vaccine adjuvants that must be considered to achieve the most protective immune response, as occurs naturally with many intrinsic pathogen-derived adjuvants.","3387":"The CD4(+)CD25(+) lineage of regulatory T (Treg) cells plays a key role in controlling immune and autoimmune responses and is characterized by a unique transcriptional signature. The transcription factor Foxp3 had been thought to determine the Treg cell lineage, a hypothesis challenged by recent observations. We have performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Treg cell signature in Treg-like cells generated under a number of conditions, with or without Foxp3, to delineate the elements that can be ascribed to T cell activation, interleukin-2, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, or Foxp3 itself. These influences synergized to determine many of the signature's components. Much of the Treg cell signature was not ascribable to Foxp3 because it contained gene clusters that are coregulated with, but not transactivated by, Foxp3. Thus, a higher level of regulation upstream of Foxp3 determines the lineage, distinct from elements downstream of Foxp3 that are essential for its regulatory properties.","3388":"The thymus generates major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted alphabetaT cells that only recognize antigenic ligands in association with MHC or MHC-like molecules. We hypothesized that MHC specificity might be imposed on a broader alphabetaTCR repertoire during thymic selection by CD4 and CD8 coreceptors that bind and effectively sequester the tyrosine kinase Lck, thereby preventing T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by non-MHC ligands that do not engage either coreceptor. This hypothesis predicts that, in coreceptor-deficient mice, alphabeta thymocytes would be signaled by non-MHC ligands to differentiate into alphabetaT cells lacking MHC specificity. We now report that MHC-independent alphabetaT cells were indeed generated in mice deficient in both coreceptors as well as MHC (\"quad-deficient\" mice) and that such mice contained a diverse alphabetaT cell repertoire whose MHC independence was confirmed at the clonal level. We conclude that CD4 and CD8 coreceptors impose MHC specificity on a broader alphabetaTCR repertoire during thymic selection by preventing thymocytes from being signaled by non-MHC ligands.","3389":"Nucleic acid-binding innate immune receptors such as Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 have been implicated in the development of some autoimmune pathologies. The Y chromosome-linked genomic modifier Yaa, which correlates with a duplication of Tlr7 and 16 other genes, exacerbates lupus-like syndromes in several mouse strains. Here we demonstrated that duplication of the Tlr7 gene was the sole requirement for this accelerated autoimmunity, because reduction of Tlr7 gene dosage abolished the Yaa phenotype. Further, we described new transgenic lines that overexpressed TLR7 alone and found that spontaneous autoimmunity developed beyond a 2-fold increase in TLR7 expression. Whereas a modest increase in Tlr7 gene dosage promoted autoreactive lymphocytes with RNA specificities and myeloid cell proliferation, a substantial increase in TLR7 expression caused fatal acute inflammatory pathology and profound dendritic cell dysregulation. These results underscore the importance of tightly regulating expression of TLR7 to prevent spontaneous triggering of harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.","3390":"Molecular mechanisms underlying synapsis of activation-induced deaminase (AID)-targeted S regions during class switch recombination (CSR) are poorly understood. By using chromosome conformation capture techniques, we found that in B cells, the Emicro and 3'Ealpha enhancers were in close spatial proximity, forming a unique chromosomal loop configuration. B cell activation led to recruitment of the germline transcript (GLT) promoters to the Emicro:3'Ealpha complex in a cytokine-dependent fashion. This structure facilitated S-S synapsis because Smicro was proximal to Emicro and a downstream S region was corecruited with the targeted GLT promoter to Emicro:3'Ealpha. We propose that GLT promoter association with the Emicro:3'Ealpha complex creates an architectural scaffolding that promotes S-S synapsis during CSR and that these interactions are stabilized by AID. Thus, the S-S synaptosome is formed as a result of the self-organizing transcription system that regulates GLT expression and may serve to guard against spurious chromosomal translocations.","3391":"Lineage commitment is induced by changes in gene expression dictated by the intimate interaction between transcription factors and chromatin regulators. Here, we revealed the antagonistic interplay between Ikaros and its associate the chromatin remodeler Mi-2beta during T cell development, as exemplified by the regulation of Cd4 expression. Loss of Ikaros or Mi-2beta led to activation or repression, respectively, of the Cd4 locus at inappropriate stages of development. Their combined mutation reverted to normal CD4 expression. In double-negative thymocytes, Ikaros binding to the Cd4 silencer contributed to its repressive activity. In double-positive thymocytes, concomitant binding of Mi-2beta with Ikaros to the Cd4 silencer caused silencer inactivation, thereby allowing for CD4 expression. Mi-2beta facilitated recruitment of histone acetyl transferases to the silencer. This recruitment possibly antagonized Ikaros and associated repressive activities. Thus, concomitant interactions between functionally opposing chromatin-regulating machineries are an important mode of gene regulation during lineage determination.","3392":"The innate immune system comprises several classes of pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-1-like receptors (RLRs). TLRs recognize microbes on the cell surface and in endosomes, whereas NLRs and RLRs detect microbial components in the cytosol. Here we discuss the recent understanding in NLRs. Two NLRs, NOD1 and NOD2, sense the cytosolic presence of the peptidoglycan fragments meso-DAP and muramyl dipeptide, respectively, and drive the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB. A different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly of large protein complexes named inflammasomes. Genetic variations in several NLR members are associated with the development of inflammatory disorders. Further understanding of NLRs should provide new insights into the mechanisms of host defense and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.","3393":"Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells play a role in pathogen defense and autoimmunity. In this issue of Immunity, van Beelen et al. (2007) reveal a pathway that elicits potent IL-17 production from memory T cells through activation of the intracellular receptor NOD2.","3394":"Typically, dendritic cells (DCs) induce peripheral tolerance under steady state but immunity during inflammation or infection. In this issue of Immunity, Jiang et al. (2007) identify disruption of E-cadherin interactions as a unique maturation pathway by which DCs are capable of mediating tolerance.","3395":"Phagocytosis is a complex process that involves multiple cellular functions. In this issue of Immunity, Silva et al. (2007) report that a protein ubiquitylation complex and the proteasome are required for the clearance of apoptotic cells in Drosophila.","3396":"In this issue of Immunity, Liu et al. (2007) show that V(D)J recombinase binds chromatin marked by H3K4 trimethylation. Because this mark associates with active promoters, the finding forges a new link between transcription, epigenetics, and recombinase targeting during lymphocyte development.","3397":"\"I came, I saw, I conquered,\" Julius Caesar proclaimed, highlighting the importance of direct visualization as a winning strategy. Continuing the \"From the Field\" series (see Editorial [2007] 26, 131), Gross et al. summarize how modern molecular imaging techniques can successfully dissect the complexities of immune response in vivo.","3398":"Natural killer (NK) cells eliminate virally infected and tumor cells. Among the receptors regulating NK cell function is 2B4 (CD244), a member of the signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) family that binds CD48. 2B4 is the only heterophilic receptor of the SLAM family, whose other members, e.g., NK-T-B-antigen (NTB-A), are self-ligands. We determined the structure of the complex between the N-terminal domains of mouse 2B4 and CD48, as well as the structures of unbound 2B4 and CD48. The complex displayed an association mode related to, yet distinct from, that of the NTB-A dimer. Binding was accompanied by the rigidification of flexible 2B4 regions containing most of the polymorphic residues across different species and receptor isoforms. We propose a model for 2B4-CD48 interactions that permits the intermixing of SLAM receptors with major histocompatibility complex-specific receptors in the NK cell immune synapse. This analysis revealed the basis for heterophilic recognition within the SLAM family.","3399":"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of innate lymphocytes that recognize lipid antigens in the context of CD1d and mediate potent immune regulatory functions via the rapid production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). We investigated whether diverse Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals in myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) could differentially stimulate iNKT cells. Together with the lipopolysaccharide-detecting receptor TLR4, activation of the nucleic acid sensors TLR7 and TLR9 in DCs were particularly potent in stimulating iNKT cells to produce IFN-gamma, but not IL-4. iNKT cell activation in response to TLR9 stimulation required combined synthesis of type I interferon and de novo production of charged beta-linked glycosphingolipid(s) by DCs. In addition, DCs stimulated via TLR9 activated both iNKT cells and NK cells in vivo and protected mice against B16F10-induced melanoma metastases. These data underline the role of TLR9 in iNKT cell activation and might have relevance to infectious diseases and cancer.","3400":"T cells interact with dendritic cells (DCs) for periods lasting from minutes to hours. However, a causal link between the duration of this interaction and the efficiency of T cell activation has not been established in vivo. Employing intravital two-photon imaging, we manipulated T cell-DC interactions in real time and found that the first T cell-DC encounter often resulted in a long-lived interaction. Moreover, the cessation of T cell receptor-major histocompatibility complex signals promoted cellular dissociation, suggesting that antigen availability on DCs regulates contact duration. Finally, at least 6 hr of in vivo T cell-DC interaction were required for naive CD4(+) T cells to undergo clonal expansion. These results establish the importance of prolonged T cell-DC interactions for efficient CD4(+) T cell activation in vivo.","3401":"Chronic viral infections often result in T cell exhaustion. To determine the molecular signature of exhaustion, we compared the gene-expression profiles of dysfunctional lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CD8(+) T cells from chronic infection to functional LCMV-specific effector and memory CD8(+) T cells generated after acute infection. These data showed that exhausted CD8(+) T cells: (1) overexpressed several inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, (2) had major changes in T cell receptor and cytokine signaling pathways, (3) displayed altered expression of genes involved in chemotaxis, adhesion, and migration, (4) expressed a distinct set of transcription factors, and (5) had profound metabolic and bioenergetic deficiencies. T cell exhaustion was progressive, and gene-expression profiling indicated that T cell exhaustion and anergy were distinct processes. Thus, functional exhaustion is probably due to both active suppression and passive defects in signaling and metabolism. These results provide a framework for designing rational immunotherapies during chronic infections.","3402":"V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) proteins RAG-1 and RAG-2. The ability of antigen-receptor-gene segments to undergo V(D)J recombination is correlated with spatially- and temporally-restricted chromatin modifications. We have found that RAG-2 bound specifically to histone H3 and that this binding was absolutely dependent on dimethylation or trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 or H3K4me3). The interaction required a noncanonical plant homeodomain (PHD) that had previously been described within the noncore region of RAG-2. Binding of the RAG-2 PHD finger to chromatin across the IgH D-J(H)-C locus showed a strong correlation with the distribution of trimethylated histone H3 K4. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan residue in the RAG-2 PHD finger abolished binding to H3K4me3 and greatly impaired recombination of extrachromosomal and endogenous immunoglobulin gene segments. Together, these findings are consistent with the interpretation that recognition of hypermethylated histone H3 K4 promotes efficient V(D)J recombination in vivo.","3403":"Many cells die by apoptosis during animal development. Apoptotic cells are rapidly removed through phagocytosis by their neighbors or by macrophages. To genetically dissect this process, we performed an in vivo screen for genes required for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by Drosophila macrophages and identified pallbearer (pall), which encodes an F box protein. F box proteins generally provide substrate specificity to Skp Cullin F box (SCF) complexes, acting as E3 ligases that target phosphorylated proteins to ubiquitylation and degradation via the 26S proteasome. We showed that Pallbearer functions in an SCF-dependent manner and provided direct evidence of a role for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation in phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses in vivo. This work might further our understanding of the regulation of apoptotic cell engulfment and thus our understanding of innate immunity as a whole.","3404":"The maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) after exposure to microbial products or inflammatory mediators plays a critical role in initiating the immune response. We found that maturation can also occur under steady-state conditions, triggered by alterations in E-cadherin-mediated DC-DC adhesion. Selective disruption of these interactions induced the typical features of DC maturation including the upregulation of costimulatory molecules, MHC class II, and chemokine receptors. These events were triggered at least in part by activation of the beta-catenin pathway. However, unlike maturation induced by microbial products, E-cadherin-stimulated DCs failed to release immunostimulatory cytokines, exhibiting an entirely different transcriptional profile. As a result, E-cadherin-stimulated DCs elicited an entirely different T cell response in vivo, generating T cells with a regulatory as opposed to an effector phenotype. These DCs induced tolerance in vivo and may thus contribute to the elusive steady-state \"tolerogenic DCs.\"","3405":"Granzyme B is important for the ability of NK cells and CD8(+) T cells to kill their targets. However, we showed here that granzyme B-deficient mice clear both allogeneic and syngeneic tumor cell lines more efficiently than do wild-type (WT) mice. To determine whether regulatory T (Treg) cells utilize granzyme B to suppress immune responses against these tumors, we examined the expression and function of granzyme B in Treg cells. Granzyme B was not expressed in naive Treg cells but was highly expressed in 5%-30% of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells in the tumor environment. Adoptive transfer of WT Treg cells, but not granzyme B- or perforin-deficient Treg cells, into granzyme B-deficient mice partially restored susceptibility to tumor growth; Treg cells derived from the tumor environment could induce NK and CD8(+) T cell death in a granzyme B- and perforin-dependent fashion. Granzyme B and perforin are therefore relevant for Treg cell-mediated suppression of tumor clearance in vivo.","3406":"How the development of antibacterial T helper 17 (Th17) cells is selectively promoted by antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) is unclear. We showed that bacteria, but not viruses, primed human DCs to promote IL-17 production in memory Th cells through the nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2)-ligand muramyldipeptide (MDP), a derivative of bacterial peptidoglycan. MDP enhanced obligate bacterial Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist induction of IL-23 and IL-1, which promoted IL-17 expression in T cells. The role of NOD2 in this IL-23-IL-1-IL-17 axis could be confirmed in NOD2-deficient DCs, such as DCs from selected Crohn's disease patients. Thus, antibacterial Th17-mediated immunity in humans is orchestrated by DCs upon sensing bacterial NOD2-ligand MDP.","3407":"The cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) is primarily expressed by T helper 17 (Th17) CD4(+) T cells and is highly upregulated during chronic inflammatory diseases. IL-22 receptor expression is absent on immune cells, but is instead restricted to the tissues, providing signaling directionality from the immune system to the tissues. However, the role of IL-22 in inflammatory responses has been confounded by data suggesting both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Herein, we provide evidence that during inflammation, IL-22 played a protective role in preventing tissue injury. Hepatocytes from mice deficient in IL-22 were highly sensitive to the detrimental immune response associated with hepatitis. Additionally, IL-22-expressing Th17 cells provided protection during hepatitis in IL-22-deficient mice. On the other hand, interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is coexpressed with IL-22 and can induce similar cellular responses, had no observable role in liver inflammation. Our data suggest that IL-22 serves as a protective molecule to counteract the destructive nature of the immune response to limit tissue damage.","3408":"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are structurally conserved through evolution, but their functions in innate immunity are different in invertebrates and vertebrates. We asked what the functions of PGRPs in fish are and whether they are indispensable for defense against infection because fish are the first vertebrates that developed adaptive immunity, but they still rely solely on innate immunity during early development of embryos. We identified and cloned three zebrafish PGRPs and showed that they are highly expressed in eggs, developing embryos, and adult tissues that contact external environment. Zebrafish PGRPs have both peptidoglycan-lytic amidase activity and broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, which is a unique feature. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in the developing zebrafish embryo, one of these PGRPs is essential for defense and survival during bacterial infections. These data demonstrate an absolute requirement for innate immunity in defense against infections in fish embryos and for a PGRP protein for survival in vertebrates.","3409":"Autophagy is a recently recognized immune effector mechanism against intracellular pathogens. The role of autophagy in innate immunity has been well established, but the extent of its regulation by the adaptive immune response is less well understood. The T helper 1 (Th1) cell cytokine IFN-gamma induces autophagy in macrophages to eliminate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we report that Th2 cytokines affect autophagy in macrophages and their ability to control intracellular M. tuberculosis. IL-4 and IL-13 abrogated autophagy and autophagy-mediated killing of intracellular mycobacteria in murine and human macrophages. Inhibition of starvation-induced autophagy by IL-4 and IL-13 was dependent on Akt signaling, whereas the inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced autophagy was Akt independent and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) dependent. These findings establish a mechanism through which Th1-Th2 polarization differentially affects the immune control of intracellular pathogens.","3410":"The balance between kinases and phosphatases is crucial for regulating lymphocyte signaling. In this issue, McNeill et al. (2007) show that the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 has a role as both positive and negative regulator of T cell signaling.","3411":"Crosspriming and crosspresentation are performed by specialized subsets of dendritic cells. In this issue, Hoeffel et al. (2007) show that human plasmacytoid dendritic cells can crosspresent HIV-derived peptides conjugated to a lipopeptide or HIV-infected cells undergoing apoptosis.","3412":"The Foxp3+ T cell lineage is thought to arise from self-specific precursors during development. By using a unique mouse model, Pacholczyk et al. (2007) present compelling evidence that self-specific cells are exceedingly rare among Foxp3(-) and, surprisingly, Foxp3+ subsets.","3413":"Chronic viral infections can appear in two very different forms: those that are typically immunologically contained after acute symptomatic infection, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and those that predictably lead to persistent viremia and progressive clinical disease. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is typical of the latter and has resulted in more than 20 million deaths worldwide. Here we review a remarkable subset of persons infected with HIV who are able to achieve long-term control of viremia and avoid immunodeficiency without the need for antiviral therapy. We review the contributing role of host genetic factors, innate and adaptive immune responses, and viral factors that may contribute to this phenotype. These individuals indicate that as with other potentially pathogenic chronic viral infections, the human immune system is able to fully control HIV and prevent HIV-associated disease, at least in some individuals. Further understanding of the mechanisms whereby this occurs should yield critical insights for prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral interventions.","3414":"Heterogeneity is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system. This is most evident in the enormous diversity of B and T cell antigen receptors. There is also heterogeneity within antiviral T cell populations, and subsets of effector and memory T cells now permeate our thinking about specialization of T cell responses to pathogens. It has been less clear, however, how heterogeneity in developing virus-specific effector and memory T cells is related to cell-fate decisions in the immune response, such as the generation long-lived memory T cells. Here we discuss recent findings that might help redefine how heterogeneity in antiviral T cell populations gives rise to T cell subsets with short- and long-lived cell fates.","3415":"Humoral immunity, in particular secreted neutralizing antibodies, is of central importance to protect the body against acutely cytopathic viruses, whereas noncytopathic viruses have found ways of balanced coexistence with the immune system to avoid antibody-mediated elimination. There is evidence that polyspecific \"natural\" antibodies provide early protection, independent of T cell help. If that line of defense is crossed, T cell-dependent immune responses then generate a humoral memory provided by long-lived plasma cells secreting specific antibodies of adapted avidity and function, i.e., isotype, even in the absence of virus. Secreted protective antibodies of humoral memory provide an efficient line of defense against reinfection and are backed up by specific B and T memory cells of reactive memory. Whereas humoral memory has developed effective antiviral protection, some viruses (i.e., HIV) have managed to develop specific evasion strategies to escape it. Thus, coevolution provides us with some insight into just how substantial antiviral antibodies and memory B cell are in protecting the host from virus infection.","3416":"Virus infection elicits potent responses in all cells intended to contain virus spread before intervention by the adaptive immune system. Central to this process is the virus-elicited production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other cytokines. The sensors involved in coupling recognition of viruses to the induction of the type I IFN genes have only recently been uncovered and include endosomal and cytosolic receptors for RNA and DNA. Here, we review their properties and discuss how their ability to recognize the unusual presence of atypical nucleic acids in particular subcellular compartments is used by the body to detect virus presence.","3417":"Because established vaccine technologies are not likely to provide protection against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, efforts are being focused on defining immunologic and virologic correlates of HIV containment with the hope that this information will provide direction to new approaches for HIV vaccination.","3418":"Bringing together discussion of innate immunity, B cell and T cell responses, vaccine design and efficacy, and the genetics of HIV and AIDS resistance allows us to access the extraordinary complexity of viral immunity and host responsiveness.","3419":"Bcl-3 is a member of the family of IkappaB inhibitors. Unlike the classical, cytoplasmic IkappaBs, Bcl-3 does not inhibit RelA- or c-Rel-containing NF-kappaB transcription factor dimers. Instead, Bcl-3 can enter the nucleus and modulate NF-kappaB activity, although the underlying mechanism and physiologic function remain largely unknown. Here we identified Bcl-3 as a regulator of immunologic tolerance to self. In parallel with NF-kappaB2, Bcl-3 functions within stroma to generate medullary thymic epithelial cells, which are essential for negative selection of autoreactive T cells. Loss of both NF-kappaB2 and Bcl-3, but not either one alone, led to a profound breakdown in central tolerance resulting in rapid and fatal multiorgan inflammation. These data reveal extensive utilization of the NF-kappaB system to promote central tolerance in the thymus, in apparent contrast with the well-known roles of NF-kappaB to promote inflammation and autoimmunity in the periphery.","3420":"The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), composed of immunoglobulin mu heavy chain and the surrogate light chain (SLC) proteins lambda5 and Vpreb, signals for proliferation and maturation of developing pre-B cells. It has been assumed that pre-B cells stop cycling by the pre-BCR-mediated downregulation of SLC transcription. We generated transgenic mice expressing SLC throughout B cell development and, remarkably, found that enforced SLC expression had no effect on pre-B cell proliferation or differentiation. However, in the presence of conventional immunoglobulin light chains, SLC components had the capacity to induce constitutive BCR internalization, secondary immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangement, and a severe developmental arrest of immature B cells, dependent on the adaptor protein Slp65. Residual B cells in the spleen showed increased expression of surface CD5, which is a negative regulator of BCR signaling, and differentiated spontaneously into IgM+ plasma cells. Thus, the silencing of SLC genes is not essential for the limitation of pre-B cell proliferation, but is required for the prevention of constitutive activation of B cells.","3421":"Crosspresentation is a specialized function of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), allowing them to induce CD8+ T cell responses against exogenous antigens that are not directly produced in their cytotosol. Human plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are not considered so far as able to perform crosspresentation. We showed here that purified human pDCs crosspresented vaccinal lipopeptides and HIV-1 antigens from apoptotic cells to specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. Apoptotic debris were internalized by phagocytosis and the lipopeptide LPPol reached nonacidic endosomes. This crosspresentation was amplified upon influenza virus infection. Importantly, the efficiency of crosspresentation by pDCs was comparable to that of mDCs. This property of human pDCs needs to be taken into account to understand the pathogenesis of infectious, allergic, or autimmune diseases and to help achieve desired responses during vaccination by targeting specifically either type of DCs.","3422":"The majority of regulatory Foxp3+CD4+ T cells naturally arises in the thymus. It has been proposed that T cell receptors (TCRs) on these cells recognize self-MHC class II-peptide complexes with high or higher affinity and that their specificities mirror specificities of autoreactive T cells. Here, we analyzed hundreds of TCRs derived from regulatory or nonregulatory T cells and found little evidence that the former population preferably recognizes self-antigens as agonists. Instead, these cells recognized foreign MHC-peptide complexes as often as nonregulatory T cells. Our results show that high-affinity, autoreactive TCRs are rare on all CD4+ T cells and suggest that selecting self-peptide is different from the peptide that activates the same regulatory T cells in the periphery.","3423":"Many neutrophil functions are regulated by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) that mediates protein membrane translocation via binding to pleckstrin homolog (PH) domains within target proteins. Here we show that inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), a cytosolic small molecule, bound the same PH domain of target proteins and competed for binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In neutrophils, chemoattractant stimulation triggered rapid elevation in Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 concentration. Depletion of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by deleting the gene encoding InsP3KB, which converts Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, enhanced membrane translocation of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-specific PH domain. This led to enhanced sensitivity to chemoattractant stimulation, elevated superoxide production, and enhanced neutrophil recruitment to inflamed peritoneal cavity. On the contrary, augmentation of intracellular Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 concentration blocked PH domain-mediated membrane translocation of target proteins and dramatically decreased the sensitivity of neutrophils to chemoattractant stimulation. These findings establish a role for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in cellular signal transduction pathways and provide another mechanism for modulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signaling in neutrophils.","3424":"Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) causes high early mortality in pneumococcal pneumonia, which is characterized by acute lung injury (ALI). The molecular mechanisms underlying ALI and the high early mortality remain unknown. Despite recent studies that identify deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a key regulator for T cell development, tumor cell proliferation, and NF-kappaB transcription factor signaling, its role in regulating bacteria-induced lethality, however, is unknown. Here, we showed that CYLD deficiency protected mice from S. pneumoniae pneumolysin (PLY)-induced ALI and lethality. CYLD was highly induced by PLY, and it inhibited MKK3-p38 kinase-dependent expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in lung, thereby potentiating ALI and mortality. Thus, CYLD is detrimental for host survival, thereby indicating a mechanism underlying the high early mortality of pneumococcal pneumonia.","3425":"As acute infections resolve, effector CD8(+) T cells differentiate into interleukin-7 receptor(lo) (IL-7R(lo)) short-lived effector cells (SLECs) and IL-7R(hi) memory precursor effector cells (MPECs) capable of generating long-lived memory CD8(+) T cells. By using another SLEC marker, KLRG1, we found that KLRG1(hi) effector cells began appearing early during infection and were committed to downregulating IL-7R. Unlike IL-7R(hi) MPECs, KLRG1(hi) IL-7R(lo) SLECs relied on IL-15, but IL-15 could not sustain their long-term maintenance or homeostatic turnover. The decision between SLEC and MPEC fates was regulated by the amount of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-12) present during T cell priming. According to the amount of inflammation, a gradient of T-bet was created in which high T-bet expression induced SLECs and low expression promoted MPECs. These results elucidate a mechanism by which the innate immune system sets the relative amounts of a lineage-determining transcription factor in activated CD8(+) T cells and, correspondingly, regulates their memory cell potential.","3426":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) is an adaptor protein that directly binds to a number of receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily. Despite in vitro evidence that TRAF3 plays diverse roles in different cell types, little is known about the in vivo functions of TRAF3. To address this gap in knowledge and to circumvent the early lethal effect of TRAF3 null mutations, we generated conditional TRAF3-deficient mice. B-cell-specific Traf3(-\/-) mice displayed severe peripheral B cell hyperplasia, which culminated in hyperimmunoglobulinemia and increased T-independent antibody responses, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Resting splenic B cells from these mice exhibited remarkably prolonged survival ex vivo independent of B cell activating factor and showed increased amounts of active nuclear factor-kappaB2 but decreased amounts of nuclear protein kinase Cdelta. Furthermore, these mice developed autoimmune manifestations as they aged. These findings indicate that TRAF3 is a critical regulator of peripheral B cell homeostasis and may be implicated in the regulation of peripheral self-tolerance induction.","3427":"Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical for antiviral responses. Here we generated a knockin mouse in which green fluorescence protein (GFP) was expressed under the control of the Ifna6 promoter. Virus-induced expression of GFP recapitulated various IFN-alpha subtypes. Systemic infection of the mice with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) increased GFP(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) via the Toll-like receptor system, and GFP(+) conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and macrophages via the RIG-I-like helicase system. By contrast, lung infection with NDV led to IFN-alpha production in alveolar macrophages (AMs) and cDCs, but not in pDCs. Specific depletion of AMs caused a marked defect in the initial viral elimination in the lung. pDCs produced IFN-alpha in the absence of AM-mediated viral recognition, suggesting that pDCs function when the first defense line is broken. Thus, AMs act as a type I IFN producer that is important for the initial responses to viral infection in the lung.","3428":"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI-3Ks) are key enzymes for cell development, activation, and survival. Here we showed that PI-3K class IB and class IA catalytic subunits, p110gamma and p110delta, played a crucial role in the development and functions of murine NK cells. p110gamma deficiency and impairment of G protein-coupled receptor (GPRC) signaling prevented full NK cell maturation. Concomitant loss of p110gamma and p110delta exacerbated this defect, resulting in a very small population of NK cells with a highly immature phenotype in the bone marrow and periphery. Moreover, combined p110gamma and p110delta signals were required for cytotoxicity and activation of the kinase ERK during NK cell-target cell interaction. p110gamma played a major role in receptor-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production through a pathway that involved the kinase ERK and 5-Lipoxigenase, which most likely generates lipid mediators activating GPRCs. Conversely, PI3Ks negatively regulated interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18-induced IFN-gamma by modulating p38 kinase activation. Our data shed light on the multiple intersecting pathways through which PI3Ks control NK cell-mediated innate responses.","3429":"Germinal centers (GCs) are important sites of antibody affinity maturation. In the classical model, the GC dark zone contains large centroblasts that are rapidly proliferating and undergoing somatic hypermutation of their antibody variable-region genes. Centroblasts give rise to smaller nonproliferating centrocytes in the light zone that compete for binding antigen on follicular dendritic cells. Recently, the approach of real-time imaging of GCs by two-photon microscopy of intact lymph nodes has provided new insights into GC dynamics that both support and challenge fundamental aspects of this model. Here we review recent and older findings on cell migration, proliferation, and interaction dynamics in the GC and discuss a model in which dark- and light-zone cells are morphologically similar, proliferation occurs in both zones, and GC B cells compete for T cell help as well as antigen.","3430":"The molecular mechanism of acute lung injury caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is unclear. In this issue of Immunity, Lim et al. (2007) demonstrate that CYLD, a deubiquinating enzyme, represses the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which is critical in preventing tissue damage.","3431":"Evidence has indicated that failed antitumor immunity is dominated by immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. In this issue of Immunity, Peng et al. (2007) add to this list by describing tumor-infiltrating gammadelta T cells that have regulatory function.","3432":"Under what context do dying beta-cells enhance the autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes? Kim et al. (2007) find that secondary necrosis of beta-cells can prime the autoimmune response via uptake by and activation of antigen-presenting cells through Toll-like receptor 2.","3433":"Activated CD8(+) T cells can differentiate into transient effector cells or long-lived memory cells. In this issue of Immunity, Joshi et al. (2007) suggest that inflammatory cytokines dictate this balance by regulating the expression of the transcription factor T-bet.","3434":"The size of the lymphocyte repertoire is of great interest, but direct information has been elusive. Moon et al. (2007) report the enumeration and isolation of naive CD4(+) T cells and show their numbers could predict the size and diversity of the primary immune response.","3435":"For initiation of an immune response, resting T cells must reprogram their metabolism. Continuing the \"From the Field\" series (see Editorial [2007] 26, 131), Jones and Thompson draw attention to the importance of metabolism during T cell activation and consider how this process is regulated by receptor-mediated signal transduction.","3436":"The molecular mechanisms whereby the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling responses remain to be elucidated. To investigate this question, we have reconstituted CD45 (encoded by Ptprc)-deficient mice, which display severe defects in thymic development, with five different expression levels of transgenic CD45RO, or with mutant PTPase null or PTPase-low CD45R0. Whereas CD45 PTPase activity was absolutely required for the reconstitution of thymic development, only 3% of wild-type CD45 activity restored T cell numbers and normal cytotoxic T cell responses. Lowering the CD45 expression increased CD4 lineage commitment. Peripheral T cells with very low activity of CD45 phosphatase displayed reduced TCR signaling, whereas intermediate activity caused hyperactivation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These results are explained by a rheostat mechanism whereby CD45 differentially regulates the negatively acting pTyr-505 and positively acting pTyr-394 p56(lck) tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites. We propose that high wild-type CD45 expression is necessary to dephosphorylate p56(lck) pTyr-394, suppressing CD4 T+ cell lineage commitment and hyperactivity.","3437":"Cell-mediated immunity stems from the proliferation of naive T lymphocytes expressing T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) specific for foreign peptides bound to host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Because of the tremendous diversity of the T cell repertoire, naive T cells specific for any one peptide:MHC complex (pMHC) are extremely rare. Thus, it is not known how many naive T cells of any given pMHC specificity exist in the body or how that number influences the immune response. By using soluble pMHC class II (pMHCII) tetramers and magnetic bead enrichment, we found that three different pMHCII-specific naive CD4(+) T cell populations vary in frequency from 20 to 200 cells per mouse. Moreover, naive population size predicted the size and TCR diversity of the primary CD4(+) T cell response after immunization with relevant peptide. Thus, variation in naive T cell frequencies can explain why some peptides are stronger immunogens than others.","3438":"Although it is established that defective clearance and, hence, increased accumulation of apoptotic cells can lead to autoimmunity, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. Here, we observed that apoptotic cells undergoing secondary necrosis but not intact apoptotic cells provoked substantial immune responses, which were mediated through the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway. The development of autoimmune diabetes was markedly inhibited in Tlr2(-\/-) mice but not in Tlr4(-\/-) mice, showing that TLR2 plays an important role in the initiation of the disease. Apoptotic beta-cell injury could stimulate the priming of diabetogenic T cells through a TLR2-dependent, but TLR4-independent, activation of antigen-presenting cells. These findings suggest that beta-cell death and its sensing via TLR2 may be an initial event for the stimulation of antigen-presenting cells and development of autoimmune diabetes.","3439":"Dendritic cells (DCs) produce type I interferons (IFNs) in greater amounts than other cells, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Here we studied the role of a transcription factor, IRF8, in DC induction of type I IFNs. Upon newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection, bone marrow-derived plasmacytoid and conventional DCs induced IFN transcripts, exhibiting two-phase kinetics. The second, amplifying phase represented an IFN feedback response that accounted for much of IFN protein production. Induction of second phase transcription required IRF8. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and Toll-like receptor-mediated IFN induction in DCs also required IRF8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that IRF7, IRF8, and RNA polymerase II were recruited to the IFN promoters upon stimulation. Moreover, sustained RNA polymerase II recruitment to the promoters critically depended on IRF8. Together, these data indicate that IRF8 magnifies the second phase of IFN transcription in DCs by prolonging binding of basic transcription machinery to the IFN promoters, thereby playing a role in innate immunity.","3440":"The Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2-antagonist\/killer (Bak) are essential regulators of lymphocyte apoptosis, but whether they play a role in viable T cell function remains unclear. Here, we report that T cells lacking both Bax and Bak display defects in antigen-specific proliferation because of Ca(2+)-signaling defects. Bax(-\/-), Bak(-\/-) T cells displayed defective T cell receptor (TCR)- and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-dependent Ca(2+) mobilization because of altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) regulation that was reversed by Bax's reintroduction. The ability of TCR-dependent Ca(2+) signals to stimulate mitochondrial NADH production in excess of that utilized for ATP synthesis was dependent on Bax and Bak. Blunting of Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial NADH elevation in the absence of Bax and Bak resulted in decreased reactive-oxygen-species production, which was required for T cell proliferation. Together, the data establish that Bax and Bak play an essential role in the control of T cell proliferation by modulating ER Ca(2+) release.","3441":"Inflammatory diseases at epithelial borders develop from aberrant interactions between resident cells of the tissue and invading immunocytes. Here, we unraveled basic functions of epithelial cells and immune cells and the sequence of their interactions in an inflammatory skin disease. Ubiquitous deficiency of the IkappaBalpha protein (Ikba(Delta)(\/Delta)) as well as concomitant deletion of Ikba specifically in keratinocytes and T cells (Ikba(K5Delta\/K5Delta lckDelta\/lckDelta)) resulted in an inflammatory skin phenotype that involved the epithelial compartment and depended on the presence of lymphocytes as well as tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin signaling. In contrast, mice with selective ablation of Ikba in keratinocytes or lymphocytes showed inflammation limited to the dermal compartment or a normal skin phenotype, respectively. Targeted deletion of RelA from epidermal keratinocytes completely rescued the inflammatory skin phenotype of Ikba(Delta)(\/Delta) mice. This finding emphasizes the important role of aberrant NF-kappaB activation in both keratinocytes and lymphocytes in the development of the observed inflammatory skin changes.","3442":"Autoimmune diseases are prevalent and often life-threatening syndromes, yet the pathogenic triggers and mechanisms involved remain mostly unresolved. Protein asparagine linked- (N-) glycosylation produces glycan structures that substantially differ among the extracellular compartments of evolutionarily divergent organisms. Alpha-mannosidase-II (alphaM-II) deficiency diminishes complex-type N-glycan branching in vertebrates and induces an autoimmune disease in mice similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus. We found that disease pathogenesis provoking glomerulonephritis and kidney failure was nonhematopoietic in origin, independent of complement C3 and the adaptive immune system, mitigated by intravenous administration of immunoglobulin-G, and linked to chronic activation of the innate immune system. N-glycans produced in alphaM-II deficiency bear immune-stimulatory mannose-dependent ligands for innate immune lectin receptors, disrupting the phylogenic basis of this glycomic recognition mechanism. Thus, mammalian N-glycan branching safeguards against the formation of an endogenous immunologic signal of nonself that can provoke a sterile inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.","3443":"The two main proteolytic machineries of eukaryotic cells, lysosomes and proteasomes, receive substrates by different routes. Polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas autophagy delivers intracellular material for lysosomal hydrolysis. The importance of autophagy for cell survival has long been appreciated, but more recently, its essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity has been characterized. Autophagy is now recognized to restrict viral infections and replication of intracellular bacteria and parasites. Additionally, this pathway delivers cytoplasmic antigens for MHC class II presentation to the adaptive immune system, which then in turn is able to regulate autophagy. At the same time, autophagy plays a role in the survival and the cell death of T cells. Thus, the immune system utilizes autophagic degradation of cytoplasmic material, to both restrict intracellular pathogens and regulate adaptive immunity.","3444":"The transcription factor Pax5 is a critical regulator of B lymphocyte commitment and identity. In this issue of Immunity, Schebesta et al. (2007) demonstrate how Pax5 activates 170 different genes involved in B cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and maturation.","3445":"Which molecular events control the initiation of a T cell response? In this issue of Immunity, Huse et al. (2007) describe a photoactivatable agonist that will substantially improve our ability to investigate this phenomenon.","3446":"In this issue of Immunity, Amsen et al. (2007) and Fang et al. (2007) propose a direct role for Notch signaling in the expression of GATA-3 transcription factor and T helper 2 cell differentiation.","3447":"In plants and invertebrates, Dicer genes play a critical role against infections by RNA viruses. In this issue, Otsuka et al. (2007) report that Dicer mutant mice are hypersusceptible to infection by the RNA virus VSV.","3448":"The transcription factor Pax5 represses B lineage-inappropriate genes and activates B cell-specific genes in B lymphocytes. Here we have identified 170 Pax5-activated genes. Conditional mutagenesis demonstrated that the Pax5-regulated genes require continuous Pax5 activity for normal expression in pro-B and mature B cells. Expression of half of the Pax5-activated genes is either absent or substantially reduced upon Pax5 loss in plasma cells. Direct Pax5 target genes were identified based on their protein synthesis-independent activation by a Pax5-estrogen receptor fusion protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Pax5 together with chromatin profiling by ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that Pax5 directly activates the chromatin at promoters or putative enhancers of Pax5 target genes. The Pax5-activated genes code for key regulatory and structural proteins involved in B cell signaling, adhesion, migration, antigen presentation, and germinal-center B cell formation, thus revealing a complex regulatory network that is activated by Pax5 to control B cell development and function.","3449":"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is required for immunoglobulin (Ig) gene class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM), and somatic hyperconversion. In general, high AID expression is found in mature B cells that are responding to antigens. However, AID expression and SHM have also been detected in developing B cells from transgenic mice that have a limited Ig repertoire. Here we demonstrate that AID expression, ongoing CSR, and active SHM occur in developing B cells from wild-type mice. Further, our results suggest that somatic variants arising from developing B cells in the bone marrow further diversify in the spleen of unimmunized mice. AID expression in developing B cells is T cell independent but involves engagement of B cell receptors and Toll-like receptors. Early AID expression can increase the preimmune repertoire of developing B cells, may provide an innate population of IgG- and IgA-expressing cells, and could be involved in receptor editing of self-reactive immature B cells.","3450":"CD4(+) T helper cells differentiate into T helper 1 (Th1) or Th2 effector lineages, which orchestrate immunity to different types of microbes. Both Th1 and Th2 differentiation can be induced by Notch, but what dictates which of these programs is activated in response to Notch is not known. By using T cell-specific gene ablation of the Notch effector RBP-J or the Notch1 and 2 receptors, we showed here that Notch was required on CD4(+) T cells for physiological Th2 responses to parasite antigens. GATA-3 was necessary for Notch-induced Th2 differentiation, and we identified an upstream Gata3 promoter as a direct target for Notch signaling. Moreover, absence of GATA-3 turned Notch from a Th2 inducer into a powerful inducer of Th1 differentiation. Therefore, Gata3 is a critical element determining inductive Th2 differentiation and limiting Th1 differentiation by Notch.","3451":"Notch signaling plays multiple roles to direct diverse decisions regarding cell fate during T cell development. During helper T (Th) cell differentiation, Notch is involved in generating optimal Th2 cell responses. Here, we present data investigating how Notch mediates Th2 cell differentiation. Notch showed a CD4(+) T cell intrinsic role in promoting IL-4 expression that required GATA-3. In the absence of Notch signals, Gata3 expression was markedly diminished. Introduction of an activated allele of Notch1 into CD4(+) T cells led to the specific and direct upregulation of a developmentally regulated Gata3 transcript that included the exon 1a sequences. Furthermore, Notch acted in parallel with GATA-3 to synergistically activate IL-4 expression. Together, these data implicate Gata3 as a direct transcriptional Notch target that acts in concert with Notch signaling to generate optimal Th2 cell responses.","3452":"Autophagy has recently been shown to be an important component of the innate immune response. The signaling pathways leading to activation of autophagy in innate immunity are not known. Here we showed that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) served as a previously unrecognized environmental sensor for autophagy. Autophagy was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human macrophages and in the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. We defined a new molecular pathway in which LPS-induced autophagy was regulated through a Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF)-dependent, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-independent TLR4 signaling pathway. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were downstream components of this pathway. This signaling pathway did not affect cell viability, indicating that it is distinct from the autophagic death signaling pathway. We further showed that LPS-induced autophagy could enhance mycobacterial colocalization with the autophagosomes. This study links two ancient processes, autophagy and innate immunity, together through a shared signaling pathway.","3453":"Adaptive B cell responses are initiated by B cell receptor-antigen engagement. Despite its importance, the early stages of B cell interaction with antigen in vivo remain elusive. Using fluorescent particulate antigen in combination with multiphoton microscopy and immune staining, we identified the follicle-subcapsular sinus (SCS) boundary of the lymph node as a site for B cell-antigen acquisition. In this macrophage-rich region, antigen accumulated shortly after administration, where specific follicular B cells were retained for long periods of time. These B cells acquired antigen cumulatively and became the main antigen carriers inside the follicle before polarizing to the B cell-T cell border. These observations not only provide evidence of a B cell role as antigen transporters into the follicle, but also highlight the boundary between the follicle and the SCS as a site for initiation of B cell responses.","3454":"gammadelta T cells are important contributors to innate immunity against cancer, but their regulatory role in controlling immune responses remains largely unknown. Here we report that a dominant gammadelta1 T cell population among lymphocytes infiltrating breast tumors possessed a potent ability to suppress naive and effector T cell responses and to block the maturation and function of dendritic cells. Adoptive cotransfer experiments demonstrated their in vivo suppressive activity. However, their immunosuppressive activity could be reversed by human Toll-like receptor (TLR) 8 ligands both in vitro and in vivo. siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments revealed that MyD88, TRAF6, IKKalpha IKKbeta, and p38alpha molecules in gammadelta1 cells were required for these cells to respond to TLR8 ligands, whereas TAK1, JNK, and ERK molecules did not appear to be involved in functional regulation. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of tumor-specific gammadelta T cells and identify a unique TLR8 signaling pathway linking to their functional regulation.","3455":"Pathways in the B7:CD28 family of costimulatory molecules regulate T cell activation and tolerance. B7-dependent responses in Cd28(-\/-)Ctla4(-\/-) T cells together with reports of stimulatory and inhibitory functions for Programmed Death-1 Ligand 1 or 2 molecules (PD-L1 or PD-L2) have suggested additional receptors for these B7 family members. We show that B7-1 and PD-L1 interacted with affinity intermediate to that of B7-1:CD28 and B7-1:CTLA-4. The PD-L1:B7-1 interface overlapped with the B7-1:CTLA-4 and PD-L1:PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) interfaces. T cell activation and cytokine production were inhibited by the interaction of B7-1 with PD-L1. The responses of PD-1-deficient versus PD-1,B7-1 double-deficient T cells to PD-L1 and of CD28,CTLA-4 double-deficient versus CD28,CTLA-4,PD-L1 triple-deficient T cells to B7-1 demonstrated that PD-L1 and B7-1 interact specifically to inhibit T cell activation. Our findings point to a substantial bidirectional inhibitory interaction between B7-1 and PD-L1 and add an additional dimension to immunoregulatory functions of the B7:CD28 family.","3456":"The precise timing of signals downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) is poorly understood. To address this problem, we prepared major histocompatibility complexes containing an antigenic peptide that is biologically inert until exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV irradiation of these complexes in contact with cognate T cells enabled the high-resolution temporal analysis of signaling. Phosphorylation of the LAT adaptor molecule was observed in 4 s, and diacylglycerol production and calcium flux was observed in 6-7 s. TCR activation also induced cytoskeletal polarization within 2 min. Antibody blockade of CD4 reduced the intensity of LAT phosphorylation and the speed of calcium flux. Furthermore, strong desensitization of diacylglycerol production, but not LAT phosphorylation, occurred shortly after TCR activation, suggesting that different molecular events play distinct signal-processing roles. These results establish the speed and localization of early signaling steps, and have important implications regarding the overall structure of the network.","3457":"The risk of celiac disease is strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 and to a lesser extent with HLA DQ8. Although the pathogenesis of HLA-DQ2-mediated celiac disease is established, the underlying basis for HLA-DQ8-mediated celiac disease remains unclear. We showed that T helper 1 (Th1) responses in HLA-DQ8-associated celiac pathology were indeed HLA DQ8 restricted and that multiple, mostly deamidated peptides derived from protease-sensitive sites of gliadin were recognized. This pattern of reactivity contrasted with the more absolute deamidation dependence and relative protease resistance of the dominant gliadin peptide in DQ2-mediated disease. We provided a structural basis for the selection of HLA-DQ8-restricted, deamidated gliadin peptides. The data established that the molecular mechanisms underlying HLA-DQ8-mediated celiac disease differed markedly from the HLA-DQ2-mediated form of the disease. Accordingly, nondietary therapeutic interventions in celiac disease might need to be tailored to the genotype of the individual.","3458":"Dicer is essential for plant, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila antiviral responses because of its role in generating small interfering RNA (siRNA) from viral genomes. We show that because of impaired miRNA production, mice with a variant Dicer1 allele (Dicer1(d\/d)) were more susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection. We did not detect VSV genome-derived siRNA in wild-type cells or any alteration of interferon-mediated antiviral responses by Dicer1 deficiency. Rather, we found that host miR24 and miR93 could target viral large protein (L protein) and phosphoprotein (P protein) genes, and a lack of miR24 and miR93 was responsible for increased VSV replication in Dicer1(d\/d) cells. Our data suggest that host miRNA can play a role in host interactions with viruses.","3459":"Immune responses can be enhanced or dampened by differential manipulation of Foxp3-expressing CD25(+)CD4(+) natural regulatory T (Treg) cells versus other naive or activated T cells. By searching for a molecule capable of distinguishing these populations, we here found that natural Treg cells constitutively expressed high amounts of folate receptor 4 (FR4). The expression of FR4 and CD25 also separated antigen-stimulated CD4(+) non-Treg cells into the FR4(hi)CD25(-) and FR4(lo)CD25(+) populations, which were different in proliferation and cytokine secretion upon restimulation. These distinctions showed that antigenic stimulation activated and expanded antigen-specific natural Treg cells as well as effector and memory T cells. Accordingly, FR4(hi)CD25(+)CD4(+) T cells enriched from alloantigen-stimulated T cells suppressed graft rejection. Administration of FR4 monoclonal antibody specifically reduced Treg cells, provoking effective tumor immunity in tumor-bearing animals, whereas similar treatment of normal young mice elicited autoimmune disease. Thus, specific manipulation of FR4(hi)CD25(+)CD4(+) Treg cells helps control ongoing immune responses.","3460":"Spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp1 cause the motheaten phenotype, characterized by widespread inflammation and autoimmunity. Because Shp1 is expressed in all hematopoietic cells, it has been unclear which aspects of the motheaten phenotypes are primary effects of Shp1 deficiency. We generated mice (Ptpn6(f\/f);CD19-cre) that delete Shp1 specifically in B cells. Analysis of these mice indicates that the increase in B-1a cells in motheaten mice is a cell-autonomous consequence of Shp1 deficiency. Shp1-deficient B-1a cells could be derived from adult bone marrow and had N-nucleotide additions, consistent with an adult origin. Shp1 deficiency altered calcium response evoked by B cell antigen receptors and impaired CD40-evoked proliferation. Young Ptpn6(f\/f);CD19-cre mice exhibited elevated serum immunoglobulins and impaired antibody responses to immunization, whereas older Ptpn6(f\/f);CD19-cre mice developed systemic autoimmunity, characterized by DNA antibodies and immune complex glomerulonephritis. Thus, Shp1 deficiency in B cells alone perturbs B cell development and causes autoimmune disease.","3461":"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) confers mucosal protection against bacteria in the intestine. In this issue, He et al.

A new study shows that a ribosomal protein, RPL22, promotes the survival of expanding alphabeta T cells.","3464":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogenous population of bone-marrow-derived immune cells. Although all DCs share a common ability to process and present antigen to naive T cells for the initiation of an immune response, they differ in surface markers, migratory patterns, localization, and cytokine production. DCs were originally considered to be myeloid cells, but recent findings have demonstrated that DCs can develop not only from myeloid- but also from lymphoid-committed progenitors. The common feature of the progenitors capable of developing into DCs is the surface expression of Flt3 receptor. The development of different populations of DCs is differentially regulated by various transcription factors and cytokines. This review summarizes the recent advances made in the field of DC development.","3465":"Prospective isolation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells has identified the lineal relationships among all blood-cell types and has allowed their developmental mechanisms to be assayed at the single-cell level. These isolated cell populations are used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of lineage fate decision and of its plasticity directly by stage-specific enforcement or repression of lineage-instructive signaling in purified cells. With an emphasis on the myeloid lineage, this review summarizes current concepts and controversies regarding adult murine hematopoietic development and discusses the potential mechanisms, operated by single or by multiple transcription factors, of myeloid lineage fate decision.","3466":"The expression of lineage-associated genes, as well as the survival and expansion of committed B cell progenitors, is controlled by multiple transcriptional regulators and growth-factor receptors. Whereas certain DNA-binding proteins, such as Ikaros and PU.1, are required primarily for the formation of more primitive lymphoid progenitors, other factors such as E2A and EBF1 have more direct roles in specifying the B cell-specific gene-expression program. Further, Pax5 functions to promote B cell commitment by repressing lineage-inappropriate gene expression and reinforcing B cell-specific gene expression. In this review, we focus on recent studies that have revealed that instead of a simple transcriptional hierarchy, efficient B cell commitment and differentiation requires the combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors in a complex gene regulatory network.","3467":"The subdivision of bone marrow (BM) with surface markers and reporter systems and the use of multiple culture and transplantation assays to assess differentiation potential have led to extraordinary progress in defining stages of B lymphopoiesis between the hematopoietic stem cell and B cell receptor (BCR)-expressing lymphocytes. Despite the lack of standard nomenclature and a series of technical issues that still need to be resolved, there seems to be a general consensus regarding the major route to becoming a B cell. Nevertheless, evidence that additional, minor pathways through which B lineage cells are generated exists, and a new appreciation that lymphoid progenitors are protean and able to alter their differentiation potential during embryogenesis and after birth in response to infections suggests that a full understanding of B cell development and how it is regulated has not yet been attained.","3468":"Notch-Delta signaling of hematopoietic precursors sets in motion a train of events that activates expression of T lineage genes. Even so, through many cell generations the pro-T cells remain uncommitted to the T cell fate, preserving alternative potentials as divergent as monocyte or dendritic cell fates. This plasticity can be explained by the tenacious expression of stem- and progenitor-associated regulatory genes in the cells, and by the combinatorial coding of T cell identity by factors that are not intrinsically T lineage specific in their spectra of activity. T lineage developmental success depends on precise temporal and quantitative regulation of these factors and on the continuing modulating influence of Notch-Delta signals that buffer the cells against mechanisms promoting non-T outcomes. An additional mechanism, still not fully defined, is required just prior to T cell receptor-mediated selection to end plasticity and make T lineage commitment irreversible.","3469":"T cells developing in the thymus are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM). Understanding the developmental steps linking multipotent HSCs to intrathymic T lineage-committed progenitors is important for understanding cancer in T lineage cells, improving T cell reconstitution after BM transplantation, and designing gene-therapy approaches to treat defective T cell development or function. Such an understanding may also help ameliorate immunological defects in aging. This review covers the differentiation steps between HSCs and committed T cell progenitors within the thymus.","3470":"Much of the current understanding in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation into immune-cell lineages comes from mouse studies, but how well does it translate to the human system?","3471":"Multipotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood-cell formation throughout life. Here, Metcalf considers the origin and heterogeneity of HSCs, their ability to self-generate, and their commitment to the various hematopoietic lineages.","3472":"Diapedesis is critical for immune system function and inflammatory responses. This occurs by migration of blood leukocytes either directly through individual microvascular endothelial cells (the \"transcellular\" route) or between them (the \"paracellular\" route). Mechanisms for transcellular pore formation in endothelium remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that lymphocytes used podosomes and extended \"invasive podosomes\" to palpate the surface of, and ultimately form transcellular pores through, the endothelium. In lymphocytes, these structures were dependent on Src kinase and the actin regulatory protein WASP; inhibition of podosome formation selectively blocked the transcellular route of diapedesis. In endothelium, membrane fusion events dependent on the SNARE-containing membrane fusion complex and intracellular calcium were required for efficient transcellular pore formation in response to podosomes. These findings provide insights into basic mechanisms for leukocyte trafficking and the functions of podosomes.","3473":"Bacteria colonize the intestine shortly after birth and thereafter exert several beneficial functions, including induction of protective immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. The distal intestine contains IgA(2), which is more resistant to bacterial proteases than is IgA(1). The mechanism by which B cells switch from IgM to IgA(2) remains unknown. We found that human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) triggered IgA(2) class switching in B cells, including IgA(1)-expressing B cells arriving from mucosal follicles, through a CD4(+) T cell-independent pathway involving a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). IECs released APRIL after sensing bacteria through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and further increased APRIL production by activating dendritic cells via thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Our data indicate that bacteria elicit IgA(2) class switching by linking lamina propria B cells with IECs through a TLR-inducible signaling program requiring APRIL. Thus, mucosal vaccines should activate IECs to induce more effective IgA(2) responses.","3474":"The alphabeta and gammadelta T lineages are thought to arise from a common precursor; however, the regulation of separation and development of these lineages is not fully understood. We report here that development of alphabeta and gammadelta precursors was differentially affected by elimination of ribosomal protein L22 (Rpl22), which is ubiquitously expressed but not essential for translation. Rpl22 deficiency selectively arrested development of alphabeta-lineage T cells at the beta-selection checkpoint by inducing their death. The death was caused by induction of p53 expression, because p53 deficiency blocked death and restored development of Rpl22-deficient thymocytes. Importantly, Rpl22 deficiency led to selective upregulation of p53 in alphabeta-lineage thymocytes, at least in part by increasing p53 synthesis. Taken together, these data indicate that Rpl22 deficiency activated a p53-dependent checkpoint that produced a remarkably selective block in alphabeta T cell development but spared gammadelta-lineage cells, suggesting that some ribosomal proteins may perform cell-type-specific or stage-specific functions.","3475":"Adoptive-transfer experiments with relatively large input numbers ( approximately 10(6)) of T cell receptor-transgenic (TCR-tg) T cells are widely used to model endogenous T cell responses to infection or immunization. We show that input numbers of naive TCR-tg T cells sufficient to squelch the endogenous response to the same epitope substantially alter the kinetics, proliferative expansion, phenotype, and efficiency of memory generation by the TCR-tg T cells in response to infection. Thus, responses from nonphysiologic input numbers of TCR-tg T cells fail to accurately mimic the endogenous T cell response. Importantly, seeding as few as approximately 10-50 TCR-tg T cells, which constitute a fraction of the endogenous repertoire, allowed vigorous proliferation and analysis of TCR-tg cells after infection in a scenario representing normal physiology for any individual TCR. These data strongly suggest that modeling the endogenous T cell response with TCR-tg cells will require every effort to approximate the endogenous precursor frequency.","3476":"Engagement of neutrophils by E-selectin results in integrin activation. Here, we investigated primary mouse neutrophils in whole blood by using intravital microscopy and autoperfused flow chambers. Slow rolling on E-selectin coimmobilized with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) required P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL)-1, was dependent on alpha(L)beta(2) integrin (LFA-1), and required continuous E-selectin engagement. Slow rolling was abolished by pharmacological blockade of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and was absent in Syk(-\/-) bone-marrow chimeric mice. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha lowered rolling velocity further and induced CXC chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1) and CXC chemokine receptor-2 (CXCR2)-dependent leukocyte arrest on E-selectin and ICAM-1. Arrest but not rolling was blocked by an allosteric inhibitor of LFA-1 activation. Neutrophil recruitment in a thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model was almost completely inhibited in Selplg(-\/-) mice or Syk(-\/-) bone-marrow chimeras treated with pertussis toxin. This identifies a second neutrophil-activation pathway that is as important as activation through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).","3477":"Although activated murine NK cells can use the granule exocytosis pathway to kill target cells immediately upon recognition, resting murine NK cells are minimally cytotoxic for unknown reasons. Here, we showed that resting NK cells contained abundant granzyme A, but little granzyme B or perforin; in contrast, the mRNAs for all three genes were abundant. Cytokine-induced in vitro activation of NK cells resulted in potent cytotoxicity associated with a dramatic increase in granzyme B and perforin, but only minimal changes in mRNA abundance for these genes. The same pattern of regulation was found in vivo with murine cytomegalovirus infection as a physiologic model of NK cell activation. These data suggest that resting murine NK cells are minimally cytotoxic because of a block in perforin and granzyme B mRNA translation that is released by NK cell activation.","3478":"Development of Peyer's patches and lymph nodes requires the interaction between CD4+ CD3- IL-7Ralpha+ lymphoid-tissue inducer (LTi) and VCAM-1+ organizer cells. Here we showed that by promoting their survival, enhanced expression of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in transgenic mice resulted in accumulation of LTi cells. With increased IL-7 availability, de novo formation of VCAM-1+ Peyer's patch anlagen occurred along the entire fetal gut resulting in a 5-fold increase in Peyer's patch numbers. IL-7 overexpression also led to formation of multiple organized ectopic lymph nodes and cecal patches. After immunization, ectopic lymph nodes developed normal T cell-dependent B cell responses and germinal centers. Mice overexpressing IL-7 but lacking either RORgamma, a factor required for LTi cell generation, or lymphotoxin alpha1beta2 had neither Peyer's patches nor ectopic lymph nodes. Therefore, by controlling LTi cell numbers, IL-7 can regulate the formation of both normal and ectopic lymphoid organs.","3479":"Visualization of lymphocyte dynamics in vivo has only recently become feasible. In this issue of Immunity, Hauser et al. (2007) gaze into the germinal-center reaction and find B cells making some unexpected moves.","3480":"In this issue of Immunity, Voigt et al. (2007) and Lu et al.

In this issue of Immunity, Li et al. (2007) find that not only does T cell-produced TGF-beta regulate Th1-cell-mediated inflammation, but it is also required for the generation of Th17 cells in vivo.","3482":"In this issue of Immunity,Stranges et al. (2007) ablate expression of the death receptor Fas in T cells, B cells, and DC. Fas deficiency in any of these lineages is sufficient to break self-tolerance.","3483":"The transcriptional repressor Blimp-1 is considered the master regulator of plasma-cell differentiation. In this issue of Immunity, Kallies et al. (2007) identify a Blimp-1-independent stage of differentiation, followed by Blimp-1-dependent terminal differentiation.","3484":"With the recent advances in human-hemato-lymphoid-system mice, this commentary discusses the utility of these mice and further improvements required to generate an accessible system that allows predictive in vivo human hematology and immunology research.","3485":"","3486":"The ability of natural-killer cells to regulate adaptive immunity is not well understood. Here we define an interaction between the class Ib major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule Qa-1-Qdm on activated T cells responsible for adaptive immunity and CD94-NKG2A inhibitory receptors expressed by natural-killer cells by using Qa-1-deficient and Qa-1 knockin mice containing a point mutation that selectively abolishes Qa-1-Qdm binding to CD94-NKG2A receptors. The Qa-1-NKG2A interaction protected activated CD4+ T cells from lysis by a subset of NKG2A+ NK cells and was essential for T cell expansion and development of immunologic memory. Antibody-dependent blockade of this Qa-1-NKG2A interaction resulted in potent NK-dependent elimination of activated autoreactive T cells and amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings extend the functional reach of the NK system to include regulation of adaptive T cell responses and suggest a new clinical strategy for elimination of antigen-activated T cells in the context of autoimmune disease and transplantation.","3487":"Proliferation, mutation, and selection in the germinal center (GC) are thought to occur in distinct microanatomical compartments-the dark zone (DZ) and the light zone (LZ). Thus, affinity maturation has been posited to require frequent trafficking between zones. Here we report the use of multiphoton in vivo microscopy to determine migration patterns of GC B cells. Analysis of time-resolved images revealed unexpected patterns of movement as well as GC B cell morphology. Though frequent movement between the DZ and LZ was anticipated, few cells were observed to cross the interface between the two compartments. Moreover, cell-track trajectories indicated that cell movement in this region is predominantly parallel to the interface, suggesting that B cells circulate within individual LZ and DZ compartments. The results suggest a revision to our views of B cell circulation within GCs and the functional relationship of its two major compartments.","3488":"Blimp-1 is considered an essential regulator of the terminal differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. We show here that Rag1-\/- mice reconstituted with fetal liver cells homozygous for a DNA-binding-deficient mutant of Prdm1 (the gene encoding Blimp-1) lack a defined plasma-cell compartment, yet show detectable amounts of all immunoglobulin isotypes. In vitro analysis revealed that Blimp-1 is not required for the initiation of antibody secretion but is essential for subsequent high immunoglobulin production. Blimp-1-independent differentiation was blocked at a preplasmablast stage characterized by decreased Pax5 expression and the activation of plasma-cell genes. Analysis of Blimp-1-sufficient differentiation revealed a phase prior to Blimp-1 expression in which several genes normally repressed by Pax5 are re-expressed, suggesting that plasma-cell differentiation is initiated by the inhibition of Pax5 function. Our results indicate that full plasma-cell differentiation but not commitment to the plasma-cell fate requires the expression of functional Blimp-1.","3489":"Fas (also known as Apo-1 and CD95) receptor has been suggested to control T cell expansion by triggering T cell-autonomous apoptosis. This paradigm is based on the extensive lymphoproliferation and systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans lacking Fas or its ligand. However, with systemic loss of Fas, it is unclear whether T cell-extrinsic mechanisms contribute to autoimmunity. We found that tissue-specific deletion of Fas in mouse antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was sufficient to cause systemic autoimmunity, implying that normally APCs are destroyed during immune responses via a Fas-mediated mechanism. Fas expression by APCs was increased by exposure to microbial stimuli. Analysis of mice with Fas loss restricted to T cells revealed that Fas indeed controls autoimmune T cells, but not T cells responding to strong antigenic stimulation. Thus, Fas-dependent elimination of APCs is a major regulatory mechanism curbing autoimmune responses and acts in concert with Fas-mediated regulation of chronically activated autoimmune T cells.","3490":"B cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a critical role in B cell tolerance and activation. Here, we show that mice with B cell-specific ablation of both Cbl and Cbl-b (Cbl-\/-Cblb-\/-) manifested systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune disease. The Cbl double deficiency resulted in a substantial increase in marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B cells. The mutant B cells were not hyperresponsive in terms of proliferation and antibody production upon BCR stimulation; however, B cell anergy to protein antigen appeared to be impaired. Concomitantly, BCR-proximal signaling, including tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk tyrosine kinase, Phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2), and Rho-family GTP-GDP exchange factor Vav, and Ca2+ mobilization were enhanced, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor protein BLNK was substantially attenuated in the mutant B cells. These results suggested that the loss of coordination between these pathways was responsible for the impaired B cell tolerance induction. Thus, Cbl proteins control B cell-intrinsic checkpoint of immune tolerance, possibly through coordinating multiple BCR-proximal signaling pathways during anergy induction.","3491":"TGF-beta1 is a regulatory cytokine with a pleiotropic role in immune responses. TGF-beta1 is widely expressed in leukocytes and stromal cells. However, the functions of TGF-beta1 expressed by specific lineages of cells remain unknown in vivo. Here, we show that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of the Tgfb1 gene developed lethal immunopathology in multiple organs, and this development was associated with enhanced T cell proliferation, activation, and CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells. TGF-beta1 produced by Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells was required to inhibit Th1-cell differentiation and inflammatory-bowel disease in a transfer model. In addition, T cell-produced TGF-beta1 promoted Th17-cell differentiation and was indispensable for the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These findings reveal essential roles for T cell-produced TGF-beta1 in controlling differentiation of T helper cells and controlling inflammatory diseases.","3492":"Cytomegaloviruses are known to encode several gene products that function to subvert MHC-dependent immune recognition. Here we characterize a rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) C-type lectin-like (RCTL) gene product with homology to the Clr ligands for the NKR-P1 receptors. RCMV infection rapidly extinguished host Clr-b expression, thereby sensitizing infected cells to killing by natural killer (NK) cells. However, the RCTL protein functioned as a decoy ligand to protect infected cells from NK killing via direct interaction with the NKR-P1B inhibitory receptor. In vivo, an RCTL mutant virus displayed diminished virulence in an NK-dependent and strain-specific manner, suggesting that host NKR-P1 polymorphisms have evolved to avert the viral decoy mechanism while maintaining Clr-b recognition to preserve self tolerance. These findings reveal a unique strategy adopted by cytomegaloviruses to evade MHC-independent self-nonself discrimination. The existence of lectin-like genes in several poxviruses suggests that this may represent a common theme for viral evasion of innate immunity.","3493":"Adaptive immune responses by dendritic cells (DCs) are critically controlled by Toll-like receptor (TLR) function. Little is known about modulation of TLR-specific signaling by other pathogen receptors. Here, we have identified a molecular signaling pathway induced by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN that modulates TLR signaling at the level of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We demonstrated that pathogens trigger DC-SIGN on human DCs to activate the serine and threonine kinase Raf-1, which subsequently leads to acetylation of the NF-kappaB subunit p65, but only after TLR-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Acetylation of p65 both prolonged and increased IL10 transcription to enhance anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. We demonstrated that different pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae, Candida albicans, measles virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 interacted with DC-SIGN to activate the Raf-1-acetylation-dependent signaling pathway to modulate signaling by different TLRs. Thus, this pathway is involved in regulation of adaptive immunity by DCs to bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens.","3494":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present short, perfectly cleaved peptides on the cell surface for immune surveillance by CD8(+) T cells. The pathway for generating these peptides begins in the cytoplasm, and the peptide-MHC I (pMHC I) repertoire is finalized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Recent studies show that the peptides for MHC I are customized by the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing and by dynamic interactions within the MHC peptide-loading complex. Failure to customize the pMHC I repertoire has profound immunological consequences.","3495":"The tyrosine kinase receptor RET regulates the intestinal nervous system. A recent paper by Veiga-Fernandes et al. (2007) demonstrates that RET is also involved in the intestinal immune system through the initiation of Peyer's-patch tissue genesis.","3496":null,"3497":"The participation of B and T cells in an immune response requires their separate activation by different forms of the target antigen.

In this issue of Immunity, Lucas et al. (2007) repeal this view by showing that NK cells acquire functionality through priming by dendritic cells.","3499":"Secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta requires caspase-1 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. However, Kanneganti et al. (2007) find that bacteria can use pore-forming mechanisms to activate caspase-1 for the production of IL-1beta precursor independently of TLRs.","3500":"The selectins and their ligands are required for leukocyte extravasation during inflammation. Several glycoproteins have been suggested to bind to E-selectin in vitro, but the complete identification of its physiological ligands has remained elusive. Here, we showed that E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1), P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), and CD44 encompassed all endothelial-selectin ligand activity on neutrophils by using gene- and RNA-targeted loss of function. PSGL-1 played a major role in the initial leukocyte capture, whereas ESL-1 was critical for converting initial tethers into steady slow rolling. CD44 controlled rolling velocity and mediated E-selectin-dependent redistribution of PSGL-1 and L-selectin to a major pole on slowly rolling leukocytes through p38 signaling. These results suggest distinct and dynamic contributions of these three glycoproteins in selectin-mediated neutrophil adhesion and signaling.","3501":"GA binding protein (GABP) is a ubiquitously expressed Ets-family transcription factor that critically regulates the expression of the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) in T cells, whereas it is dispensable for IL-7Ralpha expression in fetal liver B cells. Here we showed that deficiency of GABPalpha, the DNA-binding subunit of GABP, resulted in profoundly defective B cell development and a compromised humoral immune response, in addition to thymic developmental defects. Furthermore, the expression of Pax5 and Pax5 target genes such as Cd79a was greatly diminished in GABPalpha-deficient B cell progenitors, pro-B, and mature B cells. GABP could bind to the regulatory regions of Pax5 and Cd79a in vivo. Thus, GABP is a key regulator of B cell development, maturation, and function.","3502":"Recent evidence has suggested that signals other than those from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) could contribute to the elicitation of antigen-specific immunity. Therefore, we examined the role of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family member, Nod1, in the generation of adaptive immune responses. Our findings show that innate immune sensing of peptidoglycan by Nod1 is key for priming antigen-specific T cell immunity and subsequent antibody responses in vivo. Nod1 stimulation alone was sufficient to drive antigen-specific immunity with a predominant Th2 polarization profile. In conjunction with TLR stimulation, however, Nod1 triggering was required to instruct the onset of Th1 and Th2 as well as Th17 immune pathways. Cells outside of the hematopoietic lineage provided the early signals necessary to orchestrate the development of Nod1-dependent immune responses. These findings highlight Nod1 as a key innate immune trigger in the local tissue microenvironment that drives the development of adaptive immunity.","3503":"Recent studies implicated the existence of adult lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors (LMPPs) with little or no megakaryocyte-erythroid potential, questioning common myeloid and lymphoid progenitors as obligate intermediates in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) lineage commitment. However, the existence of LMPPs remains contentious. Herein, global and single-cell analyses revealed a hierarchical organization of transcriptional lineage programs, with downregulation of megakaryocyte-erythroid genes from HSCs to LMPPs, sustained granulocyte-monocyte priming, and upregulation of common lymphoid (but not B and T cell-specific) genes. These biological and molecular relationships, implicating almost mutual exclusion of megakaryocyte-erythroid and lymphoid pathways, are established already in fetal hematopoiesis, as evidenced by existence of LMPPs in fetal liver. The identification of LMPPs and hierarchically ordered transcriptional activation and downregulation of distinct lineage programs is compatible with a model for HSC lineage commitment in which the probability for undergoing different lineage commitment fates changes gradually when progressing from HSCs to LMPPs.","3504":"Cryopyrin is essential for caspase-1 activation triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, the events linking bacterial products and ATP to cryopyrin remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that cryopyrin-mediated caspase-1 activation proceeds independently of TLR signaling, thus dissociating caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta secretion. Instead, caspase-1 activation required pannexin-1, a hemichannel protein that interacts with the P2X(7) receptor. Direct cytosolic delivery of multiple bacterial products including lipopolysaccharide, but not flagellin, induced caspase-1 activation via cryopyrin in the absence of pannexin-1 activity or ATP stimulation. However, unlike Ipaf-dependent caspase-1 activation, stimulation of the pannexin-1-cryopyrin pathway by several intracellular bacteria was independent of a functional bacterial type III secretion system. These results provide evidence for cytosolic delivery and sensing of bacterial molecules as a unifying model for caspase-1 activation and position pannexin-1 as a mechanistic link between bacterial stimuli and the cryopyrin inflammasome.","3505":"Infection-induced inflammatory reactions involve a strong increase in dendritic cells (DCs) at the infection site and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Whether inflammatory DCs are recruited to these locations or differentiate locally, and what their functional relevance is, remain unclear. Here we showed that during Leishmania infection, monocytes were recruited to the dermis and differentiated into \"dermal monocyte-derived DCs,\" which subsequently migrated into the dLNs. In addition, monocyte recruitment to the dLNs resulted in the differentiation into \"LN monocyte-derived DCs.\" Analysis of the kinetics of monocyte differentiation into DCs, susceptibility to infection, IL-12 production, and L. major-specific T cell stimulation potential suggest that dermal monocyte-derived DCs controlled the induction of protective T helper 1 responses against Leishmania. Thus, the demonstration of monocyte differentiation potential into DCs during in vivo infection and of local DC differentiation in inflammatory foci suggests that de novo formed monocyte-derived DCs are essential in T cell immunity against pathogens.","3506":"Natural killer (NK) cells are important effector cells in the control of infections. The cellular and molecular signals required for NK cell activation in vivo remain poorly defined. By using a mouse model for the inducible ablation of dendritic cells (DCs), we showed that the in vivo priming of NK cell responses to viral and bacterial pathogens required the presence of CD11c(high) DCs. After peripheral Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation, NK cells were recruited to local lymph nodes, and their interaction with DCs resulted in the emergence of effector NK cells in the periphery. NK cell priming was dependent on the recognition of type I IFN signals by DCs and the subsequent production and trans-presentation of IL-15 by DCs to resting NK cells. CD11c(high) DC-derived IL-15 was necessary and sufficient for the priming of NK cells. Our data define a unique in vivo role of DCs for the priming of NK cells, revealing a striking and previously unappreciated homology to T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system.","3507":"Despite constant contact with the large population of commensal bacteria, the colonic mucosa is normally hyporesponsive to these potentially proinflammatory signals. Here we report that the single immunoglobulin IL-1 receptor-related molecule (SIGIRR), a negative regulator for Toll-IL-1R signaling, plays a critical role in gut homeostasis, intestinal inflammation, and colitis-associated tumorigenesis by maintaining the microbial tolerance of the colonic epithelium. SIGIRR-deficient (Sigirr(-\/-)) colonic epithelial cells displayed commensal bacteria-dependent homeostatic defects, as shown by constitutive upregulation of inflammatory genes, increased inflammatory responses to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) challenge, and increased Azoxymethane (AOM)+DSS-induced colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Gut epithelium-specific expression of the SIGIRR transgene in the SIGIRR-deficient background reduced the cell survival of the SIGIRR-deficient colon epithelium, abrogated the hypersensitivity of the Sigirr(-\/-) mice to DSS-induced colitis, and reduced AOM+DSS-induced tumorigenesis. Taken together, our results indicate that epithelium-derived SIGIRR is critical in controlling the homeostasis and innate immune responses of the colon to enteric microflora.","3508":"The initial step in a humoral immune response involves the acquisition of antigens by B cells via surface immunoglobulin. Surprisingly, anatomic studies indicate that lymph-borne proteins do not have access to the follicles where naive B cells reside. Thus, it is unclear how B cells acquire antigens that drain to lymph nodes. By tracking a fluorescent antigen and a peptide:MHC II complex derived from it, we show that antigen-specific B cells residing in the follicles acquire antigen within minutes of injection, first in the region closest to the subcapsular sinus where lymph enters the lymph node. Antigen acquisition, presentation, and subsequent T cell-dependent activation did not require B cell migration through the T cell area or exposure to dendritic cells. These results indicate that the humoral response is initiated as soluble antigens diffuse directly from lymph in the subcapsular sinus to be acquired by antigen-specific B cells in the underlying follicles.","3509":"The pleiotropic effects of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) place it in a central position in the immunopathogenesis of many diseases. Here we discuss the current understanding of MIF's role and highlight it as a potential link between inflammatory activation and malignant progression.","3510":"In this issue of Immunity, Laurence et al. (2007) examined the effects of interleukin-2 on differentiation of the T helper 17 (Th17) cells and found that this essential growth factor for all other T cell subsets blocks the development of Th17 T cells.","3511":"Ikaros family members play an important role in hematopoietic development. Thompson et al. (2007) show that pre-BCR signaling induces Aiolos expression, which in turn suppresses the expression of the pre-BCR component lambda5 and eliminates the very structure that signaled its appearance.","3512":"Tim molecules regulate T cell responses; however, the molecular basis of their ligand recognition remains largely unknown. In this issue of Immunity, Santiago et al. (2007) and Cao et al. (2007) report the crystal structures of several Tims and provide insights into the structure-function relationship of these molecules.","3513":"Generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate by sphingosine kinases (SphKs) promotes allergic inflammatory diseases, but the roles of the individual SphK isoforms are unclear. Olivera et al. (2007) show that SphK2 regulates mast cell activation whereas SphK1 enhances susceptibility to antigen challenge in vivo.","3514":"The alphabeta T cell antigen receptor (TCR), in complex with the CD3deltavarepsilon, gammavarepsilon, and zetazeta signaling subunits, is the chief determinant for specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses to self and foreign antigens. Although transmembrane domain charge interactions are critical for the assembly of the complex, the location of extracellular contacts between the TCR and CD3 subunits and their contributions to stability and signal transduction have not been defined. Here we used mutagenesis to demonstrate that the CD3deltavarepsilon and CD3gammavarepsilon subunits interact with the TCR via adjacent Calpha DE and Cbeta CC' loops, respectively. The TCR-CD3deltavarepsilon interactions helped stabilize CD3gammavarepsilon within the complex and were important for normal T cell and thymocyte responses to TCR engagement. These data demonstrate that extracellular TCR-CD3 subunit interactions contribute to the structural integrity and function of this multisubunit receptor.","3515":"The T cell immunoglobulin mucin (Tim) family of receptors regulates effector CD4(+) T cell functions and is implicated in autoimmune and allergic diseases. Tim-3 induces immunological tolerance, and engagement of the Tim-3 immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain by galectin-9 is important for appropriate termination of T helper 1-immune responses. The 2 A crystal structure of the Tim-3 IgV domain demonstrated that four cysteines, which are invariant within the Tim family, form two noncanonical disulfide bonds, resulting in a surface not present in other immunoglobulin superfamily members. Biochemical and biophysical studies demonstrated that this unique structural feature mediates a previously unidentified galectin-9-independent binding process and suggested that this structural feature is conserved within the entire Tim family. The current work provided a graphic example of the relationship between sequence, structure, and function and suggested that the interplay between multiple Tim-3-binding activities contributes to the regulated assembly of signaling complexes required for effective Th1-mediated immunity.","3516":"Ikaros DNA-binding proteins are critical for the development of lymphocytes and other hematopoietic lineages, but it remains unclear how they cooperate with other regulators of signaling and transcription to achieve ordered gene expression during development. Here, we show that Ikaros proteins regulate the pre-BCR component lambda5 in a stage-specific manner. In pre-BI cells, Ikaros modulated lambda5 expression in competition with the transcriptional activator EBF. This required Ikaros binding to the Igll1 (lambda5) promoter and was abolished either by mutation of the Ikaros DNA-binding domain or by deletion of a single Ikaros site from the Igll1 promoter. At the transition from the pre-BI to pre-BII stage, the expression of the Ikaros family member Aiolos was upregulated and required for the efficient silencing of Igll1. Aiolos expression was controlled by pre-BCR signals via the adaptor protein SLP-65. Thus, pre-BCR signaling regulates Aiolos and the silencing of Igll1 via a developmental-stage-specific feedback loop.","3517":"Recent work has identified a new subset of effector T cells that produces interleukin (IL)-17 known as T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which is involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases and is thought to be developmentally related to regulatory T (Treg) cells. Because of its importance for Treg cells, we examined the role of IL-2 in Th17 generation and demonstrate that a previously unrecognized aspect of IL-2 function is to constrain IL-17 production. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of IL-2 promoted differentiation of the Th17 cell subset. Whereas STAT3 appeared to be a key positive regulator of RORgammat and IL-17 expression, absence of IL-2 or disruption of its signaling by deletion of the transcription factor STAT5 resulted in enhanced Th17 cell development. We conclude that in addition to the promotion of activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes and the generation of Treg cells, inhibition of Th17 polarization appears to be an important function of IL-2.","3518":"The T cell immunoglobulin mucin (TIM) receptors are involved in the regulation of immune responses, autoimmunity, and allergy. Structures of the N-terminal ligand binding domain of the murine mTIM-1 and mTIM-2 receptors revealed an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold, with four Cys residues bridging a distinctive CC' loop to the GFC beta-sheet. The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding. Biochemical, mutational, and cell adhesion analyses confirmed the divergent ligand-binding modes revealed by the structures. Structural features characteristic of mTIM-1 appear conserved in human TIM-1, which also mediated homophilic interactions. The extracellular mucin domain enhanced binding through the Ig domain, modulating TIM receptor functions. These results explain the divergent immune functions described for the murine receptors and the role of TIM-1 as a cell adhesion receptor in renal regeneration and cancer.","3519":"T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.","3520":"Sphingosine-1-phosphate, a key mediator in immune cell trafficking, is elevated in the lungs of asthmatic patients and regulates pulmonary epithelium permeability. Stimulation of mast cells by allergens induces two mammalian sphingosine kinases (Sphk1 and Sphk2) to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Little is known about the individual role of these kinases in regulating immune cell function. Here we show that in mast cells, Sphk2 is required for production of S1P, for calcium influx, for activation of protein kinase C, and for cytokine production and degranulation. However, susceptibility to in vivo anaphylaxis is determined both by S1P within the mast cell compartment and by circulating S1P generated by Sphk1 predominantly from a non-mast cell source(s). Thus, sphingosine kinases are determinants of mast cell responsiveness, demonstrating a previously unrecognized relationship with anaphylaxis.","3521":"Signals from the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), consisting of mu heavy chain (muHC) and conventional light chain (LC), and its precursor the pre-BCR, consisting of muHC and surrogate light chain (SLC), via the adaptor protein SLP-65 regulate the development and function of B cells. Here, we compare the effect of SLC and conventional LC expression on receptor-induced Ca(2+) flux in B cells expressing an inducible form of SLP-65. We found that SLC expression strongly enhanced an autonomous ability of muHC to induce Ca(2+) flux irrespective of additional receptor crosslinking. In contrast, LC expression reduced this autonomous muHC ability and resulted in antigen-dependent Ca(2+) flux. These data indicate that autonomous ligand-independent signaling can be induced by receptor forms other than the pre-BCR. In addition, our data suggest that conventional LCs play an important role in the inhibition of autonomous receptor signaling, thereby allowing further B cell differentiation.","3522":"We report here that leptin can act as a negative signal for the proliferation of human naturally occurring Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. Freshly isolated T(reg) cells produced leptin and expressed high amounts of leptin receptor (ObR). In vitro neutralization with leptin monoclonal antibody (mAb), during anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation, resulted in T(reg) cell proliferation, which was interleukin-2 (IL-2) dependent. T(reg) cells that proliferated in the presence of leptin mAb had increased expression of Foxp3 and remained suppressive. The phenomena appeared secondary to leptin signaling via ObR and, importantly, leptin neutralization reversed the anergic state of the T(reg) cells, as indicated by downmodulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (p27(kip1)) and the phosphorylation of the extracellular-related kinases 1 (ERK1) and ERK2. Together with the finding of enhanced proliferation of T(reg) cells observed in leptin- and ObR-deficient mice, these results suggest a potential for therapeutic interventions in immune and autoimmune diseases.","3523":"Beyond the innate response that is elicited when tissues are infected, bacterial pathogens have evolved strategies to subvert the immune response and \"recalibrate\" it both qualitatively and quantitatively, thereby achieving a balance consistent with the survival of both the microbe and its infected host, a compromise that is likely the result of a long process of coevolution between pathogens and their hosts. By collaboratively studying the mechanisms employed, microbiologists and immunologists are fostering development of a renewed approach of infectious diseases that is expected to provide useful new concepts and applications for their control. In addition, the molecular strategies developed by bacteria to dampen immune mechanisms result from such strong and prolonged selective pressure for survival that they may point to original mechanisms and targets to conceive novel immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infectious molecules.","3524":"Details of how HIV-1 is transmitted across mucosal barriers remain sparse. In this issue of Immunity, Hladik et al. (2007) describe an organ culture system for imaging HIV-1 interaction with vaginal epithelial T cells and Langerhans cells early after infection.","3525":"Leptin is a cytokine-like hormone with proinflammatory properties linked to autoimmune diseases. In this issue of Immunity, De Rosa et al. (2007) elucidate an important new role for leptin in the anergy and hyporesponsiveness of regulatory T cells.","3526":"The role of the gp96 heat-shock protein in regulating Toll-like-receptor expression is incompletely understood. Yang et al. (2007) generated mice with conditional deficiency of gp96 in macrophages and found that this protein is an important chaperone for all Toll-like receptors that have been tested.","3527":"Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton requires nucleating factors, which initiate actin fiber formation. In this issue of Immunity, the functions of two classes of actin nucleators are examined in T lymphocytes, giving insight into the regulation of T cell polarity (Gomez et al., 2007).","3528":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are found in most metazoan organisms as well as in viruses and are implicated in an increasingly wide variety of biological processes in animals. Here, Taganov et al. discuss the role of miRNAs in the innate immune response to microbial infection.","3529":"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation after cytokine stimulation. One mechanism by which STAT signaling is regulated is by dephosphorylation through the action of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). We have identified PTP-Basophil like (PTP-BL) as a STAT PTP. PTP-BL dephosphorylates STAT proteins in vitro and in vivo, resulting in attenuation of STAT-mediated gene activation. In CD4(+) T cells, PTP-BL deficiency leads to increased and prolonged activation of STAT4 and STAT6, and consequently enhanced T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cell differentiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PTP-BL is a physiologically important negative regulator of the STAT signaling pathway.","3530":"T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization is considered to be actin-related protein (Arp) 2\/3 complex dependent. We therefore examined the requirement for Arp2\/3- and formin-dependent F-actin nucleation during T cell activation. We demonstrated that without Arp2\/3-mediated actin nucleation, stimulated T cells could not form an F-actin-rich lamellipod, but instead produced polarized filopodia-like structures. Moreover, the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC, or centrosome), which rapidly reorients to the immunological synapse through an unknown mechanism, polarized in the absence of Arp2\/3. Conversely, the actin-nucleating formins, Diaphanous-1 (DIA1) and Formin-like-1 (FMNL1), did not affect TCR-stimulated F-actin-rich structures, but instead displayed unique patterns of centrosome colocalization and controlled TCR-mediated centrosome polarization. Depletion of FMNL1 or DIA1 in cytotoxic lymphocytes abrogated cell-mediated killing. Altogether, our results have identified Arp2\/3 complex-independent cytoskeletal reorganization events in T lymphocytes and indicate that formins are essential cytoskeletal regulators of centrosome polarity in T cells.","3531":"More than half of the nascent B cells in humans initially express autoreactive antibodies. However, most of these autoantibodies are removed from the repertoire at two checkpoints before maturation into naive B cells. A third checkpoint excludes remaining autoantibodies from the antigen-experienced IgM(+) memory B cell pool. Nevertheless, low-affinity self-reactive antibodies are frequently found in the serum of normal humans. To determine the source of these antibodies, we cloned and expressed antibodies from circulating human IgG(+) memory B cells. Surprisingly, we found that self-reactive antibodies including anti-nuclear antibodies were frequently expressed by IgG(+) memory B cells in healthy donors. Most of these antibodies were created de novo by somatic hypermutation during the transition between mature naive and IgG(+) memory B cells. We conclude that deregulation of self-reactive IgG(+) memory B cells may be associated with autoimmunity.","3532":"Wnts are a family of secreted glycoproteins with diverse developmental roles, including regulation of cell migration; however, little is known about wnt signaling in mature T cells. We find that endothelial-cell-derived wnts, acting through Frizzled receptors, induce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 expression in effector T cells. Blocking wnt signaling, or MMP activity, reduces T cell migration through the basement membrane in vitro and into inflamed skin in vivo. Wnt signaling stabilizes beta-catenin protein in T cells and directly targets the MMP promoters through tandem TCF sites. Thus, our data support a necessary and previously unexpected role for wnt signaling in T cell extravasation.","3533":"Understanding the initial events in the establishment of vaginal human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) entry and infection has been hampered by the lack of appropriate experimental models. Here, we show in an ex vivo human organ culture system that upon contact in situ, HIV-1 rapidly penetrated both intraepithelial vaginal Langerhans and CD4(+) T cells. HIV-1 entered CD4(+) T cells almost exclusively by CD4 and CCR5 receptor-mediated direct fusion, without requiring passage from Langerhans cells, and overt productive infection ensued. By contrast, HIV-1 entered CD1a(+) Langerhans cells primarily by endocytosis, by means of multiple receptors, and virions persisted intact within the cytoplasm for several days. Our findings shed light on the very earliest steps of mucosal HIV infection in vivo and may guide the design of effective strategies to block local transmission and prevent HIV-1 spread.","3534":"A key event in the pathogenesis of asthma and allergies is the production of IgE antibodies. We show here that IgE(+) cells were exceptional because they were largely found outside germinal centers and expressed, from very early on, a genetic program of plasma cells. In spite of their extragerminal center localization, IgE(+) cells showed signs of somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. We demonstrated that high-affinity IgE(+) cells could be generated through a unique differentiation program that involved two phases: a pre-IgE phase in which somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation take place in IgG1(+) cells, and a post-IgE-switching phase in which IgE cells differentiate swiftly into plasma cells. Our results have implications for the understanding of IgE memory responses in allergy.","3535":"gp96 is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone for cell-surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Little is known about its roles in chaperoning other TLRs or in the biology of macrophage in vivo. We generated a macrophage-specific gp96-deficient mouse. Despite normal development and activation by interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1beta, the mutant macrophages failed to respond to ligands of both cell-surface and intracellular TLRs including TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9. Furthermore, we found that TLR4 and TLR9 preferentially interacted with a super-glycosylated gp96 species. The categorical loss of TLRs in gp96-deficient macrophages operationally created a conditional and cell-specific TLR null mouse. These mice were resistant to endotoxin shock but were highly susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes. Our results demonstrate that gp96 is the master chaperone for TLRs and that macrophages, but not other myeloid cells, are the dominant source of proinflammatory cytokines during endotoxemia and Listeria infections.","3536":"Integrins comprise a large family of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion receptors that rapidly modulate their adhesiveness. The arrest of leukocyte integrins on target vascular beds involves instantaneous conformational switches generating shear-resistant adhesions. Structural data suggest that these integrins are maintained in low-affinity conformations and must rapidly undergo conformational switches transduced via cytoplasmic changes (\"inside-out\" signaling) and simultaneous ligand-induced rearrangements (\"outside-in\"). This bidirectional activation is accelerated by signals from endothelial chemoattractants (chemokines). Recent studies predict that shear forces in the piconewton (pN) range per integrin can facilitate these biochemical switches. After extravasation, antigen recognition involves smaller internal forces from cytoskeletal motors and actin polymers forming the immune synapse. In this review, we address how forces facilitate allosteric integrin activation by biochemical signals. Evidence suggests that preformed cytoskeletal anchorage rather than free integrin mobility is key for force-enhanced integrin activation by chemokines and TCR signals.","3537":"Accumulating data suggest a potential for substantial overlap in phenotypic and functional characteristics between natural killer and dendritic cells. Thus, their identification, lineage commitment, and in vivo relevance may need a closer look.","3538":"Winau et al. provide convincing evidence that liver stellate cells can be antigen-presenting cells. This paper raises the following question: what are the roles and importance of diverse antigen-presenting cells in different organs?","3539":"Thymic lymphopoiesis depends on blood-borne, marrow-derived progenitors, but characterization of these cells, and their lineage potentials, has been difficult. In this issue, Krueger and von Boehmer show some blood cells that are already T lineage restricted, suggesting that T lineage commitment can occur pre-thymically.","3540":"The immunosuppressive mechanism of action of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has remained enigmatic despite the many years of clinical experience in the treatment of autoimmunity. In this issue of Immunity, Park-Min et al. demonstrate that IVIG engagement of Fcgamma RIII receptor on monocytes inhibits the cellular response to interferon-gamma.","3541":"MHC class II molecules usually present exogenous antigens, but peptidome analyses have also identified many antigens from cytosolic or nuclear sources. In this issue of Immunity, Schmid et al. show that MHC class II molecules can present these through autophagosomes.","3542":"Here we identified Ito cells (hepatic stellate cells, HSC), known for storage of vitamin A and participation in hepatic fibrosis, as professional liver-resident antigen-presenting cells (APC). Ito cells efficiently presented antigens to CD1-, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I-, and MHC-II-restricted T cells. Ito cells presented lipid antigens to CD1-restricted T lymphocytes such as natural killer T (NKT) cells and promoted homeostatic proliferation of liver NKT cells through interleukin-15. Moreover, Ito cells presented antigenic peptides to CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells and mediated crosspriming of CD8(+) T cells. Peptide-specific T cells were activated by transgenic Ito cells presenting endogenous neoantigen. Upon bacterial infection, Ito cells elicited antigen-specific T cells and mediated protection. In contrast to other liver cell types that have been implicated in induction of immunological tolerance, our data identify Ito cells as professional intrahepatic APCs activating T cells and eliciting a multitude of T cell responses specific for protein and lipid antigens.","3543":"Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) suppresses autoantibody-mediated inflammation by inducing and activating the inhibitory Fc receptor FcgammaRIIb and downstream negative signaling pathways. We investigated the effects of IVIG on cellular responses to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a potent macrophage activator that exacerbates inflammation. Our study showed that IVIG blocked IFN-gamma signaling and IFN-gamma-induced gene expression and suppressed IFN-gamma function in vivo during immune responses to Listeria monocytogenes and in an IFN-gamma-enhanced model of immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The mechanism of inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling was suppression of expression of the IFNGR2 subunit of the IFN-gamma receptor. The inhibitory effect of IVIG was mediated at least in part by soluble immune complexes and was dependent on FcgammaRIII but independent of FcgammaRIIb. These results reveal an unexpected inhibitory role for the activating FcgammaRIII in mediating suppression of IFN-gamma signaling and suggest that inhibition of macrophage responses to IFN-gamma contributes to the anti-inflammatory properties of IVIG.","3544":"Control of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration by chemokines plays a critical role in B cell development, differentiation, and function; however, the underlying signaling mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we show that the chemokine SDF-1 induced activation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and that integrin-mediated adhesion and migration in response to SDF-1 or CXCL13, as well as in vivo homing to lymphoid organs, was impaired in Btk-deficient (pre-)B cells. Furthermore, SDF-1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), which, unlike activation of the migration regulatory GTPases Rac or Rap1, was mediated by Btk. PLCgamma2-deficient B cells also exhibited impaired SDF-1-controlled migration. These results reveal that Btk and PLCgamma2 mediate chemokine-controlled migration, thereby providing insights into the control of B cell homeostasis, trafficking, and function, as well as into the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA).","3545":"With help of a hCD25 reporter controlled by pre-T cell receptor alpha (Ptcra) regulatory elements, T cell precursors were identified in peripheral blood. Sca-1(+)IL-7Ralpha(+)Flt3(-) precursors that were c-kit(lo)Thy-1(hi) generated T lineage cells when cultured on OP9-DL1 stromal cells and upon transfer into Rag2(-\/-)Il2rg(-\/-) mice. No B cells were generated in vivo and only few in vitro. These cells, which we call circulating T cell progenitors (CTP), were found at the same frequency in Foxn1(nu\/nu) thymus-deficient mice and wild-type mice, indicating that they were pre- rather than postthymic. Inhibition of Notch-dependent transcription in vivo reduced the frequency of intrathymic early T cell progenitors (ETP), but not CTP, indicating that the latter are less Notch dependent. Thus, CTP represent T lineage-committed T cell precursors linking extrathymic with intrathymic lymphopoiesis in adult mice.","3546":"Perforin gene (PRF1) transcription regulates perforin expression in NK cells and CTL. Here we identified the locus-wide ensemble of cis-acting sequences that drives PRF1 transcription physiologically. By using chromosome transfer, we revealed that de novo activation of a silent PRF1 locus was controlled by a 150 kb domain comprised of 16 DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). These cis-acting sequences included a locus control region (LCR) and conferred developmentally appropriate and lineage-specific expression of human perforin from BAC transgenes. The LCR included four distal DHSs that were required for perforin expression from its natural locus, and their engineered deletion from the PRF1 BAC transgene abolished LCR function and led to rapid gene silencing. Thus, LCR function is central for regulating the developmental and activation-specific PRF1 promoter activity characteristic of NK cells and CTL.","3547":"Members of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) family play crucial roles in cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although many studies have indicated that JNK1 and JNK2 have functional differences and redundancy, the upstream signaling pathway that selectively activates JNK1 or JNK2 remains unknown. In this study, we have revealed a selective mechanism of JNK activation, in which JNK2, but not JNK1, was regulated by CARMA1, a scaffold molecule, after stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR). This CARMA1-dependent regulation of JNK2 worked through the scaffold molecule Bcl10, which was inducibly associated with JNK2 and served as a JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-like scaffold to assemble the kinases JNK2, MKK7, and TAK1. Finally, we showed that CARMA1- and Bcl10-mediated JNK2 activation had a critical role in regulating the amount of c-Jun protein. Together, our studies provide genetic evidence that JNK1 and JNK2 are differentially regulated in the TCR-signaling pathway and play different functions.","3548":"T cell receptor (TCR-CD3) triggering involves both receptor clustering and conformational changes at the cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 subunits. The mechanism by which TCRalphabeta ligand binding confers conformational changes to CD3 is unknown. By using well-defined ligands, we showed that induction of the conformational change requires both multivalent engagement and the mobility restriction of the TCR-CD3 imposed by the plasma membrane. The conformational change is elicited by cooperative rearrangements of two TCR-CD3 complexes and does not require accompanying changes in the structure of the TCRalphabeta ectodomains. This conformational change at CD3 reverts upon ligand dissociation and is required for T cell activation. Thus, our permissive geometry model provides a molecular mechanism that rationalizes how the information of ligand binding to TCRalphabeta is transmitted to the CD3 subunits and to the intracellular signaling machinery.","3549":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules present products of lysosomal proteolysis to CD4(+) T cells. Although extracellular antigen uptake is considered to be the main source of MHC class II ligands, a few intracellular antigens have been described to gain access to MHC class II loading after macroautophagy. However, the general relevance and efficacy of this pathway is unknown. Here we demonstrated constitutive autophagosome formation in MHC class II-positive cells, including dendritic, B, and epithelial cells. The autophagosomes continuously fuse with multivesicular MHC class II-loading compartments. This pathway was of functional relevance, because targeting of the influenza matrix protein 1 to autophagosomes via fusion to the autophagosome-associated protein Atg8\/LC3 led to strongly enhanced MHC class II presentation to CD4(+) T cell clones. We suggest that macroautophagy constitutively and efficiently delivers cytosolic proteins for MHC class II presentation and can be harnessed for improved helper T cell stimulation.","3550":"B cells maintain homeostasis by balancing cell viability and cell death. B lymphocytes are susceptible to mitochondria- and receptor-initiated cell death at various stages of peripheral differentiation and during immune responses. The inducible transcription factor NF-kappaB enhances cell viability by activating genes that counteract both cell-death pathways. This review uses characteristic features of NF-kappaB activation and downregulation to provide insight into the regulation of B cell apoptosis in the periphery. In particular, the temporal patterns of NF-kappaB induction, differences between Rel family members, and the intersection between canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways in keeping B cells alive are discussed.","3551":null,"3552":"Tolerance of B-lymphocytes to autoantigens is established by clonal deletion, receptor editing, and anergy. In this issue of Immunity, Merrell et al. (2006) have now identified that T3 \"transitional\" B cells in the spleen are not developmental intermediates but rather a major population of anergic B cells.","3553":"In this issue of Immunity, Sugiyama et al. (2006) provide evidence that most bone-marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in vascular niches containing reticular cells that secrete CXCL12, a chemokine that promotes HSC maintenance.","3554":"The lineage relationship between the blood cells found in the developmentally successive hematopoietic organs has remained elusive. In this issue of Immunity, Murayama et al. (2006) track the migration of nascent hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish from their site of origin to a newly described intermediate location.","3555":"One more mechanism for regulating surface expression of MHC class II proteins in dendritic cells (an important process that regulates both tolerance and immunity) has been uncovered, polyubiquitination of Lys225 in the intracytoplasmic region and subsequent endocytosis and proteolysis (Omura-Hoshino et al., 2006; van Neil et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2006).","3556":"A recent surge of interest in the behavior of T and B cells in lymphopenic model systems has resurrected a certain cynicism about the validity of using such models to answer important immunological questions. Here we discuss this skepticism in a broader historical context.","3557":"Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate adaptive immune responses by activating T cells via cognate interactions between MHC-peptide complexes and T cell receptors. In immature DCs, MHC class II is predominantly stored in late endocytic compartments, where it has a short half-life because of degradation. In contrast, mature DCs recruit MHC class II to the plasma membrane. We here demonstrate that in immature DCs, the beta-chain of MHC class II was oligoubiquitinated after proteolytic processing of the associated invariant chain in endosomes and that this modification was required for efficient endocytosis and sorting into luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Ubiquitination of MHC class II was suppressed in lipopolysaccharide-activated DCs. Mutated MHC class II lacking its ubiquitination site was expressed at the plasma membrane, irrespective of DC maturation. Together, these data provide a molecular basis for the regulation of MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation by DCs.","3558":"Leukocyte migration and trafficking is dynamically regulated by various chemokine and adhesion molecules and is vital to the proper function of the immune system. We describe a role for the Cas and Hef-1-associated signal transducer in hematopoietic cells (Chat-H) as a critical regulator of T lymphocyte migration, by using lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). Impaired migration of Chat-H-depleted cells coincided with defective inside-out signaling shown by diminished chemokine-induced activation of the Rap-1 GTPase and integrin-mediated adhesion. Localization of Chat-H to the plasma membrane, association with its binding partner Crk-associated substrate in lymphocytes (CasL), and Chat-H-mediated CasL serine-threonine phosphorylation were required for T cell migration. These results identify Chat-H as a critical signaling intermediate acting upstream of Rap1 to regulate chemokine-induced adhesion and migration.","3559":"The contribution of anergy to silencing of autoreactive B cells in physiologic settings is unknown. By comparing anergic and nonanergic immunoglobulin-transgenic mouse strains, we defined a set of surface markers that were used for presumptive identification of an anergic B cell cohort within a normal repertoire. Like anergic transgenic B cells, these physiologic anergic cells exhibited high basal intracellular free calcium and did not mobilize calcium, initiate tyrosine phosphorylation, proliferate, upregulate activation markers, or mount an immune response upon antigen-receptor stimulation. Autoreactive B cells were overrepresented in this cohort. On the basis of the frequency and lifespan of these cells, it appears that as many as 50% of newly produced B cells are destined to become anergic. In conclusion, our findings indicate that anergy is probably the primary mechanism by which autoreactive B cells are silenced. Thus maintenance of the unresponsiveness of anergic cells is critical for prevention of autoimmunity.","3560":"In the bone marrow, the special microenvironment niches nurture a pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Many HSCs reside near the vasculature, but the molecular regulatory mechanism of niches for HSC maintenance remains unclear. Here we showed that the induced deletion of CXCR4, a receptor for CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12 in adult mice, resulted in severe reduction of HSC numbers and increased sensitivity to myelotoxic injury, although it did not impair expansion of the more mature progenitors. Most HSCs were found in contact with the cells expressing high amounts of CXCL12, which we have called CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells. CAR cells surrounded sinusoidal endothelial cells or were located near the endosteum. CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling plays an essential role in maintaining the quiescent HSC pool, and CAR cells appear to be a key component of HSC niches, including both vascular and endosteal niches in adult bone marrow.","3561":"Although the ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vertebrates has been studied intensely, a lineage relationship between the HSCs found in the developmentally successive hematopoietic organs remains to be shown. By using an in situ photoactivatable cell tracer in the transparent zebrafish embryo, we demonstrated that definitive blood precursors appeared between the dorsal aorta and axial vein, validating the homology of this tissue with the AGM (aorta-gonad-mesonephros) of amniotes. These cells first migrated through the blood to a previously undescribed caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), where they differentiated, expanded, and further migrated to seed the definitive hematopoietic organs, the thymus and kidney. Immigrants on the way to the thymus expressed c-myb and ikaros but not rag1; they were probably no longer HSCs, however, because they lacked scl and runx1 expression, unlike immigrants to the kidney. The CHT thus has a hematopoietic function similar to that of the mammalian fetal liver.","3562":"The Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4-signaling pathway that involves the adaptor protein TRIF activates type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Little is known about how TRIF pathway-dependent gene expression is regulated. SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) is a widely expressed cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase. Here we demonstrate that SHP-2 negatively regulated TLR4- and TLR3-activated IFN-beta production. SHP-2 inhibited TLR3-activated but not TLR2-, TLR7-, and TLR9-activated proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TNF-alpha production. SHP-2 inhibited poly(I:C)-induced cytokine production by a phosphatase activity-independent mechanism. C-terminal domain of SHP-2 directly bound TANK binding kinase (TBK1) by interacting with the kinase domain of TBK1. SHP-2 deficiency increased TBK1-activated IFN-beta and TNF-alpha expression. TBK1 knockdown inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IL-6 production in SHP-2-deficient cells. SHP-2 also inhibited poly(I:C)-induced activation of MAP kinase pathways. These results demonstrate that SHP-2 specifically negatively regulate TRIF-mediated gene expression in TLR signaling, partially through inhibiting TBK1-activated signal transduction.","3563":"The integrin alpha9beta1 is widely expressed on neutrophils, smooth muscle, hepatocytes, endothelia, and some epithelia. We now show that mice lacking this integrin have a dramatic defect in neutrophil development, with decreased numbers of granulocyte precursors in bone marrow and impaired differentiation of bone marrow cells into granulocytes. In response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), alpha9-deficient bone marrow cells or human bone marrow cells incubated with alpha9beta1-blocking antibody demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase. These effects depended on the alpha9 subunit cytoplasmic domain, which was required for formation of a physical complex between alpha9beta1 and ligated G-CSF receptor. Integrin alpha9beta1 was required for granulopoiesis and played a permissive role in the G-CSF-signaling pathway, suggesting that this integrin could play an important role in disorders of granulocyte development and other conditions characterized by defective G-CSF signaling.","3564":"To identify interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing cells in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse where an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) green fluorescence protein (GFP) element was inserted immediately before the polyadenylation site of the IL-10 gene. GFP fluorescence in cells from these mice was found to correlate positively with IL-10 protein expression. With this model, we found that after multiple T cell receptor (TCR) stimulations, strong expression of IL-10 was produced specifically by intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in the small intestine and colonic lamina propria lymphocytes (cLPL). We found that anti-CD3 treatment induces T regulatory cell 1 (Tr1)-like cells in small intestinal IEL (sIEL) and led to the accumulation of naturally occurring regulatory T (nTreg) cells in colonic LPL (cLPL). These findings highlight the intestine as a unique site for induction of IL-10-producing T cells, which play a critical role in the regulation of inflammation in the gut.","3565":"Nedd4 family interacting protein-1 (Ndfip1) is a protein whose only known function is that it binds Nedd4, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we show that mice lacking Ndfip1 developed severe inflammation of the skin and lung and died prematurely. This condition was due to a defect in Ndfip1(-\/-) T cells. Ndfip1(-\/-) T cells were activated, and they proliferated and adopted a T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype more readily than did their Ndfip1(+\/+) counterparts. This phenotype resembled that of Itchy mutant mice, suggesting that Ndfip1 might affect the function of Itch, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We show that T cell activation promoted both Ndfip1 expression and its association with Itch. In the absence of Ndfip1, JunB half-life was prolonged after T cell activation. Thus, in the absence of Ndfip1, Itch is inactive and JunB accumulates. As a result, T cells produce Th2 cytokines and promote Th2-mediated inflammatory disease.","3566":"After entry into lymph nodes (LNs), B cells migrate to follicles, whereas T cells remain in the paracortex, with each lymphocyte type showing apparently random migration within these distinct areas. Other than chemokines, the factors contributing to this spatial segregation and to the observed patterns of lymphocyte movement are poorly characterized. By combining confocal, electron, and intravital microscopy, we showed that the fibroblastic reticular cell network regulated naive T cell access to the paracortex and also supported and defined the limits of T cell movement within this domain, whereas a distinct follicular dendritic cell network similarly served as the substratum for movement of follicular B cells. These results highlight the central role of stromal microanatomy in orchestrating cell migration within the LN.","3567":"Signal transduction events leading to the survival, differentiation, or apoptosis of cells of the innate or adaptive immune system must be properly coordinated to ensure the normal mounting and termination of immune responses. One of the key transcription factors in immune responses is nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which has been the focus of intense investigation over the past two decades. With the identification of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex and ongoing progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms connecting T cell and B cell receptor proximal signals to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, a cohesive model of antigen receptor (AgR)-dependent signaling to NF-kappaB activation is beginning to emerge. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of research into the mechanisms that regulate AgR-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, with particular focus on the events leading to activation of the IKK complex.","3568":"A fraction of primitive \"lymphoid\" precursors retain plasticity for myeloid differentiation.

(2006) identify evolutionarily conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) upstream of the interferon-gamma gene, then show by using a BAC transgene reporter that CNS-22 is a key regulator of interferon-gamma expression.","3572":"Successful control of viral infection requires the host to eliminate the infecting pathogen without causing overt immunopathology. Here we showed that perforin (Prf1) and granzymes (Gzms) have distinct roles in defensive immunity and immunopathology in a well-established model of viral infection. Both Prf1 and Gzms drastically affected the outcome of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Viral titres increased markedly in both Prf1(-\/-) and Gzma(-\/-)Gzmb(-\/-) mice, but Gzma(-\/-)Gzmb(-\/-) mice recovered and survived infection, whereas Prf1(-\/-) mice did not. Indeed, infected Prf1-deficient hosts developed a fatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like syndrome. This distinction in outcome depended on accumulation of mononuclear cells and T cells in infected Prf1(-\/-) mice. Importantly, blocking experiments that clearly identified tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as the principal contributor to the lethality observed in infected Prf1(-\/-) mice provided support for the clinical potential of such an approach in HLH patients whose disease is triggered by viral infection.","3573":"The major histocompatibility complex class I molecules display peptides (pMHC I) on the cell surface for immune surveillance by CD8(+) T cells. These peptides are generated by proteolysis of intracellular polypeptides by the proteasome in the cytoplasm and then in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP). To define the unknown mechanism of ERAAP function in vivo, we analyzed naturally processed peptides in cells with or without appropriate MHC I and ERAAP. In the absence of MHC I, ERAAP degraded the antigenic precursors in the ER. However, MHC I molecules could bind proteolytic intermediates and were essential for generation of the final peptide by ERAAP. Thus, ERAAP synergizes with MHC I to generate the final pMHC I repertoire.","3574":"Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Janus kinase (Jak) family. Here we identified a homozygous Tyk2 mutation in a patient who had been clinically diagnosed with hyper-IgE syndrome. This patient showed unusual susceptibility to various microorganisms including virus, fungi, and mycobacteria and suffered from atopic dermatitis with elevated serum IgE. The patient's cells displayed defects in multiple cytokine signaling pathways including those for type I interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23. The cytokine signals were successfully restored by transducing the intact Tyk2 gene. Thus, the Tyk2 deficiency is likely to account for the patient's complex clinical manifestations, including the phenotype of impaired T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and accelerated Th2 differentiation. This study identifies human Tyk2 deficiency and demonstrates that Tyk2 plays obligatory roles in multiple cytokine signals involved in innate and acquired immunity of humans, which differs substantially from Tyk2 function in mice.","3575":"The differentiation potential of T lineage cells becomes restricted soon after entry of multipotent precursors into the thymus and is accompanied by a downregulation of the transcription factors C\/EBP alpha and PU.1. To investigate this restriction point, we have expressed C\/EBP alpha and PU.1 in fully committed pre-T cells and found that C\/EBP alpha (and C\/EBP beta) induced the formation of functional macrophages. In contrast, PU.1 converted them into myeloid dendritic cells under identical culture conditions. C\/EBP alpha-induced reprogramming is complex because upregulation of some but not all myelomonocytic markers required endogenous PU.1. Notch signaling partially inhibited C\/EBP alpha-induced macrophage formation and completely blocked PU.1-induced dendritic cell formation. Likewise, expression of intracellular Notch or the transcription factor GATA-3 inhibited C\/EBP alpha-induced lineage conversion. Our data show that committed T cell progenitors remain susceptible to the lineage instructive effects of myeloid transcription factors and suggest that Notch signaling induces T lineage restriction by downregulating C\/EBP alpha and PU.1 in multilineage precursors.","3576":"LAB (linker for activation of B cells), also known as NTAL (non-T cell activation linker), is a LAT (linker for activation of T cells)-like adaptor protein that is expressed in B, NK, and mast cells. Its role in lymphocytes has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we showed that aged LAB-deficient (Lat2(-\/-)) mice developed an autoimmune syndrome. Lat2(-\/-) T cells were hyperactivated and produced more cytokines than Lat2(+\/+) T cells. Even though LAB was absent in naive T cells, LAB could be detected in activated Lat2(+\/+) T cells. LAT-mediated signaling events were enhanced in Lat2(-\/-) T cells; however, they were suppressed in T cells that overexpressed LAB. Mice with the Lat2 gene conditionally deleted from T cells also developed the autoimmune syndrome like Lat2(-\/-) mice. Together, these data demonstrated an important role of LAB in limiting autoimmune response and exposed a mechanism regulating T cell activation.","3577":"T cell activation through the T cell receptor (TCR) is subsequently modified by secondary signals that are either stimulatory or inhibitory. We show that CEACAM1 adhesion molecule isoforms containing a long cytoplasmic domain inhibited multiple T cell functions as a consequence of TCR ligation. Overexpression of CEACAM1 resulted in decreased proliferation, allogeneic reactivity, and cytokine production in vitro and delayed type hypersensitivity and inflammatory bowel disease in mouse models in vivo. Conditioned deletion of CEACAM1 in T cells caused increased TCR-CD3 complex signaling. This T cell regulation was dependent upon the presence of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIM) within the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 and the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine-phosphatase 1 (SHP1) in the T cell. Thus, CEACAM1 overexpression or deletion in T cells resulted in T cell inhibition or activation, respectively, revealing a role for CEACAM1 as a class of inhibitory receptors potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation.","3578":"Cellular interactions promoting the in vivo expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells for maintenance of immune tolerance remain poorly defined. Here we report that mobilized Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+) (LSK) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), unlike medullary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), selectively drove the direct, immediate expansion of functional host-derived Treg cells, thereby preventing the progression to overt spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice. Treg cell expansion required cell-to-cell contact and Notch3 signaling, which was mediated selectively through the Notch ligand Jagged2 expressed by the multipotent HPC subset, as assessed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing. Conversely, notwithstanding their similar multilineage microchimerism, neither sorted Jagged2(-) HPCs nor Jagged2(lo) medullary HSCs were able to expand Treg cells. These data provide evidence for a productive Notch-mediated interaction between a unique subset of mobilized hematopoietic progenitors and Treg cells. They open therapeutic perspectives for autologous transplantation of Jagged2(+) LSK progenitors to promote Treg cell expansion in T cell-mediated diseases.","3579":"The costimulatory molecule CTLA-4 is a potent downregulator of T cell responses. Although localized mostly in intracellular compartments, little is understood regarding the mechanism that regulates its transport to the cell surface. In this study, we demonstrated that the adaptor TRIM (T cell receptor-interacting molecule) bound to CTLA-4 in the trans Golgi network (TGN) and promoted transport of CTLA-4 to the surface of T cells. Increased TRIM expression augmented surface CTLA-4 expression, and pulse-chase analysis showed a more rapid transport of CTLA-4 to the cell surface. A reduction of TRIM expression by small hairpin RNAs reduced the expression of surface CTLA-4. This resulted in a more localized pattern of CTLA-4 in the TGN. Altered CTLA-4 expression by TRIM was accompanied by corresponding changes in coreceptor-mediated effects on cytokine production and proliferation. Our findings identify a role for TRIM as a chaperone in regulating CTLA-4 expression and function by enhancing CTLA-4 transport to the surface of T cells.","3580":"Chromatin dynamics that regulate Ifng gene expression are incompletely understood. By using cross-species comparative sequence analyses, we have identified conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) upstream of the Ifng gene, one of which, located -22 kb from the transcriptional start site, contains clustered consensus binding sequences of transcription factors that function in T cell differentiation. CNS-22 was uniquely associated with histone modifications typical of accessible chromatin in both T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells and demonstrated significant and selective T-bet (T-box transcription factor expressed in T cells, Tbx21)-dependent binding and enhancer activity in Th1 cells. Deletion of CNS-22 in the context of an Ifng reporter transgene ablated T cell receptor-dependent and -independent Ifng expression in Th1 effectors and similarly blocked expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Thus, a single distal element may be essential for Ifng gene expression by both innate and adaptive immune effector cell lineages.","3581":"While T cells respond directly to toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, TLR-signaling pathways in T cells are poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate in CD4(+) T cells that CpG DNA directly enhances proliferation, prevents anergy, and augments humoral responses to a T cell-dependent antigen by a Myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase)-dependent pathway. PI-3 kinase activation required a putative Src-homology domain (SH2) binding motif in the MyD88 Toll-Like or IL-1 Receptor (TIR) domain. Reconstitution of MyD88-deficient primary T cells with a MyD88 transgene mutated in this motif abrogated association of PI-3 kinase with MyD88, phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and Glycogen Synthetase Kinase-3 (GSK-3), and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. The MyD88 death domain, on the other hand, was required for NF-kB activation and survival. These studies identify a MyD88-dependent PI-3 kinase-signaling pathway in T cells that differentiates CpG DNA-mediated proliferation from survival and is required for an in vivo T cell-dependent immune response.","3582":"Antiviral CD8(+) T cells respond to only a minute fraction of the potential peptide determinants encoded by viral genomes. Immunogenic determinants can be ordered into highly reproducible hierarchies based on the magnitude of cognate CD8(+) T cell responses. Until recently, this phenomenon, termed immunodominance, was largely defined and characterized in model systems utilizing a few strains of inbred mice infected with a handful of viruses with limited coding capacity. Here, I review work that has extended immunodominance studies to viruses of greater complexity and to the real world of human antiviral immunity.","3583":"The mosquito fights malaria to the incidental benefit of humans. In this issue, define states of \"basal\" and \"induced\" immunity and show that a single genetic manipulation can rid the mosquito of a noxious parasite.","3584":"The contribution of MyD88 adaptor-mediated signaling in immune responses to fungi is largely unexplored. In this issue of Immunity, show that MyD88 is dispensable in several aspects of dendritic-cell trafficking and T cell differentiation in response to a respiratory fungus.","3585":"In this issue of Immunity, provide new in vivo insights into the concept that antigen recognition by TLR is more than APC costimulation and regulates antigen processing and presentation to create specific microbial immunity.","3586":"How are extracellular proteins cross-presented on MHC class I molecules? In this issue of Immunity, demonstrate that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) export pathway operates in the phagosomes of dendritic cells and transfers antigens into the MHC class I pathway.","3587":"In this issue of Immunity, demonstrate a spectrum of dynamic conformation changes, from a bent form to extended forms, in extracellular domains in alpha(X)beta(2) and alpha(L)beta(2) upon separation of the alpha and beta subunits, providing structural evidence for activation of leukocyte integrins.","3588":"The signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family includes homophilic and heterophilic receptors that regulate both innate and adaptive immunity. The ectodomains of most SLAM family members are composed of an N-terminal IgV domain and a C-terminal IgC2 domain. NK-T-B-antigen (NTB-A) is a homophilic receptor that stimulates cytotoxicity in natural killer (NK) cells, regulates bactericidal activities in neutrophils, and potentiates T helper 2 (Th2) responses. The 3.0 A crystal structure of the complete NTB-A ectodomain revealed a rod-like monomer that self-associates to form a highly kinked dimer spanning an end-to-end distance of approximately 100 A. The NTB-A homophilic and CD2-CD58 heterophilic dimers show overall structural similarities but differ in detailed organization and physicochemical properties of their respective interfaces. The NTB-A structure suggests a mechanism responsible for binding specificity within the SLAM family and imposes physical constraints relevant to the colocalization of SLAM-family proteins with other signaling molecules in the immunological synapse.","3589":"Casitas B cell lymphoma (Cbl) proteins are negative regulators for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. Their role in thymocyte development remains unclear. Here we show that simultaneous inactivation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b in thymocytes enhanced thymic negative selection and altered the ratio of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Strikingly, the mutant thymocytes developed into CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-lineage T cells independent of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), indicating that the CD4(+)- and CD8(+)-lineage development programs are constitutively active in the absence of c-Cbl and Cbl-b. The mutant double-positive (DP) thymocytes exhibited spontaneous hyperactivation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). Additionally, they failed to downregulate the pre-TCR and pre-TCR signaling. Thus, our data indicate that Cbl proteins play a critical role in establishing the MHC-dependent CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell development programs. They likely do so by suppressing MHC-independent NF-kappaB activation, possibly through downmodulating pre-TCR signaling in DP thymocytes.","3590":"We used negative stain electron microscopy (EM) to examine the conformational changes in the ectodomains required for activation of the leukocyte integrins alpha(X)beta(2) and alpha(L)beta(2). They transitioned between a bent conformation and two extended conformations in which the headpiece was in either a closed or an open state. Extended integrins exhibited marked flexibility at the alpha subunit genu and between integrin epidermal growth factor-like (I-EGF) domains 1 and 2. A clasp to mimic juxtamembrane association between the integrin alpha and beta subunits stabilized the bent conformation strongly for alpha(X)beta(2) and less so for alpha(L)beta(2). A small molecule allosteric antagonist induced the extended, open headpiece conformation. A Fab known to activate beta(2) integrins on leukocytes induced extension, and a Fab reporter of activation bound only after extension had been induced. The results establish an intimate relationship between extension of beta(2) integrins and their activation in immune responses and leukocyte trafficking.","3591":"The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) receptor (CD74) was cloned recently, but the signaling mechanism is not evident. We hypothesized that signaling requires an additional molecule such as CD44, which activates nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We utilized the CD74- and CD44-deficient COS-7\/M6 cell to create stable transfectants expressing CD74, CD44, and a truncated CD44 lacking its intracytoplasmic signaling domain. CD74 alone mediated MIF binding; however, MIF-induced ERK1 and ERK2 kinase phosphorylation required the coexpression of full-length CD44. MIF binding was associated with the serine phosphorylation of CD74 and CD44. Investigations that used siRNA or kinase inhibitors indicate that MIF-induced ERK1 and ERK2 activation through CD44 required the Src tyrosine kinase. Studies of CD74, CD44, and CD74-CD44 transformants and corresponding mutant cells showed that CD74 and CD44 were necessary for MIF protection from apoptosis. These data establish CD44 as an integral member of the CD74 receptor complex leading to MIF signal transduction.","3592":"The immune system preserves and makes use of autoreactive lymphocytes with specialized functions. Here we showed that one of these populations, CD8alphaalpha(+)TCRalphabeta(+) intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), arose from a unique subset of double-positive thymocytes. This subset of cells was precommitted to preferentially give rise to CD8alphaalpha(+)TCRalphabeta(+) IELs, but they required exposure to self-agonist peptides. The agonist-selected TCRalphabeta(+) thymocytes are CD4 and CD8 double-negative, and their final maturation, including the induction of CD8alphaalpha expression, appeared to occur only after thymus export in the IL-15-rich environment of the gut. These developmental steps, including precommitment of immature thymocytes, TCR-mediated agonist selection, and postthymic differentiation promoted by cytokines, define a unique pathway for the generation of CD8alphaalpha(+)TCRalphabeta(+) IEL.","3593":"Secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) promote primary immune responses by recruiting naive lymphocytes and activated APCs. However, their role in the persistence or responsiveness of memory lymphocytes is unclear. We tested whether memory cells were maintained and could respond to challenge in the absence of SLOs. We found that influenza-specific CD8 cells in the lung acquired a memory phenotype, underwent homeostatic proliferation, recirculated through nonlymphoid tissues, and responded to and cleared a challenge infection in the complete absence of SLOs. Similarly, influenza-specific virus-neutralizing antibody was generated and maintained in the absence of SLOs. Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) was also formed in the lungs of previously infected mice and may provide a niche for the maintenance of memory cells at the local level. These data show that SLOs are dispensable for the maintenance of immunologic memory and directly demonstrate the utility of local tissues, such as iBALT, in secondary immune responses.","3594":"Anopheles gambiae, the major vector for the protozoan malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, mounts powerful antiparasitic responses that cause marked parasite loss during midgut invasion. Here, we showed that these antiparasitic defenses were composed of pre- and postinvasion phases and that the preinvasion phase was predominantly regulated by Rel1 and Rel2 members of the NF-kappaB transcription factors. Concurrent silencing of Rel1 and Rel2 decreased the basal expression of the major antiparasitic genes TEP1 and LRIM1 and abolished resistance of Anopheles to the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei. Conversely, depletion of a negative regulator of Rel1, Cactus, prior to infection, enhanced the basal expression of TEP1 and of other immune factors and completely prevented parasite development. Our findings uncover the crucial role of the preinvasion defense in the elimination of parasites, which is at least in part based on circulating blood molecules.","3595":"Crosspresentation of exogenous antigens (Ags) to CD8(+) T cells by dendritic cells generally requires their entry into the cytosol. Here we show that both soluble and phagocytosed extracellular Ags accessed the cytosol via molecular components required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD). Exogenous Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A, which inhibits protein translocation from the ER to the cytosol, abrogated crosspresentation. Exotoxin A also prevented the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) inhibitor, ICP47, from entering the cytosol and blocking TAP-mediated peptide transport. In an in vitro model of retrotranslocation, the AAA ATPase p97, an enzyme critical for ERAD, was the only cytosolic cofactor required for protein export from isolated phagosomes. Functional p97 was also required for crosspresentation but not conventional presentation. Thus, crosspresentation appears to result from an adaptation of the retrotranslocation mechanisms involved in the degradation of misfolded ER proteins.","3596":"Aspergillus fumigatus is a mold that causes a spectrum of diseases, including lethal lung infections in immunocompromised humans and allergic asthma in atopic individuals. T helper 1 (Th1) CD4(+) T cells protect against invasive A. fumigatus infections whereas Th2 CD4(+) T cells exacerbate asthma upon inhalation of A. fumigatus spores. Herein, we demonstrate that A. fumigatus-specific T cells were rapidly primed in lymph nodes draining the lung and fully differentiated into interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing Th1 CD4(+) T cells upon arrival in the airways. T-bet induction in A. fumigatus-specific CD4(+) T cells was enhanced by MyD88-mediated signals in draining lymph nodes, but T cell proliferation, trafficking, and Th1 differentiation in the airways were Toll-like receptor (TLR) and MyD88 independent. Our studies demonstrate that CD4(+) T cell differentiation during respiratory fungal infection occurs incrementally, with TLR-mediated signals in the lymph node enhancing the potential for IFN-gamma production whereas MyD88-independent signals promote Th1 differentiation in the lung.","3597":"In addition to their bridging function between innate and adaptive immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) may also contribute to primary resistance against infection. Here we analyzed the role of DCs during infection with Listeria monocytogenes by performing systemic in vivo depletion of these cells. We showed that CD8alpha(+) DCs were crucial for L. monocytogenes spreading and proliferation in the spleen. Efficient and rapid uptake of L. monocytogenes by CD8alpha(+) DCs required the small GTPase Rac1 and is a general characteristic of this DC subpopulation in filtering particles out of the blood. Thus, CD8alpha(+) DCs appear to play an important role for efficient bacterial entry into the spleen, which is of relevance for subsequent immune responses.","3598":"Although Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) play a major function in innate recognition of pathogens, their role in antigen processing and presentation in vivo is poorly understood. Here we establish that Toxoplasma gondii profilin, a TLR11 ligand present in the parasite, is an immunodominant antigen in the CD4(+) T cell response to the pathogen. The immunogenicity of profilin was entirely dependent on both TLR11 recognition and signaling through the adaptor myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Selective responsiveness to this parasite protein was regulated at the level of antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DC) and required both TLR signaling and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II recognition acting in cis. These findings support a major influence of TLR recognition in antigen presentation by DC in vivo and establish a mechanism by which TLR ligand association regulates the immunogenicity of microbial antigens.","3599":"Class-switch recombination (CSR) is essential for humoral immunity. However, the regulation of CSR is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) actively suppressed the onset and frequency of CSR in primary B cells. Consistently, mice lacking the lipid phosphatase, PTEN, in B cells exhibited a hyper-IgM condition due to impaired CSR, which could be restored in vitro by specific inhibition of PI3Kdelta. Inhibition of CSR by PI3K was partially dependent on the transcription factor, BLIMP1, linking plasma cell commitment and cessation of CSR. PI3K-dependent activation of the serine-threonine kinase, Akt, suppressed CSR, in part, through the inactivation of the Forkhead Box family (Foxo) of transcription factors. Reduced PI3K signaling enhanced the expression of AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) and accelerated CSR. However, ectopic expression of AID could not fully overcome inhibition of CSR by PI3K, suggesting that PI3K regulates both the expression and function of AID.","3600":"To determine how transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) controls T cell function, Marie et al. (2006) and Li et al. (2006a) created mice with T cells lacking TGF-beta signaling receptors. Both report that TGF-beta signaling by T cells is absolutely essential for tolerance and homeostasis.","3601":"The reason certain self-antigens are consistently targeted by autoantibodies may be because they are self-adjuvants. Two papers in this issue of Immunity provide important insights into the contribution of Toll-like receptors in systemic autoimmune disease (Berland et al., 2006; Christensen et al., 2006).","3602":"Two recent Immunity articles (Enzler et al., 2006; Sasaki et al., 2006) probe the roles of Nuclear Factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) pathways in survival and differentiation mediated by B cell activation factor of the TNF family (BAFF).","3603":"In this issue of Immunity, Bezbradica et al., (2006) uncover an unsuspected role for the cytokine GM-CSF in the thymic development of invariant NKT cells, a role that licenses these cells to secrete effector cytokines upon activation in the periphery.","3604":"Different genetic alterations may lead to type I interferon (IFN) overproduction in human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The increased bioavailability of type I IFN contributes to peripheral tolerance breakdown through the activation of immature myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). IFN-matured mDCs activate autoreactive T cells. These cells, together with plasmacytoid DCs, help expand autoreactive B cells. IFN-matured DCs also activate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, possibly increasing apoptotic cell availability. The capture of apoptotic cells by mDCs and of nucleic acid-containing immune complexes by plasmacytoid DCs and B cells amplifies the autoimmune reaction leading to disease manifestations. Genetic alterations in lineages other than B cells might explain other autoimmune syndromes where type I IFNs appear to be involved.","3605":"Type I interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines specialized to coordinate immunity to viruses and other intracellular infections. In the past several years, many of the receptors and signaling pathways that link pathogen detection to induction of type I IFNs have been identified and characterized. An integrated picture has emerged in which type I IFNs have essential functions in several seemingly disparate processes: they restrict viral spread by engaging machinery that ultimately cripples and kills infected cells, yet they are also positively linked to the activation and expansion of lymphocytes that are important for control of intracellular infections. These advances highlight the context-specific actions of type I IFNs and clarify the multiple points at which they are integrated into both innate and adaptive immunity.","3606":"The type I interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines that regulate many different cellular functions. The major signaling pathway activated by type I IFNs involves sequential phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, providing the primary mechanism through which gene expression is induced. Recent work has shown that the responses are quite complex, as shown by different responses to specific subtypes of type I IFN, activation of kinases in addition to JAKs, patterns of activation of all seven STATs in different cells, and activation of transcription factors other than STATs. The type I IFNs use this complexity to regulate many different biological functions in different types of cells, by activating different specific signals and patterns of gene expression.","3607":"Induction of type I interferons (IFNs) by viruses and other pathogens is crucial for innate immunity, and it is mediated by the activation of pattern-recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors and cytosolic receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5. The type I IFN induction is primarily controlled at the gene transcriptional level, wherein a family of transcription factors, interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), plays central roles. Here, we summarize the recent studies on IRFs, providing a paradigm of how genes are ingeniously regulated during immune responses. We also consider some evolutional aspects on the IFN-IRF system.","3608":"Nearly half a century has passed since the first published description of interferons (IFNs). This commentary introduces the four accompanying review articles on type I IFN research and attempts to relate how the field of IFN research has been changing during its history.","3609":"Expression of B cell-activating factor (BAFF), a critical B cell survival factor, is elevated in autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. Mice overproducing BAFF develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like disease and exhibit B cell activation of classical and alternative NF-kappaB-signaling pathways. We used a genetic approach and found that both NF-kappaB-signaling pathways contributed to disease development but act through distinct mechanisms. Whereas BAFF enhanced long-term B cell survival primarily through the alternative, but not the classical, NF-kappaB pathway, it promoted immunoglobulin class switching and generation of pathogenic antibodies through the classical pathway. Activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway resulted in integrin upregulation, thereby retaining autoreactive B cells in the splenic marginal zone, a compartment that contributes to their survival. Thus, both classical and alternative NF-kappaB signaling are important for development of lupus-like disease associated with BAFF overproduction. The same mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of human SLE.","3610":"Antibodies (Abs) to RNA- and DNA-containing autoantigens are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We showed previously that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, recognizing DNA, is required for the spontaneous generation of DNA autoantibodies, but not for the development of lupus nephritis in susceptible mice. We report that lupus-prone mice deficient in TLR7, a receptor for ssRNA, failed to generate Abs to RNA-containing antigens (Ags) such as Smith (Sm) Ag. TLR9 and TLR7 also had dramatic effects on clinical disease in lupus-prone mice. In the absence of TLR9, autoimmune disease was exacerbated, lymphocytes and plasmacytoid DCs were more activated, and serum IgG and IFN-alpha were increased. In contrast, TLR7-deficient mice had ameliorated disease, decreased lymphocyte activation, and decreased serum IgG. These findings reveal opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles for TLR7 and TLR9, despite similar tissue expression and signaling pathways. These results have important implications for TLR-directed therapy of autoimmune disease.","3611":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the production of autoantibodies that are frequently directed against nucleic acid-associated antigens. To better understand how B cells reactive with such antigens are regulated, we generated a model system in which heavy and light chain genes encoding 564 immunoglobulin have been targeted to the heavy and light chain loci of the nonautoimmune C57BL\/6 mouse strain. This antibody recognizes RNA, single-stranded DNA, and nucleosomes. We show that B cells expressing this immunoglobulin were activated, producing class-switched autoantibody in vivo despite the apparently normal induction of anergy. This autoantibody production was largely dependent on Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). We further show that production of these autoantibodies was sufficient to cause kidney pathology in these mice. These results demonstrate that the particular threat of nucleic acid-containing autoantigens lies in their ability to bind both antigen receptor and TLR7.","3612":"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been implicated in the control of differentiation and proliferation of multiple cell types. However, a role for TGF-beta in the control of immune homeostasis is not fully understood because of its pleiotropic action. Here we report that complete ablation of the TGF-beta signaling in T cells engendered aggressive early-onset, multiorgan, autoimmune-associated lesions with 100% mortality. Peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with TGF-beta-receptor II (TGF-betaRII) deficiency activated cytolytic and T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation program in a cell-intrinsic T cell receptor (TCR)-specific fashion. Furthermore, TGF-betaRII deficiency blocked the development of canonical CD1d-restricted NKT cells. Instead, it facilitated generation of a highly pathogenic T cell subset exhibiting multiple hallmarks of NK cells and sharply elevated amounts of FasL, perforin, granzymes, and interferon-gamma. Thus, TGF-beta signaling in peripheral T cells is crucial in restraining TCR activation-dependent Th1, cytotoxic, and NK cell-like differentiation program which, when left unchecked, leads to rapidly progressing fatal autoimmunity.","3613":"The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in inhibiting T cell functions has been studied with dominant-negative TGF-beta receptor transgenic models; however, the full impact of TGF-beta signaling on T cells and the mechanisms by which TGF-beta signals remain poorly understood. Here we show that mice with T cell-specific deletion of TGF-beta receptor II developed lethal inflammation associated with T cell activation and differentiation. In addition, TGF-beta signaling positively regulated T cell development and homeostasis. Development of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells, maintenance of peripheral Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells, and survival of CD4+ T cells all depended on TGF-beta signaling. Both T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation and survival of activated CD4+ T cells required T-bet, the TGF-beta-regulated transcription factor, which controlled CD122 expression and IL-15 signaling in Th1 cells. This study reveals pleiotropic functions of TGF-beta signaling in T cells that may ensure a diverse and self-tolerant T cell repertoire in vivo.","3614":"After viral infection, activated T cells are present in multiple tissues regardless of the infection route. How these cells acquire pleiotropic homing ability is unclear. By using a cutaneous vaccinia virus infection model, we demonstrate that regulation of T cell trafficking is multiphasic. Upon completion of three cell divisions, CD8+ T cells upregulated specific skin-homing molecules within draining lymph nodes (LN). By 60 hr after infection, some activated T cells reached the infected tissue, while others entered distant antigen-free LN. These latter cells continued to divide and acquire additional tissue-homing molecules in this new setting, independent of antigen presentation. After viral clearance, the initial skin-homing imprint became the predominant homing phenotype on memory cells and provided superior protection against secondary cutaneous challenge. These observations demonstrate a mechanism by which T cells provide both immediate tissue-specific immune control at the pathogen entry site and a more flexible systemic protection against pathogen dissemination.","3615":"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell-derived cytokines have important functions in inflammation, host defense, and immunoregulation. Yet, when and how iNKT cells undergo effector differentiation, which endows them with the capacity to rapidly secrete cytokines upon activation, remains unknown. We discovered that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Csf-2)-deficient mice developed iNKT cells that failed to respond to the model antigen alpha-galactosylceramide because of an intrinsic defect in the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. Exogenous Csf-2 corrected the functional defect only when supplied during the development of thymic, but not mature, splenic Csf-2-deficient iNKT cells. Thus, we ascribe a unique function to Csf-2, which regulates iNKT cell effector differentiation during development by a mechanism that renders them competent for cytokine secretion.","3616":"In this study, we determined conditions leading to the development of colitis in mice with nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) deficiency, a susceptibility factor in Crohn's disease. We found that NOD2-deficient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) produced increased amounts of interleukin (IL)-12 in the presence of ovalbumin (OVA) peptide and peptidoglycan or recombinant E. coli that express OVA peptide (ECOVA). Furthermore, these APCs elicited heightened interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses from cocultured OVA-specific CD4+ T cells. We then demonstrated that NOD2-deficient mice adoptively transferred OVA-specific CD4+ T cells and that administered intrarectal ECOVA developed colitis associated with the expansion of OVA-specific CD4+ T cells producing IFN-gamma. Importantly, this colitis was highly dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) function since it was suppressed in NOD2 and TLR2 double-deficient mice. Thus, NOD2-deficient mice become susceptible to colitis as a result of increased TLR2 responses when they have the capacity to respond to an antigen expressed by mucosal bacteria.","3617":"The development of spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is preceded by the organization of tertiary lymphoid organ (TLO) in situ, but its role in the development of tissue destruction and the cytokines that control such structures have not been fully defined. We have now observed that TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) is upregulated in aged nonobese diabetic (NOD) pancreas with the appearance of TLO. Blockade of TNFSF14 signaling caused a substantial reduction in the expression of lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR)-controlled migration factors within the islets and disrupts organization of tertiary structures, leading to prevention of diabetes. Consistently, enhancing LTbetaR signaling by transgenic expression of TNFSF14 in the islets of NOD mice rapidly promoted de novo formation of local TLO, resulting in diabetes, even in the absence of draining lymph nodes (LN). Thus, the TNFSF14-LTbetaR pathway appears to be critical in the development and maintenance of TLO for the onset of diabetes.","3618":"Numerous T cell subpopulations have now been claimed to exhibit regulatory activity. Shevach discusses the current understanding of the different subsets of T regulatory cells and provides a perspective on the current areas of uncertainly and controversy in the field.","3619":"","3620":"","3621":"","3622":"","3623":"An Australian newspaper recently bestowed Ian Frazer the title of \"God's gift to women\" for his research team's part in developing a vaccine to help control cervical cancer. Here Frazer discusses this work and the science behind the vaccine.","3624":"SDF-1alpha (CXCL12) signaling via its receptor, CXCR4, stimulates T cell chemotaxis and gene expression. The ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase critically mediates SDF-1alpha-dependent migration and prolonged ERK mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in T cells. However, the molecular mechanism by which CXCR4 or other G protein-coupled receptors activate ZAP-70 has not been characterized. Here we show that SDF-1alpha stimulates the physical association of CXCR4 and the T cell receptor (TCR) and utilizes the ZAP-70 binding ITAM domains of the TCR for signal transduction. This pathway is responsible for several of the effects of SDF-1alpha on T cells, including prolonged ERK MAP kinase activity, increased intracellular calcium ion concentrations, robust AP-1 transcriptional activity, and SDF-1alpha costimulation of cytokine secretion. These results suggest new paradigms for understanding the effects of SDF-1alpha and other chemokines on immunity.","3625":"Molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination of isotype switching with plasma cell differentiation are poorly understood. We show that interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) regulates both processes by controlling the expression of the Aicda and Prdm1 genes, which encode AID and Blimp-1, respectively. Genome-wide analysis demonstrated that Irf4(-\/-) B cells failed to induce the entire Blimp-1-dependent plasma cell program. Restoration of AID or Blimp-1 expression in Irf4(-\/-) B cells promoted isotype switching or secretion, respectively. IRF-4 was expressed in a graded manner in differentiating B cells and targeted Prdm1. Higher concentration of IRF-4 induced Prdm1 and consequently the transition from a germinal center gene expression program to that of a plasma cell. We propose a gene-regulatory network in which graded expression of IRF-4 developmentally coordinates isotype switching with plasma cell differentiation.","3626":"The CD40-CD154 pathway is important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Here we show that injection of an agonistic CD40 mAb to T and B cell-deficient mice was sufficient to induce a pathogenic systemic and intestinal innate inflammatory response that was functionally dependent on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma as well as interleukin-12 p40 and interleukin-23 p40 secretion. CD40-induced colitis, but not wasting disease or serum proinflammatory cytokine production, depended on interleukin-23 p19 secretion, whereas interleukin-12 p35 secretion controlled wasting disease and serum cytokine production but not mucosal immunopathology. Intestinal inflammation was associated with IL-23 (p19) mRNA-producing intestinal dendritic cells and IL-17A mRNA within the intestine. Our experiments identified IL-23 as an effector cytokine within the innate intestinal immune system. The differential role of IL-23 in local but not systemic inflammation suggests that it may make a more specific target for the treatment of IBD.","3627":"Although CD95L is required for T cell receptor (TCR)-induced cell death (TCR-ICD) in T helper 1 cells, the molecular mechanisms mediating TCR-ICD in Th2 cells are unknown. We found that death receptors were not involved in TCR-ICD of Th2 cells because blocking their cognate ligands had no effect on apoptosis of activated Th2 cells. Furthermore, we showed that caspases were not actively involved in TCR-ICD of Th2 cells. However, inhibition of granzyme B (GrB) activity abolished TCR-ICD in Th2 cells but not Th1 cells. Likewise, Th2 cells derived from GrB-deficient mice were resistant to TCR-ICD, and GrB deficiency or inhibition of GrB activity consequently enhanced the production of Th2 cytokines. GrB-deficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to allergen-induced asthma. Thus, GrB plays a critical role in the TCR-ICD of Th2 cells.","3628":"The alpha(L)beta(2) integrin (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 [LFA-1]) is regulated to engage and maintain T cell adhesion. Conformational changes in the receptor are associated with changes in receptor-ligand affinity and are necessary for firm adhesion. Less well understood is the relationship between receptor conformation and the regulation of its lateral mobility. We have used fluorescence photobleaching recovery and single-particle tracking to measure the lateral mobility of specific conformations of LFA-1. These measurements show that different receptor conformations have distinct diffusion profiles and that these profiles vary according to the activation state of the cell. Notably, a high-affinity conformation of LFA-1 is mobile on resting cells but immobile on phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-activated cells. This activation-induced immobilization is prevented by a calpain inhibitor and by an allosteric LFA-1 inhibitor. Our results suggest that current models of LFA-1 regulation are incomplete and that LFA-1 confinement by cytoskeletal attachment regulates cell adhesion both negatively and positively.","3629":"Natural killer (NK) cells recognize the absence of self MHC class I as a way to discriminate normal cells from cells in distress. In humans, this \"missing self\" recognition is ensured by inhibitory receptors such as KIR, which dampen NK cell activation upon interaction with their MHC class I ligands. We show here that NK cells lacking inhibitory KIR for self MHC class I molecules are present in human peripheral blood. These cells harbor a mature NK cell phenotype but are hyporesponsive to various stimuli, including MHC class I-deficient target cells. This response is in contrast to NK cells that express a single inhibitory KIR specific for self MHC class I, which are functionally competent when exposed to the same stimuli. These results show the involvement of KIR-MHC class I interactions in the calibration of NK cell effector capacities, suggesting its role in the subsequent \"missing self\" recognition.","3630":"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a primary immunodeficiency that manifests as increased susceptibility to many pathogens. Although the spectrum of infections suffered by WAS patients is consistent with defects in neutrophil (PMN) function, the consequences of WAS protein (WASp) deficiency on this innate immune cell have been unclear. We report that deficiency of WASp in both human and murine PMNs resulted in profound defects in clustering of beta2 integrins, leading to defective adhesion and transendothelial migration under conditions of physiologic shear flow. Wild-type PMNs redistributed clustered beta2 integrins to the uropod of the cell during active migration, whereas WASp-deficient cells remain unpolarized. The WASp-deficient PMNs also showed reduced integrin-dependent activation of degranulation and respiratory burst. PMNs from a WAS patient manifested similar defects in integrin clustering and signaling. These results suggest that impaired beta2 integrin function in WASp-deficient PMNs may contribute substantially to the clinical immunodeficiency suffered by WAS patients.","3631":null,"3632":"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to result from a dysregulated interaction between the host immune system and its commensal microflora. Heterogeneity of disease susceptibility in humans and rodents suggest that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the etiology of IBD. In particular, deficiencies in anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive mechanisms play an important role in the development of IBD. However, it is unknown how the indigenous microflora stimulates the immune system and how this response is regulated. To address these questions, we investigated the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in the development of spontaneous, commensal-dependent colitis in interleukin (IL)-2- and IL-10-deficient mice. We report that colitis was dependent on TLR signaling in Il10(-\/-) mice. In contrast, Il2(-\/-) mice developed intestinal inflammation in the absence of TLR signaling pathways. These results demonstrate a differential role of innate immune recognition by TLRs in the development of commensal-dependent colitis.","3633":"T cells causing autoimmunity must escape tolerance. We observed that CD8(+) T cells with high avidity for an antigen expressed in the pancreas, kidney, and thymic medulla were efficiently removed from a polyclonal repertoire by central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. However, both mechanisms spared low-avidity T cells from elimination. Neither the introduction of activated, self-antigen-specific CD4(+) helper T cells nor a global inflammatory stimulus were sufficient to activate the low-avidity CD8(+) T cells and did not break tolerance. In contrast, challenge with a recombinant bacterium expressing the self antigen primed the low-avidity T cells, and the animals rapidly developed autoimmune diabetes. We suggest that whereas thymic and peripheral tolerance mechanisms remove cells that can be primed by endogenous amounts of self antigen, they do not guard against tissue destruction by low-avidity effector T cells, which have been primed by higher amounts of self antigen or by crossreactive antigens.","3634":"Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells can differentiate from Foxp3(-)CD4(+) medullary thymocytes and Foxp3(-)CD4(+) naive T cells. However, the impact of these two processes on size and composition of the peripheral repertoire of regulatory T cells is unclear. Here we followed the fate of individual Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+) thymocytes and T cells in vivo in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice that express a restricted but polyclonal repertoire of TCRs. By utilizing high-throughput single-cell analysis, we showed that Foxp3(+)CD4(+) peripheral T cells were derived from thymic precursors that expressed a different TCRs than Foxp3(-)CD4(+) medullary thymocytes and Foxp3(-)CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, the diversity of TCRs on Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells exceeded the diversity of TCRs on Foxp3(-)CD4(+) naive T cells, even in mice that lack expression of tissue-specific antigens. Our results imply that higher TCR diversity on Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells helps these cells to match the specificities of autoreactive and naive T cells.","3635":null,"3636":"CD18 integrins promote neutrophil recruitment, and their engagement activates tyrosine kinases, leading to neutrophil activation. However, the significance of integrin-dependent leukocyte activation in vivo has been difficult to prove. Here, in a model of thrombohemorrhagic vasculitis, the CD18 integrin Mac-1 on neutrophils recognized complement C3 deposited within vessel walls and triggered a signaling pathway involving the Src-family kinase Hck and the Syk tyrosine kinase. This led to neutrophil elastase release, causing hemorrhage, fibrin deposition, and thrombosis. Mice genetically deficient in any of these components (C3, Mac-1, Hck, Syk, or elastase) were resistant to disease despite normal tissue neutrophil accumulation. Disease was restored in Mac-1-deficient mice infused with wild-type, but not kinase- or elastase-deficient, neutrophils. Elastase release in the inflamed tissue was reduced in Mac-1-deficient mice, and a deficiency of Mac-1 or the kinases blocked neutrophil elastase release in vitro. These data suggest that Mac-1 engagement of complement activates tyrosine kinases to promote elastase-dependent blood vessel injury in vivo.","3637":"Histocompatibility in the primitive chordate, Botryllus schlosseri, is controlled by a single, highly polymorphic locus, the FuHC. By taking a forward genetic approach, we have identified a locus encoded near the FuHC, called fester, which is polymorphic, polygenic, and inherited in distinct haplotypes. Somatic diversification occurs through extensive alternative splicing, with each individual expressing a unique repertoire of splice forms, both membrane bound and potentially secreted, all expressed in tissues intimately associated with histocompatibility. Functional studies, via both siRNA-mediated knockdown and direct blocking by monoclonal antibodies raised against fester, were able to disrupt predicted histocompatibility outcomes. The genetic and somatic diversity, coupled to the expression and functional data, suggests that fester is a receptor involved in histocompatibility.","3638":"Skin dendritic cells (DCs) are thought to act as key initiators of local T cell immunity. Here we show that after skin infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation required MHC class I-restricted presentation by nonmigratory CD8(+) DCs rather than skin-derived DCs. Despite a lack of direct presentation by migratory DCs, blocking their egress from infected skin substantially inhibited class I-restricted presentation and HSV-specific CTL responses. These results support the argument for initial transport of antigen by migrating DCs, followed by its transfer to the lymphoid-resident DCs for presentation and CTL priming. Given that relatively robust CTL responses were seen with small numbers of skin-emigrant DCs, we propose that this inter-DC antigen transfer functions to amplify presentation across a larger network of lymphoid-resident DCs for efficient T cell activation.","3639":"We evaluated gamma-irradiated Listeria monocytogenes as a killed bacterial vaccine, testing the hypothesis that irradiation preserves antigenic and adjuvant structures destroyed by traditional heat or chemical inactivation. Irradiated Listeria monocytogenes (LM), unlike heat-killed LM, efficiently activated dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors and induced protective T cell responses in mice. Like live LM, irradiated LM induced Toll-like-receptor-independent T cell priming. Cross-presentation of irradiated listerial antigens to CD8(+) T cells involved TAP- and proteasome-dependent cytosolic antigen processing. These results establish that killed LM can induce protective T cell responses, previously thought to require live infection. gamma-irradiation may be potentially applied to numerous bacterial vaccine candidates, and irradiated bacteria could serve as a vaccine platform for recombinant antigens derived from other pathogens, allergens, or tumors.","3640":"Mechanisms of dominant tolerance have evolved within the mammalian immune system to prevent inappropriate immune responses. CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells have emerged as central constituents of this suppressive activity. By using multiphoton intravital microscopy in lymph nodes (LNs) of anesthetized mice, we have analyzed how cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) interact with antigen-presenting target cells in the presence or absence of activated T(reg) cells. Nonregulated CTLs killed their targets at a 6.6-fold faster rate than regulated CTLs. In spite of this compromised effector activity, regulated CTLs exhibited no defect in proliferation, induction of cytotoxic effector molecules and secretory granules, in situ motility, or ability to form antigen-dependent conjugates with target cells. Only granule exocytosis by CTLs was markedly impaired in the presence of T(reg) cells. This selective form of regulation did not require prolonged contact between CTLs and T(reg) cells but depended on CTL responsiveness to transforming growth factor-beta. CTLs quickly regained full killing capacity in LNs upon selective removal of T(reg) cells. Thus, T(reg) cells reversibly suppress CTL-mediated immunity by allowing acquisition of full effector potential but withholding the license to kill.","3641":"T cell receptor (TCR) signaling is initiated and sustained in microclusters; however, it's not known whether signaling also occurs in the TCR-rich central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). We showed that the cSMAC formed by fusion of microclusters contained more CD45 than microclusters and is a site enriched in lysobisphosphatidic acid, a lipid involved in sorting ubiquitinated membrane proteins for degradation. Calcium signaling via TCR was blocked within 2 min by anti-MHCp treatment and 1 min by latrunculin-A treatment. TCR-MHCp interactions in the cSMAC survived these perturbations for 10 min and hence were not sufficient to sustain signaling. TCR microclusters were also resistant to disruption by anti-MHCp and latrunculin-A treatments. We propose that TCR signaling is sustained by stabilized microclusters and is terminated in the cSMAC, a structure from which TCR are sorted for degradation. Our studies reveal a role for F-actin in TCR signaling beyond microcluster formation.","3642":"Mutations affecting the Tec kinases Itk and Rlk decrease T cell receptor-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and Erk kinase activation and impair both positive and negative thymic selection. Itk(-\/-) and Rlk(-\/-)Itk(-\/-) mice also have decreased CD4:8 T cell ratios, suggestive of altered CD4:8 lineage commitment. Nonetheless, we find that CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes and peripheral CD8(+) T cells in these mice do not resemble conventional CD8(+) T cells. Instead, these cells express memory markers, rapidly produce interferon-gamma, and can be selected on hematopoietically derived cells, similar to MHC class Ib-restricted \"innate-type\" lymphocytes. Itk deficiency also greatly increases the number of cells selected by MHC class Ib. Expression of a hypersensitive Erk2 mutant partially corrects the CD8(+) T cell phenotypes in Itk(-\/-) mice, arguing that altered signaling permits development of this innate-type CD8(+) cell population. Our results suggest that Tec kinases differentially regulate development of conventional versus nonconventional lymphocytes.","3643":"The Tec family tyrosine kinases, Itk and Rlk, are expressed in thymocytes and peripheral T cells and regulate thresholds of T cell receptor signaling. Yet little is known about the specific role of Itk- and Rlk-dependent signals in CD8(+) T cell maturation. We show here that Itk(-\/-) and Rlk(-\/-)Itk(-\/-) mice were nearly devoid of conventional CD8(+) T cells and, instead, contained a large population of CD8(+) T cells that bear striking similarity to lineages of innate lymphocytes. Itk(-\/-) and Rlk(-\/-)Itk(-\/-) CD8(+) thymocytes and T cells were CD44(hi), CD122(+), and NK1.1(+); were able to produce interferon-gamma directly ex vivo; and were dependent on interleukin-15. Itk(-\/-) and Rlk(-\/-)Itk(-\/-) CD8(+) thymocytes expressed abundant transcripts for the T box transcription factor, eomesodermin, correlating with their phenotype and function. These data indicate a critical role for Itk and Rlk in conventional CD8(+) T cell development in the thymus.","3644":"The paradigm to explain antigen-dependent T cell receptor (TCR) signaling is based on the activation of the CD4 or CD8 coreceptor-associated kinase Lck. It is widely assumed that this paradigm is also applicable to signaling by bacterial superantigens. However, these bacterial toxins can activate human T cells lacking Lck, suggesting the existence of an additional pathway of TCR signaling. Here we showed that this alternative pathway operates in the absence of Lck-dependent tyrosine-phosphorylation events and was initiated by the TCR-dependent activation of raft-enriched heterotrimeric Galpha11 proteins. This event, in turn, activated a phospholipase C-beta and protein kinase C-mediated cascade that turned on the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2, triggered Ca(2+) influx, and translocated the transcription factors NF-AT and NF-kappaB to the nucleus, ultimately inducing the production of interleukin-2 in Lck-deficient T cells. The triggering of this alternative pathway by superantigens suggests that these toxins use a G protein-coupled receptor as a coreceptor on T cells.","3645":"In addition to the tyrosines of the Igalpha and beta immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), the evolutionarily conserved Igalpha non-ITAM tyrosine 204 becomes phosphorylated upon antigen recognition by the B cell receptor (BCR). Here we demonstrate that splenic B cells from mice with a targeted mutation of Igalpha Y204 exhibited an isolated defect in T cell-independent B cell activation, proliferation, and antibody response upon BCR engagement, yet normal BCR capping, antigen internalization, antigen presentation, and T cell-dependent antibody production. Mutant B cells, present in normal numbers, exhibited unimpaired BCR-induced spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation but reduced B cell linker protein (BLNK) phosphorylation, calcium flux, and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. These results suggest that Igalpha non-ITAM tyrosine 204 promotes a distinct cellular response, namely T-independent B cell proliferation and differentiation via phosphorylation of the adaptor BLNK.","3646":"The immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire is generated by somatic rearrangement of variable (V(H)), diversity (D(H)), and joining (J(H)) elements. It can be further diversified by V(H) replacement, where nonrearranged V(H) genes invade preexisting V(H)D(H)J(H) joints. To study the impact and mechanism of V(H) replacement, we generated mice in which antibody production depends on the replacement of a nonproductive V(H)D(H)J(H) rearrangement inserted into its physiological position in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. In these mice a highly diverse heavy chain repertoire resulted from V(H) replacement and a second process of noncanonical V(D)J recombination, direct V(H) to J(H) joining. V(H) replacement rarely generated detectable sequence duplications but often proceeded through recombination between the conserved homologous sequences at the 3' end of V(H). Thus, V(H) replacement is an efficient mechanism of antibody diversification, and its impact on the overall antibody repertoire could be greater than anticipated because it frequently leaves no molecular footprint.","3647":"DNA polymerases mu (pol mu), lambda (pol lambda), and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) are enzymes of the pol X family that share homology in sequence and functional domain organization. We showed previously that pol mu participates in light chain but surprisingly not heavy chain gene rearrangement. We show here that immunoglobulin heavy chain junctions from pol lambda-deficient animals have shorter length with normal N-additions, thus indicating that pol lambda is recruited during heavy chain rearrangement at a step that precedes the action of TdT. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, analysis of animals with combined inactivation of these enzymes revealed no overlapping or compensatory activities for V(D)J recombination between pol mu, pol lambda, and TdT. This complex usage of polymerases with distinct catalytic specificities may correspond to the specific function that the third hypervariable region assumes for each immunoglobulin chain, with pol lambda maintaining a large heavy chain junctional heterogeneity and pol mu ensuring a restricted light chain junctional variability.","3648":"Although inflammatory cytokines induced by infection or vaccination with adjuvants have long been known to stimulate optimal antigen-presenting cell function, recent evidence indicates that some inflammatory cytokines also act directly on the responding T cells to control their response to infection. Here, we review the evidence that specific inflammatory cytokines act to control the magnitude of expansion, the degree of contraction, and the rate of memory cell development. These data may suggest new strategies for manipulating vaccine efficacy in the quest to protect against pathogenic microbes.","3649":"In this issue, Allan et al. (2006) conclude that transport of herpes-virus antigens to lymph nodes by dendritic cells is crucial for antiviral immunity, but migrating DCs do not present herpes antigens to CD8(+) lymphocytes.","3650":"In Botryllus schlosseri, a highly polymorphic allorecognition system limits the potential for vascular fusion by genetically dissimilar, adjacent colonies.

(2006) report that in the synapses between T cells and planar bilayers, T cell receptor (TCR) proximal signaling takes place in peripheral TCR-microclusters that form continually and that TCR signaling ceases when they fuse with the central supramolecular activation cluster.","3652":"In this issue of Immunity, studies from Atherly et al (2006) and Broussard et al. (2006) show that mice deficient in Tec kinases support development of a population of CD8(+) T cells with \"innate-immune\" properties. The similarity of these cells to NKT and MHC-class-Ib-restricted T cells suggests a common developmental pathway.","3653":"DNA transactions of a wide variety generally require three major types of enzymatic activities: nucleases, polymerases, and ligases. V(D)J recombination is no exception. In this issue, Bertocci et al. (2006) have provided new insight by generating mice deficient in one or more of the polymerases.","3654":"Signals transduced by Notch receptors are indispensable for T cell specification and differentiation of alphabeta T lineage cells. However, the role of Notch signals during alphabeta versus gammadelta T lineage decision remains controversial. Here, we addressed this question by employing a clonal analysis of CD4(-)CD8(-) (DN) progenitor potential to position the divergence of alphabeta and gammadelta T cell lineages to the late DN2 to DN3 developmental stages. Accordingly, alphabeta and gammadelta precursor frequencies within these T cell progenitor subsets were determined, both in the presence and absence of Notch signaling through Delta-like 1. Notch signals were found to be critical for the DN to CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) transition, irrespective of the identity (pTalphabeta or gammadelta) of the inducing T cell receptor complex, whereas gammadelta T cells developed from gammadeltaTCR-expressing T cell progenitors in the absence of further Notch ligand interaction. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a differential, stage-specific requirement for Notch receptor-ligand interactions in the differentiation of alphabeta and gammadelta T cells from T cell progenitors.","3655":"The identity of TH2 memory cells and the mechanism regulating their maintenance during allergic inflammation remain elusive. We report that circulated human CD4+ T cells expressing the prostaglandin D2 receptor (CRTH2) are TH2 central memory T cells, characterized by their phenotype, TH2 cytokine production, gene-expression profile, and the ability to respond to allergens. Only dendritic cells (DCs) activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) can induce a robust expansion of CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 memory cells, while maintaining their central memory phenotype and TH2 commitments. CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 memory cells activated by TSLP-DCs undergo further TH2 polarization and express cystatin A, Charcot-Leydon crystal protein, and prostaglandin D2 synthase, implying their broader roles in allergic inflammation. Infiltrated CRTH2+CD4+ TH2 effector memory T cells in skin lesion of atopic dermatitis were associated with activated DCs, suggesting that TSLP-DCs play important roles not only in TH2 priming, but also in the maintenance and further polarization of TH2 central memory cells in allergic diseases.","3656":"The response of thymocytes to pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) signaling includes proliferation and gene rearrangement, two cellular processes that are incompatible. The control of proliferation by pre-TCR signals depends on the activities of the transcription factors RORgammat, Egr3, E12, and E47. Here, we describe a regulatory network in which interplay between these factors ensures transient proliferation that is temporally distinct from gene rearrangement. RORgammat expression was elevated after pre-TCR signaling, and RORgammat promoted gene rearrangement in CD4+, CD8+ cells by inhibiting cell division, promoting survival via Bcl-X(L), and inducing Rag2. Egr3 was transiently induced by pre-TCR signals and promoted a distinct proliferative phase by reducing E protein-dependent RORgammat expression and interacting with RORgammat to prevent induction of target genes. After Egr3 subsided, the expression and function of RORgammat increased. Thus, transient induction of Egr3 delays the effects of RORgammat and enables pre-TCR signaling to induce both proliferation and gene rearrangement.","3657":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are best known for their ability to recognize microbial or viral components and initiate innate immune responses. We showed here that TLRs and their coreceptors were expressed by multipotential hematopoietic stem cells, whose cell cycle entry was triggered by TLR ligation. TLR expression also extended to some of the early hematopoietic progenitors, although not the progenitor cells dedicated to megakaryocyte and erythroid differentiation. TLR signaling via the Myd88 adaptor protein drove differentiation of myeloid progenitors, bypassing some normal growth and differentiation requirements, and also drove lymphoid progenitors to become dendritic cells. CD14 contributed to the efficiency of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition by stem and progenitor cells, and LPS interacted directly with the TLR4\/MD-2 complex on these cells in bone marrow. Thus, the preferential pathogen-mediated stimulation of myeloid differentiation pathways may provide a means for rapid replenishment of the innate immune system during infection.","3658":"Here, we describe a previously unrecognized pathway for activation of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses that was independent of Toll-Interleukin 1 Receptor signaling and directed toward detection of antigens expressed by apoptotic cells. This pathway is represented within Flt-3 Ligand-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that represent immature lymphoid DCs, but not within GM-CSF-treated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Exposure of these DCs to apoptotic cells resulted in production of type I interferon and favored the development of cytotoxic T cell responses. The N-Ethyl-N-Nitrosourea-induced germline mutation 3d (Unc3b1(3d\/3d)) abolished both MHC class I and II responses elicited by this pathway, whereas a null allele of Cd36 selectively abolished class II responses. We propose that this mode of adaptive immune activation evolved to permit the sensitive detection of intracellular microbial infections, particularly viral infections, which frequently induce apoptotic cell death, but may also be important in transplantation, autoimmunity, and vaccine development.","3659":"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is specifically expressed in the germinal centers of lymphoid organs, where it initiates targeted hypermutation of variable regions of immunoglobulin genes in response to stimulation by antigen. Ectopic expression of AID, however, mediates generalized hypermutation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here, we present evidence that AID is induced outside the germinal center in response to infection by the Abelson murine leukemia virus. The genotoxic activity of virally induced AID resulted in checkpoint kinase-1 (chk1) phosphorylation and ultimately restricted the proliferation of the infected cell. At the same time, it induced NKG2D ligand upregulation, which alerts the immune system to the presence of virally transformed cells. Hence, in addition to its known function in immunoglobulin diversification, AID is active in innate defense against a transforming retrovirus.","3660":"Early and high-level production of IL-12 is crucial for effective immune responses against pathogens. Up until now, the cells providing this initial IL-12 have remained elusive. Here we show that a subset of human blood dendritic cells (DC) is the principal and primary source of IL-12p70 when blood leukocytes are stimulated with the TLR4-ligand LPS or with CD40-ligand. These so-called slanDC are characterized by the 6-sulfo LacNAc modification of PSGL-1, which is identified by the mAb M-DC8. The IL-12 response of slanDC requires a few hours of in vitro maturation, which is completely blocked in the presence of erythrocytes. This inhibition of maturation depends on the expression of CD47 on erythrocytes and of its ligand SIRPalpha on DC. While strictly controlled in the blood by erythrocytes, the high IL-12- and TNF-alpha-producing capacity of slanDC in tissues may be critical in fighting off pathogens; if uncontrolled, it may lead to adverse inflammatory reactions.","3661":"The role of nitric oxide (NO) in T cells remains controversial, and the origin and localization of endogenous NO and whether it regulates lymphocyte activation are unclear. We show here that, within minutes of binding to antigen, T cells produce NO via endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This process required increased intracellular Ca2+ and phosphoinositide3-kinase activity. By using an eNOS-green fluorescent fusion protein and fluorescent probes to detect NO, we show that eNOS translocates with the Golgi apparatus to the immune synapse of T helper cells engaged with antigen-presenting cells (APC), where it was fully activated. Overexpression of eNOS prevented the central coalescence of CD3 at the T cell-APC contact site, which was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of CD3zeta chain, ZAP-70, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases and increased IFN-gamma synthesis, but reduced production of IL-2. Therefore, eNOS-derived NO selectively potentiates T cell receptor signaling to antigen at the immunological synapse.","3662":"HS1, the leukocyte-specific homolog of cortactin, regulates F-actin in vitro and is phosphorylated in response to TCR ligation, but its role in lymphocyte activation has not been addressed. We demonstrate that HS1-deficient T cells fail to accumulate F-actin at the immune synapse (IS) and, upon TCR ligation, form actin-rich structures that are disordered and unstable. Early TCR activation events are intact in these cells, but Ca2+ influx and IL-2 gene transcription are defective. Importantly, HS1 tyrosine phosphorylation is required for its targeting to the IS and for its function in regulating actin dynamics and IL-2 promoter activity. Phosphorylation also links HS1 to multiple signaling proteins, including Lck, PLCgamma1, and Vav1, and is essential for the stable recruitment of Vav1 to the IS. Taken together, our studies show that HS1 is indispensable for signaling events leading to actin assembly and IL-2 production during T cell activation.","3663":"The maintenance of mature B cells hinges on signals emitted from the BAFF-R cell-surface receptor, but the nature of these signals is incompletely understood. Inhibition of canonical NF-kappaB transcription factor activity through ablation of the essential scaffold protein NEMO arrests B cell development at the same stage as BAFF-R deficiency. Correspondingly, activation of this pathway by constitutively active IkappaB Kinase2 renders B cell survival independent of BAFF-R:BAFF interactions and prevents proapoptotic PKCdelta nuclear translocation. In addition, canonical NF-kappaB activity mediates differentiation and proper localization of follicular and marginal zone B cells in the absence of BAFF-R, but not CD19. By replacing BAFF-R signals, constitutive canonical NF-kappaB signaling, a hallmark of various B cell lymphomas, causes accumulation of resting B cells and promotes their proliferation and survival upon activation, but does not per se induce lymphomagenesis. Therefore, canonical NF-kappaB activity can substitute for BAFF-R signals in B cell development and pathogenesis.","3664":"Calcium influx is crucial for T cell activation and differentiation. The detailed regulation of this process remains unclear. We report here that golli protein, an alternatively spliced product of the myelin basic protein gene, plays a critical role in regulating calcium influx in T cells. Golli-deficient T cells were hyperproliferative and showed enhanced calcium entry upon T cell receptor stimulation. We further found that golli regulates calcium influx in T cells through the inhibition of the store depletion-induced calcium influx. Mutation of the myristoylation site on golli disrupted its association with the plasma membrane and reversed its inhibitory action on Ca2+ influx, indicating that membrane association of golli was essential for its inhibitory action. These results indicate that golli functions in a unique way to regulate T cell activation through a mechanism involving the modulation of the calcium homeostasis.","3665":"Throughout lymphocyte development, cellular persistence and expansion are tightly regulated by survival and apoptosis. Within the Bcl-2 family, distinct apoptogenic BH3-only members like Bid, Bim, and Puma appear to function in specific cell death pathways. We found that naive human T cells after mitogenic activation, apart from expected protective Bcl-2 members, also rapidly upregulate the BH3-only protein Noxa in a p53-independent fashion. The specific role of Noxa became apparent during glucose limitation and involves interaction with the labile Bcl-2 homolog Mcl-1. Knockdown of Noxa or Mcl-1 results in protection or susceptibility, respectively, to apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation. Declining Mcl-1 levels and apoptosis induction are inversely correlated to Noxa levels and prevented by readdition of glucose. We propose that the Noxa\/Mcl-1 axis is an apoptosis rheostat in dividing cells, in a selective pathway that functions to restrain lymphocyte expansion and can be triggered by glucose deprivation.","3666":"Epigenetic changes in chromatin structure at the T helper (Th2) locus correlate with interukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 expression during Th2 differentiation. By using a transgenic green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter system, we show that conserved noncoding sequence-2 (CNS-2), located downstream of the Il4 locus, is a constitutively active enhancer in NKT cells as well as in a subset of CD44(hi) memory phenotype CD4+ T cells. CNS-2 enhancer activity and initial IL-4 expression in CD44(hi) CD4+ T cells were abolished in mice with a CD4-specific deletion of the transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling, Rbp-j. Depletion of CNS-2 active CD4+ T cells markedly decreased Th2 differentiation from naive CD4 T cells and antigen-specific IgE production after in vivo priming. These findings indicate that Notch-regulated CNS-2 enhancer controls initial IL-4 expression in NKT and memory phenotype CD4+ T cells and that CNS-2 active CD44(hi) memory phenotype T cells are important in facilitating Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells in allergic responses.","3667":"The naive CD4 T cell is a multipotential precursor with defined antigen recognition specificity but substantial plasticity for development down distinct effector or regulatory lineages, contingent upon signals from cells of the innate immune system. The range of identified effector CD4 T cell lineages has recently expanded with description of an IL-17-producing subset, called Th17, which develops via cytokine signals distinct from, and antagonized by, products of the Th1 and Th2 lineages. Remarkably, Th17 development depends on the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-beta, which is also linked to regulatory T cell development and function, providing a unique mechanism for matching CD4 T cell effector and regulatory lineage specification. Here, we review Th17 lineage development, emphasizing similarities and differences with established effector and regulatory T cell developmental programs that have important implications for immune regulation, immune pathogenesis, and host defense.","3668":"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin conditions dendritic cells to support homeostatic proliferation of central memory T cells. In this issue of Immunity, Wang et al. (2006) show that these dendritic cells are critical in maintaining T helper 2 central memory cells and impart them with expression of unique proallergic molecules.","3669":"AID is a cytidine deaminase essential for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation during the humoral immune response. In this issue of Immunity, Gourzi et al. (2006) show that AID also plays a critical role in innate immunity to virally induced acute pro-B cell leukemia.","3670":"In this issue of Immunity, Kersh and colleagues (Xi et al., 2006) investigate the regulatory network that permits two otherwise clashing cellular processes--proliferation and gene rearrangement--to occur at temporally distinct periods following the formation of the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) complex.","3671":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulate immune responses indirectly by promoting the efficacy of antigen presentation. In this issue of Immunity, Nagai et al. (2006) demonstrate that TLR signals also bias hematopoietic progenitor cells toward myelopoiesis directly by replacing cytokine and differentiative cues.","3672":"The decline in CD4+ T cell function with aging contributes to reduced vaccine efficacy. In this commentary, we discuss the factors leading to age-related changes in T cell function and propose how they may be overcome to enhance vaccine efficacy for the elderly.","3673":"Lymphopoiesis occurs throughout adult life, but the number of lymphocytes produced is substantially reduced in old individuals. This commentary will highlight observations suggesting that common mechanisms underlie declines in both B and T cell production and that reductions in lymphopoiesis are initiated much earlier than has generally been appreciated.","3674":"","3675":"The skin contains readily accessible dendritic cells (DCs) with potent antigen presentation function and functional plasticity enabling the integration of antigen specificity with environmentally responsive immune control. Recent studies challenge the established paradigm of cutaneous immune function by suggesting that lymph node-resident DCs, rather than skin-derived DCs (sDCs), are responsible for eliciting T cell immunity against cutaneous pathogens including viral vectors. We show that cutaneous delivery of lentivirus results in direct transfection of sDCs and potent and prolonged antigen presentation. Further, sDCs are the predominant antigen-presenting cells for the induction of potent and durable CD8(+) T cell immunity. These results support the classical paradigm of cutaneous immune function and suggest that antigen presentation by sDCs contributes to the high potency of lentivector-mediated genetic immunization.","3676":"The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) mediates the activation of NFkappaB and IRFs and the induction of interferons in response to viral infection. In vitro studies have also suggested that MAVS is required for interferon induction by cytosolic DNA, but the in vivo evidence is lacking. By generating MAVS-deficient mice, here we show that loss of MAVS abolished viral induction of interferons and prevented the activation of NFkappaB and IRF3 in multiple cell types, except plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). However, MAVS was not required for interferon induction by cytosolic DNA or by Listeria monocytogenes. Mice lacking MAVS were viable and fertile, but they failed to induce interferons in response to poly(I:C) stimulation and were severely compromised in immune defense against viral infection. These results provide the in vivo evidence that the cytosolic viral signaling pathway through MAVS is specifically required for innate immune responses against viral infection.","3677":"T cell activation by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical to the initiation of adaptive immune responses and protection against pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that a specialized DC subset in Peyer's patches (PPs) mediates the rapid activation of pathogen specific T cells. This DC subset is characterized by the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR6 and is found only in PPs. CCR6(+) DCs were recruited into the dome regions of PPs upon invasion of the follicle associated epithelium (FAE) by an enteric pathogen and were responsible for the rapid local activation of pathogen-specific T cells. CCR6-deficient DCs were unable to respond to bacterial invasion of PPs and failed to initiate T cell activation, resulting in reduced defense against oral infection. Thus, CCR6-dependent regulation of DCs is responsible for localized T cell dependent defense against entero-invasive pathogens.","3678":"The Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila trithorax, is implicated in regulating the maintenance of Hox gene expression and hematopoiesis. The physiological functions of MLL in the immune system remain largely unknown. Although MLL(+\/-) CD4 T cells differentiate normally into antigen-specific effector Th1\/Th2 cells in vitro, the ability of memory Th2 cells to produce Th2 cytokines was selectively reduced. Furthermore, histone modifications at the Th2 cytokine gene loci were not properly maintained in MLL(+\/-) memory Th2 cells. The reduced expression of MLL in memory Th2 cells resulted in decreased GATA3 expression accompanied with impaired GATA3 locus histone modifications. The direct association of MLL with the GATA3 locus and the Th2 cytokine gene loci was demonstrated. Memory Th2 cell-dependent allergic airway inflammation was decreased in MLL(+\/-) Th2 cell-transferred mice. Thus, a crucial role for MLL in the maintenance of memory Th2 cell function is indicated.","3679":"Carbon monoxide (CO) suppresses proinflammatory responses in macrophages reacting to LPS. We hypothesize that CO acts by inducing a molecule(s) that suppresses the inflammatory response to subsequent stress. Exposure of macrophages to CO alone in vitro produced a brief burst of mitochondrial-derived ROS, which led to expression of PPARgamma. PPARgamma expression proved essential for mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of CO. Blocking the CO-mediated increase in ROS generation prevented PPARgamma induction, and blocking PPARgamma prevented CO's anti-inflammatory effects. In a model of acute lung injury in mice, CO blocked expression of Egr-1, a central mediator of inflammation, and decreased tissue damage; inhibition of PPARgamma abrogated both effects. These data identify the mitochondrial oxidases as an (perhaps the) initial cellular target of CO and demonstrate that CO upregulates expression of PPARgamma via the mitochondria, which assures that a subsequent stress stimulus will lead to a cytoprotective as opposed to a proinflammatory phenotype.","3680":"Semaphorins play an essential role in axonal guidance, and emerging evidence points to diverse functions of several Semaphorin family members in the immune system. Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A) promotes axonal growth in the central nervous system. Here, we show that Sema7A also plays a critical role in negative regulation of T cell activation and function. T cells deficient in Sema7A exhibit enhanced homeostatic and antigen-induced proliferative response. Moreover, autoreactive Sema7A-deficient T cells mediate aggressive autoimmune disease. The deficiency in Sema7A leads to defective TCR downmodulation and T cell hyperresponsiveness. These results demonstrate an important role of Sema7A in limiting autoimmune responses and add to growing evidence of shared signaling pathways used by the immune and nervous systems.","3681":"Activated monocytes produce proinflammatory cytokines (monokines) such as interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15, and IL-18 for induction of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells provide the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, an autocrine\/negative regulator of IFN-gamma. The ability of one signaling pathway to prevail over the other is likely important in controlling IFN-gamma for the purposes of infection and autoimmunity, but the molecular mechanism(s) of how this counterregulation occurs is unknown. Here we show that in isolated human NK cells, proinflammatory monokines antagonize antiinflammatory TGF-beta signaling by downregulating the expression of the TGF-beta type II receptor, and its signaling intermediates SMAD2 and SMAD3. In contrast, TGF-beta utilizes SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 to suppress IFN-gamma and T-BET, a positive regulator of IFN-gamma. Indeed, activated NK cells from Smad3(-\/-) mice produce more IFN-gamma in vivo than NK cells from wild-type mice. Collectively, our data suggest that pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine signaling reciprocally antagonize each other in an effort to prevail in the regulation of NK cell IFN-gamma production.","3682":"The control of IL-10 production and mechanisms that mediate synergy between IFN-gamma and TLR ligands are not well understood. We report that IFN-gamma augments induction of TNFalpha by TLR ligands, immune complexes, and zymosan by suppressing IL-10 production and thereby interrupting Stat3-mediated feedback inhibition. IFN-gamma altered TLR2-induced signal transduction by increasing GSK3 activity and suppressing MAPK activation, leading to diminished IL-10 production. Inhibition of GSK3 or ablation of the GSK3beta gene ameliorated TLR2-induced peritonitis and arthritis. IFN-gamma suppressed the activity of CREB and AP-1, transcription factors that induce IL-10 expression and are regulated in part by MAPKs and GSK3. These results yield insight into mechanisms by which IFN-gamma regulates IL-10 production and TLR2-mediated inflammatory responses and identify inhibition of CREB and AP-1 as part of the macrophage response to IFN-gamma. GSK3 and CREB\/AP-1 are key players in integrating IFN-gamma and TLR2 responses in innate immunity and inflammation.","3683":"HIV-1-infected lymphocytes improperly respond to T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation. To document this phenomenon, we studied the capacity of HIV-1-infected lymphocytes to form immunological synapses. We show here that HIV-1-infected T cells poorly conjugated with antigen-presenting cells, and when they formed conjugates, the synapses were abnormal. TCR and Lck accumulated in the recycling endosomal compartment, and their clustering at the synapse was severely reduced. These phenomena were, to a large extent, caused by Nef, a viral protein affecting intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. Concomitantly, in HIV-infected cells, tyrosine phosphorylation at the synapse and the patterns of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were disturbed in a Nef-dependent manner. These findings underscore the importance of Lck and TCR endosomal trafficking in synapse formation and early T cell signaling. Alteration of endocytic and signaling networks at the immunological synapse likely impacts the function and fate of HIV-1-infected cells.","3684":"The serine kinase protein kinase D (PKD) has a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that binds diacylglycerol (DAG) with high affinity. PKD is cytosolic in unstimulated T cells, but it rapidly polarizes to the immunological synapse in response to antigen\/antigen presenting cells (APCs). PKD repositioning is determined by the accumulation of DAG at the immunological synapse and changes in DAG accessibility of the PKD-CRD. Unstimulated T cells are shown to have a uniform distribution of DAG at the plasma membrane, whereas after T cell activation, a gradient of DAG is created with a persistent focus of DAG at the center of the synapse. PKD is only transiently associated with the immune synapse, indicating a fine tuning of PKD responsiveness to DAG by additional regulatory mechanisms. These results reveal the immune synapse as a focal point for DAG and PKD as an immediate and dynamic DAG effector during T cell activation.","3685":"Intracellular proteins are degraded in the antigen processing pathway to generate peptide-loaded MHC I complexes (pMHC I) for immune surveillance. The characteristics of the final pMHC I are clear but those of their precursors and their potential binding partners remain poorly defined. By using a unique method to biochemically detect preprocessed ovalbumin-derived antigenic peptides, we find that cells generate large, C-terminally extended proteolytic intermediates that are associated with the alpha isotype of hsp90 chaperone. Knockdown of hsp90alpha expression by siRNA resulted in the loss of these intermediates and decreased presentation of the final pMHC I on the cell surface. Generation of pMHC I was also inhibited by knockdown of the cochaperone CHIP that interacts with heat shock proteins, ubiquitinates their clients, and delivers them to the proteasome. Thus, hsp90alpha can serve as a chaperone for precursors of pMHC I at an early stage in the antigen processing pathway.","3686":"The molecular basis of T cell anergy is not completely understood. We show that in antigen-primed anergic murine CD4(+) T cells the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is hypophosphorylated upon CD3\/CD28 restimulation. Signaling events downstream of LAT (PLCgamma1 phosphorylation and p85 [PI3-K] association) were impaired, whereas upstream events (CD3zeta and ZAP-70 phosphorylation) remained intact. LAT recruitment to the immunological synapse and its localization in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions were defective in anergic T cells. These defects resulted from impaired palmitoylation of LAT and were selective since the DRM localization and palmitoylation of Fyn were intact. This LAT defect was independent of Cbl-b and did not reflect enhanced LAT degradation. These results identify LAT as the most upstream target of anergy induction; moreover, they suggest that regulation of the amount of LAT in the immunological synapse and DRM by posttranslational palmitoylation contributes to the induction of T cell anergy.","3687":"Viruses trigger signaling pathways of innate immunity. In this issue, it is shown that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein is critical for intracellular detection signaling, but is dispensable for the activation of innate immunity via Toll-like receptors.","3688":"How an immune response to pathogens is initiated in the gut is still an open question. In this issue of Immunity, it has been found that a distinct subset of CCR6-expressing dendritic cells are absolutely required to activate anti-Salmonella-specific T cells.","3689":"Although transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression has been known for some time, in this issue of Immunity, the crosstalk between proinflammatory cytokine and TGF-beta signaling that regulates IFN-gamma expression is detailed for the first time.","3690":"MHC class I binding peptides are generated via cytosolic degradation of a previously undefined substrate.

In this issue of Immunity, demonstrate that anergic T cells are selectively defective in LAT activation.","3692":"The competency of the adaptive immune function decreases with age, primarily because of the decline in production of naive lymphocytes in the bone marrow and thymus as well as the expansion of incompetent memory lymphocytes. Here I discuss the recent progress on age-associated changes in lymphocytes and their effect on the adaptive immune system.","3693":"Adaptive immunity undergoes severe deterioration with age and represents the main problem in the elderly. However, evidence accumulated over the last decade supports the hypothesis that aging also has a profound impact on innate immunity, which in turn markedly impacts the health and longevity of older people.","3694":"TGFbeta presented and activated by integrin alphavbeta6 expressed on alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) continuously inhibits the functionality of alveolar macrophages (AM). Despite this inhibition, AM retain their ability to respond to inhaled microorganisms. Herein we describe a homeostatic circuit through which the effects of microbial products on macrophages transiently circumvent this inhibition by repressing alphavbeta6 expression on AEC. Subsequent production of matrix metalloproteinases by activated AM activates latent TGFbeta, reinduces alphavbeta6 expression, and thereby reinstates tonic inhibition of AM function. Our results reveal how AM can be activated while minimizing their potential to inflict collateral damage to the adjacent lung tissue and indicate that tissue-specific microenvironmental factors shape organ-specific defense strategies against microbial invasion.","3695":"The Drosophila host defense against gram-negative bacteria is mediated by the Imd pathway upon sensing of peptidoglycan by the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC. Here we report a functional analysis of PGRP-LB, a catalytic member of the PGRP family. We show that PGRP-LB is a secreted protein regulated by the Imd pathway. Biochemical studies demonstrate that PGRP-LB is an amidase that specifically degrades gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycan. In agreement with its amidase activity, PGRP-LB downregulates the Imd pathway. Hence, activation of PGRP-LB by the Imd pathway provides a negative feedback regulation to tightly adjust immune activation to infection. Our study also reveals that PGRP-LB controls the immune reactivity of flies to the presence of ingested bacteria in the gut. Our work highlights the key role of PGRPs that encode both sensors and scavengers of peptidoglycan, which modulate the level of the host immune response to the presence of infectious microorganisms.","3696":"How cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) kill intracellular pathogens without killing themselves has been a recurring question ever since their discovery. By using mice deficient in Serine Protease Inhibitor 6 (Spi6), we show that by inhibiting granzyme B (GrB), Spi6 protects CTLs from self-inflicted injury. Infection with either Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or Listeria monocytogenes (LM) revealed increased apoptosis and diminished survival of Spi6 knockout (KO) CTLs, which was cell autonomous and could be corrected by GrB deficiency. Spi6 KO mice in turn were impaired in their ability to clear LCMV infection. Spi6 KO CTLs revealed a breakdown in the integrity of cytotoxic granules, increased cytoplasmic GrB, and ensuing apoptosis. We conclude that Spi6 protects CTLs from suicide caused by GrB-mediated breakdown of cytotoxic granules.","3697":"Activated virus-specific CD8 T cells remain in the lung airways for several months after influenza virus infection. We show that maintenance of this cell population is dependent upon the route of infection and prolonged presentation of viral antigen in the draining lymph nodes (DLN) of the respiratory tract. The local effects on T cell migration have been examined. We show retention of virus-specific CD8 T cells in the mediastinal lymph node (MLN) and continuing recruitment of blood-borne migrants into the lung airways during antigen presentation. These data show that antigen that is retained after pulmonary influenza virus infection controls the migratory pattern and activation state of virus-specific CD8 T cells near the site of virus amplification.","3698":"Correlation between the promiscuity of the primary antibody response and conformational flexibility in a germline antibody was addressed by using germline antibody 36-65. Crystallographic analyses of the 36-65 Fab with three independent dodecapeptides provided mechanistic insights into the generation of antibody diversity. While four antigen-free Fab molecules provided a quantitative description of the conformational repertoire of the antibody CDRs, three Fab molecules bound to structurally diverse peptide epitopes exhibited a common paratope conformation. Each peptide revealed spatially different footprints within the antigen-combining site. However, a conformation-specific lock involving two shared residues, which were also associated with hapten binding, was discernible. Unlike the hapten, the peptides interacted with residues that undergo somatic mutations, suggesting a possible mechanism for excluding \"nonspecific\" antigens during affinity maturation. The observed multiple binding modes of diverse epitopes within a common paratope conformation of a germline antibody reveal a simple, yet elegant, mechanism for expanding the primary antibody repertoire.","3699":"We previously reported that the mice deficient for SPA-1, a Rap1 GTPase-activating protein, developed hematopoietic stem cell disorders. Here, we demonstrate that SPA-1(-\/-) mice show an age-dependent increase in B220(high) B1a cells producing anti-dsDNA antibody and lupus-like nephritis. SPA-1(-\/-) peritoneal B1 cells revealed the altered Vkappa gene repertoire, including skewed Vkappa4 usage and the significant Igkappa\/Iglambda isotype inclusion indicative of extensive receptor editing. Rap1GTP induced OcaB gene activation via p38MAPK-dependent Creb phosphorylation, and consistently, SPA-1(-\/-) immature BM B cells showing high Rap1GTP exhibited the augmented expression of OcaB and Vkappa4 genes. SPA-1(-\/-) BM cells could transfer the autoimmunity in association with the generation of peritoneal B220(high) B1a cells in Rag-2(-\/-) recipients. Finally, a portion of SPA-1(-\/-) mice developed B1 cell leukemia with hemolytic autoantibody. Present results suggest that the regulated Rap1 signal in the immature B cells plays a role in modifying the B cell receptor repertoire and in maintaining the self-tolerance.","3700":"Allelic exclusion ensures that individual B lymphocytes produce only one kind of antibody molecule. Previous studies have shown that allelic exclusion of the mouse Igkappa locus occurs by the combination of monoallelic silencing and a low level of monoallelic activation for rearrangement combined with a negative feedback loop blocking additional functional rearrangements. Using yeast artificial chromosome-based single-copy isotransgenic mice, we have identified a cis-acting element that negatively regulates rearrangement in this locus, specifically in B cells. The element, termed Sis, resides in the V-J intervening sequence. Sis specifies the targeting of Igkappa transgenes in pre-B and B cells to centromeric heterochromatin and associates with Ikaros, a repressor protein that also colocalizes with centromeric heterochromatin. Significantly, these are hallmarks of silenced endogenous germline Igkappa genes in B cells. These results lead us to propose that Sis participates in the monoallelic silencing aspect of allelic exclusion regulation.","3701":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which preferentially deaminates deoxycytidines at WRC (W = A\/T, R = A\/G) motifs in vitro. The mechanisms responsible for targeting AID and for organizing the queue of enzymes involved in vivo have been elusive. Here, we examined point mutant knockin Msh6 mice (Msh6(TD\/TD)), which lack the second phase of SHM but retain all the proteins involved, and found that AID was frequently targeted to non-WRC motifs. Unexpectedly, by comparing SHM and CSR in wild-type, Msh6(TD\/TD), and age-matched Msh6(-\/-) mice, we discovered that the presence of Msh6 protein influenced the AID targeting in phase one of SHM and mediated the proper targeting of recombination sites in CSR in vivo. Our data suggest that Msh6 plays a scaffolding role in the first phase of SHM, in addition to its enzymatic role in the second phase of SHM.","3702":"Antigen receptor gene assembly is governed by transcriptional promoters and enhancers that communicate over large distances and modulate chromatin accessibility to V(D)J recombinase. The precise role of these cis-acting elements in opening chromatin at recombinase targets and the mechanisms underlying their crosstalk remain unclear. We show that the TCRbeta enhancer (Ebeta) directs long-range chromatin opening over both DbetaJbeta clusters. Strikingly, chromatin associated with the Dbeta1 gene segment is refractory to Ebeta-mediated opening. Accessibility at Dbeta1 is accompanied by the formation of a stable holocomplex between a Dbeta-proximal promoter and Ebeta. These findings indicate a stepwise process for Dbeta --&gt; Jbeta recombination that relies on distinct aspects of Ebeta activity: an intrinsic function that directs general chromatin opening and a cooperative function that facilitates the assembly of a promoter\/enhancer holocomplex, unmasks the Dbeta1 gene segment, and triggers TCRbeta gene assembly.","3703":"Cytokine loci undergo changes in chromatin structure when naive CD4(+) T cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells and have also been examined for regulatory sequences underlying such changes and their functional correlates. Studies have shown that distal regulatory elements control the Ifng and Th2 cytokine loci and are primary targets for tissue-specific transcription factors, serving as centers for epigenetic changes that mark heritable traits in effector cells. Reports of intra- and, remarkably, interchromosomal interactions between these regulatory elements shed light on the mechanisms by which they regulate gene expression, revealing an extraordinary new picture that conceptually extends our views on how genes are regulated from two to three dimensions. Here, we summarize these recent findings on the role of regulatory elements and their mechanisms of action, which are of broad significance for gene regulation, not only of the immune system but also of many, if not all, coregulated genes.","3704":"Although alveolar macrophages are normally quiescent to prevent damaging the alveoli, in this issue of Immunity, Takabayshi et al.

The time is ripe for a reunion. Immunology has much to offer for rational intervention measures toward tuberculosis control.","3709":"","3710":"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with eczema vaccinatum (EV), a disseminated viral skin infection that follows inoculation with vaccinia virus (VV). This study examined whether AD skin can control VV replication, and the role of IL-4 and IL-13 in modulating the human cathelicidin LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide that kills VV. AD skin exhibited increased VV replication and decreased LL-37 expression compared to normal or psoriasis skin. IL-4\/IL-13 enhanced VV replication while downregulating LL-37 in VV-stimulated keratinocytes. Neutralizing IL-4\/IL-13 in AD skin augmented LL-37 and inhibited VV replication. Cathelicidins were induced via toll-like receptor-3 and were inhibited by IL-4\/IL-13 through STAT-6. Skin from cathelicidin-deficient mice exhibited reduced ability to control VV replication. Exogenous LL-37 controlled vaccinia viral replication in infected keratinocytes and AD skin explants. The current study demonstrates that Th2 cytokines enhance VV replication in AD skin by subverting the innate immune response against VV in a STAT-6-dependent manner.","3711":"IgE induction by parasites and allergens is antigen driven and cognate T cell help dependent. We demonstrate that spontaneously produced IgE in T cell-deficient and germ-free wild-type (wt) mice is composed of natural specificities and induced by a mechanism independent of MHC class II (MHC II) cognate help. This does not require secondary lymphoid structures or germinal center formation, although some bystander T cell-derived IL-4 is necessary. The pathway of spontaneous IgE production is not inhibited by regulatory T cells and increases with age to constitute significant serum concentrations, even in naive animals.","3712":"Mutations in the NALP3\/CIAS1\/cryopyrin gene are linked to three autoinflammatory disorders: Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, and chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome. NALP3, with the adaptor molecule ASC, has been proposed to form a caspase-1-activating \"inflammasome,\" a complex with pro-IL1beta-processing activity. Here, we demonstrate the effect of NALP3 deficiency on caspase-1 function. NALP3 was essential for the ATP-driven activation of caspase-1 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and for the efficient secretion of the caspase-1-dependent cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-18. IL-1beta has been shown to play a key role in contact hypersensitivity; we show that ASC- and NALP3-deficient mice also demonstrate an impaired contact hypersensitivity response to the hapten trinitrophenylchloride. NALP3, however, was not required for caspase-1 activation by Salmonella typhimurium, and NALP3 deficiency only partially protects mice from the lethal effects of endotoxin. These data suggest that NALP3 plays a specific role in the caspase-1 activation pathway.","3713":"Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) have been implicated in cell adhesion by integrin and immune response receptors through the regulation of Rho GTPases. Here, we examine the role of Vav and Rho GTPases in phagocytosis by using primary murine macrophages. The genetic deletion of Rac1 and Rac2 prevents phagocytosis mediated by integrin and Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR), whereas the genetic deletion of Vav1 and Vav3 only prevents integrin-mediated phagocytosis through the complement receptor alpha(M)beta(2). In addition, a Rac1\/2 or Vav1\/3 deficiency blocks Arp2\/3 recruitment and actin polymerization at the complement-induced phagosome, indicating that these proteins regulate early steps in phagocytosis. Moreover, constitutively active Rac is able to rescue actin polymerization and complement-mediated phagocytosis in Vav-deficient macrophages. These studies indicate that Rac is critical for complement- and FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. In contrast, Vav is specifically required for complement-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that Rac is regulated by GEFs other than Vav downstream of the FcgammaR.","3714":"Nup98 and Nup96 are components of the nuclear transport machinery and are induced by interferons (IFN). Nup98 is a constituent of an mRNA export pathway that is targeted by viruses and regulated by IFN. However, the role of Nup96 in IFN-related mechanisms has not been established. To investigate the function of Nup96 in vivo, we generated Nup96(+\/-) mice that express low levels of Nup96, as Nup96(-\/-) mice are lethal. The Nup96(+\/-) mice presented selective alterations of the immune system, which resulted in downregulation and impaired IFN alpha- and gamma-mediated induction of MHC I and IFNgamma induction of MHC II, ICAM-1, and other proteins. Frequency of TCRalphabeta+ and CD4+ T cells, which depends on MHC function, is reduced in NUP96(+\/-) mice. Upon immunization, Nup96(+\/-) mice showed impaired antigen presentation and T cell proliferation. Nup96(+\/-) cells and mice were highly susceptible to viral infection, demonstrating a role for Nup96 in innate and adaptive immunity.","3715":"Pax5 is indispensable for the commitment of early lymphoid progenitors to the B cell lineage as well as for the development of B cells. To better understand the functional importance of Pax5 at the later stages of B cell differentiation, we established a Pax5-deficient DT40 B cell line. The Pax5(-\/-) cells exhibited slower growth, decreased surface IgM expression, and total loss of B cell receptor signaling. Moreover, the expression of the plasma cell-characteristic transcription factors Blimp-1 and XBP-1 were significantly upregulated and the expression of Bcl-6 diminished in the Pax5(-\/-) cells, and this alteration was normalized by restored Pax5 expression. The Pax5-deficient cells further manifested substantially elevated secretion of IgM into the supernatant, another characteristic of plasma cells. These results indicate that downregulation of Pax5 function promotes the plasma cell differentiation of B cells.","3716":"The transcription factor Pax5 represses lineage-inappropriate genes and activates B cell-specific genes in B lymphocytes. By identifying 110 Pax5-repressed genes, we now demonstrate that Pax5 downregulates diverse biological activities including receptor signaling, cell adhesion, migration, transcriptional control, and cellular metabolism at B cell commitment. The T lymphoid or myeloid expression of these genes demonstrates that Pax5(-\/-) pro-B cells and common lymphoid progenitors display lymphoid and myeloid promiscuity of gene expression. These lineage-inappropriate genes require continuous Pax5 activity for their repression, as they are reactivated in committed pro-B cells and mature B cells following conditional Pax5 deletion. Pax5-repressed genes are also reexpressed in plasma cells, which depend for normal function on Cd28 and Ccr2 reactivation. The loss of Pax5 during terminal differentiation thus contributes to the plasma cell transcription program. Finally, ectopic expression of the Pax5-repressed chemokine gene Ccl3 in B cells results in increased osteoclast formation and bone loss, demonstrating that Pax5-mediated gene repression is essential for normal homeostasis of hematopoietic development.","3717":"BANK is an adaptor protein that is highly expressed in B cells. To investigate its physiological role, we generated BANK-deficient mice. BANK-deficient mice displayed enhanced germinal center formation and IgM production in response to T-dependent antigens, whereas this phenotype was blocked in CD40-BANK double knockout mice. Involvement of BANK in CD40 signaling was further demonstrated by in vitro analysis. CD40-mediated proliferation and survival were significantly increased in BANK-deficient B cells, with enhanced Akt activation, whereas introduction of dominant-negative Akt into BANK-deficient B cells suppressed the augmented CD40-mediated responses. Together, our findings suggest that BANK attenuates CD40-mediated Akt activation, thereby preventing hyperactive B cell responses.","3718":"Natural killer (NK) cells provide innate defense against tumors and infections by virtue of potent capacities to immediately kill cellular targets and produce cytokines. These effector functions may potentially damage normal self-tissues unless they are kept in check by tolerance mechanisms that need clarification. Here, we discuss recent studies indicating that the NK cells acquire functional competence directly through engagement of their MHC-specific receptors by self-MHC. Ironically, these receptors were first identified in terms of recognizing target cell MHC class I molecules and inhibiting NK cells in effector responses. Other studies of NK cell tolerance are also discussed. Although these studies begin to clarify the means by which NK cell tolerance is achieved, much more investigation is needed because NK cell tolerance is relevant to clinical observations in patients with infections and cancer.","3719":"Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have an increased risk of infection with several viruses compared to patients with other inflammatory skin disorders such as psoriasis. In this issue of Immunity, it is found that the cytokine milieu in the skin of AD patients profoundly affects the innate response to vaccinia virus (VV) by blocking production of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37.","3720":"In this issue of Immunity, primary macrophages from Vav1(-\/-)\/Vav3(-\/-) and Rac1(-\/-)\/Rac2(-\/-) mice to produce a new picture of Fcgamma receptor and complement receptor 3 intracellular signaling have been examined.","3721":"Mutations in CIAS1\/cryopyrin are linked to several autoinflammatory diseases. In this issue of Immunity, a critical role for cryopyrin in the caspase-1\/IL-1beta axis and reveal a broader role for cryopyrin than anticipated is uncovered.","3722":"In this issue of Immunity, it is found that the downregulation of Pax-5 during antigen-dependent-terminal differentiation results in a substantial loss of B cell identity and the transition to a plasma cell state.","3723":"After a very long and windy road, in December of 2005 the FDA approved CTLA4Ig for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Orencia is the first-in-class antagonist of CD28 costimulation. In this perspective, we discuss the science that led to CTLA4Ig development and the clinical challenges in bringing the drug from the bench to the bedside.","3724":"Here, we identify fetal bone marrow (BM)-derived CD34hiCD45RAhiCD7+ hematopoietic progenitors as thymus-colonizing cells. This population, virtually absent from the fetal liver (FL), emerges in the BM by development weeks 8-9, where it accumulates throughout the second trimester, to finally decline around birth. Based on phenotypic, molecular, and functional criteria, we demonstrate that CD34hiCD45RAhiCD7+ cells represent the direct precursors of the most immature CD34hiCD1a- fetal thymocytes that follow a similar dynamics pattern during fetal and early postnatal development. Histological analysis of fetal thymuses further reveals that early immigrants predominantly localize in the perivascular areas of the cortex, where they form a lymphostromal complex with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) driving their rapid specification toward the T lineage. Finally, using an ex vivo xenogeneic thymus-colonization assay, we show that BM-derived CD34hiCD45RAhiCD7+ progenitors are selectively recruited into the thymus parenchyma in the absence of exogenous cytokines, where they adopt a definitive T cell fate.","3725":"Dendritic cell (DC) migration from the periphery to lymph nodes is regulated by the pattern of genes expressed by DCs themselves and by signals within the surrounding peripheral environment. Here, we report that DC mobilization can also be regulated by signals initiated within the downstream lymph nodes, particularly when lymph nodes enlarge as a consequence of immunization. Lymph node B lymphocytes orchestrate expansion of the lymphatic network within the immunized lymph node. This expanded network in turn supports increased DC migration from the periphery. These results reveal unique relationships between B cells, lymphatic vessels, and migratory DCs. Knowledge that DC migration from the periphery is augmented by B cell-dependent signals reveals new potential strategies to increase DC migration during vaccination.","3726":"The nature of dendritic cell(s) (DC[s]) that conditions efficient in vivo priming of CD8+ CTL after immunization via epithelial tissues remains largely unknown. Here, we show that myeloid DCs rapidly recruited by adjuvants into the buccal mucosa or skin are essential for CD8+ T cell crosspriming. Recruitment of circulating DC precursors, including Gr1+ monocytes, precedes the sequential accumulation of CD11c+ MHC class II+ DCs in dermis and epithelium via a CCR6\/CCL20-dependent mechanism. Remarkably, a defect in CCR6, local neutralization of CCL20, or depletion of monocytes prevents in vivo priming of CD8+ CTL against an innocuous protein antigen administered with adjuvant. In addition, transfer of CCR6-sufficient Gr1+ monocytes restores CD8+ T cell priming in CCR6( degrees \/ degrees ) mice via a direct Ag presentation mechanism. Thus, newly recruited DCs likely derived from circulating monocytes are responsible for efficient crosspriming of CD8+ CTL after mucosal or skin immunization.","3727":"We describe de novo generation of IL-17-producing T cells from naive CD4 T cells, induced in cocultures of naive CD4 T cells and naturally occurring CD4+ CD25+ T cells (Treg) in the presence of TLR3, TLR4, or TLR9 stimuli. Treg can be substituted by TGFbeta1, which, together with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, supports the differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells, a process that is amplified by IL-1beta and TNFalpha. We could not detect a role for IL-23 in the differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells but confirmed its importance for their survival and expansion. Transcription factors GATA-3 and T-bet, as well as its target Hlx, are absent in IL-17-producing T cells, and they do not express the negative regulator for TGFbeta signaling, Smad7. Our data indicate that, in the presence of IL-6, TGFbeta1 subverts Th1 and Th2 differentiation for the generation of IL-17-producing T cells.","3728":"Immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, which are generated in the thymic cortex, are induced upon positive selection to differentiate into mature T lymphocytes and relocate to the thymic medulla. It was recently shown that a chemokine signal via CCR7 is essential for the cortex-to-medulla migration of positively selected thymocytes in the thymus. However, the role of the cortex-to-medulla migration in T cell development and selection has remained unclear. The present study shows that the developmental kinetics and the thymic export of mature thymocytes were undisturbed in adult mice lacking CCR7 or its ligands (CCR7L). The inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate-mediated lymphocyte egress from the thymus led to the accumulation of mature thymocytes in the cortex of CCR7- or CCR7L-deficient mice, unlike the accumulation in the medulla of normal mice, thereby suggesting that mature thymocytes may be exported directly from the cortex in the absence of CCR7 signals. However, the thymocytes that were generated in the absence of CCR7 or CCR7L were potent in causing autoimmune dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis in mice and were thus incapable of establishing central tolerance to organ-specific antigens. These results indicate that CCR7-mediated cortex-to-medulla migration of thymocytes is essential for establishing central tolerance rather than for supporting the maturation or export of thymocytes.","3729":"CD14 is a well-known pattern-recognition receptor in the innate immune system. Here, we show that CD14 enhances double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from CD14-\/- mice exhibited impaired responses to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (pIpC) and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines. CD14-\/- mice injected with pIpC also showed impaired cytokine production. When tested with [32P] labeled pIpC small fragments (pIpCsf) that maintain the inflammatory activity of crude pIpC, CD14 directly bound pIpCsf and mediated cellular uptake of pIpCsf. Our data show that TLR3 is intracellular and directly interacts with CD14. Internalized pIpCsf was localized in the lysosomes via the endosomes. In unstimulated cells, neither CD14 nor TLR3 was detected in the lysosomes. However, TLR3 was localized in the lysosomes as was CD14 once the cells took up pIpC. We also observed that internalized pIpCsf colocalized with CD14 and TLR3. Consequently, CD14 mediates pIpC uptake and enhances TLR3 signaling.","3730":"A series of signal-directed transitions regulates the development of distinct populations of self-tolerant B cells and ultimately the production of antibody-producing plasma cells. We studied the role of calcineurin\/NFAT signaling in B cells by deleting the regulatory b1 subunit of calcineurin specifically in B cells. Follicular (FO) and marginal zone (MZ) B cells develop normally in these mice, but B1 cell numbers are reduced. In vitro, calcineurin b1-deficient B cells have a cell-intrinsic proliferation defect downstream of the B cell receptor. These mice have higher total serum IgM despite the absence of B1 cells and have enhanced T cell-independent-1 responses. Conversely, mice with calcineurin b1-deficient B cells develop larger germinal centers and have reduced plasma cell development and antigen-specific antibody production during T cell-dependent immune responses. By several different criteria, calcineurin is dispensable for B cell tolerance, indicating that this phosphatase complex modulates immunogenic, but not tolerogenic, responses in vivo.","3731":"When T cells encounter antigens via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), information about the quantity and quality of antigen engagement is relayed to the intracellular signal transduction machinery. This process is poorly understood. The TCR itself lacks a significant intracellular domain. Instead, it is associated with CD3 molecules that contain intracellular signaling domains that couple the TCR\/CD3 complex to the downstream signaling machinery. The earliest events in TCR signaling must involve the transfer of information from the antigen binding TCR subunit to the CD3 signaling subunits of the TCR\/CD3 complex. Elucidating the structural organization of the TCR with the associated CD3 signaling molecules is necessary for understanding the mechanism by which TCR engagement is coupled to activation. Here, we review the current state of our understanding of the structure and organization of the TCR\/CD3 complex.","3732":"Migration of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) through lymphatics to draining lymph nodes (LNs) represents a key step in the initiation of an adaptive immune response. In this issue of Immunity, provide the first evidence that remodeling of the lymphatic network within LNs and in peripheral tissues enhances DC migration after immunization and that this process depends on the presence of B cells within the LN.","3733":"In this issue of Immunity, describe a physical and functional relationship between Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the pattern recognition protein CD14. In the presence of CD14, TLR3-mediated signal transduction events are amplified.","3734":"How B cells discriminate antigen-receptor-mediated signals in development and navigate critical checkpoints in adaptive immune responses remains poorly resolved. In this issue of Immunity, conditionally ablate the main regulatory subunit of the calcineurin phosphatase complex in B cells to reveal both positive and negative influences on the development of antibody responses and B cell memory.","3735":"","3736":"CD8 T lymphocytes are important effectors in protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We recently characterized the detour pathway of CD8 T cell activation in tuberculosis mediated by apoptotic vesicles from infected cells that transport mycobacterial antigens to dendritic cells (DCs). Here we demonstrate that apoptotic vesicles from mycobacteria-infected macrophages stimulate CD8 T cells in vivo. Homing of DCs to draining lymph nodes was critically required for effective crosspriming. Subsequent fate of vesicle-associated antigens in recipient DCs was characterized by endosomal mechanisms predominating over proteasomal processing. In addition, vesicle processing depended on the presence of saposins to disintegrate apoptotic membranes. Apoptotic vesicles displayed potent adjuvant activity by stimulating through Toll-like receptors (TLR). Ultimately, vaccination with vesicles from infected cells induced protection against M. tuberculosis infection. Taken together, we propose the detour pathway to represent a genuine immunological mechanism mediating crosspriming of CD8 T cells in vivo and protection against tuberculosis.","3737":"Nucleic acid recognition upon viral infection triggers type I interferon production. Viral RNA is detected by both endosomal, TLR-dependent and cytosolic, RIG-I\/MDA5-dependent pathways. TLR9 is the only known sensor of foreign DNA; it is unknown whether innate immune recognition of DNA exists in the cytosol. Here we present evidence that cytosolic DNA activates a potent type I interferon response to the invasive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. The noninvasive Legionella pneumophila triggers an identical response through its type IV secretion system. Activation of type I interferons by cytosolic DNA is TLR independent and requires IRF3 but occurs without detectable activation of NF-kappaB and MAP kinases. Microarray analyses reveal a unique but overlapping gene-expression program activated by cytosolic DNA compared to TLR9- and RIG-I\/MDA5-dependent responses. These findings define an innate immune response to DNA linked to type I interferon production.","3738":"MyD88 is an important signaling adaptor for both TLR and IL-1R family members. Here, we evaluated the role of TLR2\/MyD88 and IL-1R\/MyD88 signaling in host defense against S. aureus by using a cutaneous infection model in conjunction with bioluminescent bacteria. We found that lesions of S. aureus-infected MyD88- and IL-1R-deficient mice were substantially larger with higher bacterial counts compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, TLR2-deficient mice had lesions that were only moderately larger with minimally higher bacterial counts. In addition, MyD88- and IL-1R- but not TLR2-deficient mice had severely decreased recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. This neutrophil recruitment was not dependent upon IL-1R\/MyD88 signaling by recruited bone marrow-derived cells, suggesting that resident skin cells utilize IL-1R\/MyD88 signaling to promote neutrophil recruitment.","3739":"The FDC-specific molecular signals required in the formation of FDC networks, B cell follicles, and germinal centers (GCs) have remained poorly understood. We used FDC-specific gene targeting to investigate the function of p55TNFR and IKK2 in lymphoid organ structure and function. Here we show that FDC-specific expression of p55TNFR is necessary and sufficient to promote FDC network and B cell follicle formation, restore the expression of CXCL13 and VCAM-1\/ICAM-1 in FDCs, and lead to productive GCs. Notably, FDC-specific disruption of IKK2 does not affect formation of FDC networks. Yet, after antigen engagement or immune complex (IC) deposition, FDCs lacking IKK2 fail to upregulate VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and GCs remain sterile. These findings demonstrate that IKK2-independent function of p55TNFR on FDCs is sufficient to support the development of FDC networks and GCs, while FDC-specific IKK2 is indispensable for the generation of efficient humoral immune responses.","3740":"The first checkpoint in T cell development, beta selection, has remained incompletely characterized for lack of specific surface markers. We show that CD27 is upregulated in DN3 thymocytes initiating beta selection, concomitant with intracellular TCR-beta expression. Clonal analysis determined that CD27high DN3 cells generate CD4+CD8+ progeny with more than 90% efficiency, faster and more efficiently than the CD27low majority. CD27 upregulation also occurs in gammadelta-selected DN3 thymocytes in TCR-beta-\/- mice and in IL2-GFP transgenic reporter mice where GFP marks the earliest emerging TCR-gammadelta cells from DN3 thymocytes. With CD27 to distinguish pre- and postselection DN3 cells, a detailed gene expression analysis defined regulatory changes associated with checkpoint arrest, with beta selection, and with gammadelta selection. gammadelta selection induces higher CD5, Egr, and Runx3 expression as compared to beta selection, but it triggers less proliferation. Our results also reveal differences in Notch\/Delta dependence at the earliest stages of divergence between developing alphabeta and gammadelta T-lineage cells.","3741":"Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated immune responses are downregulated by several mechanisms that affect signaling pathways. However, it remains elusive how TLR-mediated gene expression is differentially modulated. Here, we show that IkappaBNS, a TLR-inducible nuclear IkappaB protein, negatively regulates induction of a subset of TLR-dependent genes through inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. IkappaBNS-deficient macrophages and dendritic cells show increased TLR-mediated expression of genes such as IL-6 and IL-12p40, which are induced late after TLR stimulation. In contrast, IkappaBNS-deficient cells showed normal induction of genes that are induced early or induced via IRF-3 activation. LPS stimulation of IkappaBNS-deficient macrophages prolonged NF-kappaB activity at the specific promoters, indicating that IkappaBNS mediates termination of NF-kappaB activity at selective gene promoters. Moreover, IkappaBNS-deficient mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxin shock and intestinal inflammation. Thus, IkappaBNS regulates inflammatory responses by inhibiting the induction of a subset of TLR-dependent genes through modulation of NF-kappaB activity.","3742":"Beta-catenin has been implicated in thymocyte development because of its function as a coactivator of Tcf\/LEF-family transcription factors. Previously, we discovered a novel pathway for p53-induced beta-catenin degradation through a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex involving Siah1, SIP (CacyBP), Skp1, and Ebi. To gain insights into the physiological relevance of this new degradation pathway in vivo, we generated mutant mice lacking SIP. We demonstrate here that SIP-\/- thymocytes have an impaired pre-TCR checkpoint with failure of TCRbeta gene rearrangement and increased apoptosis, resulting in reduced cellularity of the thymus. Moreover, the degradation of beta-catenin in response to DNA damage is significantly impaired in SIP-\/- cells. SIP-\/- embryonic fibroblasts show a growth-rate increase resulting from defects in G1 arrest. Thus, the beta-catenin degradation pathway mediated by SIP defines an essential checkpoint for thymocyte development and cell-cycle progression.","3743":"Although cellular receptors for immunoglobulins were first identified nearly 40 years ago, their central role in the immune response was discovered only in the last decade. They are key players in both the afferent and efferent phase of an immune response, setting thresholds for B cell activation, regulating the maturation of dendritic cells, and coupling the exquisite specificity of the antibody response to innate effector pathways, such as phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. Moreover, because of their general presence as receptor pairs consisting of activating and inhibitory molecules on the same cell, they have become a paradigm for studying the balance of positive and negative signals that ultimately determine the outcome of an immune response. This review will summarize recent results in Fc-receptor biology with an emphasis on data obtained in in vivo model systems.","3744":"Both interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signal via the adapter molecule MyD88. However, in response to a cutaneous infection challenge, the downstream signaling events diverge and IL-1R, but not TLR2, proves to be essential for host defense.","3745":"Follicular dendritic cells signal the formation of B cell follicles as well as B cell activation, proliferation, and maturation. However, the precise molecular pathways controlling these processes are just beginning to be unraveled.","3746":"How does signaling through the pre-TCR and gammadelta TCR generate distinct cell lineages? A new study shows that a cell-surface marker, CD27, identifies the first point of demarcation of these lineages and allows further probing into the critical regulatory factors that control beta and gammadelta selection.","3747":"A key strategy to protect humans against an influenza pandemic is the development of an effective vaccine. However, the development of effective pandemic vaccines poses both practical and immunological challenges.","3748":"","3749":"","3750":"The crystal structure of a recombinant mouse single chain CD8alphabeta ectodomains at 2.4 A resolution reveals paired immunoglobulin variable region-like domains with a striking resemblance to CD8alphaalpha in size, shape, and surface electrostatic potential of complementarity-determining regions (CDR), despite &lt;20% sequence identity between the CD8alpha and CD8beta subunits. Unlike the CD8alpha subunit(s) in the heterodimer or homodimer, the CDR1 loop of CD8beta tilts away from its corresponding CDR2 and CDR3 loops. Consistent with this observation, independent mutational studies reveal that alanine substitutions of residues in the CDR1 loop of CD8beta have no effect on CD8alphabeta coreceptor function, whereas mutations in CD8beta CDR2 and CDR3 loops abolish CD8alphabeta coreceptor activity. The implications of these findings and additional CD8alpha mutational studies for CD8alphabeta- versus CD8alphaalpha-MHCI binding are discussed.","3751":"The lethal outcome of high-dose pulmonary virus infection is thought to reflect high-level, sustained virus replication and associated lung inflammation prior to development of an adaptive immune response. Herein, we demonstrate that the outcome of lethal\/sublethal influenza infection instead correlates with the initial virus replication tempo. Furthermore, the magnitude of early lung antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies inversely with inoculum dose and is controlled by lymph-node-resident dendritic cells (LNDC) through IL-12p40-regulated FasL-dependent T cell apoptosis. These results suggest that the inoculum dose and replication rate of a pathogen entering the respiratory tract may regulate the strength of the adaptive immune response, and the subsequent outcome of infection and that LNDC may serve as regulators (gatekeepers) in the development of CD8+ T cell responses.","3752":"CD45 is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase highly expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells. We previously generated mice containing a point mutation in the juxtamembrane wedge of CD45. Demonstrating the critical negative regulatory function of the wedge, the CD45 E613R mutation led to a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) and a lupus-like autoimmune syndrome. Here we show the central role of B cells in this phenotype. Genetic elimination of B cells, but not T cells, ablates the LPD. In contrast to CD45-deficient B cells, the E613R mutation generates hyperresponsive B cells. Comparison of CD45-deficient and CD45 E613R mice reveals dichotomous effects of these mutations on B cell development. Together, the results support a role for CD45 as a rheostat, with both positive and negative regulatory functions, that fine-tunes the signal transduction threshold at multiple checkpoints in B cell development.","3753":"Lentiviral Nef increases T cell signaling activity, but the molecular nature of the stimulus involved is incompletely described. We explored CD4 T cell lipid raft composition in the presence and absence of Nef. Here, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7, which acts in conjunction with c-Cbl, is absent from lipid rafts. This Nef-mediated exclusion is associated with failure of ubiquitination of activated Vav. In the presence of Nef, lipid raft Cdc42 is activated and forms a ternary complex between the c-Cbl-interacting protein p85Cool-1\/betaPix and c-Cbl, displacing UbcH7 from rafts. Suppression of p85Cool-1\/betaPix expression restores UbcH7 raft localization and Vav ubiquitination and diminishes Cdc42 activity. Moreover, p85Cool-1\/betaPix knockdown attenuates HIV replication. Thresholds for activation of signaling involve the intricate balance of positive and negative regulators. Here we provide evidence for Nef disruption of a negative regulator of T cell signaling in promoting HIV replication.","3754":"Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), a distinct skin-resident dendritic cell population, acquire antigen in the skin and migrate to draining lymph nodes where they are thought to initiate adaptive immune responses. To examine the functional requirement of LCs in skin immunity, we generated BAC transgenic mice in which the regulatory elements from human Langerin were used to drive expression of diphtheria toxin. The resulting mice have a constitutive and durable absence of epidermal LCs but are otherwise intact. Unexpectedly, we found that contact hypersensitivity (CHS) was amplified rather than abrogated in the absence of LCs. Moreover, we showed that LCs act during the priming and not the effector phase. Thus, LCs not only were dispensable for CHS, but they served to regulate the response, a previously unappreciated function.","3755":"Beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling may contribute to the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and proliferation in some malignancies. We now show that expression of constitutively active beta-catenin in normal lymphoid or myeloid progenitors generated uncommitted cells with multilineage differentiation potential. Inappropriate gene expression occurred in cells destined to produce either cell type and caused corresponding changes in their characteristics. For example, forced activation of beta-catenin quickly increased C\/EBPalpha while reducing EBF and Pax-5 in lymphoid progenitors that then generated myeloid cells. Inversely, EBF dramatically increased in transduced myeloid progenitors and lymphocytes were produced. The results indicate that ectopic activation of beta-catenin destabilizes lineage fate decisions and confers some, but not all, stem cell properties on committed progenitors.","3756":"Proinflammatory caspases play an essential role in innate immune responses to infection by regulating the cleavage and activation of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of these enzymes requires the assembly of an intracellular molecular platform, termed the inflammasome, which is comprised of members of the pyrin domain (PYD)-containing superfamily of apoptosis and inflammation-regulatory proteins. We report here the identification and characterization of a poxvirus-encoded PYD-containing protein that interacts with the ASC-1 component of the inflammasome and inhibits caspase-1 activation and the processing of IL-1beta and IL-18 induced by diverse stimuli. Knockout viruses that do not express this protein are unable to productively infect monocytes and lymphocytes due to an abortive phenotype and are markedly attenuated in susceptible hosts due to decreased virus dissemination and enhanced inflammatory responses at sites of infection. Thus, modulation of inflammasome function constitutes an important immunomodulatory strategy employed by poxviruses to circumvent host antiviral responses.","3757":"CARMA1 mediates T cell receptor (TCR)-induced NF-kappaB activation. However, how TCR links to CARMA1 in the signaling pathway is not clear. Here, we show that CARMA1 is inducibly phosphorylated after TCR-CD28 costimulation. This phosphorylation is likely induced by PKCtheta, since PKCtheta induces phosphorylation of CARMA1 in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that the PKCtheta-induced phosphorylation of CARMA1 likely occurs on Ser552 on the Linker region of CARMA1. Importantly, expression of CARMA1 mutant, in which Ser552 is mutated, fails to mediate TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation in CARMA1-deficient T cells. The functional defect of this CARMA1 mutant is likely due to the fact that this mutant cannot be phosphorylated at the critical residue, thereby failing to recruit the downstream signaling components into the immunological synapse. Together, our studies provide the first genetic evidence that the phosphorylation of CARMA1 plays a critical role in the TCR signaling pathway.","3758":"PKC isoforms and CARMA1 play crucial roles in immunoreceptor-dependent NF-kappaB activation. We tested whether PKC-dependent phosphorylation of CARMA1 directly regulates this signaling cascade. B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement led to the progressive recruitment of CARMA1 into lipid rafts and to the association of CARMA1 with, and phosphorylation by, PKCbeta. Furthermore, PKCbeta interacted with the serine-rich CARMA1 linker, and both PKCbeta and PKCtheta phosphorylated identical serine residues (S564, S649, and S657) within this linker. Mutation of two of these sites ablated the functional activity of CARMA1. In contrast, deletion of the linker resulted in constitutive, receptor- and PKC-independent NF-kappaB activation. Together, our data support a model whereby CARMA1 phosphorylation controls NF-kappaB activation by triggering a shift from an inactive to an active CARMA1 conformer. This PKC-dependent switch regulates accessibility of the CARD and CC domains and controls assembly and full activation of the membrane-associated IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalosome.","3759":"Pathogens utilize many strategies to dampen the host inflammatory response. In this issue of Immunity, a report by Johnston and colleagues reveals a poxvirus strategy that inhibits the inflammasome, arresting secretion of interleukin-1-related cytokines, thus silencing key alarms that mobilize host defenses.","3760":"Antigen receptor-induced NF-kappaB activation depends on receptor-proximal and -distal signaling events. Two papers in this issue of Immunity demonstrate that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of CARMA1 is the critical molecular link that controls the activation of the IKK signalosome and NF-kappaB.","3761":"The lymphotoxin axis is important for the maintenance of several specialized lymphoid microenvironments in secondary lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid-tissue architecture is highly plastic and requires continual homeostatic signaling to maintain its basal functional state. The cellularity of lymph nodes in adult mice was reduced by systemic blockade of lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbeta R) signaling with a soluble decoy receptor both in resting and reactive settings. This reduction in cellularity resulted from greatly impaired lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes due to decreased levels of peripheral lymph node addressing (PNAd) and MAdCAM on high endothelial venules (HEV). LTbeta R signaling was required to maintain normal levels of RNA expression of MAdCAM, and also of PNAd by regulating the expression of key enzymes and scaffold proteins required for its assembly. Thus, the homeostatic maintenance of functional HEV status in adult mice relies largely on LTbeta R signaling.","3762":"The humoral immune response to protein antigens is composed of a rapid low-affinity IgM antibody response followed by an IgG response exhibiting higher affinity. Here, we demonstrate that Lsc, a protein that regulates G protein-coupled-receptor signaling and RhoA activation, is required by B lymphocytes for the antigen-specific IgM antibody response to a protein antigen. We further show that in lsc(-\/-) mice, MZB cells are selectively affected such that naive and in vivo-activated MZB cells migrate toward sphingosine-1-phosphate at increased proportions but release inefficiently from integrin ligands. Consequently, lsc(-\/-) MZB cells do not traffick appropriately in an immune response and do not contribute to the TD antibody response. These data demonstrate that Lsc regulates the migration and adhesion of MZB cells, and this regulation appears to be required for these cells to contribute to the antibody response to TD antigens.","3763":"We provide evidence that sensory neurons regulate the effector functions and phenotype of CD8+ T cells during active immunosurveillance of HSV-1 latency. Low-level viral gene expression in latently infected sensory ganglia gives rise to a unique, functionally active CD8+ T cell population. Surprisingly, distinct neuronal subsets require different CD8 effector mechanisms to maintain viral latency, with some requiring IFN-gamma and others requiring lytic granules (LG). This nonredundant efficacy of CD8+ T cell effector mechanisms in maintaining viral latency is explained as follows: (1) a subset of neurons that expresses IFN-gamma receptors (IFN-gamma R+) and Qa 1 responds to IFN-gamma, but Qa 1 engagement of CD94\/NKG2a blocks LG exocytosis by CD8+ T cells; (2) another neuronal subset is responsive to LG because it lacks Qa 1 and is refractory to IFN-gamma because it also lacks IFN-gamma R. In the latter subset, LG appear to provide a nonlethal block of viral reactivation.","3764":"Dendritic cells process internalized antigens to present degradative products on MHC for TCR recognition. Because antigen-exposed DCs also induce humoral immunity, DCs must also retain antigen in its native state for the engagement of BCR on B cells. Here, we demonstrate that antigen endocytosed by the inhibitory Fc receptor, FcgammaRIIB, accesses a non-degradative intracellular vesicular compartment that recycles to the cell surface, enabling interaction of native antigen with BCR on B cells. Immunization with IgG-opsonized, T independent antigens leads to enhanced humoral responses in a FcgammaRIIB and complement dependent manner. IC-loaded DCs trafficking to the splenic marginal zone can prime a T independent response in an FcgammaRIIB-dependent manner. Thus dendritic cells are equipped with both non-degradative and degradative antigen uptake pathways to facilitate antigen presentation to both B and T cells.","3765":"We found IL-6-STAT3 pathway suppresses MHC class II (MHCII) expression on dendritic cells (DCs) and attenuates T cell activation. Here, we showed that IL-6-STAT3 signaling reduced intracellular MHCII alphabeta dimmer, Ii, and H2-DM levels in DCs. IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation decreased cystatin C level, an endogenous inhibitor of cathepsins, and enhanced cathepsin activities. Importantly, cathepsin S inhibitors blocked reduction of MHCII alphabeta dimer, Ii, and H2-DM in the IL-6-treated DCs. Overexpression of cystatin C suppressed IL-6-STAT3-mediated increase of cathepsin S activity and reduction of MHCII alphabeta dimer, Ii, and H2-DM levels in DCs. Cathepsin S overexpression in DCs decreased intracellular MHCII alphabeta dimer, Ii, and H2-DM levels, LPS-mediated surface expression of MHCII and suppressed CD4(+) T cell activation. IL-6-gp130-STAT3 signaling in vivo decreased cystatin C expression and MHCII alphabeta dimer level in DCs. Thus, IL-6-STAT3-mediated increase of cathepsin S activity reduces the MHCII alphabeta dimer, Ii, and H2-DM levels in DCs, and suppresses CD4(+) T cell-mediated immune responses.","3766":"Cytokines of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family, such as IL-1 alpha\/beta and IL-18, have important functions in host defense, immune regulation, and inflammation. Insight into their biological functions has led to novel therapeutic approaches to treat human inflammatory diseases. Within the IL-1 family, IL-1 alpha\/beta, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 have been matched to their respective receptor complexes and have been shown to have distinct biological functions. The most prominent orphan IL-1 receptor is ST 2. This receptor has been described as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor-IL-1 receptor signaling, but it also functions as an important effector molecule of T helper type 2 responses. We report a member of the IL-1 family, IL-33, which mediates its biological effects via IL-1 receptor ST 2, activates NF-kappaB and MAP kinases, and drives production of T(H)2-associated cytokines from in vitro polarized T(H)2 cells. In vivo, IL-33 induces the expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and leads to severe pathological changes in mucosal organs.","3767":"Five TLRs are thought to play an important role in antiviral immunity, sensing viral products and inducing IFN-alpha\/beta and -lambda. Surprisingly, patients with a defect of IRAK-4, a critical kinase downstream from TLRs, are resistant to common viruses. We show here that IFN-alpha\/beta and -lambda induction via TLR-7, TLR-8, and TLR-9 was abolished in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. In contrast, IFN-alpha\/beta and -lambda were induced normally by TLR-3 and TLR-4 agonists. Moreover, IFN-beta and -lambda were normally induced by TLR-3 agonists and viruses in IRAK-4-deficient fibroblasts. We further show that IFN-alpha\/beta and -lambda production in response to 9 of 11 viruses tested was normal or weakly affected in IRAK-4-deficient blood cells. Thus, IRAK-4-deficient patients may control viral infections by TLR-3- and TLR-4-dependent and\/or TLR-independent production of IFNs. The TLR-7-, TLR-8-, and TLR-9-dependent induction of IFN-alpha\/beta and -lambda is strictly IRAK-4 dependent and paradoxically redundant for protective immunity to most viruses in humans.","3768":"The contribution of dendritic cells (DCs) to antibody responses through antigen-unspecific B cell costimulation is well documented. now demonstrate that the ITIM-bearing FcgammaRIIB allows DCs to recycle internalized native antigen (Ag) for presentation to B cells, a process that might be critical for the initiation of humoral responses.","3769":"Activation of ST2, an orphan member of the IL-1 receptor family for 16 years, drives T helper type 2 (T(H)2) responses. The cytokine IL-33 is the specific ligand for ST2. IL-33 recapitulates much of the existing data that ST2 promotes T(H)2-type responses. The caspase-1 processing of precursor IL-33 provides a therapeutic target to control allergic diseases.","3770":"The intrinsic refractoriness of naive T cells for cytokine production is counteracted by cells of the innate immune system. Upon sensing danger via Toll-like receptors, these cells upregulate T cell costimulatory molecules and secrete cytokines that enhance T cell activation. We show that cytokine-mediated priming of naive T cells requires the NF-kappaB family member c-Rel. In resting naive cells c-Rel is associated primarily with IkappaBbeta, an inhibitory molecule that is not effectively degraded by TCR signals. Exposure of T cells to proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, shifts c-Rel to IkappaBalpha-associated complexes that are readily targeted by the TCR. As a consequence, IL-2 and IFN-gamma mRNA are produced more quickly, and at higher levels, in cytokine-primed T cells. This mechanism does not operate in effector T cells where cytokine gene expression is c-Rel-independent. We propose that c-Rel plays a crucial role as a target of innate signals in T cells.","3771":"Activation of extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk) is central to growth-factor-receptor-mediated signaling including that originating from the T cell antigen receptor. It integrates cytoplasmic signals to effect changes in transcription associated with differentiation, proliferation, and survival. In this report, we present an analysis of mice with targeted deletions in Erk1 and Erk2 to assess the relationship between Erk activity and cell-cycle progression, thymocyte development, and lineage commitment. These studies show that Erk is selectively retained during beta selection-driven proliferation, and yet Erk1\/2 are not required to complete differentiation to CD4+CD8+ preselection stage of development. Erk activity is essential for the process of positive selection, and it differentially affects CD4 and CD8 T cell maturation; yet, diminished expression itself is not sufficient to alter lineage commitment.","3772":"To monitor IL-4 expression at the single-cell level, we generated mice with insertions of different reporter genes into both copies of the Il4 gene that permitted the simultaneous analysis of IL-4 transcripts via GFP and IL-4 protein secretion by use of huCD2. Innate and adaptive cells competent for IL-4 production were marked by GFP, while cells that presently or recently secreted IL-4 additionally displayed huCD2. After challenge with the strictly enteric helminth, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, GFP-positive innate and adaptive cells disseminated widely, but IL-4 secretion was predominantly mediated by CD4+ T cells in the intestines and draining lymphoid organs. IL-4-competent cells persisted in cured animals, and memory responses reflected rapid cytokine production at the site of rechallenge. These data reveal a two-step process for cytokine production: the first generating poised cells that disseminate systemically and the second inducing the rapid production of the cytokine in response to local stimulation.","3773":"Toll-like receptors modulate many aspects of the innate immune response. Recent reports suggest that the maturation of phagosomes following particle uptake is modulated through signaling of Toll-like receptors. In the current study, the kinetics of phagosome maturation was evaluated quantitatively by ratio fluorometry to determine the lumenal pH of the phagosomes and a FRET-based technique to determine the degree of phagosome\/lysosome fusion. Profiles generated for phagosomes containing experimental particles with or without the TLR ligands Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 or LPS failed to reveal a difference in maturation despite activating TLR-signaling pathways. Moreover, while macrophages defective in individual TLRs generated phagosome maturation profiles identical to wild-type macrophages, MyD88-deficient macrophages exhibited a marked depression in phagosome\/lysosome fusion that appears independent of short-term TLR-mediated effects. The results demonstrate that the rate of maturation of phagosomes proceeds independently of TLR signaling pathways.","3774":"Mature recirculating B cells are generally assumed to exist in follicular niches in secondary lymphoid organs, and these cells mediate T-dependent humoral immune responses. We show here that a large proportion of mature B lymphocytes occupy an anatomically and functionally distinct perisinusoidal niche in the bone marrow. Perisinusoidal B cells circulate freely, as revealed by parabiosis studies. However, unlike their counterparts in the follicular niche, these cells are capable of being activated in situ by blood-borne microbes in a T-independent manner to generate specific IgM antibodies. The bone marrow represents a unique type of secondary lymphoid organ in which mature B cells are strategically positioned in the path of circulating microbes.","3775":"Despite numerous reports on MHC class II expression by T cells from a wide spectrum of mammalian species including humans, the biological relevance of this phenomenon has never been tested with appropriately designed animal models. To address this issue, we developed mouse models in which immature thymocytes are the only positively selecting antigen-presenting cells in the thymus. In these mice, CD4+ T cells were generated with the appropriate maturation phenotype and showed a diverse repertoire of TCR Vbetas. The CD4+ T cells were functionally competent, mediating effective allogeneic responses that involved polyclonal TCR Vbetas. These results suggest that the thymocyte-thymocyte (T-T) interaction operates as an independent pathway for CD4+ T cell selection in the thymi of species with MHC II-positive thymocytes. This T-T interaction appears to be the basis for the generation of donor MHC-restricted CD4+ T cells in xenogeneic hosts.","3776":"Conventional understanding of CD4 T cell development is that the MHC class II molecules on cortical thymic epithelial cell are necessary for positive selection, as demonstrated in mouse models. Clinical data, however, show that hematopoietic stem cells reconstitute CD4 T cells in patients devoid of MHC class II. Additionally, CD4 T cells generated from human stem cells in immunocompromised mice were restricted to human, but not mouse, MHC class II. These studies suggest an alternative pathway for CD4 T cell development that does not normally exist in mice. MHC class II is expressed on developing human thymocytes, indicating a possible role of MHC II on thymocytes for CD4 T cell generation. Therefore, we created mice in which MHC class II is expressed only on T lineage cells. Remarkably, the CD4 compartment in such mice is efficiently reconstituted with unique specificity, demonstrating a novel thymocyte-driven pathway of CD4 T cell selection.","3777":"We recently reported that SHIP restrains LPS-induced classical (M1) activation of in vitro differentiated, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMPhis) and that SHIP upregulation is essential for endotoxin tolerance. Herein, we show that in vivo differentiated SHIP-\/- peritoneal (PMPhis) and alveolar (AMPhis) macrophages, unlike their wild-type counterparts, are profoundly M2 skewed (alternatively activated), possessing constitutively high arginase I (ArgI) and Ym1 levels and impaired LPS-induced NO production. Consistent with this, SHIP-\/- mice display M2-mediated lung pathology and enhanced tumor implant growth. Interestingly, BMMPhis from SHIP-\/- mice do not display this M2 phenotype unless exposed to TGFbeta within normal mouse plasma (MP) during in vitro differentiation. Our results suggest that SHIP functions in vivo to repress M2 skewing and that macrophage polarization can occur during differentiation in response to TGFbeta if progenitors have elevated PIP3.","3778":"Structural studies on T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for foreign antigens demonstrated a remarkably similar topology characterized by a central, diagonal TCR binding mode that maximizes interactions with the MHC bound peptide. However, three recent structures involving autoimmune TCRs demonstrated unusual interactions with self-peptide\/MHC complexes. Two TCRs from multiple sclerosis patients bind with unconventional topologies, and both TCRs are shifted toward the peptide N terminus and the MHC class II beta chain helix. A TCR from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model binds in a conventional orientation, but the structure is unusual because the self-peptide only partially fills the binding site. For all three TCRs, interaction with the MHC bound self-peptide is suboptimal, and only two or three TCR loops contact the peptide. Optimal TCR binding modes confer a competitive advantage for antimicrobial T cells during an infection, whereas altered binding properties may permit survival of a subset of autoreactive T cells during thymic selection.","3779":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the archetypal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) envisioned by as innate sensors of pathogen attack and host triggers of an adaptive immune response. Two recent papers (Choe et al., 2005; Bell et al., 2005) reveal the distinctive architecture of a TLR sensor domain and hint at how this structural design facilitates the recognition of a wide array of pathogen molecules.","3780":"Functional polarization of macrophages into M1 or M2 cells is an operationally useful, simplified conceptual framework describing the plasticity of mononuclear phagocytes. Genetic approaches have begun to shed new light on mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization and on the actual in vivo significance of polarized M2 cells ( [this issue of Immunity]).","3781":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) trigger inflammatory signaling in macrophages and enrich on phagosomes, suggesting that TLRs may directly influence phagosome formation and maturation. However, in this issue of Immunity, Yates and Russell use carefully defined particles and quantitative methodology to measure phagosome maturation and find no effect of TLR signaling on the process.","3782":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are major constituents of peripheral tissues, where they control immunity to foreign and self-antigens. The process of continuous DC renewal under homeostatic conditions is largely undefined. Here, we demonstrate that CD14+ DC precursors, either derived from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells or isolated from blood, were attracted by the chemokine CXCL14, which is constitutively produced in healthy skin and other epithelial tissues. In a tissue model we show that human epidermal equivalents profoundly affected CD14+ DC precursors, including their suprabasal positioning and survival as well as their differentiation into Langerhans cell-like cells with potent antigen-presentation functions. Our model assigns unprecedented roles to CXCL14 and epidermal tissue as attractant and niche of differentiation, respectively, in the renewal of Langerhans cells under steady-state conditions.","3783":"Certain microbes evade host innate immunity by killing activated macrophages with the help of virulence factors that target prosurvival pathways. For instance, infection of macrophages with the TLR4-activating bacterium Bacillus anthracis triggers an apoptotic response due to inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activation by the bacterial-produced lethal toxin. Other pathogens induce macrophage apoptosis by preventing activation of NF-kappaB, which depends on IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta). To better understand how p38 and NF-kappaB maintain macrophage survival, we searched for target genes whose products prevent TLR4-induced apoptosis and a p38-dependent transcription factor required for their induction. Here we describe key roles for transcription factor CREB, a target for p38 signaling, and the plasminogen activator 2 (PAI-2) gene, a target for CREB, in maintenance of macrophage survival.","3784":"Intercellular signals can be transmitted through neuronal synapses or through gap junctions, with the latter mediating transmission of calcium fluxes and small molecules between cells. We show here that a third form of communication between cells can be mediated by tunneling nanotubules (TNT). When myeloid-lineage dendritic cells and monocytes are triggered to flux calcium by chemical or mechanical stimulation, the signal can be propagated within seconds to other cells at distances hundreds of microns away via TNT. A complex and transient network of TNT is seen in live cells, with individual tubules exhibiting substantial variation in length and diameter. In addition to calcium fluxes, microinjected dye tracers can be transferred through these connections. Following TNT-mediated stimulation, spreading of lamellipodia occurs in dendritic cells characteristic of that seen during the phagocytic response to bacteria. These results demonstrate that nonneuronal cells can transmit signals to distant cells through a physically connected network.","3785":"Antigen receptor-mediated signaling is critical for the development and survival of B cells. However, it has not been established whether B cell development requires a signal from self-ligand engagement at the immature stage, a process known as \"positive selection.\" Here, using a monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) mouse line, specific for the self-Thy-1\/CD90 glycoprotein, we demonstrate that BCR crosslinking by low-dose self-antigen promotes survival of immature B cells in culture. In spleen, an increase in BCR signaling strength, induced by low-dose self-antigen, directed naive immature B cells to mature, not into the default follicular B cell fate, but instead into the marginal-zone B cell subset. These data indicate that positive selection can occur in developing B cells and that BCR signal strength is a key factor in deciding between two functionally distinct mature B cell compartments in the microenvironment of the spleen.","3786":"Understanding the regulation of immune responses is central for control of autoimmune and infectious disease. In murine models of autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory disease, potent regulatory T lymphocytes have recently been characterized. Despite an explosion of interest in these cells, their relevance to human disease has been uncertain. In a longitudinal study of malaria sporozoite infection via the natural route, we provide evidence that regulatory T cells have modifying effects on blood-stage infection in vivo in humans. Cells with the characteristics of regulatory T cells are rapidly induced following blood-stage infection and are associated with a burst of TGF-beta production, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production, and decreased antigen-specific immune responses. Both the production of TGF-beta and the presence of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells are associated with higher rates of parasite growth in vivo. P. falciparum-mediated induction of regulatory T cells may represent a parasite-specific virulence factor.","3787":"The c-Myb transcription factor is crucial during definitive hematopoiesis. However, the embryonic lethality of Myb traditional null mutations has precluded analysis of c-Myb function in lymphocytes. Using tissue-specific inactivation at the Myb locus, we demonstrate that loss of Myb causes a partial block during B cell development at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition, resulting in greatly decreased output of new B cells from the bone marrow. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Myb is not essential for the proliferation of splenic B cells, but that loss of c-Myb function prevents normal B cell homeostasis due to decreased splenic B cell survival. Decreased survival is accompanied by hyporesponsiveness to the B cell survival factor BLyS (also termed BAFF), decreased expression of the BLyS receptor 3 (BR3), and altered regulation of PKCdelta nuclear accumulation. Thus, c-Myb is important during multiple stages of B-lymphopoiesis.","3788":"Vav1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho-family GTPases, which is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR stimulation. Vav1-deficient mice have defects in positive and negative selection of thymocytes as well as TCR-induced proliferation in mature T cells, demonstrating a critical role for Vav1 in transducing TCR signals. Binding of phospholipids to the PH domain of Vav1 has been proposed to regulate its GEF activity in vitro. To test this model in vivo, we have generated mice carrying a point mutation in the PH domain of Vav1, and we show that they have defects in T cell development and activation. We demonstrate that the mutation affects the function of Vav1 as a GEF and perturbs PI3K-dependent pathways downstream of Vav1. Unexpectedly, the mutation selectively affects TCR-induced proliferation of CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T cells, demonstrating differences in the wiring of TCR signaling pathways between the two lineages.","3789":"Perforin delivers granzymes to induce target-cell apoptosis. At high concentrations, perforin multimerizes in the plasma membrane to form pores. However, whether granzymes enter target cells via membrane pores is uncertain. Here we find that perforin at physiologically relevant concentrations and during cell-mediated lysis creates pores in the target-cell membrane, transiently allowing Ca(2+) and small dyes into the cell. The Ca(2+) flux triggers a wounded membrane-repair response in which internal vesicles, including lysosomes and endosomes, donate their membranes to reseal the damaged membrane. Perforin also triggers the rapid endocytosis of granzymes into large EEA-1-staining vesicles. The restoration of target-cell membrane integrity by triggering the repair response is necessary for target cells subjected to cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack to avoid necrosis and undergo the slower process of programmed cell death. Thus, the target cell actively participates in determining its own fate during cell-mediated death.","3790":"Questions regarding T cell development have recently received much attention, but the earliest intrathymic differentiation steps in adult mice have remained controversial. Three new papers together show that for at least some thymus-settling precursors, the loss of B lineage potential occurs in the thymus, and Notch acts on multipotent progenitors early after thymic entry.","3791":"The contribution of a self-antigen to marginal-zone B lymphocytes is described in this issue (). Other interpretations of these important findings are considered here.","3792":"In many host-parasite systems, regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25+, FOXP3+) have been shown to modulate cellular immunity and pathology. In this issue of Immunity, Walther et al. have now shown that following experimental malaria infection of human volunteers, enhanced TGF-beta and T reg responses are associated with a faster parasite growth rate. The study demonstrates that regulation of cellular immunity must be addressed if we are to develop successful interventions.","3793":"Aire promotes the tolerization of thymocytes by inducing the expression of a battery of peripheral-tissue antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that the cellular mechanism by which Aire exerts its tolerance-promoting function is not primarily positive selection of regulatory T cells, but rather negative selection of T effector cells. Surprisingly, supplementing its influence on the transcription of genes encoding peripheral-tissue antigens, Aire somehow enhances the antigen-presentation capability of medullary epithelial cells. Thus, this transcriptional control element promotes central tolerance both by furnishing a specific thymic stromal cell type with a repertoire of self antigens and by better arming such cells to present these antigens to differentiating thymocytes. In Aire's absence, autoimmunity and ultimately overt autoimmune disease develops.","3794":"The functional activity of integrins is dynamically regulated by T cell receptor stimulation and by protein kinase C (PKC). We report a novel function for the PKC effector protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in integrin activation. Constitutively active and kinase-inactive PKD1 mutants lacking the PKD1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain block phorbol ester- and TCR-mediated activation and clustering of beta1 integrins. The PH domain of PKD1 mediates the association of PKD1 with the GTPase Rap1 and is central to Rap1 activation and membrane translocation in T cells. Furthermore, PKD1 and Rap1 associate with beta1 integrins in a manner that is dependent on the carboxy-terminal end of the beta1 integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain. beta1 integrin expression is required for Rap1 activation and membrane localization of the PKD1-Rap1 complex. Therefore, PKD1 promotes integrin activation in T cells by regulating Rap1 activation and membrane translocation via interactions with the beta1 integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain.","3795":"V(D)J recombination is a tightly controlled process of somatic recombination whose regulation is mediated in part by chromatin structure. Here, we report that RAG2 binds directly to the core histone proteins. The interaction with histones is observed in developing lymphocytes and within the RAG1\/RAG2 recombinase complex in a manner that is dependent on the RAG2 C terminus. Amino acids within the plant homeo domain (PHD)-like domain as well as a conserved acidic stretch of the RAG2 C terminus that is considered to be a linker region are important for this interaction. Point mutations that disrupt the RAG2-histone association inhibit the efficiency of the V(D)J recombination reaction at the endogenous immunoglobulin locus, with the most dramatic effect in the V to DJ(H) rearrangement.","3796":"The recruitment of basophils into the sites of allergic inflammation is often observed. However, no definitive evidence has been provided that basophils are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic disorders. Here, we show that basophils are responsible for the development of IgE-mediated chronic allergic inflammation independently of T cells and mast cells. A single subcutaneous injection of multivalent antigens elicited not only immediate- and late-phase ear swelling but also delayed-onset ear swelling with massive eosinophil infiltration in mice sensitized with antigen-specific IgE. Mast cells were essential for the immediate- and late-phase ear swelling but dispensable for the delayed one. T cells were also dispensable for the latter. Transfer of FcRI-expressing basophils into FcRI-deficient mice restored the development of the delayed-onset allergic inflammation. These findings indicate a novel mechanism of development of chronic allergic inflammation that is induced by basophils through the interaction of antigen, IgE, and FcRI.","3797":"Posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms control TNFalpha expression through AU-rich elements in the 3'UTR of its mRNA. This is mediated through Erk and p38 MAP kinase signaling, although the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the MAP kinase signal-integrating kinases (Mnks), which are activated by both these pathways, regulate TNFalpha expression in T cells via the 3'UTR. A selective Mnk inhibitor or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mnk1 inhibits TNFalpha production in T cells, whereas Mnk1 overexpression enhances expression of a reporter construct containing the TNFalpha 3'UTR. We identify ARE binding proteins that are Mnk substrates, such as hnRNP A1, which they phosphorylate at two sites in vitro. hnRNP A1 is phosphorylated in response to T cell activation, and this is blocked by Mnk inhibition. Moreover, Mnk-mediated phosphorylation decreases binding of hnRNP A1 to TNFalpha-ARE in vitro or TNFalpha-mRNA in vivo. Therefore, Mnks are novel players in cytokine regulation and potential new targets for anti-inflammatory therapy.","3798":"DNA and RNA stimulate the mammalian innate immune system through activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). DNA containing methylated CpG motifs, however, is not stimulatory. Selected nucleosides in naturally occurring RNA are also methylated or otherwise modified, but the immunomodulatory effects of these alterations remain untested. We show that RNA signals through human TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, but incorporation of modified nucleosides m5C, m6A, m5U, s2U, or pseudouridine ablates activity. Dendritic cells (DCs) exposed to such modified RNA express significantly less cytokines and activation markers than those treated with unmodified RNA. DCs and TLR-expressing cells are potently activated by bacterial and mitochondrial RNA, but not by mammalian total RNA, which is abundant in modified nucleosides. We conclude that nucleoside modifications suppress the potential of RNA to activate DCs. The innate immune system may therefore detect RNA lacking nucleoside modification as a means of selectively responding to bacteria or necrotic tissue.","3799":"The mechanisms that mediate the recruitment of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes in vivo are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the mechanisms by which exogenously produced CD4(+) Th1 and Th2 cells roll and adhere in Con A-inflamed liver microcirculation differ dramatically: Th1 cells use alpha(4)beta(1)-integrin and Th2 cells use the vascular adhesion protein (VAP)-1. P-selectin plays no detectable role in Th1 or Th2 cell trafficking in liver microcirculation. Cellular recruitment in the liver sinusoids has previously been shown to be independent of many known adhesion molecules, leading to the suggestion that recruitment in these structures is mediated by physical trapping. While this may still be true for neutrophils, Th1 and Th2 cells use alpha(4)-integrin and VAP-1, respectively, to adhere within the liver sinusoids.","3800":"Calcium modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML) is a ubiquitously expressed protein implicated in T cell signaling, although its mechanism and physiologic role in the immune system are unknown. We show here that CAML is essential for peripheral T cell development. Inactivation of CAML in mouse thymocytes lowered the numbers of double-positive and single-positive thymocytes, concomitant with reduced positive and enhanced negative selection. We found that CAML interacts with p56Lck and appears to regulate subcellular localization of the kinase in both resting and T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated cells. CAML-deficient cells displayed enhanced p56lck and ZAP-70 phosphorylation and increased IL2 production and cell death after TCR stimulation, suggesting that CAML may act as a negative regulator of p56lck. Our data establish a novel role for CAML as an essential mediator of T cell survival during thymopoiesis and indicate that its loss deregulates p56Lck signaling.","3801":null,"3802":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) animal models such as the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse have improved our understanding of disease pathophysiology, but many candidate therapeutics identified therein have failed to prevent\/cure human disease. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation of disease-modifying agents tested in the NOD mouse based on treatment timing, duration, study length, and efficacy. Interestingly, some popular tenets regarding NOD interventions were not confirmed: all treatments do not prevent disease, treatment dose and timing strongly influence efficacy, and several therapies have successfully treated overtly diabetic mice. The analysis provides a unique perspective on NOD interventions and suggests that the response of this model to therapeutic interventions can be a useful predictor of the human response as long as careful consideration is given to treatment dose, timing, and protocols; more thorough investigation of these parameters should improve clinical translation.","3803":"In this issue of Immunity, Anderson et al. provide another clue to the riddle that is Aire--why do human beings and mice lacking Aire develop diffuse and pathogenic autoimmunity? They find that Aire influences central tolerance not only by promoting the expression of peripheral self-proteins in thymic medullary epithelial cells (MECs) but also by furnishing these cells with the apparatus for effective antigen presentation ().","3804":"CpG methylation of DNA silences TLR9-mediated innate immune recognition. In this issue of Immunity, Kariko et al (2005) suggest that the innate immune recognition of RNA by TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8 is in fact controlled by modification of nucleotides, including methylation.","3805":"A number of modified histones, including acetylated H3 and H4 and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX), are associated with V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination (CSR). In contrast, little is known concerning the chromatin modifications associated with somatic hypermutation (SHM) in vivo. Here, we report that several modifications--including histone acetylation and H3-lysine 4 methylation--fail to demarcate an actively hypermutating immunoglobulin (Ig) locus or to correlate spatially with SHM within Ig loci. Furthermore, no obvious association between SHM and gammaH2AX could be detected. Instead, we find that the phosphorylated form of histone H2B (H2B(Ser14P)) correlates tightly with SHM and CSR. Phosphorylation of H2B within Ig variable and switch regions requires AID and may be mediated by the histone kinase Mst1. These findings indicate that SHM and CSR trigger distinct DNA damage responses and identify a novel histone modification pattern for SHM consisting of H2B(Ser14P) in the absence of gammaH2AX.","3806":"Il4 and Il13, closely linked genes, are expressed monoallelically in TH2 cells. Four different approaches (RNA FISH, cultures from Il13T-Il4\/Il13-G4 mice, cultures from heterozygous Il13-Il4 double knockout mice, and a highly selected set of BABL\/c*CAST\/Ei clones displaying strong Il4 allelic bias) were utilized to study monoallelic expression of Il4 and coexpression of Il4 and Il13 on the same chromosome. There was a random probability for expression of one or two Il4 and one or two Il13 alleles; coexpression of cis and trans Il4 and Il13 alleles was equally probable. Histone H3 acetylation of CNS1, located in the Il13-Il4 intergenic region, was permissive for expression of IL-4 and IL-13 but did not determine the degree of their expression. Thus, monoallelism at the Il4 locus is a complex process; expression is linked to opening CNS1 but probability of expression is controlled at other sites. Based on these probabilities, individual cells randomly express Il4 and Il13 alleles.","3807":"For developing T cells, coreceptor choice is matched to T cell antigen receptor (TCR) MHC specificity during positive selection in the thymus, but the mechanism remains uncertain. Here, we document that TCR-mediated positive selection signals inactivate the immature CD8(III) enhancer in double positive (DP) thymocytes, explaining in part the cessation of CD8 coreceptor transcription that occurs during positive selection. More importantly, by placing CD4 protein expression under the control of CD8 transcriptional regulatory elements, we demonstrate that cessation of CD4 coreceptor transcription during positive selection results in precisely the same lineage fate as cessation of CD8 coreceptor transcription. That is, MHC-II-signaled DP thymocytes differentiated into CD8-lineage cytotoxic T cells, despite the MHC-II specificity and CD4 dependence of their TCRs. This study demonstrates that termination of coreceptor transcription during positive selection promotes CD8-lineage fate, regardless of TCR specificity or coreceptor protein identity.","3808":"Anopheles gambiae uses effective immune responses, including phagocytosis, to fight microbial infection. We have developed a semiquantitative phagocytosis test and used it in conjunction with dsRNA gene silencing to test the in vivo roles of 71 candidate genes in phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we show that inactivation of 26 genes changes the phagocytic activity by more than 45% and that two pathways similar to those that mediate apoptotic cell removal in Caenorhabditis elegans are used in A. gambiae for phagocytosis of microorganisms. Simultaneous inactivation of the identified regulators of phagocytosis and conserved components defining each signaling pathway permitted provisional assignment of the novel regulators to one or the other pathway. Pathway inactivation enhances at least three times the ability of E. coli and S. aureus to proliferate in the mosquito. Interestingly, mosquito survival is not compromised even if both pathways are perturbed simultaneously.","3809":"When hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are adoptively transferred into HBV transgenic mice, they enter the liver, recognize antigen, secrete interferon gamma (IFNgamma), inhibit viral replication, and kill their target cells, causing hepatitis. In the current study, we examined the impact of antigen recognition on the evolution of the activation phenotype, antiviral effector functions, expansion and contraction kinetics, and compartmentalization of the transferred CTLs. The results reveal that noncytolytic and cytolytic effector functions and expansion-contraction kinetics of the CTLs are regulated asynchronously and in an oscillatory manner as a consequence of antigen recognition in the liver and in association with PD-1 upregulation. We suggest that such oscillations maximize viral clearance and minimize tissue injury during HBV infection and that poor coordination of these events could lead to viral persistence and chronic liver disease.","3810":"Mouse IgG subclasses display a hierarchy of in vivo activities, with IgG2a and IgG2b showing the greatest protective and pathogenic properties. These enhanced activities result, in part, from their ability to bind to a novel, gamma chain-dependent, activating IgG Fc receptor, FcgammaRIV. FcgammaRIV maps in the 75 kb genomic interval between FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII; its expression is restricted to myeloid lineage cells, and it binds to IgG2a and IgG2b with intermediate affinity. No binding to IgG1 or IgG3 was observed. Blocking FcgammaRIV binding to pathogenic anti-platelet antibodies is sufficient to protect mice from antibody-induced thrombocytopenia. Thus, the FcgammaR system has evolved distinct activation receptors displaying selectivity for IgG subclasses, with IgG1 antibodies exclusively dependent on FcgammaRIII, whereas IgG2a and IgG2b show preferential dependence on FcgammaRIV activation. These distinct binding affinities for the IgG subclasses to FcgammaRs account for their differential protective and pathogenic activities in vivo.","3811":"T cell priming to exogenous antigens reflects regulated antigen processing in dendritic cells, subsequent homing to lymph nodes, sustained interactions between T cells and antigen-bearing dendritic cells, and, ultimately, selective T cell activation and differentiation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that an intrinsic property of the class II:peptide complex is a key determinant that dictates the specificity of an emerging CD4 T cell response. We found that immunodominant peptides possess extremely long half-lives with class II molecules (t(1\/2) &gt; 150 hr), whereas cryptic peptides displayed half-lives of less than 10 hr. Furthermore, and most importantly, by using a peptide shuttle vector and four independent antigens, we demonstrate a direct, causative relationship between the half-life of peptide epitopes and their immunogenicity in vivo. Taken collectively, our results suggest the half-life of class II:peptide complexes is the primary parameter that dictates the ultimate hierarchy of the elicited T cell response.","3812":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in antiviral response by recognizing viral components. Recently, a RNA helicase, RIG-I, was also suggested to recognize viral double-stranded RNA. However, how these molecules contribute to viral recognition in vivo is poorly understood. We show by gene targeting that RIG-I is essential for induction of type I interferons (IFNs) after infection with RNA viruses in fibroblasts and conventional dendritic cells (DCs). RIG-I induces type I IFNs by activating IRF3 via IkappaB kinase-related kinases. In contrast, plasmacytoid DCs, which produce large amounts of IFN-alpha, use the TLR system rather than RIG-I for viral detection. Taken together, RIG-I and the TLR system exert antiviral responses in a cell type-specific manner.","3813":"B-1a and B-1b lymphocytes were found to exhibit specialized roles in providing immunity to Streptococcus pneumoniae and differ dramatically in their developmental requirements. Transgenic mice overexpressing CD19 (hCD19Tg) generated B-1a cells and natural antibodies that provided protection during infection, while CD19-deficient (CD19(-\/-)) mice lacked B-1a cells, lacked natural antibodies, and were more susceptible to infection. By contrast, pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) immunization protected CD19(-\/-) mice during lethal challenge, whereas hCD19Tg mice remained unprotected. This resulted from differences in the B-1b subset: the key population found to produce protective PPS-specific antibody in both wild-type and CD19(-\/-) mice. Thus, CD19(-\/-) mice generated B-1b cells and protective adaptive PPS-specific antibody responses, whereas hCD19Tg mice lacked B-1b cells and adaptive PPS-specific antibody responses. This reciprocal contribution of B-1a and B-1b subsets to innate and acquired immunity reveals an unexpected division of labor within the B-1 compartment that is normally balanced by their coordinated development.","3814":"How CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes commit to CD4 helper versus CD8 cytotoxic lineages is a central unresolved question in developmental immunology. In this issue, show that engineering CD4 for shutoff immediately after positive selection misdirects cells to the cytotoxic lineage. The result highlights the distinction between positive selection and lineage commitment and provides new impetus for reexamining lineage models.","3815":"The known IgG FcRs primarily mediate inflammation by interacting with IgG1, even though IgG2 isotypes tend to be more pathogenic. A novel FcgammaR that binds IgG2 but not IgG1 has just been identified, potentially explaining differences in biological activity that are seen with various IgG isotypes.","3816":"Capsular polysaccharides enhance bacterial virulence. In this issue of Immunity, demonstrate a division of labor between the B-1 B cell subsets: natural antibodies from B-1a cells limit infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas B-1b cells generate the anticapsule-induced response that prevents fatal infection.","3817":null,"3818":"Mice with mutations in CD19 Y482\/Y513 form germinal centers (GC) but fail to produce high-affinity antibodies. In these mice, GC B cell differentiation, proliferation, and class switching occur but are defective. Altered CD19 signaling results in retention of early GC B cells and reduced proliferation in the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) zone of GC, and causes failure to select for high-affinity mutations. In normal mice, the earliest detectable aggregates of GC B cells are in contact with FDC and IgM+ cells are only found in the FDC zone, further evidence that the FDC zone is the site of initial GC B cell proliferation, differentiation, and class switching. Proliferation in the non-FDC zone and somatic mutation are not dependent on CD19, indicating separate signaling requirements for the two GC compartments, but these CD19-independent GC functions are not sufficient to generate high-affinity antibodies and B cell memory.","3819":"T cell shape is dictated by the selective recruitment of molecules to different regions of the cell (polarity) and is integral to every aspect of T cell function, from migration to cytotoxicity. This study describes a mechanism for the regulation of T cell polarity. We show that T cells contain a network of asymmetrically distributed proteins with the capacity to dictate the subcellular localization of both cell surface receptors and morphological determinants in T cells. Proteins from the Scribble, Crumbs3, and Par3 complexes, previously shown to regulate epithelial polarity, were polarized in T cells containing either uropods or immunological synapses. Reduction in Scribble expression prevented the polarization of cell surface receptors and prevented morphological changes associated with uropod formation, migration, and antigen presentation. By dynamically coordinating molecular distribution throughout the T cell, this network provides a mechanism by which T cell function and polarity are linked.","3820":"STAT proteins are a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Once activated, STAT proteins translocate into the nucleus and help coordinate gene transcription. One striking feature of STAT signaling is its rapid and transient activation and deactivation cycle, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this remain poorly understood. Here, we report on a nuclear protein that contains both PDZ and LIM domains and that interacts with activated STAT4 molecules. We show that SLIM is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that acts on STAT proteins to cause their proteosome-mediated degradation and enhance their dephosphorylation. Overexpression of SLIM leads to impaired STAT1 and STAT4 activity due to reduced STAT protein levels, while SLIM-deficiency results in increased STAT expression and thus enhanced IFNgamma production by Th1 cells. These studies suggest that SLIM is a novel ubiquitin E3 ligase whose targets include STAT proteins.","3821":"The mechanisms controlling the differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptional profiling approach, we identified Gfi1 as a novel critical transcription factor in DC differentiation. Gfi1-\/- mice showed a global reduction of myeloid and lymphoid DCs in all lymphoid organs whereas epidermal Langerhans cells were enhanced in number. In vivo, Gfi1-\/- DCs showed striking phenotypic and functional alterations such as defective maturation and increased cytokine production. In vitro, Gfi1-\/- hematopoietic progenitor cells were unable to develop into DCs. Instead, they differentiated into macrophages, suggesting that Gfi1 is a critical modulator of DC versus macrophage development. Analysis of hematopoietic chimeras and retrovirus-reconstituted hematopoietic progenitor cells established a cell autonomous and nonredundant role for Gfi1 in DC development. The developmental defect of Gfi1-\/- progenitor cells was associated with decreased STAT3 activation. In conclusion, we have identified Gfi1 as a critical transcription factor that controls DC versus macrophage development and dissociates DC maturation and activation.","3822":"Invariant Valpha14i NKT (iNKT) cells are a specialized subset of T lymphocytes with regulatory functions. They coexpress TCRalphabeta and natural killer cell markers. They differentiate through interaction of their Valpha14-Jalpha18 invariant TCRalpha chains with CD1d expressed on double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Although their development has been shown to be thymus dependent, their developmental pathway has not been definitively established. By using genetic analyses, we show here that all iNKT cells are selected from a pool of DP thymocytes. Their development is absolutely dependent on Runx1 and ROR(gamma)t, transcription factors that influence, but are not required for, development of conventional T cells. Our results indicate that even though CD1d binding DP thymocytes have yet to be observed, Valpha14-Jalpha18 rearrangement in these cells is required for development of iNKT cells.","3823":"Primary T helper 2 cells are heterogeneous, expressing subsets of cytokines at varying levels. Mechanisms controlling this spectrum of phenotypes are still unclear. The ETS family transcription factor PU.1 is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells. Th2 cytokine production is decreased in cultures transduced with a PU.1-expressing retrovirus and increased in Th2 cells following RNAi that decreases PU.1 expression. In primary cultures, PU.1 expression is restricted to a subpopulation of Th2 cells that express CCL22 and a subset of Th2 cytokines. PU.1 regulates the Th2 phenotype by interfering with GATA-3 DNA binding without altering GATA-3 protein levels. Thus, the expression of PU.1 in subsets of Th2 cells establishes a defined cytokine profile and contributes towards establishing the spectrum of cytokine production observed in Th2 populations.","3824":"The polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-derived serine proteases play a key role in immune complex (IC)-mediated inflammation. However, the mechanisms by which these proteases regulate inflammatory response remain largely undefined. Here, we show that IC-activated cathepsin G- and neutrophil elastase-deficient (CG\/NE) PMNs adhered normally to IC-coated surfaces but did not undergo CD11b clustering and failed to initiate cytoskeletal reorganization and cell spreading. As a result, CG\/NE-deficient PMNs exhibited severe defects in MIP-2 secretion and reactive oxygen intermediates production. Exogenously added CG, but not proteolytically inactive CG, was sufficient to restore these defects. These findings identify an important role for CG in integrin-dependent PMN effector functions that are separate from and downstream of integrin-dependent adhesion.","3825":"Psychological\/physical stresses are known to cause relapses of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To reveal a mechanism by which noninflammatory stresses affect host defenses, responses to immobilization stress in mice were investigated, focusing on the role of a multifunctional cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18). In the adrenal cortex, the stress induced IL-18 precursor proteins (pro-IL-18) via adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and a superoxide-mediated caspase-1 activation pathway, resulting in conversion of pro-IL-18 to the mature form, which was released into plasma. Inhibitors of caspase-1, reactive oxygen species, and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) suppressed stress-induced accumulation of plasma IL-18. These inhibitors also blocked stress-induced IL-6 expression. This, together with the observation that IL-6 was not induced in IL-18-deficient mice, showed that IL-6 induction by stress is dependent on IL-18. In stressed organisms, IL-18 may influence pathological and physiological processes. Controlling the caspase-1 activating pathway to suppress IL-18 levels may provide preventative means against stress-related disruption of host defenses.","3826":"The human nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-containing protein family consists of some 25 members related to the Apaf-1\/Ced-4 family of apoptosis regulators and certain plant disease-resistance genes (Inohara et al., 2004). One member, NOD2 (CARD15), has gained recent prominence through its association with increased susceptibility to several clinically important human inflammatory diseases, especially Crohn's disease (CD). NOD2 is a cytoplasmic molecule involved in sensing microbial cell wall components and regulating inflammatory processes and apoptosis. This review focuses on recent insights into the functions of normal and variant NOD2 proteins and the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying NOD2-associated inflammatory diseases.","3827":"De Libero et al. (2005) demonstrate in this issue of Immunity that bacterial infection leads to increased synthesis of autologous glycolipids that are recognized by CD1-restricted human T cells, indicating that recognition of inducible self-glycolipids could be a mechanism for microbial detection. This mechanism also may provide a connection between infection and autoimmunity.","3828":"There has been recent progress in understanding the mechanism of somatic hypermutation in germinal centers. By contrast, there is more theory than certainty about the way those cells that acquire heightened affinity for antigen are subsequently selected. Wang and Carter (2005) highlight this in the current issue of Immunity in a study of germinal center development in mice with impaired CD19 signaling.","3829":"In this issue of Immunity, Ludford-Menting at al. (2005) show that scaffold proteins previously implicated in the control of epithelial cell polarity also play an important role in determining the macroscopic organization of the engaged T cell.","3830":"Langerhans cells (LCs) are prominent dendritic cells (DCs) in epithelia, but their role in immunity is poorly defined. To track and discriminate LCs from dermal DCs in vivo, we developed knockin mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the langerin (CD207) gene. By using vital imaging, we showed that most EGFP(+) LCs were sessile under steady-state conditions, whereas skin inflammation induced LC motility and emigration to lymph nodes (LNs). After skin immunization, dermal DCs arrived in LNs first and colonized areas distinct from slower migrating LCs. LCs reaching LNs under steady-state or inflammatory conditions expressed similar levels of costimulatory molecules. Langerin and EGFP were also expressed on thymic DCs and on blood-derived, CD8alpha(+) DCs from all secondary lymphoid organs. By using a similar knockin strategy involving a diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) fused to EGFP, we demonstrated that LCs were dispensable for triggering hapten-specific T cell effectors through skin immunization.","3831":"Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) catabolizes the amino acid tryptophan. IDO-expressing immunoregulatory dendritic cells (DCs) have been implicated in settings including tumors, autoimmunity, and transplant tolerance. However, the downstream molecular mechanisms by which IDO functions to regulate T cell responses remain unknown. We now show that IDO-expressing plasmacytoid DCs activate the GCN2 kinase pathway in responding T cells. GCN2 is a stress-response kinase that is activated by elevations in uncharged tRNA. T cells with a targeted disruption of GCN2 were not susceptible to IDO-mediated suppression of proliferation in vitro. In vivo, proliferation of GCN2-knockout T cells was not inhibited by IDO-expressing DCs from tumor-draining lymph nodes. IDO induced profound anergy in responding wild-type T cells, but GCN2-knockout cells were refractory to IDO-induced anergy. We hypothesize that GCN2 acts as a molecular sensor in T cells, allowing them to detect and respond to conditions created by IDO.","3832":"Sustained signaling from the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules is thought necessary for generating high numbers of effector T cells. Here, we show that Survivin is controlled in peripheral T cells by OX40 cosignaling via sustained PI3k and PKB activation. Survivin is induced by OX40 independent of mitotic progression in late G1, and blocking Survivin suppresses S-phase transition and division of T cells and leads to apoptosis. Moreover, Survivin expression alone is sufficient to restore proliferation and to antagonize apoptosis in costimulation-deficient T cells and can rescue T cell expansion in vivo. Survivin allows effector T cells to accumulate in large numbers, but Bcl-2 family proteins are required for T cell survival after the phase of active division. Thus, sustained Survivin expression from costimulatory signaling maintains T cell division over time and regulates the extent of clonal expansion.","3833":"In plants and invertebrate animals, RNA silencing is a form of nucleic acid-based adaptive immunity. By contrast, jawed vertebrates have evolved complex protein-based adaptive immunity. Although short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been used as artificial tools to silence viral infection in human cells, it remains unknown whether mammalian viruses naturally elicit such immunity in vertebral cells. Here, we report the evidence that HIV-1 encodes viral siRNA precursors in its genome and that natural HIV-1 infection provokes nucleic acid-based immunity in human cells. To combat this cellular defense, HIV-1 has evolved in its Tat protein a suppressor of RNA silencing (SRS) function. Tat abrogates the cell's RNA-silencing defense by subverting the ability of Dicer to process precursor double-stranded RNAs into siRNAs.","3834":"The role of the T cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) in alphabeta\/gammadelta lineage commitment remains controversial, in particular whether different TCR isoforms intrinsically favor adoption of a certain lineage. Here, we demonstrate that impairing the signaling capacity of a gammadeltaTCR complex enables it to efficiently direct thymocytes to the alphabeta lineage. In the presence of a ligand, a transgenic gammadeltaTCR mediates almost exclusive adoption of the gammadelta lineage, while in the absence of ligand, the same gammadeltaTCR promotes alphabeta lineage development with efficiency comparable to the pre-TCR. Importantly, attenuating gammadeltaTCR signaling through Lck deficiency causes reduced ERK1\/2 activation and Egr expression and diverts thymocytes to the alphabeta lineage even in the presence of ligand. Conversely, ectopic Egr overexpression favors gammadelta T cell development. Our data support a model whereby gammadelta versus alphabeta lineage commitment is controlled by TCR signal strength, which depends critically on the ERK MAPK-Egr pathway.","3835":"Signals transduced by T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) have been shown to be critical for alphabeta and gammadelta T cell development, but their role in lineage determination remains poorly defined. Two models have been forwarded for alphabeta\/gammadelta lineage choice: the instructive model and the stochastic model. Recent data, however, are inconsistent with either model. In this study, we devised an experimental system in which lineage fate was controlled exclusively by the gammadeltaTCR. We then analyzed the impact of TCR signal strength on alphabeta\/gammadelta lineage development by altering the surface expression or signaling potential of the gammadeltaTCR complex. We found that increasing the gammadeltaTCR signal strength favored gammadelta lineage development, whereas weakening the gammadeltaTCR signal favored alphabeta lineage development. These results support a model in which the strength of the TCR signal is a critical determinant in the lineage fate decision.","3836":"Extracellular antigens are internalized and processed before binding MHC class II molecules within endosomal and lysosomal compartments of professional antigen presenting cells (APC) for subsequent presentation to T cells. Yet select cytoplasmic peptides derived from autoantigens also intersect and bind class II molecules via an unknown mechanism. In human B lymphoblasts, inhibition of the peptide transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) failed to alter class II-restricted cytoplasmic epitope presentation. By contrast, decreased display of cytoplasmic epitopes via class II molecules was observed in cells with diminished expression of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (Lamp-2). Overexpression of Lamp-2 isoform A (Lamp-2a), an established component of chaperone-mediated autophagy, enhanced cytoplasmic autoantigen presentation. Manipulating APC expression of heat shock cognate protein 70 (hsc70), a cofactor for Lamp-2a, also altered cytoplasmic class II peptide presentation. These results demonstrate a novel role for the lysosomal Lamp-2a-hsc70 complex in promoting immunological recognition and antigen presentation.","3837":"Costimulatory signals from dendritic cells (DCs) are required for naive T cells to respond to antigenic stimulation. To what extent DCs reactivate memory T cells during recall responses is not known. Here, an in vivo depletion system has been used to analyze the role of DCs in reactivating CD8 memory T cells during recall responses to three different microbial infections. We show a profound decrease in the numbers of responding memory CD8 T cells in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues during the recall responses to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), or influenza virus. These data show that interaction with DCs is a major mechanism driving T cell reactivation in vivo, even during a tissue-specific infection of the respiratory tract.","3838":"Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is a conserved major component of the outer membrane of Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we report that OmpA from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOmpA) activates macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in a TLR2-dependent way. However, TLR2 does not account for binding of KpOmpA to innate immune cells. KpOmpA binds the scavenger receptors (SRs) LOX-1 and SREC-I, but not other members of the same family. LOX-1 colocalizes and cooperates with TLR2 in triggering cellular responses. The TLR2-activated functional program includes production of the long pentraxin PTX3, a soluble pattern recognition receptor involved in resistance against diverse pathogens. PTX3, in turn, binds KpOmpA but does not affect recognition of this microbial moiety by cellular receptors. KpOmpA-elicited in vivo inflammation is abrogated in TLR2(-\/-) mice and significantly reduced in PTX3(-\/-) mice. Thus, SR-mediated KpOmpA recognition and TLR2-dependent cellular activation set in motion a nonredundant PTX3-mediated humoral amplification loop of innate immunity.","3839":"Phagocytosis requires receptor-mediated recognition of particles, usually in the guise of infectious agents and apoptotic cells. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes to generate phagolysosomes, which play a key role in enzymatic digestion of the internalized contents into component parts. Recent findings indicate that a simple paradigm of a single cognate receptor interaction that guides the phagosome to phagolysosome formation belies the complexity of combinatorial receptor recognition and diversity of phagosome function. In fact, phagosomes are comprised of hundreds of proteins that play a key role in deciphering the contents of the phagosome and in defining host response. In this review we discuss how the challenge of recognizing diverse molecular patterns is met by combinatorial interactions between phagocytic receptors. Furthermore, these combinations are dynamic and both sculpt the balance between a proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory response and direct phagosome diversity. We also indicate an important role for genetically tractable model organisms in defining key components of this evolutionarily conserved process.","3840":"","3841":"","3842":"","3843":"In developing B cells, expression of surface immunoglobulin is an important signal to terminate recombinase activator gene (RAG) expression and V(D)J recombination. However, autoreactive antigen receptors instead promote continued gene rearrangement and receptor editing. The regulation by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling of RAG expression and editing is poorly understood. We report that in editing-competent cells BCR ligand-induced RAG mRNA expression is regulated at the level of RAG transcription, rather than mRNA stability. In immature B cells carrying innocuous receptors, RAG expression appears to be under rapidly reversible negative regulation. Studies involving transduction of a superrepressive (sr) I kappa B alpha protein indicate that NF-kappaB\/Rel proteins promote RAG transcription. Interestingly, NF kappa B1-deficient cells overexpress RAG and undergo an exaggerated receptor editing response. Our data implicate NF kappa B transcription factors in the BCR-mediated regulation of RAG locus transcription. Rapidly activated NF kappa B pathways may facilitate prompt antigen receptor-regulated changes in RAG expression important for editing and haplotype exclusion.","3844":"Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) detect molecular signatures of microbes and initiate immune responses to infection. Prototypical PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signal via a conserved pathway to induce innate response genes. In contrast, the signaling pathways engaged by other classes of putative PRRs remain ill defined. Here, we demonstrate that the beta-glucan receptor Dectin-1, a yeast binding C type lectin known to synergize with TLR2 to induce TNF alpha and IL-12, can also promote synthesis of IL-2 and IL-10 through phosphorylation of the membrane proximal tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain and recruitment of Syk kinase. syk-\/- dendritic cells (DCs) do not make IL-10 or IL-2 upon yeast stimulation but produce IL-12, indicating that the Dectin-1\/Syk and Dectin-1\/TLR2 pathways can operate independently. These results identify a novel signaling pathway involved in pattern recognition by C type lectins and suggest a potential role for Syk kinase in regulation of innate immunity.","3845":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are key instigators of adaptive immune responses. Using an alphaviral expression cloning technology, we have identified the chemokine CCL19 as a potent inducer of T cell proliferation in a DC-T cell coculture system. Subsequent studies showed that CCL19 enhanced T cell proliferation by inducing maturation of DCs, resulting in upregulation of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CCL19 programmed DCs for the induction of T helper type (Th) 1 rather than Th2 responses. Importantly, only activated DCs that migrated from the periphery to draining lymph nodes, but not resting steady-state DCs residing within lymph nodes, expressed high levels of CCR7 in vivo and responded to CCL19 with the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Migrating DCs isolated from mice genetically deficient in CCL19 and CCL21 (plt\/plt) presented an only partially mature phenotype, highlighting the importance of these chemokines for full DC maturation in vivo. Our findings indicate that CCL19 and CCL21 are potent natural adjuvants for terminal activation of DCs and suggest that chemokines not only orchestrate DC migration but also regulate their immunogenic potential for the induction of T cell responses.","3846":"Hematopoiesis occurs in the liver and the bone marrow (BM) during murine development. Newborn mice with a ubiquitous deletion of I kappa B alpha develop a severe hematological disorder characterized by an increase of granulocyte\/erythroid\/monocyte\/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM) and hypergranulopoiesis. Here, we report that this particular myeloproliferative disturbance is mediated by continuously deregulated perinatal expression of Jagged1 in I kappa B alpha-deficient hepatocytes. The result is a permanent activation of Notch1 in neutrophils. In contrast, in mice with a conditional deletion of I kappa B alpha only in the myeloid lineage (ikba(flox\/flox) x LysM-Cre) and in fetal liver cell chimeras (ikba(FL delta\/FL delta)), a cell-autonomous induction of the myeloproliferative disease was not observed. Coculture of I kappa B alpha-deficient hepatocytes with wild-type (wt) BM cells induced a Jagged1-dependent increase in CFUs. In summary, we show that cell-fate decisions leading to a premalignant hematopoietic disorder can be initiated by nonhematopoietic cells with inactive I kappa B alpha.","3847":"The susceptibility to infections and the strong Th2 bias observed in neonates are thought to be due to the immaturity of the dendritic cell (DC) compartment. We show that neonatal DCs, like their adult counterparts, elicit Th1 responses. We also demonstrate that during potentially harmful systemic inflammation, after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 triggering, neonatal B cells produce high concentrations of IL-10, preventing optimal IL-12 secretion by neonatal DCs and, thus, Th1 priming. Although both CD5+ and CD5- B cell subsets respond to CpG ODN stimulation, we found that only CD5+ B cells produce IL-10. Therefore, these results show the regulatory role of CD5+ B cells on DC activation in vivo for Th1\/Th2 polarization and highlight the paradoxical effects of TLR triggering in vivo.","3848":"The identification of specific genetic loci that contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases has proved difficult due to the contribution of multiple interacting genes, the inherent genetic heterogeneity present in human populations, and a lack of new mouse mutants. By using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis to discover new immune regulators, we identified a point mutation in the murine phospholipase Cg2 (Plcg2) gene that leads to severe spontaneous inflammation and autoimmunity. The disease is composed of an autoimmune component mediated by autoantibody immune complexes and B and T cell independent inflammation. The underlying mechanism is a gain-of-function mutation in Plcg2, which leads to hyperreactive external calcium entry in B cells and expansion of innate inflammatory cells. This mutant identifies Plcg2 as a key regulator in an autoimmune and inflammatory disease mediated by B cells and non-B, non-T haematopoietic cells and emphasizes that by distinct genetic modulation, a single point mutation can lead to a complex immunological phenotype.","3849":"The factors regulating dendritic cell (DC) development and homeostasis are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that DCs express the lymphotoxin (LT)-beta receptor (LT beta R) and that in mice lacking the LT beta R in hematopoietic cells, spleen, and lymph node, CD8- DC numbers are reduced. B cells are a key source of LT alpha 1 beta 2 for splenic DC homeostasis, and transgenic overexpression of LT alpha 1 beta 2 on B cells leads to expansion of the CD8- DC compartment. Furthermore, we find that about 5% of splenic DCs are undergoing cell division, and the number of dividing CD8- DCs is disproportionately reduced in the absence of the LT beta R. In parabiosis experiments, splenic DCs were only partially replaced by circulating precursors over a 6 week period. We conclude that LT alpha 1 bet a2 acts on DCs or DC precursors to promote DC homeostasis, and we suggest that DC proliferation is an important pathway for locally maintaining these cells in the steady state.","3850":"Activating receptors in cells of hematopoetic origin include members of two unrelated protein families, the immunoglobulin (Ig) and C type lectins, which differ even in the orientation of the transmembrane (TM) domains. We examined assembly of four receptors with diverse function: the NK receptors KIR2DS and NKG2C\/CD94, the Fc receptor for IgA, and the GPVI collagen receptor. For each of the four different receptors studied here, assembly results in the formation of a three-helix interface in the membrane involving two acidic TM residues from the signaling dimer and a basic TM residue from the ligand recognition module, an arrangement remarkably similar to the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex. The fact that the TM domains of Ig family and C type lectins adopt opposite orientations proves that these receptor families independently evolved toward the same structural arrangement of the interacting TM helices. This assembly mechanism is thus widely utilized by receptors in cells of hematopoetic origin.","3851":"The complement system and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are two central arms of innate immunity that are critical to host defense as well as the development of adaptive immunity. Most pathogens activate both complement and TLRs, suggesting the potential for crosstalk between the two systems. We show here that the complement-derived C5a anaphylatoxin negatively regulates TLR4- and CD40-induced synthesis of IL-12 family cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27) from inflammatory macrophages (M phi s) by extracellular signal-regulated kinase- and phosphoinositide 3 kinase-dependent pathways. This decreased cytokine response translates into a decreased T helper type 1 (Th1) response in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we found enhanced Th1 immunity in C5a receptor-deficient mice, something that conferred protection from Leishmania major infection. Our findings identify the negative impact of C5a on IL-12 family cytokines as an important mechanism for regulating Th1 polarization in response to innate and adaptive immune network activation.","3852":"The immune system provides an attractive option for use in cancer therapy. Our increasing understanding of the molecular events important in the generation of an effective immune response presents us with the opportunity to manipulate key genes to boost the immune response against cancer. Genetic modification is being employed to enhance a range of immune processes including antigen presentation, activation of specific T cells, and localization of immune effectors to tumors. In this review, we describe how many diverse cell types, including dendritic cells, T cells, and tumor cells, are being modified with a variety of genes, including those encoding antigens, cytokines, and chemokines, in order to enhance tumor immunity.","3853":"NF-kappa B was discovered because of its binding to the Ig kappa locus intronic enhancer, but deletion of its binding site does not appear to affect V-to-J kappa rearrangement. New work by Verkoczy et al. in this issue of Immunity suggests that NF-kappa B regulates Ig kappa rearrangement after all, by activating RAG expression during receptor editing.","3854":"C type lectins recognize pathogens by binding to pathogen-specific carbohydrate residues. The finding reported by Rogers et al. (2005) in this issue of Immunity, that ligand binding by the C type lectin Dectin-1 leads to recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Syk and is critical to subsequent cytokine production by the cell, will surely inspire further research on the mechanisms of carbohydrate receptor signaling.","3855":"The genetic determinism of type-1 diabetes in NOD mice likely involves complementary defects in central T cell tolerance induction and peripheral immunoregulation. To study the contribution of the NOD genetic background to central tolerance, we followed the behavior of BDC2.5 clonotype thymocytes in fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC). The NOD genetic background encodes a quantitative deficiency in the ability to delete these self-reactive thymocytes and to divert them to the CD8alphaalpha lineage. In genetic analyses, comparing NOD and B6.H2g7 FTOCs, the NOD defect incorporated the influence of several loci (notably ones on chr1 and 3). Microarray analyses assessing FTOCs from the same two strains argued that the NOD abnormality reflects the combined effects of turning down the gene expression program that provokes apoptosis and turning on a new program promoting cell survival. Intersection of the data from the two approaches points to a small set of attractive candidate genes.","3856":"Gene-targeted mice have recently revealed a role for lymphocytes and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) in conferring protection against cancer, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have characterized a successful primary antitumor immune response initiated by naive CD4+ T cells. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-negative myeloma cells injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice were surrounded within 3 days by macrophages that captured tumor antigens. Within 6 days, naive myeloma-specific CD4+ T cells became activated in draining lymph nodes and subsequently migrated to the incipient tumor site. Upon recognition of tumor-derived antigenic peptides presented on MHC-II by macrophages, the myeloma-specific CD4+ T cells were reactivated and started to secrete cytokines. T cell-derived IFNgamma activated macrophages in close proximity to the tumor cells. Tumor cell growth was completely inhibited by such locally activated macrophages. These data indicate a mechanism for immunosurveillance of MHC-II-negative cancer cells by tumor-specific CD4+ T cells through collaboration with macrophages.","3857":"Granzyme A (GzmA) triggers cell death with apoptotic features by targeting the endoplasmic reticulum-associated SET complex, which contains the GzmA-activated DNase NM23-H1, its inhibitor SET, and Ape1. The SET complex was postulated to translocate to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress and participate in its repair. Because mitochondrial damage is important in apoptosis, we investigated whether GzmA damages mitochondria. GzmA induces a rapid increase in reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, but does not cleave bid or cause apoptogenic factor release. The mitochondrial effect is direct, does not require cytosol, and is insensitive to bcl-2 and caspase inhibition. SET complex nuclear translocation, which occurs within minutes of peroxide or GzmA treatment, is dependent on superoxide generation since superoxide scavengers block it. Superoxide scavengers also block apoptosis by CTLs expressing GzmA and\/or GzmB. Therefore, mitochondrial damage is an essential first step in killer cell granule-mediated pathways of apoptosis.","3858":"Signaling by G protein-coupled receptors coupled to Galpha(i) assists in triggering lymphocyte movement into and out of lymph nodes. Here, we show that modulating the signaling output from these receptors dramatically alters B cell trafficking. Intravital microscopy of adoptively transferred B cells from wild-type and Rgs1-\/- mice revealed that Rgs1-\/- B cells stick better to lymph node high endothelial venules, home better to lymph nodes, and move more rapidly within lymph node follicles than do wild-type B cells. In contrast, B cells from Gnai2-\/- mice enter lymph nodes poorly and move more slowly than do wild-type B cells. The Gnai2-\/- mice often lack multiple peripheral lymph nodes, and their B cells respond poorly to chemokines, indicating that Galpha(i1) and Galpha(i3) poorly compensate for the loss of Galpha(i2). These results demonstrate opposing roles for Rgs1 and Gnai2 in B cell trafficking into and within lymph nodes.","3859":"Regulatory T cell-mediated dominant tolerance has been demonstrated to play an important role in the prevention of autoimmunity. Here, we present data arguing that the forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 acts as the regulatory T cell lineage specification factor and mediator of the genetic mechanism of dominant tolerance. We show that expression of Foxp3 is highly restricted to the subset alphabeta of T cells and, irrespective of CD25 expression, correlates with suppressor activity. Induction of Foxp3 expression in nonregulatory T cells does not occur during pathogen-driven immune responses, and Foxp3 deficiency does not impact the functional responses of nonregulatory T cells. Furthermore, T cell-specific ablation of Foxp3 is sufficient to induce the identical early onset lymphoproliferative syndrome observed in Foxp3-deficient mice. Analysis of Foxp3 expression during thymic development suggests that this mechanism is not hard-wired but is dependent on TCR\/MHC ligand interactions.","3860":"To understand how CD8 expression is regulated during the transition process from CD4+8+ (CD4 and CD8 double positive, DP) to CD4-8+ (CD8 single positive, CD8SP) cells in the thymus, the involvement of Runx proteins in the alteration of chromatin configuration was investigated. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we first demonstrated that Runx proteins bind to the stage-specific CD8 enhancer, as well as the CD4 silencer, in CD8SP thymocytes. Among Runx family members, Runx3 expression was initiated in DP thymocytes receiving a positive selection signal and increased in concert with differentiation to the CD8SP stage. Furthermore, reactivation of the CD8 gene, as well as CD4 silencing, was suppressed in positively selected thymocytes of Runx dominant-negative transgenic mice. These results suggest that Runx proteins, especially Runx3, are involved in lineage specification of CD8 T cells and provide important information for understanding the mechanism for the mutually exclusive expression of coreceptors in mature thymocytes.","3861":"The class IV semaphorin Sema4A provides a costimulatory signal to T cells. To investigate the possible developmental and regulatory roles of Sema4A in vivo, we generated Sema4A-deficient mice. Although Sema4A-deficient mice develop normally, DCs and T cells from knockout mice display poor allostimulatory activities and T helper cell (Th) differentiation, respectively. Interestingly, in addition to its expression on DCs, Sema4A is upregulated on Th1-differentiating cells, and it is necessary for in vitro Th1 differentiation and T-bet expression. Consequently, in vivo antigen-specific T cell priming and antibody responses against T cell-dependent antigens are impaired in the mutant mice. Additionally, Sema4A-deficient mice exhibit defective Th1 responses. Furthermore, reconstitution studies with antigen-pulsed DCs reveal that DC-derived Sema4A is important for T cell priming, while T cell-derived Sema4A is involved in developing Th1 responses. Collectively, these results indicate a nonredundant role of Sema4A not only in T cell priming, but also in the regulation of Th1\/Th2 responses.","3862":"In humans, T cells differentiate in thymus and B cells develop in bone marrow (BM), but the natural killer (NK) precursor cell(s) and site(s) of NK development are unclear. The CD56bright NK subset predominates in lymph nodes (LN) and produces abundant cytokines compared to the cytolytic CD56dim NK cell that predominates in blood. Here, we identify a novel CD34dimCD45RA(+) hematopoietic precursor cell (HPC) that is integrin alpha4beta7bright. CD34dimCD45RA(+)beta7bright HPCs constitute &lt;1% of BM CD34(+) HPCs and approximately 6% of blood CD34(+) HPCs, but &gt;95% of LN CD34(+) HPCs. They reside in the parafollicular T cell regions of LN with CD56bright NK cells, and when stimulated by IL-15, IL-2, or activated LN T cells, they become CD56bright NK cells. The data identify a new NK precursor and support a model of human NK development in which BM-derived CD34dimCD45RA(+)beta7bright HPCs reside in LN where endogenous cytokines drive their differentiation to CD56bright NK cells in vivo.","3863":"Homeostatic regulation of neutrophil production is thought to match neutrophil elimination to maintain approximately constant numbers in the blood. Here, we show that IL-17, a cytokine that regulates granulopoiesis through G-CSF, is made by gammadelta T cells and unconventional alphabeta T cells. These neutrophil-regulatory T cells (Tn) are expanded in mice that lack leukocyte adhesion molecules, which have neutrophilia and defective neutrophil trafficking. Normal neutrophils migrate to tissues, where they become apoptotic and are phagocytosed by macrophages and dendritic cells. This curbs phagocyte secretion of IL-23, a cytokine controlling IL-17 production by Tn cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type, but not adhesion molecule-deficient, neutrophils into mice deficient in beta2 integrins transiently decreases neutrophilia and reduces levels of serum IL-17. Antibody blockade of the p40 subunit of IL-23 reduces neutrophil numbers in wild-type mice. These findings identify a major homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of neutrophil production in vivo.","3864":"Whereas high-avidity recognition of peptide-MHC complexes by developing T cells in the thymus results in deletion and promotes self-tolerance, such recognition by mature T cells in the periphery results in activation and clonal expansion. This dichotomy represents the basis of a dilemma that has stumped immunologists for many years, how are self-specific T cells tolerized in the periphery? There appear to be two important criteria used to achieve this goal. The first is that in the absence of inflammatory pathogens, tolerance is promoted when T cells recognize antigen presented by quiescent dendritic cells (DCs) expressing low levels of costimulatory molecules. A second critical factor that defines \"self\" and drives tolerance through deletion, anergy, or suppression is the persistence of antigen.","3865":"A paper by Martinvalet et al. (2005) in this issue of Immunity examines the mechanisms used by granzyme A to kill target cells after its cytoplasmic injection by cytotoxic lymphocytes. They show that this protease induces mitochondrial damage and generation of reactive oxygen species that are necessary for cell death.","3866":"Identification of the transcription factor Foxp3 as a \"master regulator\" of regulatory T (T(R)) cells was a major discovery. A new study by Fontenot et al. (2005), reported in this issue of Immunity, provides novel insights into T(R) cell biology by tracking their behavior in mice expressing a GFP-Foxp3 fusion-protein reporter.","3867":"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recently awarded 14 contracts to fund the Large-Scale Antibody and T Cell Epitope Discovery Program. This initiative is designed to identify immune epitopes from selected infectious agents utilizing complementary methods for epitope discovery. NIAID will make information on each newly identified epitope freely available to scientists worldwide through the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), currently under development. On October 12-14, 2004, representatives of NIAID met in San Diego, California, with a group of investigators from various research institutions to discuss progress and plans for the large-scale epitope discovery projects and for the establishment of the IEDB. It is anticipated that these initiatives will establish detailed maps of immune reactions toward several important complex pathogens, which in turn will foster development of new diagnostic, immune-based therapeutic, and vaccine programs. Herein is an account of the meeting and its results.","3868":"Normal bone marrow (BM) contains T cells whose function and origin are poorly understood. We observed that CD8+ T cells in BM consist chiefly of CCR7+ L-selectin+ central memory cells (TCMs). Adoptively transferred TCMs accumulated more efficiently in the BM than naive and effector T cells. Intravital microscopy (IVM) showed that TCMs roll efficiently in BM microvessels via L-, P-, and E-selectin, whereas firm arrest required the VCAM-1\/alpha4beta1 pathway. alpha4beta1 integrin activation did not depend on pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Galphai proteins but was reduced by anti-CXCL12. In contrast, TCM diapedesis did not require CXCL12 but was blocked by PTX. After extravasation, TCMs displayed agile movement within BM cavities, remained viable, and mounted potent antigen-specific recall responses for at least two months. Thus, the BM functions as a major reservoir for TCMs by providing specific recruitment signals that act in sequence to mediate the constitutive recruitment of TCMs from the blood.","3869":"Understanding, treating, and preventing diseases caused by immunosuppression and\/or persistent infections remain both a major challenge in biomedical research and an important health goal. For a virus or any infectious agent to persist, it must utilize strategies to suppress or evade the host's immune response. Here, we report that two dissimilar viruses employ a common maneuver to cause a profound immunosuppression. Measles virus (MV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) interfere with dendritic cell (DC) development and expansion in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism for this is through the generation of type I interferon (IFN) that acts via a signal transducer and activator of a transcription (STAT)2-dependent, but STAT1-independent, pathway. Thus, viruses subvert the known antiviral effect of type I IFN through STAT2-specific signaling to benefit their survival. These observations have implications for understanding and developing therapies to treat diseases caused by immunosuppression and\/or persistent infections.","3870":"In classical descriptions of leukocyte chemokine signaling, Src family kinases are thought to function in a positive fashion by coupling receptor associated Galpha subunits to downstream mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. However, neutrophils derived from hck-\/-fgr-\/- mice and dendritic cells (DCs) from fgr-\/- animals manifested significantly higher intracellular signaling (Ca2+ flux, MAP kinase activation, actin polymerization) and functional responses (chemotaxis in vitro and migration in vivo) to a number of different chemokines. These kinases may mediate their effect through the inhibitory receptor PIR-B since neutrophils and DCs from pir-b-\/- mice were also hyperresponsive to chemokine stimulation. In wild-type (wt) cells dephosphorylation of PIR-B was associated with maximal chemokine signaling, whereas in hck-\/-fgr-\/- cells PIR-B was unphosphorylated. These data support a model in which the Src family kinases Hck and Fgr function as negative regulators of myeloid cell chemokine signaling by maintaining the tonic phosphorylation of PIR-B.","3871":"Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules, including Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR, present peptide fragments from proteins degraded in the endocytic pathway. HLA-DR is targeted to late-endocytic structures named MHC class II-containing Compartments (MIIC), where it interacts with HLA-DM. This chaperone stabilizes HLA-DR during peptide exchange and is critical for successful peptide loading. To follow this process in living cells, we have generated cells containing HLA-DR3\/Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP), HLA-DM\/Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), and invariant chain. HLA-DR\/DM interactions were observed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). These interactions were pH insensitive, yet occurred only in internal structures and not at the limiting membrane of MIIC. In a cellular model of infection, phagosomes formed a limiting membrane surrounding internalized Salmonella. HLA-DR and HLA-DM did not interact in Salmonella-induced vacuoles, and HLA-DR was not loaded with antigens. The absence of HLA-DR\/DM interactions at the limiting membrane prevents local loading of MHC class II molecules in phagosomes. This may allow these bacteria to successfully evade the immune system.","3872":"CD1a is expressed on Langerhans cells (LCs) and dendritic cells (DCs), where it mediates T cell recognition of glycolipid and lipopeptide antigens that contain either one or two alkyl chains. We demonstrate here that CD1a-restricted T cells can discriminate the peptide component of didehydroxymycobactin lipopeptides. Structure analysis of CD1a cocrystallized with a synthetic mycobactin lipopeptide at 2.8 A resolution further reveals that the single alkyl chain is inserted deep within the A' pocket of the groove, whereas its two peptidic branches protrude along the F' pocket to the outer, alpha-helical surface of CD1a for recognition by the TCR. Remarkably, the cyclized lysine branch of the peptide moiety lies in the shallow F' pocket in a conformation that closely mimics that of the alkyl chain in the CD1a-sulfatide structure. Thus, this structural study illustrates how a single chain lipid can be presented by CD1 and that the peptide moiety of the lipopeptide is recognized by the TCR.","3873":"Vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1 (VDUP1) is a stress-response gene that is upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in tumor cells. The in vivo roles of VDUP1 were investigated by producing mice lacking VDUP1 (VDUP1-\/- mice). VDUP1-\/- mice showed minimal changes in the development of T and B cells, but there was a profound reduction in the numbers of natural killer (NK) cells. As well, these mice showed decreased NK activity. In the VDUP1-\/- mice, the expression of CD122 was reduced, demonstrating that VDUP1 is required for CD122 expression and NK maturation. In addition, severe lymphoid hyperplasia in the small intestine was observed in VDUP1-\/- mice. Taken together, these results suggest that VDUP1 is a critical factor for the development and function of NK cells in vivo.","3874":"Helper T cells discriminate among different antigen-presenting cells to provide their help in a selective fashion. The molecular mechanisms leading to this exquisite selectivity are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that immunological synapses are dynamic and adaptable structures allowing T cells to communicate with multiple cells. We show that T cells can form simultaneous immunological synapses with cells presenting different levels of antigenic ligands but eventually polarize toward the strongest stimulus. Remarkably, living T cells form discrete foci of signal transduction of different intensities during the interaction with different antigen-presenting cells and rapidly relocate TCR and Golgi apparatus toward the cell providing the strongest stimulus. Our results illustrate that, although T cell activation requires sustained signaling, T cells are capable of rapid synapse remodeling and swift polarization responses. The combination of sustained signaling with preferential and rapid polarization provides a mechanism for the high sensitivity and selectivity of T cell responses.","3875":"Expression of tissue-specific homing molecules directs antigen-experienced T cells to particular peripheral tissues. In studies using soluble antigens that focused on skin and gut, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within regional lymphoid tissues were proposed to be responsible for imprinting homing phenotypes. Whether this occurs in other sites and after physiologic antigen processing and presentation is unknown. We define in vivo imprinting of distinct homing phenotypes on monospecific T cells responding to antigens expressed by tumors in intracerebral, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal sites with efficient brain-tropism of CD8 T cells crossprimed in the cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Multiple imprinting programs could occur simultaneously in the same LN when tumors were present in more than one site. Thus, the identity of the LN is not paramount in determining the homing phenotype; this critical functional parameter is dictated upstream at the site of antigen capture by crosspresenting APCs.","3876":"Broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 are rare but invaluable for vaccine design. 4E10 is the broadest neutralizing antibody known and recognizes a contiguous and highly conserved epitope in the membrane-proximal region of gp41. The crystal structure of Fab 4E10 was determined at 2.2 A resolution in complex with a 13-residue peptide containing the gp41 core epitope (NWFDIT). The bound peptide adopts a helical conformation in which the key contact residues, TrpP672, PheP673, IleP675, and ThrP676, map to one face of the helix. The peptide binds in a hydrophobic pocket that may emulate its potential interaction with the host cell membrane. The long CDR H3 of the antibody extends beyond the bound peptide in an orientation that suggests that its apex could contact the viral membrane when 4E10 is bound to its membrane-proximal epitope. These structural insights should assist in the design of immunogens to elicit 4E10-like neutralizing responses.","3877":"","3878":"Accumulating data suggest that the bone marrow is a reservoir for memory CD8+ T cells. In this issue of Immunity, show that bone marrow CD8+ T cells are predominantly CCR7+\/CD62L+ \"central memory\" cells and describe specific signals that mediate their constitutive recruitment from the blood.","3879":"We describe the gene structure, regulation, signal transduction. and functions of a cytokine, interleukin (IL)-32. An IL-18 unresponsive cell was converted to a responsive cell by transfection of the IL-18 receptor beta chain, and IL-18-induced microarray revealed high expression of a cytokine-like gene. Although IL-32 does not share sequence homology with known cytokine families, IL-32 induces various cytokines, human TNFalpha, and IL-8 in THP-1 monocytic cells as well as mouse TNFalpha and MIP-2 in Raw macrophage cells. IL-32 activates typical cytokine signal pathways of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. IL-32 mRNA is highly expressed in immune tissue rather than other tissues. Human IL-32 exists as four splice variants, and IL-32 from other species were found as expressed sequence tag clones in the databank. Induced in human peripheral lymphocyte cells after mitogen stimulation, in human epithelial cells by IFNgamma, and in NK cells after exposure to the combination of IL-12 plus IL-18, IL-32 may play a role in inflammatory\/autoimmune diseases.","3880":"Efficient immune attack of malignant disease requires the concerted action of both CD8+ CTL and CD4+ Th cells. We used human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 (A2.1) transgenic mice, in which the mouse CD8 molecule cannot efficiently interact with the alpha3 domain of A2.1, to generate a high-affinity, CD8-independent T cell receptor (TCR) specific for a commonly expressed, tumor-associated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope derived from the human p53 tumor suppressor protein. Retroviral expression of this CD8-independent, p53-specific TCR into human T cells imparted the CD8+ T lymphocytes with broad tumor-specific CTL activity and turned CD4+ T cells into potent tumor-reactive, p53A2.1-specific Th cells. Both T cell subsets were cooperative and interacted synergistically with dendritic cell intermediates and tumor targets. The intentional redirection of both CD4+ Th cells and CD8+ CTL by the same high-affinity, CD8-independent, tumor-specific TCR could provide the basis for novel broad-spectrum cancer immunotherapeutics.","3881":"Leukocyte migration from the blood to tissues is a prerequisite for normal immune responses. We produced mice deficient in an endothelial cell-surface oxidase (amine oxidase, copper containing-3 [AOC3], also known as vascular adhesion protein-1 [VAP-1]) and found that this enzyme is needed for leukocyte extravasation in vivo. Real-time imaging shows that AOC3 mediates slow rolling, firm adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes in vessels at inflammatory sites and lymphoid tissues. Absence of AOC3 results in reduced lymphocyte homing into lymphoid organs and in attenuated inflammatory response in peritonitis. These data alter the paradigm of leukocyte extravasation cascade by providing the first physiological proof for the concept that endothelial cell surface enzymes regulate the development of inflammatory reactions in vivo and suggest that this enzyme should be useful as an anti-inflammatory target.","3882":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF, TNFalpha) is implicated in various pathophysiological processes and can be either protective, as in host defense, or deleterious, as in autoimmunity or toxic shock. To uncover the in vivo functions of TNF produced by different cell types, we generated mice with TNF ablation targeted to various leukocyte subsets. Systemic TNF in response to lipopolysaccharide was produced mainly by macrophages and neutrophils. This source of TNF was indispensable for resistance to an intracellular pathogen, Listeria, whereas T-cell-derived TNF was important for protection against high bacterial load. Additionally, both T-cell-derived TNF and macrophage-derived TNF had critical and nonredundant functions in the promotion of autoimmune hepatitis. Our data suggest that T-cell-specific TNF ablation may provide a therapeutic advantage over systemic blockade.","3883":"T cell receptor crossreactivity with different peptide ligands and biased recognition of MHC are coupled features of antigen recognition that are necessary for the T cell's diverse functional repertoire. In the crystal structure between an autoreactive, EAE T cell clone 172.10 and myelin basic protein (1-11) presented by class II MHC I-Au, recognition of the MHC is dominated by the Vbeta domain of the TCR, which interacts with the MHC alpha chain in a manner suggestive of a germline-encoded TCR\/MHC \"anchor point.\" Strikingly, there are few specific contacts between the TCR CDR3 loops and the MBP peptide. We also find that over 1,000,000 different peptides derived from combinatorial libraries can activate 172.10, yet the TCR strongly prefers the native MBP contact residues. We suggest that while TCR scanning of pMHC may be degenerate due to the TCR germline bias for MHC, recognition of structurally distinct agonist peptides is not indicative of TCR promiscuity, but rather highly specific alternative solutions to TCR engagement.","3884":"Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes, a major gammadelta T lymphocyte subset in humans, display cytolytic activity against various tumor cells upon recognition of yet uncharacterized structures. Here, we show that an entity related to the mitochondrial F1-ATPase is expressed on tumor cell surface and promotes tumor recognition by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. When immobilized, purified F1-ATPase induces selective activation of this lymphocyte subset. The Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell receptors (TCR) and the F1-ATPase also bind a delipidated form of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Moreover, the presence of apo A-I in the culture medium is required for optimal activation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells by tumors expressing F1-ATPase. This study thus describes an unanticipated tumor recognition mechanism by Vgamma9Vdelta2 lymphocytes and a possible link between gammadelta T cell immunity and lipid metabolism.","3885":"Many viruses encode proteins that counteract the development of the interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral state. Here, we report that interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), a key mediator of type I IFN induction, is targeted for degradation by binding to the RTA immediate-early nuclear transcription factor encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8). Cotransfection with RTA blocked IRF7-mediated IFNalpha and IFNbeta mRNA production and promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF7 protein in a proteasome-dependent fashion. Addition of RTA also promoted polyubiquitination of IRF7 in an in vitro cell free assay, demonstrating that RTA itself acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. RTA also autoregulated its own polyubiquitination and stability, and both activities were abolished by point mutations in a Cys plus His-rich N-terminal domain. Therefore, manipulation of the stability and function of IRF7 by the KSHV RTA transcription factor provides an unexpected regulatory strategy for circumventing the innate immune defence system.","3886":"CD34 is a cell-surface sialomucin expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mast cells, and vascular endothelia. Despite its popularity as an HSC marker, the function of CD34 on hematopoietic cells remains enigmatic. Here, we have addressed this issue by examining the behavior of mutant mast cells lacking CD34, the related sialomucin, CD43, or both molecules. Loss of these molecules leads to a gene-dose-dependent increase in mast cell homotypic aggregation with CD34\/CD43KOs &gt; CD43KO &gt; CD34KO &gt; wild-type. Importantly, reexpression of CD34 or CD43 in these cells caused reversal of this phenotype. Furthermore, we find that loss of these sialomucins prevents mast cell repopulation and hematopoietic precursor reconstitution in vivo. Our data provide clear-cut evidence for a hematopoietic function for CD34 and suggest that it acts as a negative regulator of cell adhesion.","3887":"Serum IgA is considered a discrete housekeeper of the immune system with multiple anti-inflammatory functions, whereas IgA-immune complexes mediate inflammatory responses. Here, we identify FcalphaRI as a molecular device that determines the nature of IgA responses. In the absence of sustained aggregation, receptor targeting by serum IgA or anti-FcalphaRI Fab inhibits activating responses of heterologous FcgammaR or FcepsilonRI. The inhibitory mechanism involves recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to FcalphaRI and impairment of Syk, LAT, and ERK phosphorylation induced by FcepsilonRI engagement. SHP-1 recruitment is dependent on ERK. Conversely, sustained aggregation of FcalphaRI by multimeric ligands stimulates cell activation by recruiting high amounts of Syk and aborting SHP-1 binding. Both types of signals require the FcRgamma-ITAM motif. Anti-FcalphaRI Fab treatment suppresses manifestations of allergic asthma in FcalphaRI transgenic mice. These findings redefine FcalphaRI as a bifunctional inhibitory\/activating receptor of the immune system that mediates both anti- and proinflammatory functions of IgA.","3888":"Resident dendritic cells (DC) within the T cell area of the lymph node take up soluble antigens that enter via the afferent lymphatics before antigen carrying DC arrive from the periphery. The reticular network within the lymph node is a conduit system forming the infrastructure for the fast delivery of soluble substances from the afferent lymph to the lumen of high endothelial venules (HEVs). Using high-resolution light microscopy and 3D reconstruction, we show here that these conduits are unique basement membrane-like structures ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells with occasional resident DC embedded within this cell layer. Conduit-associated DC are capable of taking up and processing soluble antigens transported within the conduits, whereas immigrated mature DC occur remote from the reticular fibers. The conduit system is, therefore, not a closed compartment that shuttles substances through the lymph node but represents the morphological equivalent to the filtering function of the lymph node.","3889":"Lyn, one of several Src-family tyrosine kinases in immune cells, is noted for its ability to negatively regulate signaling pathways through phosphorylation of inhibitory receptors, enzymes, and adaptors. Somewhat paradoxically, it is also a key mediator in several pathways of B cell activation, such as CD19 and CD180. Whether Lyn functions to promote or inhibit immune cell activation depends on the stimulus and the developmental state, meaning that the consequences of Lyn activity are context dependent. The importance of regulating Lyn activity is exemplified by the pathological conditions that develop in both lyn-\/- and lyn gain-of-function mice (lynup\/up), including lethal antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases and myeloid neoplasia. Here, we review the outcomes of altered Lyn activity within the framework of B cell development and differentiation and the circumstances that appear to dictate the outcome.","3890":"In this issue of Immunity, Marko Salmi and colleagues describe mice lacking AOC3, an endothelial cell monoaminooxidase that is involved in modulating leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and migration (Stolen et al., 2005). Their data demonstrate the importance of oxidative modification of (unknown) adhesion molecules in regulating inflammation and lymphocyte homing.","3891":"A study by Sixt et al. in this issue of Immunity identifies conduit-associated dendritic cells whose privileged access to antigen arriving by the conduit enables uptake and processing of antigen within 90 min of antigen inoculation, long before the arrival of dendritic cells from skin.","3892":"TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) signaling has been implicated in inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, but little is understood about its physiological function. Here, we report the generation and characterization of TRAIL-R(-\/-) mice, which develop normal lymphocyte populations but possess enhanced innate immune responses. TRAIL-R(-\/-) mice exhibited increased clearance of murine cytomegalovirus that correlated with increased levels of IL-12, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma. Stimulation of macrophages with Mycobacterium and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, -3, and -4, but not TLR9, ligands resulted in high levels of TRAIL upregulation and enhanced cytokine production in TRAIL-R(-\/-) cells. The immediate-early TLR signaling events in TRAIL-R(-\/-) macrophages and dendritic cells are normal, but I kappa B-alpha homeostatic regulation and NF-kappa B activity at later time points is perturbed. These data suggest that TRAIL-R negatively regulates innate immune responses.","3893":"We recently identified a 3' region of the rad50 gene possessing strong enhancer activity as well as activity consistent with function as a locus control region (LCR) for the flanking Th2 cytokine genes. In this study, we identify several functional elements within this region by examining chromatin changes as well as activity in transgenic mice. We find within this region four DNase I hypersensitive clusters, three of which are highly conserved and predominantly expressed in Th2 cells. Histone acetylation of this region is elevated in Th2 cells. Further, one of the hypersensitive sites (RHS7) is rapidly demethylated in Th2, but not Th1, cells. In transgenic mice, these hypersensitive sites impart strong, Th2-specific enhancer activity as well as copy number-dependent expression of the reporter gene, recapitulating LCR function. We postulate that these sites function alone or in combination with other regulatory elements to coordinate gene expression in the Th2 cytokine locus.","3894":"The transcription factor C\/EBP alpha is required for granulopoiesis and frequently disrupted in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show disruption of C\/EBP alpha blocks the transition from the common myeloid to the granulocyte\/monocyte progenitor but is not required beyond this stage for terminal granulocyte maturation. C\/EBP alpha-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have increased expression of Bmi-1 and enhanced competitive repopulating activity. Bone marrow in adult C\/EBP alpha-deficient mice was filled with myeloblasts, similar to human AML, supporting the notion that disruption of C\/EBP alpha cooperates with other events in the development of leukemia. Therefore, C\/EBP alpha is not only essential for granulocyte development but, in addition, is a regulator of hematopoietic stem cell activity.","3895":"The Polycomb group (PcG) gene Bmi-1 has recently been implicated in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from loss-of-function analysis. Here, we demonstrate that increased expression of Bmi-1 promotes HSC self-renewal. Forced expression of Bmi-1 enhanced symmetrical cell division of HSCs and mediated a higher probability of inheritance of stemness through cell division. Correspondingly, forced expression of Bmi-1, but not the other PcG genes, led to a striking ex vivo expansion of multipotential progenitors and marked augmentation of HSC repopulating capacity in vivo. Loss-of-function analyses revealed that among PcG genes, absence of Bmi-1 is preferentially linked with a profound defect in HSC self-renewal. Our findings define Bmi-1 as a central player in HSC self-renewal and demonstrate that Bmi-1 is a target for therapeutic manipulation of HSCs.","3896":"GM-CSF promotes homeostasis of myeloid cells. We report that GM-CSF upregulates mRNA and protein production of the soluble form of membrane bound VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) in human monocytes. This sVEGFR-1 was biologically active, as cell-free supernatants from GM-CSF-stimulated monocytes blocked detection of endogenously expressed VEGF and inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation, even in the presence of exogenous rhVEGF. VEGF activity was recovered by neutralizing sVEGFR-1. To determine whether these events were important in vivo, Matrigel plugs were incubated with rhVEGF, rhGM-CSF, or rhGM-CSF\/rhVEGF and injected into mice. Plugs containing GM-CSF or GM-CSF\/VEGF had less endothelial cell invasion than plugs containing rhVEGF and were similar to plugs incubated with PBS alone. Neutralizing antibodies specific for sVEGFR-1 injected in these plugs reversed the effects of GM-CSF or GM-CSF\/VEGF, while an isogenic antibody did not. Thus, GM-CSF and monocytes play a vital role in angiogenesis through the regulation of VEGF and sVEGFR-1.","3897":"The cause of common polygenic autoimmune diseases is not understood because of genetic and cellular complexity. Here, we pinpoint the action of a subset of autoimmune susceptibility loci in the NOD mouse strain linked to D1mit181, D2mit490, D7mit101, and D15mit229, which cause a generalized resistance to thymic deletion in vivo that applies equally to Aire-induced organ-specific gene products in the thymic medulla and to systemic antigens expressed at high levels throughout the thymus and affects CD4(+), CD4(+)8(+), and CD4(+)25(+) thymocytes. Resistance to thymic deletion does not reflect a general deficit in TCR signaling to calcineurin- or ERK-induced genes, imbalance in constitutive regulators of apoptosis, nor excessive signaling to prosurvival genes but is distinguished by failure to induce the proapoptotic gene and protein, Bim, during in vivo encounter with high-avidity autoantigen. These findings establish defects in thymic deletion and Bim induction as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.","3898":"CD11c(hi) dendritic cells (DC) play an essential role during the initiation of cell-mediated immunity. Recently, CD11c(lo)CD45RB(hi) DC with regulatory properties have been described. However, the origins of regulatory DC are poorly understood. Here, we show that spleen-derived stromal cells promote selective development of CD11c(lo)CD45RB(+) IL-10-producing regulatory DC from lineage-negative c-kit(+) progenitor cells. These DC have the capacity to suppress T cell responses and induce IL-10-producing regulatory T cells in vitro and to induce antigen-specific tolerance in vivo. Furthermore, stromal cells from mice infected with Leishmania donovani more effectively supported differentiation of these highly potent regulatory DC. The ability of tissue stromal cells to direct the development of DC with a regulatory phenotype thus provides a new mechanism for local immune regulation.","3899":"Escape from adaptive T cell immunity through transmutation of viral antigenic structure is a cardinal feature in the pathogenesis of SIV\/HIV infection and a major obstacle to antiretroviral vaccine development. However, the molecular determinants of this phenomenon at the T cell receptor (TCR)-antigen interface are unknown. Here, we show that mutational escape is intimately linked to the structural configuration of constituent TCR clonotypes within virus-specific CD8(+) T cell populations. Analysis of 3416 SIV-specific TCR sequences revealed that polyclonal T cell populations characterized by highly conserved TCRB CDR3 motifs were rendered ineffectual by single residue mutations in the cognate viral epitope. Conversely, diverse clonotypic repertoires without discernible motifs were not associated with viral escape. Thus, fundamental differences in the mode of antigen engagement direct the pattern of adaptive viral evolution. These findings have profound implications for the development of vaccines that elicit T cell immunity to combat pathogens with unstable genomes.","3900":"DRAK2 is a member of the death-associated protein (DAP)-like family of serine\/threonine kinases. Members of this family induce apoptosis in various cell types. DRAK2, in particular, is specifically expressed in T cells and B cells, and it is differentially regulated during T cell development. To determine whether DRAK2 regulates lymphocyte apoptosis, we produced Drak2(-\/-) mice. Contrary to our expectations, Drak2(-\/-) T cells did not demonstrate any defects in apoptosis or negative selection; however, T cells from Drak2(-\/-) mice exhibited enhanced sensitivity to T cell receptor-mediated stimulation with a reduced requirement for costimulation. These results provide evidence that DRAK2 raises the threshold for T cell activation by negatively regulating signals through the TCR. In contrast to other models of T cell hypersensitivity, Drak2(-\/-) mice were remarkably resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These results expose a new pathway regulating T cell activation and highlight the intricacies of induced autoimmune disease.","3901":"Susceptibility to autoimmunity in B6.Sle1b mice is associated with extensive polymorphisms between two divergent haplotypes of the SLAM\/CD2 family of genes. The B6.Sle1b-derived SLAM\/CD2 family haplotype is found in many other laboratory mouse strains but only causes autoimmunity in the context of the C57Bl\/6 (B6) genome. Phenotypic analyses have revealed variations in the structure and expression of several members of the SLAM\/CD2 family in T and B lymphocytes from B6.Sle1b mice. T lymphocytes from B6.Sle1b mice have modified signaling responses to stimulation at 4-6 weeks of age. While autoimmunity may be mediated by a combination of genes in the SLAM\/CD2 family cluster, the strongest candidate is Ly108, a specific isoform of which is constitutively upregulated in B6.Sle1b lymphocytes.","3902":"The supply of naive T cells by the thymus normally requires precursor T cell proliferation within the thymus and would be particularly important in the setting of HIV infection when both naive and memory T cells are progressively depleted. As a robust, quantitative index of intrathymic proliferation, the ratio of different T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), molecular markers of distinct T cell receptor rearrangements occurring at different stages of thymocyte development, was measured in peripheral blood-mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This ratio has the virtue that it is a \"signature\" of thymic emigrants throughout their entire life and, thus, can be measured in peripheral cell populations that are easy to obtain. Using the new assay, we evaluated the effect of HIV infection on intrathymic precursor T cell proliferation by longitudinal analysis of PBMCs from recently infected individuals. Our findings reveal a substantial reduction in intrathymic proliferation. The analysis also indicates the existence of a compensatory mechanism acting to sustain the numbers of recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) in the periphery.","3903":"Small RNAs of 21-23 nucleotides are powerful regulators of gene expression and play essential roles in biological processes that include development, maintenance of genome stability, and viral adaptive defense mechanisms. Such small RNAs are simple in design yet rich in biology and have captivated the attention of biologists in many fields. This review discusses the potential roles of small RNAs in immune biology and speculates on their potential participation in lymphogenesis and antiviral mechanisms.","3904":"","3905":"","3906":"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microbial infection and play an essential role in the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms of TLR-mediated control of adaptive immunity are not yet fully understood. Induction of dendritic cell (DC) maturation is essential for activation of naive T cells. Here, we demonstrate that TLR-induced DC maturation and migration to the lymph nodes, in the absence of TLR-induced inflammatory cytokines, are not sufficient for T cell activation in vivo. We show that transient depletion of regulatory T (Tr) cells recovers the primary CD4 T cells response in MyD88-deficient mice, demonstrating that a major mechanism of TLR-mediated activation of T cell responses is the blocking of suppression by regulatory T cells. In addition we show that a TLR-induced signal(s) is required for memory CD4 T cell differentiation, but not for activation of memory T cells.","3907":"As a means of developing therapies that target the pathogenic T cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) without compromising the immune system or eliciting systemic side effects, we investigated the use of T-bet-specific antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs (siRNA) to silence T-bet expression in autoreactive encephalitogenic T cells and evaluated the biological consequences of this suppression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for MS. The T-bet-specific AS oligonucleotide and siRNA suppressed T-bet expression, IFNgamma production, and STAT1 levels during antigen-specific T cell differentiation. In vitro suppression of T-bet during differentiation of myelin-specific T cells and in vivo administration of a T-bet-specific antisense oligonucleotide or siRNA inhibited disease. T-bet was shown to bind the IFNgamma and STAT1 promoters, but did not regulate the IL-12\/STAT4 pathway. Since T-bet regulates IFNgamma production in CD4(+) T cells, but to a lesser extent in most other IFNgamma-producing cells, T-bet may be a target for therapeutics for Th1-mediated diseases.","3908":"SAP is an adaptor mutated in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. It plays a critical role in T helper 2 (T(H)2) cytokine production. This function was suggested to reflect the capacity of SAP to associate with SLAM family receptors and enable tyrosine phosphorylation signaling by these receptors through SAP-mediated recruitment of Src-related kinase FynT. Here, we addressed by genetic means the importance of the SAP-FynT interaction in normal T cell functions. By creating a mouse in which the FynT binding site of SAP was inactivated in the germ line (sap(R78A) mouse) and by analyzing mice lacking SAP, FynT or SLAM, evidence was obtained that the SAP-FynT cascade is indeed crucial for normal T(H)2 functions in vitro and in vivo. These data imply that SAP is necessary for T(H)2 cytokine regulation primarily as a result of its capacity to recruit FynT. They also establish a previously unappreciated role for FynT in SAP-dependent T(H)2 cytokine regulation.","3909":"XLP is caused by mutations affecting SAP, an adaptor that recruits Fyn to SLAM family receptors. SAP-deficient mice recapitulate features of XLP, including increased T cell activation and decreased humoral responses post-infection. SAP-deficient T cells also show increased TCR-induced IFN-gamma and decreased T(H)2 cytokine production. We demonstrate that the defect in IL-4 secretion in SAP-deficient T cells is independent of increased IFN-gamma production. SAP-deficient cells respond normally to polarizing cytokines, yet show impaired TCR-mediated induction of GATA-3 and IL-4. Examination of TCR signaling revealed normal Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK activation in SAP-deficient cells, but decreased PKC-theta recruitment, Bcl-10 phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation, and nuclear NF-kappaB1\/p50 levels. Similar defects were observed in Fyn-deficient cells. SLAM engagement amplified PKC-theta recruitment in wt but not SAP- or Fyn-deficient cells, arguing that a SAP\/Fyn-mediated pathway enhances PKC-theta\/NF-kappaB1 activation and suggesting a role for this pathway in T(H)2 regulation.","3910":"Activation of the B cell antigen receptor triggers phosphorylation of cytoplasmic and transmembrane adaptor proteins such as SLP-65 and NTAL, respectively. Specific phosphoacceptor sites in SLP-65 serve as docking sites for Ca(2+)-mobilizing enzymes Btk and PLC-gamma2. Phosphorylated NTAL recruits the Grb2 linker, but downstream signaling cascades are unclear. We now show that receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NTAL and concomitant Grb2 complex formation critically modulate the Ca(2+) response without affecting SLP-65 and PLC-gamma2 phosphorylation. Grb2 turned out to play a negative regulatory role, which appears to be eliminated upon binding to NTAL. This allows for a sustained release of intracellular Ca(2+) and is mandatory for subsequent entry of Ca(2+) from extracellular sources. Thus, elevation of Ca(2+) is regulated by at least two signaling modules, the B cell-specific Ca(2+) initiation complex comprising SLP-65, Btk, and PLC-gamma2 and the more ubiquitously expressed NTAL\/Grb2 complex, which acts as an amplifier by switching off inhibitory elements.","3911":"Helper T cell responses that focus the TCR repertoire of responding clones provide experimental access to the mechanisms of clonal selection in vivo. Using TCRbeta chain animals, we directly evaluate the extent of TCRalpha CDR3 diversity and the pMHCII binding attributes of individual antigen-specific Th cells. Here, we demonstrate that dominant clonotypes, as defined by TCR junctional sequence similarities, are surprisingly diverse at the level of pMHCII binding properties, before and after antigen exposure. During an immune response, we can detect and quantify the selective loss of antigen-specific clonotypes that express lower-affinity TCR. This affinity threshold selection is followed by the unbiased propagation of preferred clonotypes regardless of TCR-pMHCII half-lives or affinity. Thus, an affinity threshold mechanism discriminates Th clones with TCR of best fit and propagates clonal diversity without promoting autoreactivity.","3912":"During embryogenesis a developmental program leading to the formation of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches is initiated. We now show that lymph node-like structures as well as tertiary lymphoid structures can ectopically be induced by intradermal injection of newborn lymph node-derived cells. ICAM-1\/VCAM-1-expressing stromal organizers, follicular dendritic cells, lymphatic endothelium, and HEVs in these structures are of donor origin, while all hematopoietic cells are host derived. Formation depends on lymphotoxin-expressing donor cells, whereas further organization requires lymphotoxin-expressing recipient cells. While induced secondary lymphoid structures develop a normal cellular architecture, the degree of organization in tertiary structures is correlated to the immune activation status of the host. These results indicate that the cellular and molecular requirements for the establishment of lymph nodes and tertiary structures are remarkably similar and that hyperactivated lymphocytes can fulfill the role of lymphoid tissue inducer cells during inflammatory responses.","3913":"Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells usually results in an anti-inflammatory state with inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-12. How apoptotic cell-derived signals regulate IL-12 gene expression is not understood. We demonstrate that cell-cell contact with apoptotic cells is sufficient to induce profound inhibition of IL-12 production by activated macrophages. Phosphatidylserine could mimic the inhibitory effect. The inhibition does not involve autocrine or paracrine actions of IL-10 and TGF-beta. We report the identification, purification, and cloning of a novel zinc finger nuclear factor, named GC binding protein (GC-BP), that is induced following phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages or by treatment with phosphatidylserine. GC-BP selectively inhibits IL-12 p35 gene transcription by binding to its promoter in vitro and in vivo, thus decreasing IL-12 production. Blocking GC-BP by RNA interference restores IL-12 p35 transcription and IL-12 p70 synthesis. Finally, GC-BP itself undergoes functionally significant tyrosine dephosphorylation in response to apoptotic cells.","3914":"To examine the role of the TNF-R superfamily signaling protein TRAF2 in mature B cell development and NF-kappaB activation, conditionally TRAF2-deficient mice were produced. B cells lacking TRAF2 expression in these mice possessed a selective survival advantage, accumulated in the lymph nodes and splenic marginal zone, were larger in size, and expressed increased levels of CD21\/35. These TRAF2-deficient B cells could not proliferate or activate the canonical NF-kappaB pathway in response to CD40 ligation. By contrast, noncanonical NF-kappaB activation was constitutively hyperactive, with TRAF2-deficient B cells exhibiting close to maximal processing of NF-kappaB2 from p100 to p52 and high levels of constitutive p52 and RelB DNA binding activity. These findings establish TRAF2 as a multifunctional regulator of NF-kappaB activation that mediates activation of the canonical pathway but acts as a negative regulator of the noncanonical pathway. This dual functionality explains the contrasting roles of TRAF2 in B cell maturation and activation.","3915":"Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding protein that organizes and concentrates specific ligands within the caveolae membranes. We identified a conserved caveolin-1 binding motif in the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 and designed several synthetic peptides, referred to as CBD1, corresponding to the consensus caveolin-1 binding domain in gp41. In rabbits, these peptides elicit the production of antibodies that inhibit infection of primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes by various primary HIV-1 isolates. Interestingly, gp41 exists as a stable complex with caveolin-1 in HIV-infected cells. Anti-CBD1 peptide antibodies, therefore, might be functional by inhibiting the potential interaction of gp41 with caveolin-1. Because of their capacity to elicit antibodies that inhibit the different clades of HIV-1, CBD1-based peptides may represent a novel synthetic universal B cell epitope vaccine candidate for HIV\/AIDS. Moreover, such peptides could also have an application as a therapeutic vaccine since CBD1-specific antibodies are rare in HIV-infected individuals from several geographic origins.","3916":"","3917":"Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells contributes to their removal in situ by quiet, noninflammatory, and nonimmunogenic mechanisms. In this issue of Immunity, describe a completely new mechanism for this effect that involves a novel zinc finger nuclear factor that inhibits IL-12 production.","3918":"TCR affinity and ligand off-rate have both been found to influence the degree of T cell activation by peptide-MHC. A report in this issue of Immunity finds that ligand off-rate does not correlate with antigen-specific peripheral T cell expansion. Moreover, the data point to the surprising notion that there exist TCR affinity thresholds and, once attained, T cells with higher affinity receptors have no competitive advantage.","3919":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells use the perforin\/granzyme pathway to kill virally infected cells and tumor cells. Mutations in genes important for this pathway are associated with several human diseases. CD4(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells have emerged as important in the control of immunopathological processes. We have previously shown that human adaptive Treg cells preferentially express granzyme B and can kill allogeneic target cells in a perforin-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that activated human CD4(+)CD25(+) natural Treg cells express granzyme A but very little granzyme B. Furthermore, both Treg subtypes display perforin-dependent cytotoxicity against autologous target cells, including activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CD14(+) monocytes, and both immature and mature dendritic cells. This cytotoxicity is dependent on CD18 adhesive interactions but is independent of Fas\/FasL. Our findings suggest that the perforin\/granzyme pathway is one of the mechanisms that Treg cells can use to control immune responses.","3920":"TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members, CD40, and BAFFR play critical roles in B cell survival and differentiation. Genetic deficiency in a novel adaptor molecule, Act1, for CD40 and BAFF results in a dramatic increase in peripheral B cells, which culminates in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, hypergammaglobulinemia, and autoantibodies. While the B cell-specific Act1 knockout mice displayed a similar phenotype with less severity, the pathology of the Act1-deficient mice was mostly blocked in CD40-Act1 and BAFF-Act1 double knockout mice. CD40- and BAFF-mediated survival is significantly increased in Act1-deficent B cells, with stronger IkappaB phosphorylation, processing of NF-kappaB2 (p100\/p52), and activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 pathways, indicating that Act1 negatively regulates CD40- and BAFF-mediated signaling events. These findings demonstrate that Act1 plays an important role in the homeostasis of B cells by attenuating CD40 and BAFFR signaling.","3921":"High LDL and\/or low HDL are risk factors for atherosclerosis and are also a common clinical feature in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Here, we show that changes in lipid profiles that reflect atherosclerotic disease led to activation of skin murine dendritic cells (DCs) locally, promoted dermal inflammation, and induced lymph node hypertrophy. Paradoxically, DC migration to lymph nodes was impaired, suppressing immunologic priming. Impaired migration resulted from inhibitory signals generated by platelet-activating factor (PAF) or oxidized LDL that acts as a PAF mimetic. Normal DC migration and priming was restored by HDL or HDL-associated PAF acetylhydrolase (PAFAH), which mediates inactivation of PAF and oxidized LDL. Thus, atherosclerotic changes can sequester activated DCs in the periphery where they may aggravate local inflammation even as they poorly carry out functions that require their migration to lymph nodes. In this context, HDL and PAFAH maintain a normally functional DC compartment.","3922":"Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with clinical hallmarks of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth). The genetic basis of this autoimmune disease is poorly understood. Id3 is an immediate early-response gene in growth regulation and is involved in TCR-mediated T cell selection during T cell development. Here, we show that Id3-deficient mice develop many disease symptoms found in primary Sjogren's syndrome patients including dry eyes and mouth, lymphocyte infiltration in lachrymal and salivary glands, and development of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Adoptive transfer experiment indicated a T cell intrinsic role for Id3 in the development of Sjogren's symptoms. Furthermore, genetic ablation of T cells or neonatal 3 day thymectomy in Id3-deficient mice showed a rescue of disease symptoms, suggesting a thymic origin of autoimmune T cells. Thus, this study establishes a critical connection between Id3-mediated T cell development and autoimmune diseases.","3923":"Both osteopontin (OPN) and natural killer T (NKT) cells play a role in the development of immunological disorders. We examined a functional link between OPN and NKT cells. Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis is a well-characterized murine model of T cell-mediated liver diseases. Here, we show that NKT cells secrete OPN, which augments NKT cell activation and triggers neutrophil infiltration and activation. Thus, OPN- and NKT cell-deficient mice were refractory to Con A-induced hepatitis. In addition, a neutralizing antibody specific for a cryptic epitope of OPN, exposed by thrombin cleavage, ameliorated hepatitis. These findings identify NKT cell-derived OPN as a novel target for the treatment of inflammatory liver diseases.","3924":"For a preferential homing of T cells to the gut, expression of the integrin alpha4beta7 and the chemokine receptor CCR9 is essential and is induced by antigenic stimulation with dendritic cells from the gut-associated lymphoid organs. Here, we show that the vitamin A (retinol) metabolite, retinoic acid, enhances the expression of alpha4beta7 and CCR9 on T cells upon activation and imprints them with the gut tropism. Dendritic cells from the gut-associated lymphoid organs produced retinoic acid from retinol. The enhanced alpha4beta7 expression on T cells by antigenic stimulation with these dendritic cells was suppressed by the retinal dehydrogenase inhibitor citral and the retinoic acid receptor antagonist LE135. Accordingly, vitamin A deficiency caused a reduction in alpha4beta7(+) memory\/activated T cells in lymphoid organs and a depletion of T cells from the intestinal lamina propria. These findings revealed a novel role for retinoic acid in the imprinting of gut-homing specificity on T cells.","3925":"We have studied the role of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (betaTM\/Cyto) in T cell signaling. Upon antigen stimulation, T lymphocytes expressing a TCR with mutant and betaTM and Cyto domains accumulate in large numbers and are specifically defective in undergoing activation-induced cell death (AICD). The mutant TCR poorly recruits the protein adaptor Carma-1 and is subsequently impaired in activating NF-kappaB. This signaling defect leads to a reduced expression of Fas ligand (FasL) and to a reduction in AICD. These beta chain domains are involved in discriminating cell division and apoptosis.","3926":"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) limit autoimmunity but also attenuate the magnitude of antipathogen and antitumor immunity. Understanding the mechanism of Treg function and therapeutic manipulation of Tregs in vivo requires identification of Treg-selective receptors. A comparative analysis of gene expression arrays from antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells differentiating to either an effector\/memory or a regulatory phenotype revealed Treg-selective expression of LAG-3, a CD4-related molecule that binds MHC class II. Antibodies to LAG-3 inhibit suppression by induced Tregs both in vitro and in vivo. Natural CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs express LAG-3 upon activation, which is significantly enhanced in the presence of effector cells, whereas CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs from LAG-3(-\/-) mice exhibit reduced regulatory activity. Lastly, ectopic expression of LAG-3 on CD4(+) T cells significantly reduces their proliferative capacity and confers on them suppressor activity toward effector T cells. We propose that LAG-3 marks regulatory T cell populations and contributes to their suppressor activity.","3927":"Alterations of TGF-beta signaling have been described in colorectal cancer, although the molecular consequences are largely unknown. By using transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta or a dominant-negative TGF-betaRII, we demonstrate that TGF-beta signaling in tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes controls the growth of dysplastic epithelial cells in experimental colorectal cancer, as determined by histology and a novel system for high-resolution chromoendoscopy. At the molecular level, TGF-beta signaling in T cells regulated STAT-3 activation in tumor cells via IL-6. IL-6 signaling required tumor cell-derived soluble IL-6R rather than membrane bound IL-6R and suppression of such TGF-beta-dependent IL-6 trans-signaling prevented tumor progression in vivo. Taken together, our data provide novel insights into TGF-beta signaling in colorectal cancer and suggest novel therapeutic approaches for colorectal cancer based on inhibition of TGF-beta-dependent IL-6 trans-signaling.","3928":"The NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) induces proteolytic processing of NF-kappaB2\/p100 and, hence, the generation of NF-kappaB dimers such as p52:RelB but was suggested not to signal for the processing of IkappaB. Here, we show that although the induction of IkappaB degradation in lymphocytes by TNF is independent of NIK, its induction by CD70, CD40 ligand, and BLyS\/BAFF, which all also induce NF-kappaB2\/p100 processing, does depend on NIK function. Both CD70 and TNF induce recruitment of the IKK kinase complex to their receptors. In the case of CD70, but not TNF, this process is associated with NIK recruitment and is followed by prolonged receptor association of just IKK1 and NIK. Recruitment of the IKK complex to CD27, but not that of NIK, depends on NIK kinase function. Our findings indicate that NIK participates in a unique set of proximal signaling events initiated by specific inducers, which activate both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB dimers.","3929":"IL-17A was cloned more than 10 years ago and six IL-17 family members (IL-17A-F) have subsequently been described. IL-17A is largely produced by activated memory T lymphocytes but stimulates innate immunity and host defense. IL-17A and IL-17F both mobilize neutrophils partly through granulopoeisis and CXC chemokine induction, as well as increased survival locally. IL-17A and IL-17F production by T lymphocytes is regulated by IL-23 independent of T cell receptor activation. Increasing evidence shows that IL-17 family members play an active role in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. This places IL-17 family members and their receptors as potential targets for future pharmacotherapy.","3930":"Signaling by receptors in the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily mediate biological outcomes ranging from inflammation to apoptosis and other forms of programmed cell death. How receptor signaling mediates these divergent responses is just beginning to be understood. Here, we discuss how receptor submembrane localization and the formation of alternate signaling complexes can alter the fate of cells stimulated through TNFRs with a death domain, also known as \"death receptors.\"","3931":"T cell priming by dendritic cells (DC) from gut-associated lymphoid tissues gives rise to effector cells with pronounced gut tropism. The mechanism for DC-dependent imprinting of gut specificity has remained unknown. New findings point to retinoic acid, which is uniquely produced by intestinal DC, but not by DC from other lymphoid organs.","3932":"Id3(-\/-) mice were found to have autoantibodies, lymphocytic infiltrates in, and decreased secretion by exocrine glands. Similar symptoms are found in primary Sjogren's Syndrome. In this issue of Immunity, Li and colleagues suggest an important role for Id3 function in T cell development and Sjogren's Syndrome.","3933":"Although found predominantly in the peritoneal and pleural cavities, B-1 cells are also present in other peripheral tissues such as spleen and lung. While similar in surface phenotypes, such as CD5, all B-1 cells are not equivalent in their response to stimuli. Here, we report that the src family kinase Lck is required to confer the BCR hyporesponsiveness typical of CD5+ B-1 cells and appears involved in the maintenance of their unique function. Splenic B-1 cells express CD5 but not Lck and are not hyporesponsive; however, within the peritoneum, these B-1 cells are induced to express Lck and acquire a hyporesponsive phenotype. Peritoneal B-1 cells from lck-deficient mice, while CD5+, no longer exhibit attenuated BCR signaling. Interestingly, lck-null mice exhibited increased natural antibody levels characteristic of B-1 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate a key role for Lck in modulating the signaling and cellular fate of B-1 B cells.","3934":"Chemokines guide lymphocytes from blood to secondary lymphoid organs by triggering integrin-dependent firm adhesion under vascular flow and directed migration of T and B lymphocytes within lymphoid tissue. Here, we analyze the roles of DOCK2, a mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans CED-5 and Drosophila melanogaster Myoblast City, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) during lymphocyte recirculation. DOCK2 mediated efficient lymphocyte migration in a largely PI3K-independent manner, although a minor, PI3K-dependent pathway for migration was observed in wild-type and DOCK2-deficient lymphocytes. In T cells, this residual migration depended mainly on PI3Kgamma, whereas other PI3K isoforms were implicated in B cells. In vitro adhesion assays and intravital microscopy of lymphoid organ vasculature uncovered an unexpected defect in integrin activation in DOCK2-\/- B cells, whereas lack of DOCK2 did not affect chemokine-triggered integrin activation in T cells. DOCK2 and PI3Kgamma thus play distinct roles during T and B cell integrin activation and migration.","3935":"The molecular regulation of the recruitment of initial signaling complexes at the TNF-R1 is poorly defined. We demonstrate here that within minutes internalized TNF-R1 (TNF receptosomes) recruits TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 to establish the \"death-inducing signaling complex\" (DISC). In addition, we identified the TNF-R1 internalization domain (TRID) required for receptor endocytosis and provide evidence that TNF-R1 internalization, DISC formation, and apoptosis are inseparable events. Analyzing cell lines expressing an internalization-deficient receptor (TNF-R1 DeltaTRID) revealed that recruitment of RIP-1 and TRAF-2 to TNF-R1 occurred at the level of the plasma membrane. In contrast, aggregation of TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8 to establish the TNF-R1-associated DISC is critically dependent on receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, fusion of TNF receptosomes with trans-Golgi vesicles results in activation of acid sphingomyelinase and cathepsin D. Thus, TNF receptosomes establish the different TNF signaling pathways by compartmentalization of plasma membrane-derived endocytic vesicles harboring the TNF-R1-associated DISC.","3936":"The reported affinity differences between CD28 and CTLA-4 binding to B7-1 and B7-2 may serve to selectively regulate CD28 and CTLA-4 function by differentially recruiting and\/or stabilizing these molecules at the immunological synapse. Here we show that ligand binding is important for the accumulation of both CD28 and CTLA-4 at the synapse. While CD28 is recruited to the synapse in the absence of B7-1 and B7-2 binding, it is not effectively stabilized there, as its localization can be disrupted by CTLA-4. In the case of CTLA-4, ligand binding is critical for its concentration at the synapse. We also demonstrate that the affinity and avidity differences in ligand binding translate into selective recruitment of CD28 or CTLA-4 to the immunological synapse--B7-1 is the major ligand mediating CTLA-4 localization, while B7-2 is the main ligand for CD28 concentration at the synapse.","3937":"TCR transgenic mice that express a peptide antigen in keratinocytes develop a lethal CD8 T cell-dependent autoimmune disease. We employed an adoptive transfer system to understand this disease and show that transfer of low numbers of naive CD8 T cells into peptide transgenic mice caused chronic skin disease. The antigen-presenting cell that initiated this response was the epidermal Langerhans cell. Naive CD8 T cells proliferated extensively, migrated to tissues, developed effector function, and were capable of making a recall response. These features are very different from the abortive activation of CD8 T cells that occurred in response to the same antigen presented by APC from other tissues. Furthermore, tolerance was dominant when the antigen was presented by both Langerhans cells and other APC. These data suggest that Langerhans cells do not have tolerogenic properties in the steady state.","3938":"Many microbial pathogens employ antigenic variation as a strategy to evade the immune system, posing a challenge in vaccine development. To understand the requirements for immunity against such pathogens, we studied Borrelia hermsii, a relapsing fever bacterium. We found that mice deficient in T, follicular B, marginal zone B, or B1a lymphocytes resolved B. hersmii bacteremia and became resistant to reinfection. The resolution of bacteremia coincided with an expansion and persistence of B1b lymphocytes, and purified B1b lymphocytes from convalescent wild-type or TCR-betaxdelta-\/- mice conferred immunity to Rag1-\/- mice. The B1b lymphocytes in the reconstituted Rag1-\/- mice provided long-lasting immunity by rapidly generating B. hermsii-specific IgM but not IgG upon bacterial challenge. Unmutated IgM is sufficient to eliminate B. hermsii, because AID-\/- mice deficient in somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination efficiently resolved all bacteremic episodes. These data demonstrate that B1b lymphocytes can provide long-lasting T cell-independent IgM memory.","3939":"MICA molecules interact with the NKG2D-activating receptor on human NK and CD8 T cells. We investigated the participation of the MICA\/NKG2D pathway in the destruction of intestinal epithelium by intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IEL) in Celiac disease and its premalignant complication, refractory sprue. We show that MICA is strongly expressed at epithelial cell surface in patients with active disease and is induced by gliadin or its p31-49 derived peptide upon in vitro challenge, an effect relayed by IL-15. This triggers direct activation and costimulation of IEL through engagement of NKG2D, leading to an innate-like cytotoxicity toward epithelial targets and enhanced TCR-dependent CD8 T cell-mediated adaptive response. Villous atrophy in Celiac disease might thus be ascribed to an IEL-mediated damage to enterocytes involving NKG2D\/MICA interaction after gliadin-induced expression of MICA on gut epithelium. This supports a key role for MIC\/NKG2D in the activation of intraepithelial immunity in response to danger.","3940":"A major function of NKG2D linking innate and adaptive immunity is to upregulate antigen-specific CTL-mediated cytotoxicity in tissues expressing stress-induced NKG2D ligands, such as MIC, by coactivating TCR signaling. Here, we show that, under conditions of dysregulated IL15 expression in vivo in patients with celiac disease and in vitro in healthy individuals, multiple steps of the NKG2D\/DAP10 signaling pathway leading to ERK and JNK activation are coordinately primed to activate direct cytolytic function independent of TCR specificity in effector CD8 T cells. These findings may not only explain previous reports of transformation of CTL into NK-like \"lymphokine-activated killers\" (LAK cells) under high doses of IL2 (a substitute for IL15) but may also have significant implications for understanding and treating immunopathological diseases.","3941":"The initial application of two-photon imaging to the study of lymphoid tissues has provided a dramatic glimpse into how cells of the immune system move and interact in their native environments. In this review we summarize what we have learned so far and point out areas for future investigation using this approach.","3942":"Recently, static and dynamic imaging methods have produced the first glimpses of the interactions between antigen-specific T cells and peptide-MHC-bearing antigen-presenting cells in the lymph nodes. Using data from these experiments, we produced a numerically, spatially, and temporally scaled simulation of the first 50 hr of the primary T cell-dependent immune response. The simulation highlights how lymph node structure facilitates antigen presentation to rare, naive, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.","3943":"A central feature of the immune system is the migratory behavior of its cellular components. Thus, fully understanding the generation and maintenance of immune responses must include consideration of how hematopoietic cells home to, interact within, and exit from secondary lymphoid organs as well as peripheral tissues. Recent advances in in situ imaging techniques now permit direct observation of these events in their physiologic settings with high spatiotemporal resolution. This review summarizes progress in this area of investigation from a lymphocentric perspective. We highlight controversies, point out key unanswered questions, and briefly outline what we believe are some of the near-term directions that in situ microscopic analysis of the immune system will take.","3944":"Recent advances in photonics, particularly multi-photon microscopy (MPM) and new molecular and genetic tools are empowering immunologists to answer longstanding unresolved questions in living animals. Using intravital microscopy (IVM) investigators are dissecting the cellular and molecular underpinnings controlling immune cell motility and interactions in tissues. Recent IVM work showed that T cell responses to antigen in lymph nodes are different from those observed in vitro and appear dictated by factors uniquely relevant to intact organs. Other IVM models, particularly in the bone marrow, reveal how different anatomic contexts regulate leukocyte development, immunity, and inflammation. This article will discuss the current state of the field and outline how IVM can generate new discoveries and serve as a \"reality check\" for areas of research that were formerly the exclusive domain of in vitro experimentation.","3945":"Adaptive immune responses are initiated by interactions of T cells with antigen-presenting cells, but the basic nature of these interactions during an immune response in vivo has been a matter of speculation. While some in vitro systems provide evidence for stable interactions, referred to as immunological synapses, compelling evidence supports T cell activation through serial transient interactions. Deep tissue intravital and organ culture microscopy studies suggest that both modes of interaction are employed, but new issues have emerged. This review will discuss in vitro results that framed the hypotheses that are currently being tested in vivo. I present a model in which TCR stop signals compete with chemokine-mediated go signals to adjust the duration of immunological synapse formation and tune the immune response between tolerance and full activation.","3946":"Infiltration of lymphocytes in the small intestinal epithelium is a hallmark of active celiac disease. In this issue of Immunity, two papers uncover mechanisms controlling the cytolytic potential of these cells and provide evidence that lymphocyte killing of enterocytes is an important part of the celiac disease pathogenesis.","3947":"The role of cellular selection in the development of gammadelta T cells remains unclear. Knockout mice lacking a subset of Vgamma genes, including Vgamma3, contain abundant gammadelta T cells but are devoid of dendritic epidermal gammadeltaT cells (DETCs), which normally express an invariant Vgamma3\/Vdelta1 gammadelta TCR. A rearranged Vgamma2 transgene restored DETC development, but the restored DETCs selectively expressed a unique Vdelta gene other than Vdelta1, indicating that DETC development involves TCR-based selection. In both normal and transgenic\/knockout mice, specific DETC precursors in the fetal thymus were activated and expressed the IL-15 receptor beta chain, skin-homing receptors, and thymic exiting receptors. In vitro activation of irrelevant precursors also led to upregulation of the skin-homing receptor, providing an explanation for how thymic selection is coordinated with development of epidermal gammadelta T cells.","3948":"Natural interferon-producing cells (IPC) respond to viruses by secreting type I interferon (IFN) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 mediates IPC recognition of some of these viruses in vitro. However, whether TLR9-induced activation of IPC is necessary for an effective antiviral response in vivo is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that IPC and dendritic cells (DC) recognize murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) through TLR9. TLR9-mediated cytokine secretion promotes viral clearance by NK cells that express the MCMV-specific receptor Ly49H. Although depletion of IPC leads to a drastic reduction of the IFN-alpha response, this allows other cell types to secrete IL-12, ensuring normal IFN-gamma and NK cell responses to MCMV. We conclude that the TLR9\/MyD88 pathway mediates antiviral cytokine responses by IPC, DC, and possibly other cell types, which are coordinated to promote effective NK cell function and MCMV clearance.","3949":"Little is known of the transcriptional events controlling the differentiation and function of dendritic cells (DC). We found that the ligand-activated transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is immediately upregulated after the induction of monocyte-derived DC differentiation. Activation of PPARgamma changed the expression pattern of cell surface receptors and enhanced the internalizing activity of DC. Unexpectedly, we found that CD1 glycoproteins, a class of molecules responsible for the presentation of self and foreign modified lipids, were coordinately regulated by PPARgamma activation. CD1a levels were reduced, while CD1d expression was induced. Enhanced expression of CD1d was coupled to the selective induction of invariant natural-killer T cell (iNKT cell) proliferation in the presence of alpha-GalCer. These results suggest that PPARgamma orchestrates a transcriptional response leading to the development of a DC subtype with increased internalizing capacity, efficient lipid presentation, and the augmented potential to activate iNKT cells.","3950":"The differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells is controlled by two transcription factors, Blimp-1 and XBP1. By gene expression profiling, we defined a set of genes whose induction during mouse plasmacytic differentiation is dependent on Blimp-1 and\/or XBP1. Blimp-1-deficient B cells failed to upregulate most plasma cell-specific genes, including xbp1. Differentiating xbp1-deficient B cells induced Blimp-1 normally but failed to upregulate genes encoding many secretory pathway components. Conversely, ectopic expression of XBP1 induced a wide spectrum of secretory pathway genes and physically expanded the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, XBP1 increased cell size, lysosome content, mitochondrial mass and function, ribosome numbers, and total protein synthesis. Thus, XBP1 coordinates diverse changes in cellular structure and function resulting in the characteristic phenotype of professional secretory cells.","3951":"The Tec family tyrosine kinase, Itk, is critical for PLC-gamma1 activation downstream of the TCR. Studies of Itk-\/- mice have demonstrated a requirement for Itk in Th2 cytokine production and protective immunity to parasitic infections. Here we address the mechanism by which Itk regulates Th2 differentiation. We find that naive Itk-\/- CD4+ T cells respond normally to cytokine skewing signals and can differentiate efficiently into either Th1 or Th2 lineage cells. In the absence of skewing cytokines, wild-type CD4+ T cells stimulated with low-avidity ligands preferentially express GATA-3 mRNA and differentiate into Th2 cells. Under these same stimulation conditions, Itk-\/- T cells produce large amounts of T-bet mRNA and differentiate into IFN-gamma-producing cells. Furthermore, Itk is upregulated during Th2 differentiation, while Rlk, a related Tec kinase, disappears rapidly from differentiating Th2 cells. Together, these findings provide a molecular explanation for the essential role of Itk in Th2 differentiation.","3952":"Murine natural killer cells selectively express members of the Ly49 family of class I MHC receptors; however, the molecular mechanism controlling probabilistic expression of Ly49 proteins has not been defined. A pair of overlapping, divergent promoters discovered in the Ly49g gene functions as a molecular switch that can produce a forward transcript containing the coding region of the gene (on position) or a noncoding transcript in the opposite direction (off position), and this element maintains transcription in the chosen direction. Competition of C\/EBP and TBP transcription factors for overlapping binding sites determines the relative strength of the competing promoters and the probability of transcription in a given direction. Similar elements precede all Ly49 family members, and the relative strength of the forward promoter in each inhibitory Ly49 gene correlates with the percentage of natural killer cells that express a given receptor, supporting a promoter competition model of selective gene activation.","3953":"The developmental origin of type I interferon (IFN)-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) is controversial. In particular, the rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes in murine PDCs and the expression of pre-T cell receptor alpha (pTalpha) gene by human PDCs were proposed as evidence for their \"lymphoid\" origin. Here we demonstrate that PDCs capable of IFN production develop efficiently from both myeloid- and lymphoid-committed progenitors. Rearranged IgH genes as well as RAG transcripts were found in both myeloid- and lymphoid-derived PDCs. The human pTalpha transgenic reporter was activated in both myeloid- and lymphoid-derived PDCs at a level comparable to pre-T cells. PDCs were the only cell population that activated murine RAG1 knockin and human pTalpha transgenic reporters outside the lymphoid lineage. These results highlight a unique developmental program of PDCs that distinguishes them from other cell types including conventional dendritic cells.","3954":"The cellular organization and relationships among precursors that initiate embryonic angiogenesis and hematopoiesis in the human have yet to be characterized. Here, we identify a subpopulation of primitive endothelial-like cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) that express PECAM-1, Flk-1, and VE-cadherin, but not CD45 (CD45negPFV cells), and that are uniquely responsible for endothelial and hematopoietic development. Molecular profiling of CD45negPFV cells is consistent with endothelial and hematopoietic competency. Clonal isolation demonstrates that the CD45negPFV population includes bipotent cells with endothelial and hematopoietic capacity. We suggest that human hematopoiesis and endothelial maturation originate exclusively from a subset of embryonic endothelium that possesses hemangioblastic properties and offers a model system to study these lineage relationships in the human.","3955":"Cell growth during the G1 stage of the cell cycle is partly controlled by inducing c-myc expression, which in B cells is regulated by the NF-kappaB1 and c-Rel transcription factors. Here, we show that c-myc-dependent growth during T cell activation requires c-Rel and RelA and that blocking this growth by inhibiting protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta) coincides with a failure to upregulate c-myc due to impaired RelA nuclear import and inhibition of NFAT-dependent c-rel transcription. These results demonstrate that different Rel\/NF-kappaB dimers regulate the mitogenic growth of mature T and B cells, with a signaling pathway incorporating PKCtheta and NFAT controlling c-Rel\/RelA-induced c-myc expression in activated T cells.","3956":"Regulation of tyrosine kinase-mediated cellular activation through antigen receptors is of great biological and practical significance. The evolutionarily conserved Cbl family ubiquitin ligases have emerged as key negative regulators of activated tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors, and their impaired function switches a normal immune response into autoimmunity. Cbl proteins facilitate the ubiquitinylation of activated tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins and of the signaling chains of receptors themselves; monoubiquitin tag promotes sorting of activated receptors and associated proteins into internal vesicles of the multivesicular body, facilitating their lysosomal degradation, whereas polyubiquitin tag promotes proteasomal degradation. Notably, increased expression of Cbl proteins and other ubiquitin ligases is a component of anergic signaling program in T cells. Thus, controlled destruction of the signaling apparatus has emerged as a key to fine-tuning antigen receptor signaling. Further studies of this pathway are likely to elucidate the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and offer new therapeutic targets.","3957":"T cell receptor-defined subsets of gammadelta T cells differentially localize in cutaneous, intestinal, or reproductive epithelium. In this issue of Immunity, Xiong et al. show that murine Vgamma3+ T cells undergo TCR-dependent selection in the fetal thymus that drives expression of a cutaneous homing receptor.","3958":"Members of the Ly49 gene family of natural killer (NK) cell receptors in mice are expressed in seemingly stochastic combinations such that each NK cell expresses a handful of family members. A transcriptional switch appears to establish this interesting pattern of expression.","3959":"The origin of plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors (pDC) has been controversial. This manuscript shows that CLP and CMP both can give rise to pDCs. pDCs derived from CMP express RAG gene products and show IgHD-J rearrangement, suggesting that pDC represent a unique lineage whose gene expression program shows substantial plasticity.","3960":"Survival of naive T cells is dependent upon IL-7, which is present in vivo in limiting amounts with the result that naive T cells must compete for IL-7-mediated survival signals. It would seem imperative during T cell homeostasis that limiting IL-7 be shared by the greatest possible number of T cells. We now describe a novel regulatory mechanism that specifically suppresses IL7Ralpha transcription in response to IL-7 and other prosurvival cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-15). Consequently, IL7R expression is reduced on T cells that have received cytokine-mediated survival signals so they do not compete with unsignaled T cells for remaining IL-7. Interestingly, cytokine-mediated suppression of IL7Ralpha transcription involves different molecular mechanisms in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as CD8+ T cells utilize the transcriptional repressor GFI1 while CD4+ T cells do not. We suggest that this homeostatic regulatory mechanism promotes survival of the maximum possible number of T cells for the amount of IL-7 available.","3961":"The CC chemokine receptor CCR7 has been identified as a key regulator of homeostatic B and T cell trafficking to secondary lymphoid organs. Data presented here demonstrate that CCR7 is also an essential mediator for entry of both dermal and epidermal dendritic cells (DC) into the lymphatic vessels within the dermis while this receptor is dispensable for the mobilization of Langerhans cells from the epidermis to the dermis. Moreover, a distinct population of CD11c(+)MHCII(high) DC showing low expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 in wild-type animals was virtually absent in skin-draining lymph nodes of CCR7-deficient mice under steady-state conditions. We provide evidence that these cells represent a semimature population of DC that is capable of initiating T cell proliferation under conditions known to induce tolerance. Thus, our data identify CCR7 as a key regulator that governs trafficking of skin DC under both inflammatory and steady-state conditions.","3962":"Naturally arising CD25+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (TR) play an important role in the prevention of autoimmunity. TCR specificity is thought to play a critical role in TR development and function, but the repertoire and specificity of TR TCRs remain largely unknown. We find by sequencing of TRAV14 (Valpha2) TCRalpha chains associated with a transgenic TCRbeta chain that the TRand CD25- CD4+ TCR repertoires are similarly diverse, yet only partially overlapping. Retroviral expression of TCRalpha genes in TCR transgenic RAG-deficient T cells revealed that a high frequency of TCRs derived from CD25+ but not CD25- CD4+ T cells confers the ability to rapidly expand upon transfer into a lymphopenic host. Thus, these data show that a large proportion of naturally arising TR have substantially more efficient interactions with MHC class II bound peptides from the peripheral self than CD25- T cells.","3963":"The oncogenic EBV protein LMP1 mimics a dysregulated CD40 receptor in vitro. To compare CD40 and LMP1-mediated events in vivo, transgenic mice were engineered to express mouse CD40 (mCD40tg) or a protein with extracellular mCD40 and cytoplasmic LMP1 (mCD40-LMP1tg). Transgenic and CD40(-\/-) mice were bred so that only the transgenic CD40 molecule is expressed in B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. mCD40-LMP1tg mice had normal lymphocyte subsets, and immunization elicited an antibody response featuring normal isotype switching, affinity maturation, and germinal center (GC) formation. However, unimmunized mCD40-LMP1tg mice had expanded immature and germinal center B cells, produced autoantibodies, exhibited marked splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, and elevated serum IL-6. Thus, signaling through the LMP1 cytoplasmic tail results in amplified and abnormal mimicry of CD40 functions in vivo, indicating possible ways in which LMP1 contributes to the pathogenesis of EBV-associated human disease.","3964":"Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is mainly produced by activated Th1 cells. The data presented here indicate that neither resting nor activated immune cells express IL-22 receptor, and IL-22 did not have any effects on these cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, cells of the skin and the digestive and respiratory systems represent putative targets of this cytokine. The expression of IL-22 receptor in keratinocytes was upregulated by Interferon-gamma. In these cells, IL-22 activated STAT3 and directly and transcriptionally increased the expression of beta-Defensin 2 and beta-Defensin 3. High levels of IL-22 were associated with strongly upregulated beta-Defensin expression in skin from patients with T cell-mediated dermatoses. Taken together, IL-22 does not serve the communication between immune cells but is a T cell mediator that directly promotes the innate, nonspecific immunity of tissues.","3965":"An initial exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a transient state of hyporesponsiveness to a subsequent challenge with LPS. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon, termed endotoxin tolerance, remains poorly understood despite a recent resurgence of interest in this area. We demonstrate herein that SHIP(-\/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMmphis) and mast cells (BMMCs) do not display endotoxin tolerance. Moreover, an initial LPS treatment of wild-type BMmphis or BMMCs increases the level of SHIP, but not SHIP2 or PTEN, and this increase is critical for the hyporesponsiveness to subsequent LPS stimulation. Interestingly, this increase in SHIP protein is mediated by the LPS-induced production of autocrine-acting TGFbeta and neutralizing antibodies to TGFbeta block LPS-induced endotoxin tolerance. In vivo studies with SHIP(+\/+) and SHIP(-\/-) mice confirm these in vitro findings and show a correlation between the duration of endotoxin tolerance and elevated SHIP levels.","3966":"Neutrophils (PMN) have been described as critical effector cells in the host's antibacterial innate immunities. However, the classification of murine PMNs remains unclear. Here, we show that in addition to normal PMN (PMN-N), there are at least two distinct subsets of PMNs (PMN-I and PMN-II) distinguished as follows: (1) cytokine and chemokine production (PMN-I, IL-12\/CCL3; PMN-II, IL-10\/CCL2; PMN-N, no cytokine\/chemokine production), (2) macrophage activation (PMN-I, classically activated macrophages; PMN-II, alternatively activated macrophages; PMN-N, no effect on macrophage activation), (3) Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression (PMN-I, TLR2\/TLR4\/TLR5\/TLR8; PMN-II, TLR2\/TLR4\/TLR7\/TLR9; PMN-N, TLR2\/TLR4\/TLR9), and (4) surface antigen expression (PMN-I, CD49d(+)CD11b-; PMN-II, CD49d(-)CD11b+; PMN-N, CD49d(-)CD11b-). PMN-I was obtained from MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-resistant hosts, while MRSA-sensitive hosts were a source of PMN-II. PMN-N was obtained from naive mice. Anti-MRSA innate immunities might be influenced differently by these biochemically and physically distinguished PMNs. PMN-N may convert to PMN-I or PMN-II in response to host circumstance.","3967":"Forkhead (Fox) transcription factors play key roles in immunoregulation. Members of the Foxo subfamily have been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and\/or apoptosis, but their specific immunological contexts remain largely undefined. We demonstrate here that Foxo3a, the predominant Foxo member expressed in peripheral lymphoid organs, plays a critical role in lymphoid homeostasis. Foxo3a deficiency leads to spontaneous lymphoproliferation, associated with inflammation of several organs, in the absence of overt apoptotic defects. These findings correlated with the presence of hyperactivated helper T cells, which proliferated more vigorously and produced more Th1 and Th2 cytokines than their wild-type counterparts. Foxo3a inhibits NF-kappaB activation, whose overactivity was responsible for T cell hyperactivity in Foxo3a-deficient mice. Thus, Foxo3a regulates helper T cell activation and tolerance by inhibiting NF-kappaB activity, reinforcing a generalized role for the forkhead proteins in the maintenance of T cell tolerance through the inhibition of inflammatory transcriptional activities.","3968":"Cyclophilin A (CypA\/Ppia) is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that binds the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine. The resulting complex blocks T cell function by inhibiting the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. To identify the native function of CypA, long suspected of regulating signal transduction, we generated mice lacking the Ppia gene. These animals develop allergic disease, with elevated IgE and tissue infiltration by mast cells and eosinophils, that is driven by CD4+ T helper type II (Th2) cytokines. Ppia(-\/-) Th2 cells were hypersensitive to TCR stimulation, a phenotype consistent with increased activity of Itk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase crucial for Th2 responses. CypA bound Itk via the PPIase active site. Mutation of a conformationally heterogeneous proline in the SH2 domain of Itk disrupted interaction with CypA and specifically increased Th2 cytokine production from wild-type CD4+ T cells. Thus, CypA inhibits CD4+ T cell signal transduction in the absence of cyclosporine via a regulatory proline residue in Itk.","3969":"Patients with lupus (SLE) experience progressive cognitive loss without evidence of CNS vascular disease or inflammation. SLE patients produce anti-DNA antibodies that crossreact with NMDA receptors and are capable of mediating excitotoxic death. We now show that mice induced by antigen to express these antibodies have no neuronal damage until breakdown of the blood-brain barrier occurs. Following administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to immunized mice, antibodies gain access to the brain. They bind preferentially to hippocampal neurons and cause neuronal death with resulting cognitive dysfunction and altered hippocampal metabolism on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, given prior to LPS administration, prevents neuronal damage. Thus, systemic immune responses can cause cognitive impairment in the absence of an inflammatory cascade, implicating the immune system in yet another arena of human pathobiology. Furthermore, NMDA receptor antagonists prevent antibody-mediated damage and may constitute a new approach to therapy in SLE.","3970":"Antigen-specific immunotolerance limits the expansion of self-reactive T cells involved in autoimmune diseases. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b is upregulated in T cells after tolerizing signals. Loss of Cbl-b in mice results in impaired induction of T cell tolerance both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, rechallenge of Cbl-b mutant mice with the tolerizing antigen results in massive lethality. Moreover, ablation of Cbl-b resulted in exacerbated autoimmunity. Mechanistically, loss of Cbl-b rescues reduced calcium mobilization of anergic T cells, which was attributed to Cbl-b-mediated regulation of PLCgamma-1 phosphorylation. Our results show a critical role for Cbl-b in the regulation of peripheral tolerance and anergy of T cells.","3971":"The immune system detects viral infections and mutations in parenchymal cells when antigens from these cells are crosspresented on MHC class I molecules of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC). Exogenous antigens are crosspresented through TAP-dependent (cytosolic) or poorly understood TAP-independent (vacuolar) pathways. The TAP-independent pathway is blocked by the cysteine protease inhibitor, leupeptin, but not by proteasome inhibitors, which is opposite to the effects of these agents on the TAP-dependent pathway. Dendritic cells lacking the cysteine protease cathepsin S lack the TAP-independent pathway. Mice whose APC lack cathepsin S have reduced crosspriming to particulate and cell-associated antigens, as well as to influenza virus. Cathepsin S-deficient phagosomes generate a class I-presented peptide poorly. In contrast, cathepsin S-sufficient phagosomes and recombinant cathepsin S produce the mature epitope. Therefore, cathepsin S plays a major role in generating presented peptides for the vacuolar pathway of crosspresentation, and this mechanism is active in vivo.","3972":null,"3973":"The last fifteen years have seen a reemergence of interest in cancer immunosurveillance and a broadening of this concept into one termed cancer immunoediting. The latter, supported by strong experimental data derived from murine tumor models and provocative correlative data obtained by studying human cancer, holds that the immune system not only protects the host against development of primary nonviral cancers but also sculpts tumor immunogenicity. Cancer immunoediting is a process consisting of three phases: elimination (i.e., cancer immunosurveillance), equilibrium, and escape. Herein, we summarize the data supporting the existence of each of the three cancer immunoediting phases. The full understanding of the immunobiology of cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting will hopefully stimulate development of more effective immunotherapeutic approaches to control and\/or eliminate human cancers.","3974":"Research into the biology of endotoxin (aka lipopolysaccharide; LPS) began well over 100 years ago and has had many unexpected turns. The phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance was among these and has engendered immense curiosity over the years. Sly and colleagues (this issue of Immunity) have taken an important step toward understanding the phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance and have enhanced our comprehension of LPS signaling as a whole by demonstrating that the cytosolic phosphatase SHIP is required to permit the development of an LPS-refractory state in macrophages and mice.","3975":"Previous studies have implicated the transcription factor FoxO3a in apoptosis induction. Thus, it comes as a surprise in this issue of Immunity that lymphoproliferative disease in Foxo3a-deficient mice may be due to T cell hyperactivity instead of cell death defects. Lin and colleagues provide important new evidence that disease development is associated with NF-kappaB hyperactivation in T cells.","3976":"The role of BAFF in B cell self tolerance was examined by tracking the fate of anti-HEL self-reactive B cells in BAFF transgenic mice using four different models of self-reactive B cell deletion. BAFF overexpression did not affect the development of self-reactive B cells normally deleted in the bone marrow or during the early stages of peripheral development. By contrast, self-reactive B cells normally deleted around the late T2 stage of peripheral development were rescued from deletion, matured, and colonized the splenic follicle. Furthermore, self-reactive B cells normally selectively deleted from the marginal zone repopulated this compartment when excess BAFF was present. Self-reactive B cells rescued by excess BAFF were not anergic. BAFF overexpression therefore rescued only self-reactive B cells normally deleted with relatively low stringency and facilitated their migration into otherwise forbidden microenvironments. This partial subversion of B cell self tolerance is likely to underlie the autoimmunity associated with BAFF overexpression.","3977":"Mucosal secretions of the human gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genital tracts contain significant quantities of IgG. The mechanism by which IgG reaches luminal secretions and the function of IgG in these locations are unknown. Here, we find that the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the vehicle that transports IgG across the intestinal epithelial barrier into the lumen where the IgG can bind cognate antigen. The FcRn can then recycle the IgG\/antigen complex back across the intestinal barrier into the lamina propria for processing by dendritic cells and presentation to CD4(+) T cells in regional organized lymphoid structures. These results explain how IgG is secreted onto mucosal surfaces and scavenges luminal antigens for recognition by the immune system.","3978":"NKG2D is an activating receptor on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells that has been implicated in immunity against tumors and microbial pathogens. Here we show that RAE-1 is present in prediabetic pancreas islets of NOD mice and that autoreactive CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the pancreas express NKG2D. Treatment with a nondepleting anti-NKG2D monoclonal antibody (mAb) during the prediabetic stage completely prevented disease by impairing the expansion and function of autoreactive CD8(+) T cells. These findings demonstrate that NKG2D is essential for disease progression and suggest a new therapeutic target for autoimmune type I diabetes.","3979":"As innate immune system components, natural killer (NK) cells respond rapidly to infections and effectively control replication of pathogens, including murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a double-stranded DNA beta-herpesvirus. In the absence of NK cell control, MCMV infection results in early mortality due to uncontrolled viral replication. However, here we show that even in the face of initial NK cell control, there is late recrudescence of disease and mortality in immunodeficient mice due to the outgrowth of MCMV mutants that escape recognition by innate NK cells. These data suggest that viral infections in certain clinical settings also may be due to viral escape from innate immunity.","3980":"The nature of early T lineage progenitors in the thymus or bone marrow remains controversial. Here we assess lineage capacity and proliferative potential among five distinct components of the earliest intrathymic stage (DN1, CD25(-)44(+)). All of these express one or more hemato-lymphoid lineage markers. All can produce T lineage cells, but only two of them display kinetics of differentiation, proliferative capacity, and other traits consistent with being canonical T progenitors. The latter also appeared limited to producing cells of the T or NK lineages, while B lineage potential derived mainly from the other, less typical T progenitors. In addition to precisely defining canonical early progenitors in the thymus, this work reconciles conflicting results from numerous groups by showing that multiple progenitors with a DN1 phenotype home to the thymus and make T cells, but possess different proliferative potentials and lineage capacities.","3981":"Changes in chromatin structure underlie the activation or silencing of genes during development. The chromatin remodeler Mi-2beta is highly expressed in thymocytes and is presumed to be a transcriptional repressor because of its presence in the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Using conditional inactivation, we show that Mi-2beta is required at several steps during T cell development: for differentiation of beta selected immature thymocytes, for developmental expression of CD4, and for cell divisions in mature T cells. We further show that Mi-2beta plays a direct role in promoting CD4 gene expression. Mi-2beta associates with the CD4 enhancer as well as the E box binding protein HEB and the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300, enabling their recruitment to the CD4 enhancer and causing histone H3-hyperacetylation to this regulatory region. These findings provide important insights into the regulation of CD4 expression during T cell development and define a role for Mi-2beta in gene activation.","3982":"In bone marrow, hematopoiesis is thought to depend on special microenvironments known as niches that maintain blood cells. However, the identity of niches and interaction of blood cells with niches remain poorly understood. Here we identify stage-specific cellular niches for B lymphopoiesis. The earliest precursors, pre-pro-B cells and end-stage B cells, plasma cells require CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12. CXCL12-expressing cells are a small population of stromal cells, scattered throughout bone marrow and located some distance from the cells expressing interleukin (IL)-7. Multipotent hematopoietic progenitors are attached to the processes of CXCL12-expressing cells and pre-pro-B cells adjoin their cell bodies. Maturer pro-B cells that require IL-7 have moved away and adjoin the IL-7-expressing cells. Plasma cells again seed CXCL12-expressing cells. We demonstrate the B lymphocyte characteristic location and movement between specific niches within bone marrow during development and suggest that CXCL12 maintains the cells in the niche.","3983":"In the steady state, interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) leads to T cell tolerance. To examine the role of DC regulated peripheral tolerance in a model autoimmune disease, we delivered an encephalitogenic oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide to DCs in vivo. We found that targeting MOG peptide to DCs resulted in a novel form of peripheral T cell tolerance that was sufficiently profound to prevent autoimmune experimental acute encephalomyelitis (EAE). The tolerized T cells were severely impaired in specific secondary responses to antigen in vivo but they were not intrinsically anergic since they remained highly responsive to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in vitro. The mechanism that mediates this dynamic antigen-specific T cell unresponsiveness differs from previously described forms of tolerance in that it requires that DCs induce CD5 expression on activated T cells.","3984":"Inflammatory bowel disease is an immune-mediated intestinal inflammatory condition that is associated with an increase in autoantibodies that bind to epithelial cells. However, it is unknown whether the epithelial cell-derived products that are recognized by such autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenic process. Through a combined antigen-screening approach utilizing humoral and cellular immune responses, we identify herein an epithelial lectin, galectin-4, that specifically stimulates IL-6 production by CD4(+) T cells. Interestingly, the reactivity of CD4(+) T cells to galectin-4 is precisely elicited under intestinal inflammatory conditions. The galectin-4-mediated production of IL-6 is MHC class II independent and induced by PKCtheta-associated pathway through the immunological synapse. The galectin-4-mediated stimulation of CD4(+) T cells is shown to exacerbate chronic colitis and delay the recovery from acute intestinal injury. These studies identify the presence of an immunogenic, endogenous lectin in the intestine and dissect the biological role of lectin\/CD4(+) T cell interactions under inflammatory conditions.","3985":"Gene variants in mice that have strong, Mendelian effects on autoimmune susceptibility have been one of the most productive entry points for identifying genes and processes regulating human autoimmunity. With the tools now available to map and identify new mouse Mendelian gene variants, the handful of spontaneous mutations accumulated over several decades have all been identified, and the main bottleneck lies in producing new Mendelian immune variants. We outline here a strategy to generate large sets of functional variants in genes controlling lupus and humoral immunity, based upon limited variation of the mouse genome sequence with the chemical mutagen, ENU, combined with a set of sensitive immunological screens.","3986":"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is an essential enzyme to regulate class switch recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM), and gene conversion (GC). AID is known to be required for DNA cleavage of S regions in CSR. However, its molecular mechanism is a focus of extensive debate. RNA editing hypothesis postulates that AID edits yet unknown mRNA to generate specific endonucleases for CSR and SHM. By contrast, DNA deamination hypothesis assumes that AID deaminates cytosine in DNA, followed by DNA cleavage by base excision repair enzymes. We discuss available evidence for the two proposed models. Recent findings, namely requirement of protein synthesis for DNA breakage and dispensability of U removal activity of uracil DNA glycosylase, force us to reconsider DNA deamination hypothesis.","3987":"In this issue of Immunity, the Jonjic and Yokoyama teams provide evidence that beta-herpesvirus mutants can emerge under the selective pressure of innate immunity during primary infections. These rare mutants that escape natural killer cell recognition cause disease and death in mice that lack sterilizing T cell immunity.","3988":"Two recent Immunity papers link peripheral tolerance with the ability of developing B cells to capture BAFF. These findings suggest that an increase in effective BAFF levels leads to autoreactive B cell maturation.","3989":"Insects depend solely upon innate immune responses to survive infection. These responses include the activation of extracellular protease cascades, leading to melanization and clotting, and intracellular signal transduction pathways inducing antimicrobial peptide gene expression. In Drosophila, the IMD pathway is required for antimicrobial gene expression in response to gram-negative bacteria. The exact molecular component(s) from these bacteria that activate the IMD pathway remain controversial. We found that highly purified LPS did not stimulate the IMD pathway. However, lipid A, the active portion of LPS in mammals, activated melanization in the silkworm Bombyx morii. On the other hand, the IMD pathway was remarkably sensitive to polymeric and monomeric gram-negative peptidoglycan. Recognition of peptidoglycan required the stem-peptide sequence specific to gram-negative peptidoglycan and the receptor PGRP-LC. Recognition of monomeric and polymeric peptidoglycan required different PGRP-LC splice isoforms, while lipid A recognition required an unidentified soluble factor in the hemolymph of Bombyx morii.","3990":"Macrophage\/neutrophil-specific IL-4 receptor alpha-deficient mice (LysM(Cre)IL-4Ralpha(-\/flox)) were generated to understand the role of IL-4\/IL-13 responsive myeloid cells during Type 2 immune responses. LysM(Cre)IL-4Ralpha(-\/flox) mice developed protective immunity against Nippostrongylus brasiliensis accompanied by T(H)2 development and goblet cell hyperplasia. In contrast, LysM(Cre)IL-4Ralpha(-\/flox) mice were extremely susceptible to Schistosoma mansoni infection with 100% mortality during acute infection. Mortality was not dependent on neutrophils and occurred in the presence of T(H)2\/Type 2 responses, granuloma formation, and egg-induced fibrosis. Death was associated with increased T(H)1 cytokines, hepatic and intestinal histopathology, increased NOS-2 activity, impaired egg expulsion, and sepsis. IL-10 was not able to compensate for the absence of IL-4\/IL-13-activated alternative macrophages. Together, this shows that alternative macrophages are essential during schistosomiasis for protection against organ injury through downregulation of egg-induced inflammation.","3991":"RBP-J is a key mediator of Notch signaling that regulates a large spectrum of cell fate determinations. To elucidate the functions of Notch signaling in T cell development, we inactivated RBP-J specifically at two stages of T cell development by crossing RBP-J floxed mice with lck-cre or CD4-cre transgenic mice. The loss of RBP-J at an earlier developmental stage resulted in enhanced generation and accelerated emigration of gammadelta T cells, whereas alphabeta T cell development was arrested at the double-negative 3 stage. The loss of RBP-J at a later stage did not affect the absolute number or the production rate of CD4 or CD8-positive mature T cells but enhanced Th1 cell response and reduced CD4(+) T cell proliferation. Our data demonstrated that Notch\/RBP-J signaling regulates gammadelta T cell generation and migration, alphabeta T cell maturation, terminal differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th1\/Th2 cells, and activation of T cells.","3992":"In mammals, IgG is transferred from mother to young by the MHC-related receptor FcRn, which binds IgG in acidic endosomes and releases it at basic pH into blood. Maternal IgY, the avian counterpart of IgG, is transferred to embryos across yolk sac membranes. We affinity-purified the chicken yolk sac IgY receptor (FcRY) and sequenced its gene. FcRY is unrelated to MHC molecules but is a homolog of the mammalian phospholipase A(2) receptor. Analytical ultracentrifugation and truncation experiments suggest that FcRY forms a compact structure containing an IgY binding site at acidic pH but undergoes a conformational change at basic pH that disrupts the site. FcRY is thus unrelated to mammalian FcRn in both its structure and mechanism for pH-dependent binding, illustrating distinct routes utilized by evolution to transfer antibodies.","3993":"The integrin LFA-1 and its ligand ICAM-1 mediate B cell adhesion, but their role in membrane-bound antigen recognition is still unknown. Here, using planar lipid bilayers and cells expressing ICAM-1 fused to green fluorescence protein, we found that the engagement of B cell receptor (BCR) promotes B cell adhesion by an LFA-1-mediated mechanism. LFA-1 is recruited to form a mature B cell synapse segregating into a ring around the BCR. This distribution is maintained over a wide range of BCR\/antigen affinities (10(6) M(-1) to 10(11) M(-1)). Furthermore, the LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 reduces the level of antigen required to form the synapse and trigger a B cell. Thus, LFA-1\/ICAM-1 interaction lowers the threshold for B cell activation by promoting B cell adhesion and synapse formation.","3994":"The mechanism by which T cell antigen receptors (TCR) accumulate at the immunological synapse has not been fully elucidated. Since TCRs are continuously internalized and recycled back to the cell surface, we investigated the role of polarized recycling in TCR targeting to the immunological synapse. We show here that the recycling endosomal compartment of T cells encountering activatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs) polarizes towards the T cell-APC contact site. Moreover, TCRs in transit through recycling endosomes are targeted to the immunological synapse. Inhibition of T cell polarity, constitutive TCR endocytosis, or recycling reduces TCR accumulation at the immunological synapse. Conversely, increasing the amount of TCRs in recycling endosomes before synapse formation enhanced their accumulation. Finally, we show that exocytic t-SNAREs from T cells cluster at the APC contact site and that tetanus toxin inhibits TCR accumulation at the immunological synapse, indicating that vesicle fusion mediated by SNARE complexes is involved in TCR targeting to the immunological synapse.","3995":"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) plays a critical role in downregulating T cell responses. A number of autoimmune diseases have shown genetic linkage to the CTLA-4 locus. We have cloned and expressed an alternatively spliced form of CTLA-4 that has genetic linkage with type I diabetes in the NOD mice. This splice variant of CTLA-4, named ligand-independent CTLA-4 (liCTLA-4), lacks exon2 including the MYPPPY motif essential for binding to the costimulatory ligands B7-1 and B7-2. Here we show that liCTLA-4 is expressed as a protein in primary T cells and strongly inhibits T cell responses by binding and dephosphorylating the TcRzeta chain. Expression of liCTLA-4, but not full-length CTLA-4 (flCTLA-4), was higher in memory\/regulatory T cells from diabetes-resistant NOD congenic mice compared to susceptible NOD mice. These data suggest that increased expression and negative signaling delivered by the liCTLA-4 may regulate development of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.","3996":"Memory T cells are distributed throughout the body following infection, but the migratory dynamics of the memory pool in vivo is unknown. The ability of circulating microbe-specific memory T cells to populate lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues was examined using adoptive transfer and parabiosis systems. While migration of memory CD8 T cells to lymph nodes and peritoneal cavity required G(i)-coupled receptor signaling, migration to the spleen, bone marrow, lung, and liver was independent of this pathway. Following parabiosis, memory T cells rapidly equilibrated into the lymphoid tissues, lung, and liver of each parabiont, implying most memory cells were not obligately tissue resident. Equilibration of memory cell populations was delayed in the brain, peritoneal cavity, and intestinal lamina propria, indicating controlled gating for entry into these tissues. In addition, memory cell migration to the lamina propria required beta7 integrins. Thus, the blood-borne T cell pool serves to maintain the homeostasis of tissue-based memory populations.","3997":"We propose a model where autoimmunity can be viewed as a dynamic system driven by opposite vectors IFN-alpha\/beta and TNF. These cytokines drive differentiation of distinct types of DCs, TNF-DCs, or IFN-DCs, which present different antigens leading to distinct autoimmune responses. When balanced, both cytokines synergize in protective immunity. When one of the cytokines prevails, autoimmunity occurs, Type I interferons (IFN-alpha\/beta) playing a major role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and TNF playing a major role in rheumatoid arthritis. This model complements the Type 1\/Type 2 paradigm. Therefore, immunity can be viewed as a dynamic system driven by two sets of opposite vectors: IFN-alpha\/beta\/TNF and IFN-gamma\/IL-4.","3998":"The B7 family of T cell costimulatory molecules has recently acquired several new members. Some of these are activating while others are inhibitory. In this review, we will focus on the novel inhibitory pathways with particular emphasis on the PD-1:PD-L pathway. Understanding the mechanisms of these pathways has implications for development of novel treatment strategies for autoimmune disease, transplantation, tumor immunotherapy, and vaccine development.","3999":"The pathogenic roles of B cells in human autoimmune diseases involve a multitude of mechanistic pathways and include the well-established contributions of autoantibodies and immune complexes that induce local inflammatory reactions and tissue destruction. Recent results using several novel B cell-directed therapies have provided new insights into additional roles of B cells in human autoimmunity. In this review, we will highlight some of these studies and discuss how clinical insights parallel murine models of normal immunity and autoimmunity.","4000":"The establishment and maintenance of immunological tolerance entails both central and peripheral mechanisms. The latter have been highlighted in the past several years, mostly because of great interest in the activities of regulatory T cells. However, an important role for central tolerance mechanisms has been reemphasized by recent results on human autoimmune diseases, including APECED and type 1 diabetes.","4001":"The isolation of a novel Fc receptor (FcRY) from chicken yolk sac provides insight at the mechanistic level as to how avian maternal immunoglobulin (IgY) is transferred to offspring. This receptor is distinct from its mammalian counterpart and is a phospholipase A(2) receptor homolog. Biophysical analyses indicate that FcRY achieves pH-dependent binding to IgY through a conformational change.","4002":"Intracellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome, and resulting peptides surviving cytoplasmic peptidase activity can be presented by MHC class I molecules. Here, we show that intracellular aminopeptidases degrade peptides within seconds, almost irrespectively of amino acid sequence. N- but not C-terminal extension increases the half-life of peptides until they are 15 amino acids long. Beyond 15 amino acids, peptides are exclusively trimmed by the peptidase TPPII, which displays both exo- and endopeptidase activity. Surprisingly, most proteasomal degradation products are handled by TPPII before presentation by MHC class I molecules. We define three distinct proteolytic activities during antigen processing in vivo. Proteasome-generated peptides relevant for antigen presentation are mostly 15 amino acids or longer. These require TPPII activity for further trimming before becoming substrates for other peptidases and MHC class I. The heterogeneous pool of aminopeptidases will process TPPII products into MHC class I peptides and beyond.","4003":"Natural killer (NK) and CD1d-restricted Valpha14i natural killer T (NKT) cells play a critical early role in host defense. Here we show that mice with a targeted deletion of T-bet, a T-box transcription factor required for Th1 cell differentiation, have a profound, stem cell-intrinsic defect in their ability to generate mature NK and Valpha14i NKT cells. Both cell types fail to complete normal terminal maturation and are present in decreased numbers in peripheral lymphoid organs of T-bet(-\/-) mice. T-bet expression is regulated during NK cell differentiation by NK-activating receptors and cytokines known to control NK development and effector function. Our results identify T-bet as a key factor in the terminal maturation and peripheral homeostasis of NK and Valpha14i NKT cells.","4004":"The peptide spanning residues 48-61 of hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) presented by I-A(k) gives rise to two T cell populations, referred to as type A and B, that distinguish the complex generated intracellularly upon processing of HEL from that formed with exogenous peptide. Here, we ascribe this difference to recognition of distinct conformers of the complex and show that formation of the two complexes results from antigen processing in different intracellular compartments and is dependent upon H2-DM. While the type A complex preferentially formed in a lysosome-like late vesicle, the type B complex failed to form in this compartment; this distinction was abolished in antigen-presenting cells lacking DM. Experiments in vitro indicated that H2-DM acts directly on the complex to eliminate the type B conformation. We conclude that different antigen-processing pathways generate distinct MHC-peptide conformers, priming T cells with distinct specificity that may play unique roles in immunity.","4005":"CD44 on activated T cells can initiate contact and mediate rolling on hyaluronan on endothelial cells. We have shown that the integrin VLA-4 is used preferentially over LFA-1 in conjunction with this rolling interaction for firm adhesion. Here, we show by coimmunoprecipitation and transfection studies that CD44 associates with VLA-4 but not LFA-1 on the plasma membrane of immune cells. Absence of the cytoplasmic portion of CD44 abrogates this coassociation and attendant firm adhesion. Moreover, in an in vivo model of lymphocyte homing, cells expressing only the truncated form of CD44 together with VLA-4 fail to traffic to an inflamed site, thereby defining a discrete biological role for the cytoplasmic domain. These studies demonstrate a molecular mechanism whereby coanchoring within a single bimolecular complex between a primary and secondary adhesion molecule regulates a cell's ability to firmly adhere, providing a fundamental alteration to the paradigm of leukocyte extravasation.","4006":"Peripheral autoantigen binding B cells are poorly competitive with naive B cells for survival and undergo rapid cell death. However, in monoclonal Ig-transgenic mice lacking competitor B cells, autoantigen binding B cells can survive for extended periods. The basis for competitive elimination of autoantigen binding B cells has been unknown. Here we demonstrate that autoantigen binding B cells have increased dependence on BAFF for survival. In monoclonal Ig-transgenic mice, each autoantigen binding B cell receives elevated amounts of BAFF, exhibiting increased levels of NFkappaB p52 and of the prosurvival kinase Pim2. When placed in a diverse B cell compartment, BAFF receptor engagement and signaling are reduced and the autoantigen binding cells are unable to protect themselves from Bim and possibly other death-promoting factors induced by chronic BCR signaling. These findings indicate that under conditions where BAFF levels are elevated, autoantigen-engaged cells will be rescued from rapid competitive elimination, predisposing to the development of autoimmune disease.","4007":"Primary neonatal Th1 cells develop alongside of Th2 upon priming of the newborn but undergo apoptosis upon recall with antigen. These Th1 cells were isolated, and their death was correlated with elevated IL-13Ralpha1 chain expression. Strikingly, neutralization of Th2s' IL-4 reduced apoptosis, sustained recall responses, and the live Th1 cells displayed a decrease in IL-13Ralpha1 expression. Blockade of IL-13Ralpha1 or IL-4Ralpha also restores recall and secondary Th1 responses. Adult T cells primed within the neonatal environment did not upregulate IL-13Ralpha1 chain or undergo apoptosis and developed recall Th1 responses. These observations indicate that developmental expression of IL-13Ralpha1 along with IL-4Ralpha provides a receptor through which IL-4 induces death of Th1 cells and skews neonatal immunity toward Th2.","4008":"We investigated the role of acetylated microtubules in the antigen-specific interaction of T helper and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In T cells, acetylated microtubules concentrated at contact site with APCs, surrounding clusters of CD3 and LFA-1. TcR engagement induced a transient deacetylation of microtubules at early times and an enhanced acetylation at late times. Confocal videomicroscopy studies revealed that the HDAC6 tubulin deacetylase was translocated and concentrated at the contact site of T cells with APCs. Overexpression of HDAC6 but not a dead deacetylase mutant in T cells disorganized CD3 and LFA-1 at the immune synapse. This effect was reverted by treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. The antigen-specific translocation of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and IL-2 production were also severely impaired by overexpression of HDAC6. Our results underscore the key role for HDAC6 in the organization of the immune synapse and the antigen-specific reorientation of the MTOC.","4009":"Notch signaling has been identified as an important regulator of leukocyte differentiation and thymic maturation. Less is known about the role of Notch signaling in regulating mature T cells. We examined the role of Notch 1 in regulating peripheral T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. Coligation of Notch 1 together with TCR and CD28 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. This effect was dependent on presenilin activity and induced the expression of HES-1, suggestive of Notch 1 signaling. Biochemical analysis demonstrated an inhibition of AKT and GSK3beta phosphorylation following Notch 1 engagement while other biochemical signals such as TCR and ERK phosphorylation remained intact. Similar effects were observed in vivo in an adoptive transfer model. Therefore, Notch 1 signaling may play an important role in regulating naive T cell activation and homeostasis.","4010":"In vivo, beta(2) integrins and particularly alpha(L)beta(2) (LFA-1) robustly support firm adhesion of leukocytes, but can also cooperate with other molecules in supporting rolling adhesion. Strikingly, a small molecule alpha\/beta I-like allosteric antagonist, XVA143, inhibits LFA-1-dependent firm adhesion, while at the same time it enhances adhesion in shear flow and rolling both in vitro and in vivo. XVA143 appears to induce the extended conformation of integrins as shown by increased activation epitope exposure. Fab to the beta(2) I-like domain converts firm adhesion to rolling adhesion, but does not enhance adhesion. Residue alpha(L)-Glu-310 in the linker following the I domain is critical for communication to the beta(2) I-like domain, rolling, integrin extension, and activation by Mn(2+) of firm adhesion. The results demonstrate the importance of integrin extension in rolling, and suggest that rolling and firm adhesion are mediated by extended conformations of alpha(L)beta(2) that differ in the affinity of the alpha(L) I domain for ICAM-1.","4011":"Contact sensitivity responses require both effective immune sensitization following cutaneous exposure to chemical haptens and antigen-specific elicitation of inflammation upon subsequent hapten challenge. We report that antigen-independent effects of IgE antibodies can promote immune sensitization to haptens in the skin. Contact sensitivity was markedly impaired in IgE(-\/-) mice but was restored by either transfer of sensitized cells from wild-type mice or administration of hapten-irrelevant IgE before sensitization. Moreover, IgE(-\/-) mice exhibited impairment in the reduction of dendritic cell numbers in the epidermis after hapten exposure. Monomeric IgE has been reported to influence mast cell function. We observed diminished contact sensitivity in mice lacking FcepsilonRI or mast cells, and mRNA for several mast cell-associated genes was reduced in IgE(-\/-) versus wild-type skin after hapten exposure. We speculate that levels of IgE normally present in mice favor immune sensitization via antigen-independent but FcepsilonRI-dependent effects on mast cells.","4012":"For decades immunologists have relied heavily on the mouse model for their experimental designs. With the realization of the important role innate immunity plays in orchestrating immune responses, invertebrates such as worms and flies have been added to the repertoire. Here, we discuss the advent of the zebrafish as a powerful vertebrate model organism that promises to positively impact immunologic research.","4013":"Natural killer T (NKT) cells, as their name implies, constitutively express markers and receptors first identified on bona fide natural killer (NK) cells, supporting a potential relationship between NKT and NK cells. In this issue of Immunity, Townsend et al. further define this relationship in terms of the transcription factor, T-bet.","4014":"Proteasomes can't do it all. It was previously known that aminopeptidases frequently degrade proteasome-generated peptides. Now it appears that another protease, tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP II), plays a critical role in cleaving proteasomal produced peptides into shorter peptides that can then be degraded by aminopeptidases.","4015":"Siegelman and colleagues demonstrate unexpected synergism of CD44 and VLA-4 during lymphocyte extravasation. This is the first time that molecules mediating rolling and firm adhesion have been shown to associate biochemically leading to direct functional cooperation.","4016":"E2A proteins are essential for the development of B cells beyond the progenitor cell stage. Here we have isolated E2A-deficient bone marrow-derived cells that have the ability to grow long-term in vitro and coexpress, at low levels, regulators of different hematopoietic cell lineages. When transferred into lethally irradiated hosts, E2A-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells reconstitute the T, NK, myeloid, dendritic, and erythroid lineages but fail to develop into mature B lineage cells. Enforced expression of E47 in E2A-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells directly activates the transcription of a subset of B lineage-specific genes, including lambda5, mb-1, and Pax5. In contrast, E47 inhibits the expression of regulators of other hematopoietic lineages, including TCF-1 and GATA-1. These observations indicate that E2A-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells remain pluripotent after long-term culture in vitro and that E2A proteins play a critical role in B cell commitment.","4017":"PD-1, a member of the CD28\/CTLA-4\/ICOS costimulatory receptor family, delivers negative signals that have profound effects on T and B cell immunity. The 2.0 A crystal structure of the extracellular domain of murine PD-1 reveals an Ig V-type topology with overall similarity to the CTLA-4 monomer; however, there are notable differences in regions relevant to function. Our structural and biophysical data show that PD-1 is monomeric both in solution as well as on cell surface, in contrast to CTLA-4 and other family members that are all disulfide-linked homodimers. Furthermore, our structure-based mutagenesis studies identify the ligand binding surface of PD-1, which displays significant differences compared to those present in the other members of the family.","4018":"Upon systemic activation by antigens, CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T cells selectively accumulate and undergo apoptosis in the liver, a mechanism associated with the induction of hepatic tolerance and chronic infection. The molecular basis for CD8(+) T cell preference in this process is unknown. We prepared B7-H1-deficient mice by gene targeting and found spontaneous accumulation of CD8(+) T cells in the liver while CD4(+) T cell levels remained normal. Moreover, antigen-driven CD8(+) T cells proliferated normally while apoptotic levels during the contraction phase was selectively impaired in the liver, leading to accelerated hepatocyte damage in experimental autoimmune hepatitis. Therefore, B7-H1 is a key protein selectively regulating the accumulation and deletion of intrahepatic CD8(+) T cells and may also contribute to inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and tolerance in the liver.","4019":"Mutations within the NALP3\/cryopyrin\/CIAS1 gene are responsible for three autoinflammatory disorders: Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome, and CINCA. The NALP3 protein is homologous to NALP1, which is a component of the inflammasome, a molecular platform that activates the proinflammatory caspases-1 and -5. NALP3 (and other members of the NALP family) lacks the C-terminal, CARD-containing sequence of NALP1, and its role in caspase activation is unclear. Here, we report that NALP2 and NALP3 associate with ASC, the CARD-containing protein Cardinal, and caspase-1 (but not caspase-5), thereby forming an inflammasome with high proIL-1beta-processing activity. Macrophages from Muckle-Wells patients spontaneously secrete active IL-1beta. Increased inflammasome activity is therefore likely to be the molecular basis of the symptoms associated with NALP3-dependent autoinflammatory disorders.","4020":"The murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 MK3 protein inhibits CD8(+) T cell recognition by ubiquitinating the cytoplasmic tails of classical MHC class I heavy chains. Here we show that MK3 also provides the first example of a protein that degrades tapasin and TAP. The degradation was MK3 RING finger dependent and primarily affected TAP. MK3 associated with TAP1 in the absence of tapasin or TAP2, suggesting that TAP1 was a primary binding partner in the peptide loading complex. TAP2 also played a major role in MK3 stability and function. By degrading TAP, therefore, MK3 limited its own expression. However, TAP degradation also broadened the MK3 inhibitory repertoire and achieved a remarkable resistance to MHC class I upregulation by interferon-gamma, suggesting that it represents a specific adaptation to immune evasion in lymphoid tissue.","4021":"The establishment of viral persistence generally requires evasion of the host CD8(+) T cell response. Here we describe a form of evasion wherein the CD8(+) T cells are fully capable of recognizing their cognate antigen but their effector functions are suppressed by regulatory T cells. Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells adoptively transferred into mice persistently infected with Friend virus proliferated and appeared activated, but failed to produce IFNgamma or reduce virus loads. Cotransfer experiments revealed that a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells from persistently infected mice suppressed IFNgamma production by the CD8(+) T cells. Treatment of persistently infected mice with anti-GITR antibody to ameliorate suppression by regulatory T cells significantly improved IFNgamma production by transferred CD8(+) T cells and allowed a significant reduction in viral loads. The results indicate that CD4(+) regulatory T cells contribute to viral persistence and demonstrate an immunotherapy for treating chronic retroviral infections.","4022":"Mice lacking CD38, an ectoenzyme that generates the calcium-mobilizing metabolite cADPR, make reduced T cell-dependent antibody responses. Despite the predicted role for CD38 in B cell activation, we find that CD38 regulates the migration of dendritic cell (DC) precursors from the blood to peripheral sites and controls the migration of mature DCs from sites of inflammation to lymph nodes. Thus, T cells are inefficiently primed in Cd38(-\/-) mice, leading to poor humoral immune responses. We also show that CD38 and cADPR modulate calcium mobilization in chemokine-stimulated DCs and are required for the chemotaxis of immature and mature DCs to CCL2, CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL12. Therefore, CD38 regulates adaptive immunity by controlling chemokine receptor signaling in DCs.","4023":"Using IL-4 reporter mice we identified eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells as the three IL-4-producing cell types that appear in the lungs of mice infected with the migrating intestinal helminth, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Eosinophils were most prevalent, peaking by approximately 1000-fold on day 9 after infection, with Th2 cells and basophils at 3- and 10-fold lower numbers, respectively. Eosinophil and basophil expansion in blood in response to parasites and their capacity for IL-4 expression required neither Stat6 nor T cells. Th2 induction and expansion in draining lymph nodes was also Stat6 independent. In contrast, eosinophil (and Th2 cell) recruitment to the lung was dependent on Stat6 expression by a bone marrow-derived tissue resident cell, whereas basophil recruitment was Stat6 and IL-4\/IL-13 independent but T cell dependent. Primary type 2 immune responses in the lung represent the focal recruitment and activation of discrete cell populations from the blood that have previously committed to express IL-4.","4024":"During development, discrete cell fates often result from variation in the intensity of a particular signal. The mechanisms underlying these seemingly analog-to-digital switches are not understood. In developing T lymphocytes, low-intensity signals through the antigen receptor result in positive selection while more intense signals give rise to negative selection. By deleting the genetic locus encoding the regulatory B1 subunit of calcineurin specifically in thymocytes, we found an absolute requirement for calcineurin in positive selection. In contrast, calcineurin activity was dispensable in several models of negative selection. Unexpectedly, we found that removal of calcineurin activity from thymocytes results in inefficient ERK activation at the double-positive stage of thymocyte development, when selection occurs. These studies clarify the mechanism by which graded signals are converted to discrete outcomes in T cell development and further indicate that the developmental roles of calcineurin likely contribute to immunosuppression by calcineurin inhibitors.","4025":"Mucosal tissues are the primary site of natural HIV transmission and a major reservoir for HIV replication. Targeting immune responses to the mucosal entry site before viral dissemination could protect and also clear viral reservoirs. Recent understanding of mucosal HIV transmission and of chemokines and integrins in mucosal trafficking can aid design of new strategies to enhance AIDS vaccine efficacy.","4026":"Migration of dendritic cells to secondary lymphatic organs is a key event in acquired immunity. The role of the multifunctional ectoenzyme CD38 in humoral immune responses has now been revisited, suggesting that CD38 links innate and adaptive immunity by triggering chemokine-mediated dendritic cell chemotaxis.","4027":"Cytokine-mediated inflammation is a target for novel therapies as well as for fundamental research. A single amino acid mutation in the NALP-3 gene controlling the activation of caspase-1 results in increased processing of the inactive IL-1beta precursor and release of the active cytokine. Blocking IL-1 receptors arrests inflammation in humans with the mutation.","4028":"Differential Ly6C expression identifies a major phenotypic division in CD44loCD62LhiCD4+ Th cells. Using two separate models of single subset adoptive transfer, we demonstrate the unique capacity of Ly6Chi Th cells to promote antigen-specific plasma cell production in vivo. In contrast, both compartments support germinal center formation and proliferate to equivalent levels upon TCR triggering in vivo and in vitro. Developmentally, CD4+CD8- thymocytes leave the thymus expressing low levels of Ly6C; 3 days later approximately 50% stably upregulate Ly6C without cell division or TCR engagement in the periphery. Interestingly, antigen-specific Th cell clonotypes unevenly assort into these peripheral compartments, creating separate TCR repertoires that underpin peripheral functional diversity. Taken together, these data reveal a developmentally distinct Ly6Chi naive Th cell compartment subspecialized to regulate plasma cell production in vivo.","4029":"The chemokine RANTES is secreted rapidly after activation of human CD8+ T cells, with a cycloheximide-resistant burst during the first hour. This pattern was observed in purified memory and effector phenotype CD8+ cells from blood as well as in blasts. In contrast, secretion of other chemokines and interferon-gamma by these cells was sensitive to cycloheximide and detectable only after a lag. Immunofluorescence microscopy of CD8+ memory and effector cells and blasts showed RANTES present in intracellular vesicles that do not significantly colocalize with cytotoxic granule markers or other markers of defined cytoplasmic compartments. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that RANTES is stored in small vesicles distinct from the lysosomal secretory granules. RANTES+ vesicles polarize rapidly in response to TcR engagement and are more rapidly depleted from the cytoplasm. These results show that CD8+ T cells have two distinct TcR-regulated secretory compartments characterized by different mobilization kinetics, effector molecules, and biological function.","4030":"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable despite conventional and high-dose therapies. Therefore, novel biologically based treatment approaches are urgently required. Here we demonstrate that expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in MM cells and its agonists 15-d-PGJ2 and troglitazone completely abolished IL-6-inducible MM cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through affecting expression of multiple cell cycle or apoptosis genes, whereas PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 and PPARalpha agonist WY14643 did not display this inhibitory effect. These PPARgamma agonists significantly inhibited DNA binding and transactivation of STAT3 bound to the promoter of target genes in chromatin, but did not affect the expression of IL-6 receptor and phosphorylation of JAK\/STAT3, MAPK, and PI3K\/Akt. Interestingly, although inactivation of STAT3 by PPARgamma agonists is in a PPARgamma-dependent manner, the molecular mechanism by which two structurally distinct PPARgamma agonists suppress IL-6-activated STAT3 shows the divergent interactions between PPARgamma and STAT3 including direct or SMRT-mediated association.","4031":"IL-4 secreting and nonsecreting cells from Th2 cultures have a similar probability of producing IL-4 upon subsequent stimulation, implying that there is stochastic element in IL-4 production by stimulated Th2 cells. Purified IL-4 producers and nonproducers have similar Gata3 and c-maf mRNA expression. Il4 gene accessibility, analyzed by restriction enzyme accessibility (REA) at sites in the promoter, in the second intron (DNase I hypersensitivity sites HSII and HSIII) and in CNS-1 in the two populations was also similar. However, upon TCR stimulation, site VA, which is 5 kB 3' of exon 4, displayed a striking increase in accessibility but REA was 2- to 3-fold greater in producers than nonproducers. Cyclosporin A treatment inhibited VA opening, implying the involvement of NFAT in increased VA accessibility. Induction of VA accessibility is sensitive to cycloheximide, suggesting an additional factor(s) is needed. Thus, opening of VA is a probabilistic event determining which Th2 cells transcribe Il4.","4032":"To establish whether the widely expressed regulator of Src family kinases Csk contributes to the control of acute inflammation in vivo, we inactivated csk in granulocytes by conditional mutagenesis (Cre\/loxP). Mutant mice (Csk-GEcre) developed acute multifocal inflammation in skin and lung. Animals were protected from the disease in a microbiologically controlled environment, but remained hypersensitive to LPS-induced shock. Csk-deficient granulocytes showed enhanced spontaneous and ligand-induced degranulation with hyperinduction of integrins. This hyperresponsiveness was associated with hyperadhesion and impaired migratory responses in vitro. Hyperphosphorylation of key signaling proteins such as Syk and Paxillin in mutant granulocytes further supported breakdown of the activation threshold set by Csk. By enforcing the need for ligand engagement Csk thus prevents premature granulocyte recruitment while supporting the motility of stimulated cells through negative regulation of cell adhesion.","4033":"A common feature of many infections is that many pathogen-specific memory T cells become established in diverse nonlymphoid tissues. A mechanism that promotes the retention and survival of the memory T cells in diverse tissues has not been described. Our studies show that the collagen binding alpha1beta1 integrin, VLA-1, is expressed by the majority of influenza-specific CD8 T cells recovered from nonlymphoid tissues during both the acute and memory phases of the response. Antibody treatment or genetic deficiency of VLA-1 decreased virus-specific CTL in the lung and other nonlymphoid tissues, and increased them in the spleen. In spite of the increase in the spleen, secondary heterosubtypic immunity against flu was compromised. This suggests that VLA-1 is responsible for retaining protective memory CD8 T cells in the lung and other tissues via attachment to the extracellular matrix.","4034":"To determine the importance of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) in the regulation of hematopoietic growth factor signaling generally, and of G-CSF-induced cellular responses specifically, we created mice in which the Socs3 gene was deleted in all hematopoietic cells. Although normal until young adulthood, these mice then developed neutrophilia and a spectrum of inflammatory pathologies. When stimulated with G-CSF in vitro, SOCS3-deficient cells of the neutrophilic granulocyte lineage exhibited prolonged STAT3 activation and enhanced cellular responses to G-CSF, including an increase in cloning frequency, survival, and proliferative capacity. Consistent with the in vitro findings, mutant mice injected with G-CSF displayed enhanced neutrophilia, progenitor cell mobilization, and splenomegaly, but unexpectedly also developed inflammatory neutrophil infiltration into multiple tissues and consequent hind-leg paresis. We conclude that SOCS3 is a key negative regulator of G-CSF signaling in myeloid cells and that this is of particular significance during G-CSF-driven emergency granulopoiesis.","4035":"The involvement of microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) in the function of mast cells, melanocytes, and osteoclasts has recently started to be investigated in depth. In a previous study, we found Hint to be associated with MITF in mast cells and showed that it suppresses MITF's transcriptional activity. Here, we have found that lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is also associated with MITF and forms a multicomplex with MITF and Hint. We have also shown that Ap4A, an endogenous molecule consisting of two adenosine linked by four phosphate which is known to be synthesized by LysRS, is accumulated intracellularily above 700 microM in IgE-Ag-activated mast cells, binds to Hint, liberates MITF, and thus leads to the activation of MITF-dependent gene expression. This implies that LysRS plays a key role via Ap4A as an important signaling molecule in MITF transcriptional activity.","4036":"Somatic hypermutation contributes to the generation of antibody diversity and is strongly associated with the maturation of antigen-specific immune responses. We asked whether somatic hypermutation also plays a role in the generation of the murine immunoglobulin repertoire during B cell development. To facilitate identification of somatic mutations, we examined mouse systems in which only antibodies expressing lambda1, lambda2, and lambdax light chains can be generated. Somatic mutations were found in cells, which, by surface markers, RAG expression, and rapid turnover, had the phenotype of immature B cells. In addition, expression of AID was detected in these cells. The mutations were limited to V regions and were localized in known hotspots. Mutation frequency was not diminished in the absence of T cells. Our results support the idea that somatic hypermutation can occur in murine immature B cells and may represent a mechanism for enlarging the V gene repertoire.","4037":"The alloimmune response can be divided into specific junctures where critical decisions between tolerance and immunity are made which define the outcome of the transplant. At these \"decision nodes\" various cytokines direct alloresponsive T cells to develop either a proinflammatory response aimed at graft destruction or an immunoregulatory response facilitating graft acceptance. This review will focus on the role of these cytokines in influencing the progression of an alloimmune response leading ultimately to either allograft survival or rejection.","4038":"One or more members of the HIT (histidine triad) family of proteins is encoded in the genomes of diverse species, ranging from prokaryotes to humans. However, the precise cellular and biochemical functions of many of these proteins are largely enigmatic. Therefore, the paper by Lee et al. in this issue of Immunity that ascribes a role for the histidine triad protein HINT (also designated HINT1) in regulating the activity of the microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) is of great interest. Furthermore, this study implicates a role for an exotic endogenous nucleotide Ap4A in this process. This naturally occurring compound consists of two adenosines linked by four phosphate residues, and has been proposed as an intracellular and extracellular signaling molecule.","4039":"Regulatory T cells play an important role in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance by suppressing immune responses against autoimmune diseases and cancer. Little is known, however, about the nature of the physiological target antigens for CD4(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here we report the identification of the LAGE1 protein as a ligand for tumor-specific CD4(+) Treg cell clones generated from the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of cancer patients. Phenotypic and functional analyses demonstrated that they were antigen-specific CD4(+) Treg cells expressing CD25 and GITR molecules and possessing suppressive activity on the proliferative response of naive CD4(+) T cells to anti-CD3 antibody stimulation. Ligand-specific activation and cell-cell contact were required for TIL102 Treg cells to exert suppressive activity on CD4(+) effector cells. These findings suggest that the presence of tumor-specific CD4(+) Treg cells at tumor sites may have a profound effect on the inhibition of T cell responses against cancer.","4040":"Microbial heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been implicated in the induction of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. We now show that human dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with peptide-loaded mycobacterial HSP70 complexes generate potent antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses, which are dependent on an HSP70-stimulated calcium signaling cascade. From the calculated peptide binding affinity of mycobacterial HSP70 (K(D) = 14 microM) we show that 120 pM HSP70 bound peptide is sufficient to generate a peptide-specific CTL response that is up to four orders of magnitude more efficient than peptide alone. The minimal 136 amino acid, mycobacterial HSP70 peptide binding domain can generate CTL responses, and a single amino acid mutant HSP70 designed to prevent peptide binding but retain stimulatory capacity has allowed us to separate antigen delivery from DC immunostimulation.","4041":"Single-cell transplantation analysis revealed that the cells that had the strongest dye efflux activity (\"Tip\"-SP cells) and had the phenotype CD34- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ Lin- (CD34- KSL cells) exhibited very strong proliferation and multilineage differentiation capacity. Ninety-six percent of the lethally irradiated mice that received a single \"Tip\"-SP CD34- KSL cell showed significant donor cell engraftment for long term. These findings support the hypothesis that \"Tip\"-SP CD34- KSL cells represent the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells that are capable of migrating into the primary site and surviving and\/or proliferating with nearly absolute efficiency. This led us to propose high marrow-seeding efficiency as a specific characteristic of primitive HSCs, in addition to their self-renewal and multipotent capacity.","4042":"The immune evasion protein US3 of human cytomegalovirus binds to and arrests MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, substantial amounts of class I molecules still escape US3-mediated ER retention, suggesting that not all class I alleles are affected equally by US3. Here, we identify tapasin inhibition as the mechanism of MHC retention by US3. US3 directly binds tapasin and inhibits tapasin-dependent peptide loading, thereby preventing the optimization of the peptide repertoire presented by class I molecules. Due to the allelic specificity of tapasin toward class I molecules, US3 affects only class I alleles that are dependent on tapasin for peptide loading and surface expression. Accordingly, tapasin-independent class I alleles selectively escape to the cell surface.","4043":"The physiological benefit of the febrile response is poorly understood. Here we show that fever-range thermal stress enhances the function of the L-selectin lymphocyte homing receptor through an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent signaling mechanism. Thermal stimulation of L-selectin adhesion in vitro and in vivo is mediated by engagement of the gp130 signal-transducing chain by IL-6 and a soluble form of the IL-6 receptor-alpha (sIL-6Ralpha) binding subunit. Thermal control of adhesion is maintained in IL-6-deficient mice through a gp130-dependent compensatory mechanism mediated by IL-6-related cytokines (i.e., oncostatin M [OSM], leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], and IL-11). Combined biochemical and pharmacological inhibitor (PD98059, U0126, SB203580, SP600125) approaches positioned MEK1\/ERK1-2, but not p38 MAPK or JNK, in the IL-6\/sIL-6Ralpha signaling pathway upstream of activation of L-selectin\/cytoskeletal interactions and L-selectin avidity\/affinity. These results highlight a role for gp130-linked IL-6\/sIL-6Ralpha transsignaling in amplifying lymphocyte trafficking during febrile inflammatory responses.","4044":"A potential shortcoming of nonlive vaccines is their relative inefficiency in generating T cell responses, thus limiting their application in infections requiring cellular immunity. Here, we present a system to induce cellular immunity and to study the immunological implications of time-delayed dendritic cell (DC) apoptosis and antigen reprocessing in vivo. We generated a self-replicating cytopathic pestivirus RNA to enhance production and presentation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigens and to induce apoptosis in DC 24-48 hr after transfection. Replicon-transfected H-2(b) DCs used to immunize HLA-A2 transgenic mice induced protection upon challenge with a vaccinia virus expressing HCV antigens. Induction of cell death enhanced the immunogenicity of DC-associated antigen. Transfer of cellular material from vaccine DCs to endogenous antigen presenting cells was visualized in lymph nodes and spleen, and crossprimed CD8(+) T cells were characterized. The findings are relevant for the rational design of vaccines against noncytopathic pathogens like HCV.","4045":"T cells play a central role in the recognition and elimination of foreign pathogens. Signals through the T cell receptor (TCR) control the extent and duration of the T cell response. To ensure that T cells are not inappropriately activated, signaling pathways downstream of the TCR are subject to multiple levels of positive and negative regulation. Herein, we describe two related proteins, Sts-1 and Sts-2, that negatively regulate TCR signaling. T cells from mice lacking Sts-1 and Sts-2 are hyperresponsive to TCR stimulation. The phenotype is accompanied by increased Zap-70 phosphorylation and activation, including its ubiquitinylated forms. Additionally, hyperactivation of signaling proteins downstream of the TCR, a marked increase in cytokine production by Sts1\/2(-\/-) T cells, and increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis is observed. Therefore, Sts-1 and Sts-2 are critical regulators of the signaling pathways that regulate T cell activation.","4046":"Chemokines regulate rapid leukocyte adhesion by triggering a complex modality of integrin activation. We show that the small GTPase RhoA and the atypical zeta PKC differently control lymphocyte LFA-1 high-affinity state and rapid lateral mobility induced by chemokines. Activation of LFA-1 high-affinity state and lateral mobility is controlled by RhoA through the activity of distinct effector regions, demonstrating that RhoA is a central point of diversification of signaling pathways leading to both modalities of LFA-1 triggering. In contrast, zeta PKC controls LFA-1 lateral mobility but not affinity triggering. Blockade of the 23-40 RhoA effector region prevents induction of LFA-1 high-affinity state as well as lymphocyte arrest in Peyer's patch high endothelial venules. Thus, RhoA controls the induction of LFA-1 high-affinity state by chemokines independently of zeta PKC, and this is critical to support chemokine-regulated homing of circulating lymphocytes.","4047":"A recent workshop on \"Dendritic Cells: Biology and Therapeutic Applications,\" sponsored by the Juan March Foundation, brought together basic and clinical research scientists to discuss the mechanisms underlying the control of immune responses and tolerance by dendritic cells (DCs), as well as recent research in cancer immunotherapy based on DC vaccination. Particular emphasis was placed on antigen processing and presentation by DCs, C-type lectin antigen receptors, DC maturation and polarization of T cell responses, the control of immunity versus tolerance by DCs, the developmental origin of DCs, and the use of DCs in cancer immunotherapy.","4048":"Virus-specific memory T cell populations demonstrate plasticity in antigenic and functional phenotype, in recognition of antigen, and in their ability to accommodate new memory T cell populations. The adaptability of complex antigen-specific T cell repertoires allows the host to respond to a diverse array of pathogens and accommodate memory pools to many pathogens in a finite immune system. This is in part accounted for by crossreactive memory T cells, which can be employed in immune responses and mediate protective immunity or life-threatening immunopathology.","4049":"The molecular consequence of the fever response has been illuminated by a recent study showing that a temperature shift to 40 degrees C resulted in increased leukocyte adhesion to tissue sections, which was mediated by L-selectin activation in lymphocytes. This L-selectin activation during heat responses was dependent on IL-6 trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6R.","4050":"By combining cell surface staining with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and Hoechst 33342 dye supravital staining, Matsuzaki et al. have succeeded in enriching hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) essentially to homogeneity. When single-cell transplantation analysis was performed using the isolated cells, over 95% of the recipient mice showed long-term multilineage engraftment. The work demonstrates unexpectedly high marrow seeding efficiency of HSCs and proposes high marrow homing capacity as a new criterion for HSCs.","4051":"The signals that control decisions of progenitor commitment involve the interplay of both cytokines and transcription factors. Flt3L has emerged as a potential regulator of dendritic cell (DC) development, but regulation of HSC commitment to the DC lineage remains poorly understood. Our central finding is the identification of STAT3 activation as a checkpoint of Flt3L-regulated DC development. Deletion of STAT3 caused profound deficiency in the DC compartment and abrogated Flt3L effects on DC development. DC derivation by Flt3L revealed a normal HSC pool, a 2- to 3-fold accumulation of CLP\/CMP, but absence of common DC precursors as well as their DC progeny in STAT3-deficient mice. The formation of CMP and CLP represents the first decisive lineage commitment step, and in this regard we provide evidence that commitments of CLP\/CMP to the DC lineage strictly depend on the interplay of both Flt3L and STAT3 activation.","4052":"Microbial infections induce chemokine and cytokine cascades that coordinate innate immune defenses. Infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes induces CCR2-dependent monocyte recruitment and activation, an essential response for host survival. Herein we show that invasive L. monocytogenes, but not killed or noninvasive bacteria, induce secretion of MCP-1, the requisite chemokine for monocyte recruitment. Induction of MCP-1, but not TNF or IL-12, following L. monocytogenes infection is MyD88 independent. Consistent with these results, MyD88 deficiency does not impair monocyte recruitment to L. monocytogenes infected spleens, but prevents monocyte activation. Our results indicate that distinct microbial signals activate innate immune responses in an ordered, step-wise fashion, providing a mechanism to specify and modulate antimicrobial effector functions.","4053":"We report that disruption of CD154 in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice abrogates the helper function of CD4+CD25- T cells without impairing the regulatory activity of CD4+CD25+ T cells. Whereas CD4+ T cells from NOD mice enhanced a diabetogenic CD8+ T cell response in monoclonal TCR-transgenic NOD mice, CD4+ T cells from NOD.CD154(-\/-) mice actively suppressed it. Suppression was mediated by regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells capable of inhibiting CD8+ T cell responses induced by peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), but not peptide\/MHC monomers. It involved inhibition of DC maturation, did not occur in the presence of CD154+ T-helper cells, and could be inhibited by activation of DCs with LPS, CpG DNA, or an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb. Thus, in at least some genetic backgrounds, CD154-CD40 interactions and innate stimuli release immature DCs from suppression by CD4+CD25+ T cells.","4054":"The transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed at every stage of thymic development, but its role in thymocyte differentiation is unknown. The fact that RAG chimeric animals lacking GATA-3 cannot generate early thymocytes from common lymphoid progenitors has thus far precluded investigation of the function of GATA-3 in the thymus. To address this, we generated mice deficient in GATA-3 at early and late stages of thymic differentiation. Our studies revealed that GATA-3 is involved in beta selection and is indispensable for single-positive CD4 thymocyte development. Thus, our data demonstrate that the coordinated and regulated expression of GATA-3 at each stage of thymic development is critical for the generation of mature T cells.","4055":"Autoimmune associated bone disease and intestinal inflammation are closely linked with deregulation and hyperactivation of autoreactive CD4 T cells. How these T cells are activated and mediate disease is not clear. Here we show that in the Interleukin 2-deficient mouse model of autoimmunity spontaneous osteopenia and colitis are caused by increased production of the ligand for receptor activator of NFkappaB (RANKL). RANKL acting via its receptor, receptor activator of NFkappaB (RANK), increases bone turnover and promotes intestinal dendritic cell (DC) survival in vivo. Modulation of RANKL-RANK interactions with exogenous recombinant osteoprotegerin (Fc-OPG) reverses skeletal abnormalities and reduces colitis by decreasing colonic DC numbers. This study identifies a common causal link between bone disease and intestinal inflammation and establishes the importance of DC in mediating colonic inflammation in vivo.","4056":"The proliferative response of autoreactive rheumatoid factor (RF) B cells to mammalian chromatin-containing immune complexes (ICs) results from the sequential engagement of the B cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). We have used ICs constructed from anti-hapten antibodies and defined haptenated dsDNA fragments to determine the form of mammalian DNA that mediates this process. Despite their relatively low abundance in mammalian DNA, we found that inclusion of hypomethylated CpG motifs in these ICs was necessary for effective activation. In the absence of antibody, the same fragments could efficiently stimulate low-affinity hapten-specific and DNA-reactive 3H9 B cells, but not RF B cells. These results extend the BCR\/TLR9 coengagement paradigm to a second major class of autoreactive B cells, further confirm the critical role of the BCR in chromatin ligand delivery to TLR9, and implicate hypomethylated CpG motifs as ligand elements necessary for the initiation of systemic autoimmune disease.","4057":"CD40(-\/-) mice succumbed to low-dose aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis due to deficient IL-12 production leading to impaired priming of IFN-gamma T cell responses. In contrast, CD40L(-\/-) mice were resistant to M. tuberculosis. This asymmetry in outcome of infection between the two knockout strains is likely due to the existence of an alternative ligand for CD40. Both in vitro M. tuberculosis infection and recombinant M. tuberculosis Hsp70 elicited IL-12 production from WT dendritic cells. This response was absent in both CD40(-\/-) dendritic cells and CD40(-\/-) mice, suggesting that M. tuberculosis Hsp70 serves as an alternative ligand for CD40 in vivo.","4058":"Factors involved in pregnancy failure due to abnormal fetomaternal tolerance are poorly understood. Here we describe distinct defects in placenta formation and subsequent pregnancy loss solely dependent on the activation of the complement alternative pathway and the effector mechanisms provided by the maternal C3. Surprisingly, this effect is independent of other complement activation pathways and of the effector mechanisms provided by other complement components. These findings provide significant insight into the role of the innate immune system in human pregnancy failure, a frequent clinical outcome.","4059":"The homodimeric immunoreceptor NKG2D drives the activation of effector cells following engagement of diverse, conditionally expressed MHC class I-like protein ligands. NKG2D recognition is highly degenerate in that a single surface on receptor monomers binds pairs of distinct surfaces on each structurally divergent ligand, simultaneously accommodating multiple nonconservative ligand allelic or isoform substitutions. In contrast to TCR-pMHC and other NK receptor-ligand interactions, thermodynamic and kinetic analyses of four NKG2D-ligand pairs (MIC-A*001, MIC-B*005, ULBP1, and RAE-1beta) reported here show that the relative enthalpic and entropic terms, heat capacity, association rates, and activation energy barriers are comparable to typical, rigid protein-protein interactions. Rather than \"induced-fit\" binding, NKG2D degeneracy is achieved using distinct interaction mechanisms at each rigid interface.","4060":"Stat1 is phosphorylated on serine 727 within its transactivating domain (TAD) in response to interferons or other immunological signals. We generated gene-targeted mutant mice expressing a serine727-alanine mutant of Stat1. These animals showed increased mortality upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes and impaired clearance of the bacteria from spleen and liver. The Stat1S727A mice were more resistant to the LPS-induced septic shock syndrome, suggesting that Stat1 serine phosphorylation promotes inflammatory responses. Expression of IFN-gamma-induced genes was strongly reduced in macrophages expressing Stat1(S727A). While mutation of Stat1 at S727 did not reduce its binding to chromatin, association with the coactivator CBP and histone acetylation at the interferon-responsive GBP promoter was strongly reduced, suggesting defective recruitment of histone acetylases as the mechanism underlying IFN-gamma hyporesponsiveness. Our data demonstrate that the increase in transcription factor activity caused by Stat serine phosphorylation contributes to macrophage activation and to IFN-gamma-dependent immune responses in vivo.","4061":"Notch proteins are used repeatedly to direct developmental cell fate decisions in multiple organs. During hematopoiesis and immune development, Notch is critical for T\/B lineage specification and for generation of splenic marginal zone B cells. In early embryonic development, Notch is crucial for generating hematopoietic stem cells. Emerging data suggest that Notch may also modulate the differentiation and activity of peripheral T cells. Understanding the specific regulation of the Notch pathway in different contexts and its interaction with other signaling pathways remains an important challenge to comprehend the full spectrum of Notch effects. In this review, we critically assess recent findings regarding the function of Notch in the hematolymphoid system.","4062":"Expression of genes in the right place at the right time is fundamental to all of life. The ontogeny of effector and memory T cells is a robust example of this important principle. Although lymphocytes represent a late addition in animal evolution, they are serving as an exceptional model system to unlock the mysteries surrounding the way in which the genome is animated. It will be speculated here that further insight into fundamental principles of genome function may arise from study of immunity. Likewise, such information may be key to understanding and altering immunobiology.","4063":"Recognition of MHC and MHC-like molecules by both natural killer (NK) and T cell receptors (TCR) reveals remarkable degeneracy. The interaction of the NKG2D NK receptor with several MHC I-like ligands has now been analyzed thermodynamically by McFarland and Strong, who suggest that a \"rigid adaptation\" mechanism governs such crossreactivity. This contrasts with \"induced fit\" that accounts for TCR adaptation to multiple MHCp ligands.","4064":"A powerful weapon is critical to a soldier when battling with a strong enemy. In this issue of Immunity, Varinou et al. suggest that serine phosphorylation of Stat1, an important signal transducer and activator of transcription in interferon (IFN) signaling, is required for Stat1 to fight against a highly pathogenic infection.","4065":"While the contribution of intracellular adaptor proteins to lymphocyte activation has been well studied, the function of these molecules in innate immune effector cells such as neutrophils has not been extensively addressed. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the adaptor molecule SH2 domain-containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) in FcgammaR and integrin signaling. Stimulation of these receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoplasmic relocalization of SLP-76 in freshly isolated murine neutrophils. Neutrophils lacking SLP-76 demonstrate decreased FcgammaR-induced calcium flux and reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production in response to immune complex stimulation. More dramatically, SLP-76-\/- neutrophils fail to produce ROI, spread, or activate critical downstream regulators in response to integrin ligation. These results provide genetic evidence for a critical role of SLP-76 in the regulation of neutrophil function.","4066":"The translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) involving MALT1 is the most common chromosomal abnormality in lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Although the paracaspase MALT1 can bind to BCL10, the physiological function of MALT1 is unknown. Using mouse models, we show that Malt1 is essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and IL-2 production in response to TCR ligation and strictly required for signal-specific NF-kappaB activation induced by the TCR but not TNF-alpha or IL-1 signaling. Malt1 operates downstream of Bcl10, controls the catalytic activity of the canonical IKK complex, and regulates the signaling of Jnk and p38 MAP kinases. In contrast to Bcl10 disruption, however, inactivation of Malt1 has only mild effects on B cell activation and does not cause defects during neurodevelopment. Thus, Malt1 is an essential regulator of Bcl10 signaling that is differentially required depending on cellular context.","4067":"Upon TCR engagement, naive CD4 T cells differentiate toward the Th1 or Th2 phenotype. IL-4, acting through Stat6, plays a major role in Th2 differentiation; IL-2 has also been reported to be essential. Here, we report that retroviral (RV)-mediated expression of a constitutively active Stat5A mutant (STAT5A1*6) can fully restore IL-4 production when naive CD4 T cells are primed in the absence of IL-2. Furthermore, STAT5A1*6 expression causes Th2 differentiation in the absence of IL-4 or in Stat6- or IL-4Ralpha-deficient cells. Infection with STAT5A1*6-NGFR-RV does not enhance GATA-3 expression. STAT5A1*6-NGFR-RV and GATA-3-GFP-RV each render the Il4 gene accessible, but the sites of restriction enzyme accessibility are different. Stat5A binds to HSII and HSIII sites of the Il4 gene. Coinfection with STAT5A1*6-NGFR-RV and GATA-3-GFP-RV results in optimal Th2 priming.","4068":"IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) is required for NF-kappaB activation and suppression of TNFalpha-mediated liver apoptosis. To investigate how IKKbeta suppresses apoptosis, we generated hepatocyte-specific Ikkbeta knockout mice, Ikkbeta(Deltahep), which exhibit little residual NF- kappaB activity but are healthy with normal liver function. Unexpectedly, Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice are slightly more sensitive than controls to LPS-induced liver apoptosis but are highly susceptible to liver destruction following concanavalin A (ConA)-induced T cell activation. Unlike LPS, a potent inducer of circulating TNFalpha, ConA exerts cytotoxic effects through cell-bound TNFalpha, which activates type 1 and 2 TNF receptors (TNFR). While TNFR2 does not contribute to NF-kappaB activation, it is important for ConA-induced JNK activation, which is augmented by the absence of IKKbeta. Using JNK-deficient mice we show that JNK is required for ConA-induced liver damage. Thus, the antiapoptotic function of IKKbeta, which is most critical in situations that involve cell-bound TNFalpha, is mediated partially through attenuation of JNK activity.","4069":"L-selectin mediates lymphocyte migration to peripheral lymph nodes and leukocyte rolling on vascular endothelium during inflammation. One unique feature that distinguishes L-selectin from other adhesion molecules is that it is rapidly cleaved from the cell surface after cellular activation. The biological significance of L-selectin endoproteolytic release was determined by generating gene-targeted mice expressing a modified receptor that was not cleaved from the cell surface. Blocking L-selectin cleavage on antigen-stimulated lymphocytes allowed their continued migration to peripheral lymph nodes and inhibited their short-term redirection to the spleen. Blocking homeostatic L-selectin cleavage also resulted in a constitutive 2-fold increase in overall L-selectin expression by leukocytes. As a result, neutrophils entered the inflamed peritoneum in greater numbers or for a longer duration. Thus, endoproteolytic cleavage regulates both homeostatic and activation-induced changes in cell surface L-selectin density, which directs the migration patterns of activated lymphocytes and neutrophils in vivo.","4070":"The GATA-3 transcription factor has a determinant role in T cell specification and is an essential mediator of T helper 2-type polarized immune responses. While both committed NK precursors and mature NK cells express GATA-3, a role of this transcription factor in murine NK cell differentiation is not known. We found that NK cells, in contrast to T cells, can be generated in the absence of GATA-3. However, while GATA-3 antagonizes IFN-gamma production in differentiating T cells, GATA-3-deficient NK cells paradoxically produced less IFN-gamma compared to control NK cells and failed to provide early protection in vivo against infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Surprisingly, GATA-3 was essential for NK cell homing to the liver. Our results suggest that GATA-3 promotes NK cell maturation and acts in this lineage to specify distinct effector phenotypes.","4071":"Single cell PCR studies showed that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) express a variety of lineage-affiliated genes. However, it remains unclear whether these cells exhibiting \"lineage priming\" represent bona fide stem cells or a subpopulation earmarked for differentiation. Here we have used a Cre-Lox approach to follow the fate of cells expressing a lineage-affiliated marker. We crossed lysozyme Cre mice with yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) reporter mice and found EYFP gene expression not only in myelomonocytic cells but also in a fraction of HSCs as well as B cells and T cells. Transplantation of EYFP+ HSCs into primary and secondary recipients generated mice in which all hematopoietic cells were EYFP+. In contrast, crosses between CD19 Cre and lck Cre mice with reporter mice showed no EYFP expression in HSCs or intermediate progenitors. Our results demonstrate that lysozyme expression does not mark myeloid commitment and that long-term repopulation potential is maintained in primed HSCs.","4072":"Therapies that neutralize the function of TNF-alpha suppress rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but not osteoarthritis (OA). We show that patients suffering from RA but not OA have significant levels of autoantibodies directed to TNF-alpha. Thus, the immune system can selectively generate autoimmunity to proinflammatory mediators when such a response is beneficial for the host. A well-defined model of RA was used to elaborate the contribution of beneficial autoimmunity to the regulation of disease. We show that during the disease autoantibody production is elicited against few inflammatory, but not regulatory, mediators. Selective amplification of these beneficial antibodies by targeted DNA vaccines provided protective immunity. Epitope mapping revealed that anti-TNF-alpha immunity is highly restricted and excretes no crossreactivity to other known gene products. Its selective exclusion substantially exacerbated the disease. Administration of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies could then override this aggravation. This substantiates the significance of beneficial autoimmunity in restraining self-destructive immunity.","4073":"Intracellular signaling by most cell surface receptors requires the generation of two major second messengers, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5-P3) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). The enzymes that produce these second messengers, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC), utilize a common substrate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2). Until now, it has not been clear whether de novo PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis is necessary for PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 and IP3 production. Here we show that BTK, a member of the Tec family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, associates with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks), the enzymes that synthesize PtdIns-4,5-P2. Upon B cell receptor activation, BTK brings PIP5K to the plasma membrane as a means of generating local PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis. This enzyme-enzyme interaction provides a shuttling mechanism that allows BTK to stimulate the production of the substrate required by both its upstream activator, PI3K, and its downstream target, PLC-gamma2.","4074":"WSX-1 is a class I cytokine receptor with homology to the IL-12 receptors and is essential for resistance to Leishmania major infection. In the present study, we demonstrated that WSX-1 was also required for resistance to Trypanosoma cruzi. WSX-1-\/- mice exhibited prolonged parasitemia, severe liver injury, and increased mortality over wild-type mice. WSX-1-\/- splenocytes produced enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines, which were responsible for the prolonged parasitemia. Massive necroinflammatory lesions were observed in the liver of infected WSX-1-\/- mice, and IFN-gamma that was overproduced in WSX-1-\/- mice compared with wild-type mice was responsible for the lesions. In addition, vast amounts of various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, were produced by liver mononuclear cells in WSX-1-\/- mice. Thus, during T. cruzi infection, WSX-1 suppresses liver injury by regulating production of proinflammatory cytokines, while controlling parasitemia by suppression of Th2 responses, demonstrating its novel role as an inhibitory regulator of cytokine production.","4075":"Although recent studies have described IL-27 and its receptor, WSX-1, as promoters of Th1 differentiation in naive CD4+ T cells, the data presented here indicate that signaling through this receptor is involved in limiting the intensity and duration of T cell activity. When WSX-1-deficient mice are infected with the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii, they establish protective T cell responses, characterized by production of inflammatory cytokines and control of parasite replication. However, infected WSX-1-\/- mice are unable to downregulate these protective responses, and develop a lethal, T cell-mediated inflammatory disease. This pathology was characterized by the excessive production of IFN-gamma, persistence of highly activated T cells, and enhanced T cell proliferation in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate that WSX-1 is not required for the generation of IFN-gamma-mediated immunity to this parasitic infection and identify a novel function for this receptor as a potent antagonist of T cell-mediated, immune hyperactivity.","4076":"Originally the only known heterodimeric cytokine, IL-12 is now part of a family of five cytokines and shares important functions in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity with two of them, IL-23 and IL-27. Although initially these three cytokines were considered to have largely overlapping immunological functions, more recent studies, including two articles in this issue of Immunity (Hamano et al., 2003; Villarino et al., 2003), indicate that they mediate complex and well-differentiated functions.","4077":"Adaptor proteins act as conduits to channel upstream signals into downstream effector branches. Two B cell-associated adaptors, Bam32 and Carma1, regulate the ERK, JNK, and NF-kappaB branches of the BCR signaling pathway. Recent studies of Bam32-\/- and Carma1-\/- mice suggest that each adaptor controls a distinct conduit regulating either only proliferation (Bam32) or both the proliferation and survival of B cells (Carma1).","4078":"The Tec kinase Btk is an important regulator of antigen receptor activation of phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-gamma). Data from Carpenter and colleagues (Saito et al., this issue of Immunity) now suggest that Btk also activates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), thereby stimulating a positive feedback loop that generates PI(4,5)P2, the substrate for both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and PLC-gamma.","4079":"Markers of multiple hematopoietic lineages are expressed in multipotent progenitors, a phenomenon referred to as \"lineage priming.\" A new study in this issue of Immunity provides compelling evidence that such \"promiscuous\" gene expression occurs in hematopoietic stem cells and does not interfere with their long-term repopulation potential.","4080":"Bam32 is an adaptor protein recruited to the plasma membrane upon B cell receptor (BCR) crosslinking in a phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner; however, its physiologic function is unclear. To determine its physiologic function, we produced Bam32-deficient mice. Bam32(-\/-) B cells develop normally but have impaired T-independent antibody responses in vivo and diminished responses to BCR crosslinking in vitro. Biochemical analysis revealed that Bam32 acts in a novel pathway leading from the BCR to MAPK\/ERK Kinases (MEK1\/2), MAPK\/ERK Kinase Kinase-1 (MEKK1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). This pathway appears to be initiated by hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1 (HPK1), which interacts directly with Bam32, and differs from all previously characterized BCR signaling pathways in that it is required for normal BCR-mediated proliferation but not for B cell survival.","4081":"Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor able to drive the terminal differentiation of B cells into Ig-secreting plasma cells. We have created mice with a B cell-specific deletion of prdm1, the gene encoding Blimp-1. B cell development and the number of B cells responding to antigen appear to be normal in these mice. However, in response to either TD or TI antigen, serum Ig, short-lived plasma cells, post-GC plasma cells, and plasma cells in a memory response are virtually absent, demonstrating that Blimp-1 is required for plasmacytic differentiation and Ig secretion. In the absence of Blimp-1, CD79b(+)B220(-) pre-plasma memory B cell development is also defective, providing evidence that this subset is an intermediate in plasma cell development. B cells lacking Blimp-1 cannot secrete Ig or induce muS mRNA when stimulated ex vivo. Furthermore, although prdm1-\/- B cells fail to induce XBP-1, XBP-1 cannot rescue plasmacytic differentiation without Blimp-1.","4082":"T cell receptors (TCR) adopt a similar orientation when binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, yet the biological mechanism that generates this similar TCR orientation remains obscure. We show here the cocrystallographic structure of a mouse TCR bound to a human MHC molecule not seen by the TCR during thymic development. The orientation of this xenoreactive murine TCR atop human MHC deviates from the typical orientation more than any previously determined TCR\/MHC structure. This unique orientation is solely due to the placement of the TCR Valpha domain on the MHC. In light of new information provided by this structure, we have reanalyzed the existing TCR\/MHC cocrystal structures and discovered unique features of TCR Valpha domain position on class I MHC that correlate with CD8 dependence. Finally, we propose that the orientation seen in TCR recognition of MHC is a consequence of selection during T cell development.","4083":"In this study we provide evidence that the SDF-1alpha\/CXCR4 chemokine axis is involved in both the retention of neutrophils within the bone marrow and the homing of senescent neutrophils back to the bone marrow. We show that the functional responses of freshly isolated human and murine neutrophils to CXCR2 chemokines are significantly attenuated by SDF-1alpha, acting via CXCR4. As a consequence, the mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow in vivo by the CXCR2-chemokine, KC, was dramatically enhanced by blocking the effects of endogenous SDF-1alpha using a specific CXCR4 antagonist. As neutrophils age, they upregulate expression of CXCR4 and acquire the ability to migrate toward SDF-1alpha. We show here that these senescent CXCR4(high) neutrophils preferentially home to the bone marrow in vivo in a CXCR4-dependent manner, suggesting a previously undefined mechanism for the clearance of senescent neutrophils from the circulation.","4084":"T cells express a toxin-related ADP-ribosylating ectoenzyme, ART2. Exposure of mature T cells to NAD, the substrate for ADP-ribosylation, induces cell death. ART2-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation activates the cytolytic P2X7 purinoceptor, causing calcium flux, pore formation, phosphatidylserine exposure, shedding of CD62L, cell shrinkage, and propidium iodide uptake. Interestingly, much lower NAD than ATP concentrations are required to activate P2X7. NAD-induced cell death (NICD) operates with endogenous sources of NAD released upon cell lysis. These findings identify P2X7 as a key effector of NICD and demonstrate that P2X7 can be activated by an endogenous ligand other than ATP. Our results delineate an alternative mechanism for inducing T cell death and set an interesting precedent for immunoregulation via crosstalk between NAD-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferases and purinoceptors.","4085":"Conserved molecular patterns derived from pathogenic microorganisms prime antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) to induce adaptive T cell responses. In contrast, virus-infected or tumor cells that express low levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I activate natural killer (NK) cells for direct killing. It is unknown whether NK cell recognition of MHC class I(low) targets can also induce adaptive T cell responses. Here, we show that MHC class I(low) targets initiate a cascade of immune responses, starting with the immediate activation of NK cells. The activated NK cells then prime DC to produce IL-12 and to induce highly protective CD8 T cell memory responses. Therefore, sensing of MHC class I(low) targets by NK cells can link innate and adaptive immunity to induce protective T cell responses and may alarm the immune system during early infection with noncytopathic viruses.","4086":"Following activation by antigen, naive CD4+ T helper precursor cells execute distinct genetic programs that result in their differentiation toward the type 1 or type 2 helper T cell (Th1 or Th2) phenotype. Although the differentiation and function of these Th subsets has been well studied, little is known about the contribution to these differentiation events of cell surface receptors other than those for soluble cytokines, such as IL-12 or IL-4. Here, we provide direct evidence that the Delta1 interaction with Notch3 on CD4+ T cells transduces signals, promoting development toward the Th1 phenotype. The positive role of Notch signaling in effector cell differentiation was dose dependent, with high levels of stimulation resulting in reduced T cell activation. Our data revealed a clear contribution of Notch pathways to Th1 versus Th2 fate decisions, while also providing insight into another mechanism for inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation.","4087":"Effector CD4+ T cells rapidly activate high-level cytokine expression following TCR stimulation. Consistent with accelerated protein production in these cells, global mRNA profiles revealed that, after cytokines, the most impressive cluster of activated genes encode rRNA-maturation factors. Activation of these genes was ERK-MAPK dependent, accompanied by increased rRNA transcription and faster maturation kinetics, and much greater in effector CD4+ T cells than in naive cells. Ribosomal protein subunit (RPS) synthesis was also ERK-MAPK dependent and increased to match rRNA production, but without evident increase in RPS mRNA. Instead, stimulation promoted polysome loading of RPS mRNA via cis-acting, 5'-terminal oligopyrimidines. These results demonstrate how, in response to extracellular signals, effector CD4+ T cells coordinately increase multiple ribosomal components to accommodate burgeoning cytokine production.","4088":"Endoglin, an ancillary TGF-beta receptor, is differentially expressed in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSC). Here, we describe simple and highly efficient purification schemes for mouse bone marrow LTR-HSCs using Endoglin as a marker. The Endoglin positive and Sca-1 positive (Endo(Pos) Sca-1(Pos)) population, which contains about 36% of \"Side Population\" (SP) cells, is highly enriched for LTR-HSCs. In long-term competitive reconstitution assays, 100 such cells reconstituted all lethally irradiated recipients. Interestingly, the Endo(Pos) Sca-1(Pos) population contains comparable LTR-HSC activity in both SP and non-SP fractions, indicating that many HSCs are not captured by the SP phenotype. Furthermore, LTR-HSCs are exclusively found in the Endo(Pos) Sca-1(Pos) Lin(Neg\/Low) (lineage negative\/low), but not in the Endo(Neg) Sca-1(Pos) Lin(Neg\/Low) population, suggesting that the Endo(Pos) population may contain all LTR-HSCs in mouse bone marrow. Finally, we demonstrated that the Endo(Pos) Sca-1(Pos) Rh(Low) (Rhodamine-123 low) phenotype, without using CD34, c-Kit, or Lineage markers, defines a nearly homogenous population of LTR-HSCs.","4089":"Deficiencies of the Msh2 protein or the Smu tandem repeat (SmuTR) sequences each reduce isotype switching in mice by about 2- to 3-fold. We find that switching in mice deficient for both Msh2 and SmuTR is nearly ablated. We propose that the SmuTR provides closely spaced cleavage sites that can undergo switch recombination independent of Msh2, whereas cleavages in sequences flanking the SmuTR require Msh2 processing to allow recombinational joining. We also find that changes in Smu sequences alter the focus of switch junctions within Sgamma sequences, indicating that sequences of switch regions act together in the choice of switch recombination junctions. These findings help to explain the conservation of tandemly repeated switch regions associated with heavy chain constant genes in species capable of switching.","4090":"Therapeutic application of broadly reactive anti-T cell antibodies can lead not only to potent immunosuppression but also to profound and long-lived T cell depletion. We reasoned that a strategy that almost exclusively targets activated cytopathic donor reactive T cells and spares immunoregulatory networks might prove to be an exceptionally potent and highly selective means of producing long-term engraftment and tolerance. Herein we show that the combined administration of rapamycin and agonist IL-2- and antagonist IL-15-related cytolytic fusion proteins provides for long-term engraftment\/tolerance in exceptionally stringent allotransplant models by (1) limiting the early expansion of activated T cells, (2) preserving and even exaggerating their subsequent apoptotic clearance, and (3) further amplifying the depletion of these activated T cells by antibody-dependent mechanisms, while (4) preserving CD4+CD25+ T cell-dependent immunoregulatory networks.","4091":"Protein kinase D (PKD) is an antigen receptor-activated serine kinase localized at either the plasma membrane or the cytosol of lymphocytes. To probe PKD function at these different locations, transgenesis was used to target active PKD either to the membrane or cytosol of pre-T cells. In recombinase gene null pre-T cells, membrane and cytosolic active PKD both induced differentiation reminiscent of beta selection: downregulation of CD25 and upregulation of CD2 and CD5. Active PKDs also induced pre-T cell proliferation, although this response was not universal to all thymocyte subsets. There were two striking differences between the actions of the differentially localized PKDs. Membrane but not cytosolic PKD could induce expression of CD8 and CD4 in recombinase null mice; cytosolic but not membrane PKD suppressed Vbeta to DJbeta rearrangements of the TCRbeta chain locus in wild-type T cells. PKD function is thus determined by its intracellular location and cell context.","4092":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) requires selective targeting of the mutational machinery to the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The induction of SHM in the BL2 cell line upon costimulation is associated with hyperacetylation of the chromatin at the variable region but not at the constant region. The V region-restricted histone hyperacetylation resulting from costimulation occurs independent of AID expression and mutation. Interestingly, costimulation in the presence of Trichostatin A causes hyperacetylation of histones associated with the constant region and extends mutations to the constant region. Under this condition, promoter proximal mutations are observed in the variable region as well. The overexpression of AID results in a similar deregulation of mutational targeting. Our results indicate that the stimulation of SHM in BL2 cells activates two independent pathways resulting in histone modifications that permit induced levels of AID to selectively target the variable region for mutation.","4093":"The evolutionarily ancient intracellular stress response protects cells from the effects of external and internal forces which perturb cellular metabolism. Members of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like superfamily act as cell surface indicators of the intracellular stress response. Cellular immunity employs these indicators as a cue for elimination of damaged, infected, and malignant cells, promoting the health of the individual and the evolutionary success of the species.","4094":"","4095":"","4096":"","4097":"GATA-1 is an essential transcription factor for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte (MegE) development. Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA-1. Enforced expression of GATA-1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to loss of self-renewal activity and the exclusive generation of MegE lineages. Strikingly, ectopic GATA-1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte\/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into MegE lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA-1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG-1 and GATA-2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their MegE development did not require \"permissive\" erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA-1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, which could not be prevented by enforced permissive Bcl-2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA-1 specifically instructs MegE commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA-1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis.","4098":"Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1\/JAB) negatively regulates not only the cytokine-signaling pathway but also lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation. We found that SOCS1-deficient dendritic cells (DCs) were also hyperresponsive to interferon-gamma and interleukin-4. To define the role of SOCS1-deficient DCs in vivo, we generated mice in which the SOCS1 expression was restored in T and B cells on a SOCS1(-\/-) background. In these mice, DCs were accumulated in the thymus and spleen and produced high levels of BAFF\/BLyS and APRIL, resulting in the aberrant expansion of B cells and autoreactive antibody production. SOCS1-deficient DCs efficiently stimulated B cell proliferation in vitro and autoantibody production in vivo. These results indicate that SOCS1 plays an essential role in the normal DC functions and suppression of systemic autoimmunity.","4099":"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can induce T cell activation as well as T cell tolerance. The molecular mechanisms by which APCs regulate this critical decision of the immune system are not well understood. Here we show that Stat3 signaling plays a critical role in the induction of antigen-specific T cell tolerance. Targeted disruption of Stat3 signaling in APCs resulted in priming of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells in response to an otherwise tolerogenic stimulus in vivo. Furthermore, APCs devoid of Stat3 effectively break antigen-specific T cell anergy in vitro. Conversely, increased Stat3 activity in APCs led to impaired antigen-specific T cell responses. Stat3 signaling provides, therefore, a novel molecular target for manipulation of immune activation\/tolerance, a central decision with profound implications in autoimmunity, transplantation, and cancer immunotherapy.","4100":"Antiretroviral therapy is unable to eliminate HIV infection in a small, long-lived population of latently infected T cells, providing a source for renewed viral replication following cessation of therapy. Analysis of individual latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu (Thy\/Liv) mouse demonstrated no functional viral RNA produced in the latent state. Following reactivation viral expression was dramatically increased, rendering the infected cells susceptible to an anti-HIV immunotoxin. Treatment with the immunotoxin in conjunction with agents that activate virus expression without inducing cell division (IL-7 or the non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester prostratin) depleted the bulk of the latent reservoir and left uninfected cells able to respond to subsequent costimulation. We demonstrate that activation of latent virus is required for targeting by antiviral agents and provide the basis for future therapeutic strategies to eradicate the latent reservoir.","4101":"Chlamydia trachomatis survives within host cells by inhibiting fusion between Chlamydia vacuoles and lysosomes. We show here that treatment of infected macrophages with ATP leads to killing of chlamydiae through ligation of the purinergic receptor, P2X(7)R. Chlamydial killing required phospholipase D (PLD) activation, as PLD inhibition led to rescue of chlamydiae in ATP-treated macrophages. However, there was no PLD activation nor chlamydial killing in ATP-treated P2X(7)R-deficient macrophages. P2X(7)R ligation exerts its effects by promoting fusion between Chlamydia vacuoles and lysosomes. P2X(7)R stimulation also resulted in macrophage death, but fusion with lysosomes preceded macrophage death and PLD inhibition did not prevent macrophage death. These results suggest that P2X(7)R ligation leads to PLD activation, which is directly responsible for inhibition of infection.","4102":"Leukocyte integrins contain an inserted (I) domain in their alpha subunits and an I-like domain in their beta(2) subunit, which directly bind ligand and regulate ligand binding, respectively. We describe a novel mechanistic class of integrin inhibitors that bind to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the beta(2) I-like domain and prevent its interaction with and activation of the alpha(L) I domain. The inhibitors do not bind to the alpha(L) I domain but stabilize alpha\/beta subunit association and can show selectivity for alpha(L)beta(2) compared to alpha(M)beta(2). The inhibitors reveal a crucial intersection for relaying conformational signals within integrin extracellular domains. While blocking signals in one direction to the I domain, the antagonists induce the active conformation of the I-like domain and stalk domains, and thus transmit conformational signals in the other direction toward the transmembrane domains.","4103":"The transcription factor NF-kappaB is implicated in various aspects of T cell development and function. The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of two kinases, IKK1\/alpha and IKK2\/beta, and the NEMO\/IKKgamma regulatory subunit, mediates NF-kappaB activation by most known stimuli. Adoptive transfer experiments had demonstrated that IKK1 and IKK2 are dispensable for T cell development. We show here that T lineage-specific deletion of IKK2 allows survival of naive peripheral T cells but interferes with the generation of regulatory and memory T cells. T cell-specific ablation of NEMO or replacement of IKK2 with a kinase-dead mutant prevent development of peripheral T cells altogether. Thus, IKK-induced NF-kappaB activation, mediated by either IKK1 or IKK2, is essential for the generation and survival of mature T cells, and IKK2 has an additional role in regulatory and memory T cell development.","4104":"RAG1\/GFP knockin mice were exploited to isolate and characterize fetal lymphoid progenitors. CD11b and IL-7Ralpha are expressed in a developmental stage-dependent fashion, revealing how substantial numbers of early lymphoid progenitors were discarded or neglected in previous studies. The myeloerythroid potential of fetal progenitors in clonal assays declined in synchrony with activation of the RAG1 locus but was not completely extinguished. Lymphoid differentiation corresponded to patterns of gene expression previously found for adult marrow, but no fraction of fetal liver was enriched with respect to B + T progenitors. Also, unlike adults, fetal lymphoid progenitors transiently expressed endothelial cell markers. These findings help to reconcile discrepancies in previous reports and suggest that the fetal immune system arises via unique mechanisms.","4105":"IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)\/Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily members are critical for regulating multiple aspects of dendritic cell (DC) biology. Several signaling pathways associated with each family utilize the adapter molecule, TRAF6, but its role in DCs is unclear. By examining TRAF6-deficient mice and bone marrow (BM) chimeras reconstituted with TRAF6-deficient fetal liver cells, we show that proper DC maturation requires TRAF6. In response to either microbial components or CD40L, TRAF6-deficient DCs fail to upregulate surface expression of MHCII and B7.2, or produce inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, LPS-treated TRAF6-deficient DCs do not exhibit an enhanced capacity to stimulate naive T cells. Interestingly, a major population of splenic DCs, the CD4(+)CD8alpha(-) subset, is nearly absent in both TRAF6-deficient mice and BM chimeras. Together these results indicate that TRAF6 regulates the critical processes required for maturation, activation, and development of DCs, the primary cellular bridge between innate and adaptive immunity.","4106":"After antigen-driven expansion, the majority of T cells involved in an immune response die rapidly by apoptosis dependent on the Bcl-2 related proteins, Bim and Bax or Bak. The details of how these proteins are activated and interact are still unclear. The crystal structure of mouse Bcl-x(L) bound to a long helical fragment of Bim indicates that the structure of Bim is very different from proteins with a Bcl-2-like fold and may leave the BH3 region of Bim constitutively exposed. Based on the structural homology between Bcl-x(L) and Bax, we predicted that binding of Bim to Bax would require displacement of the Bax penultimate alpha helix. Consistent with this prediction, truncation of this short helix was required for Bim\/Bax interaction and led to spontaneous activation of Bax. Our results suggest a way in which both Bim and Bax\/Bak might be required for activated T cell apoptosis.","4107":"Macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) is an important component of the innate immune system implicated in host defense against microbial infections such as candidiasis and in antigen presentation. We demonstrate here that the MMR expression is induced in mouse peritoneal macrophages following exposure to PPARgamma ligands or to interleukine-13 (IL-13) via a PPARgamma signaling pathway. Ligand activation of the PPARgamma in macrophages promotes uptake, killing of Candida albicans, and reactive oxygen intermediates production triggered by the yeasts through MMR overexpression. We also show that MMR induction by IL-13 via PPARgamma is dependent on phopholipase A2 activation and that IL-13 induces 15d-PGJ2 production and nuclear localization. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway controlling the MMR surface expression and suggest that endogenous PPARgamma ligand produced by phospholipase A2 activation may be an important regulator of MMR expression by IL-13.","4108":"Information on how suppressor\/regulatory T cells can be generated directly in vivo and prevent autoimmunity remains fragmentary. We show here that epicutaneous immunization (ECi) with the immunodominant peptide of myelin basic protein (MBP), Ac1-11, protects mice that are transgenic for an Ac1-11-specific T cell receptor against both the induced and spontaneous forms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). This protection was antigen specific and antigen dose dependent, and was mediated by CD4(+)\/CD25(-) T cells whose suppressive activity required cell-cell contact and could transfer protection to naive recipients. These ECi-induced suppressor T cells controlled naive MBP-specific CD4 T cells by inhibiting both their activation and their capacity to secrete IFN-gamma. There was no CD4 T cell infiltration in the brain of protected mice. Finally, ECi with autoantigenic peptides protected two nontransgenic models from relapsing-remitting EAE in an antigen-specific and antigen dose-dependent manner.","4109":"Beta-glucans are structural cell wall polymers of many fungi which possess immunomodulatory activities. Although the therapeutic benefits associated with these compounds, particularly as anti-infective and antitumorigenic agents, have led to a large body of published research over the last five decades, it is still unclear how these carbohydrates mediate their effects. Recent studies, however, are starting to shed some light on the cellular receptors and molecular mechanisms involved, which also have direct relevance on the innate immune response to fungal pathogens.","4110":"SOCS1 is a key regulator of cytokine signaling and is important for maintaining balance in the immune system. In addition to roles in T, NKT, and macrophage cell function, a new study indicates that SOCS1 modulates dendritic cell activation and may help prevent autoimmunity.","4111":"Through the biochemical dissection of conformational changes, Shimaoka et al. (this issue of Immunity) have delineated a novel role for the I-like domain in the allosteric regulation of LFA-1 function and signaling. This work advances our understanding of LFA-1 antagonism and reveals new avenues for approaching LFA-1, and potentially other I-domain containing integrins, as drug targets.","4112":"SLP-65(-\/-) mice display a partial block at the pre-B cell stage of development. Here, we show that LAT is required for the differentiation of SLP-65(-\/-) pre-B cells. We show that LAT and SLP-76 are recruited to the pre-BCR and associated with Ig-alpha upon pre-BCR engagement, whereas LAT interaction with SLP-76 is already detected in untreated pre-B cells. Reconstitution of LAT or SLP-65 expression in SLP-65\/LAT(-\/-) pre-B cells restored their calcium (Ca2+) mobilization capacity, led to downregulation of surface pre-BCR, and induced differentiation to BCR+ cells. Together, our results suggest that the adaptor proteins LAT and SLP-76 are involved in pre-BCR signaling, thereby rescuing arrested murine SLP-65(-\/-) pre-B cells.","4113":"Chromatin remodeling of type 2 cytokine gene loci occurs during differentiation of naive CD4 and CD8 T cells into type 2 helper (Th2) and cytotoxic (Tc2) T cells. IL-4 production and histone hyperacetylation in IL-4-associated nucleosomes in developing Tc2 cells were significantly lower than those of Th2 cells; however, cytokine production and histone hyperacetylation of IL-5 and IL-13 genes were equivalent. Developing Tc2 cells expressed lower GATA3 levels and dramatically increased levels of repressor of GATA (ROG). A ROG response element in the IL-13 gene exon 4 displayed Tc2-specific binding of ROG, HDAC1, and HDAC2 and exhibited repression of IL-4 gene activation. Thus, ROG may confer CD8 T cell-specific repression of histone hyperacetylation and activation of the IL-4 gene locus.","4114":"Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) has a well-established role in LPS-induced immune responses. Here, we report that LBP also plays an essential role in the innate immune response to Gram-positive pneumococci, specifically to their major inflammatory component, pneumococcal cell wall (PCW). LBP was present in the CSF of patients with meningitis, and LBP-deficient mice failed to develop meningeal inflammation. LBP enhanced PCW-induced cell signaling and TNF-alpha release. LBP bound specifically to PCW multimers, indicating novel lipid-independent binding capability for LBP. We propose the iterative anionic groups along the glycan backbone of the cell wall are a crucial structure for recognition by LBP. Such a function for LBP expands its role to Gram-positive infections.","4115":"The physiological role of SDF-1 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains elusive. We show that colonization of bone marrow by HSCs in addition to myeloid cells is severely impaired in SDF-1(-\/-) embryos by a long-term repopulation assay. Colonization of spleen by HSCs was also affected, but to a lesser extent. Enforced expression of SDF-1 under the control of vascular-specific Tie-2 regulatory sequences could completely rescue the reduction of HSCs but not myeloid cells in SDF-1(-\/-) bone marrow. SDF-1 was detected in the vicinity of the vascular endothelial cells in fetal bone marrow. SDF-1 plays a critical role in colonization of bone marrow by HSCs and myeloid cells during ontogeny, and the mechanisms by which SDF-1 functions are distinct between HSCs and myeloid cells.","4116":"A mouse strain was identified with a recessive genetic lesion, which spontaneously developed a lymphoproliferative autoimmune syndrome exhibiting features of systemic lupus erythematosus. Positional mapping of the disease-associated locus revealed a lesion in Rasgrp1 that prevented the translation of the RasGRP1 protein. T cells from these mice failed to activate Ras or proliferate vigorously following antigen encounter and showed defects in positive selection. Peripheral RasGRP1lag T cells spontaneously adopted a memory phenotype and were able to transfer disease to lymphopenic recipient mice. CD4+ T cells accumulated in the lymphoid tissues of older RasGRP1lag mice and were resistant to activation-induced cell death. RasGRP1lag B cells were functionally normal, but activated B cells were detected in older mice, as were autoantibodies directed against self-antigens. Our findings indicate that Ras signaling pathways are required to maintain T cell tolerance and to prevent autoimmune disease.","4117":"The frequency of somatic hypermutations of an Ig kappa transgene with an artificial test insert, RS, is at least 4-fold higher than that of three related transgenes. The four transgenes differ only in the sequence of a 96 bp insert within the variable region. RS is hypermutable over the total 625 nucleotides of the variable\/joining region. The RS insert contains two CAGGTG sequences, potential binding sites for basic helix-loop-helix proteins. Changing CAGGTG to AAGGTG reduces the mutability to that of the non-RS transgenes without altering the mutation pattern. The CAGGTG motif enhances somatic hypermutation without enhancing transcription. A DNA probe containing the two CAGGTG sites, but not AAGGTG, binds E47 and gives rise to two specific EMSA bands with nuclear extracts from mutating cells. Possible actions of this enhancer of somatic hypermutation are discussed.","4118":"Dendritic cells (DCs) initiate and control immune responses. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) represent a unique DC subset able to promptly release large amounts of type I interferon (IFN-alphabeta) upon viral encounter. Here we report that depletion of pDCs from human blood mononuclear cells abrogates the secretion of specific and polyclonal IgGs in response to influenza virus. Furthermore, purified pDCs triggered with virus induce CD40-activated B cells to differentiate into plasma cells. Two pDC cytokines act sequentially, with IFN-alphabeta generating non-Ig-secreting plasma blasts and IL-6 inducing their differentiation into Ig-secreting plasma cells. These plasma cells display the high levels of CD38 found on tissue plasma cells. Thus, pDCs are critical for the generation of plasma cells and antibody responses.","4119":"The overall degree of complexity of the T cell surface has been unclear, constraining our understanding of its biology. Using global gene expression analysis, we show that 111 of 374 genes encoding well-characterized leukocyte surface antigens are expressed by a resting cytotoxic T cell. Unexpectedly, of 97 stringently defined, T cell-specific transcripts with unknown functions that we identify, none encode proteins with the modular architecture characteristic of 80% of leukocyte surface antigens. Only two encode proteins with membrane topologies found exclusively in cell surface molecules. Our analysis indicates that the cell type-specific composition of the resting CD8+ T cell surface is now largely defined, providing an insight into the overall compositional complexity of the mammalian cell surface and a framework for formulating systematic models of T cell surface-dependent processes, such as T cell receptor triggering.","4120":"DNA polymerase mu (pol mu) is a template-dependent polymerase closely related to the lymphoid-specific enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). We report here the phenotype of pol mu-deficient mice. Such animals display an abnormal B cell differentiation, with a specific alteration in the IgM- to IgM+ transition in bone marrow. In all mice, Ig light chain gene rearrangement is impaired at the level of the Vkappa-Jkappa and Vlambda-Jlambda junctions, which show extensive nibbling of both coding extremities. These alterations lead to a profound defect in the peripheral B cell compartment which, although variable between animals, results in an average 40% reduction in the splenic B cell fraction. Pol mu appears, therefore, as a key element contributing to the relative homogeneity in size of light chain CDR3 and taking part in Ig gene rearrangement at a stage where TdT is no longer expressed.","4121":"In sepsis, there is evidence that excessive C5a generation leads to compromised innate immune functions, being associated with poor outcome. We now report that in vitro exposure of neutrophils to C5a causes increased levels of IkappaBalpha, decreased NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription of TNFalpha, and decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFalpha production. Similar findings were obtained with neutrophils from cecal ligation\/puncture (CLP)-induced septic rats. Such changes were reversed by antibody-induced in vivo blockade of C5a. In contrast, in vitro exposure of alveolar macrophages to C5a and LPS resulted in enhanced production of TNFalpha and no increase in IkappaBalpha. These data suggest that CLP-induced sepsis causes a C5a-dependent dysfunction of neutrophils, which is characterized by altered signaling associated with NF-kappaB activation.","4122":"HLA-DM (DM) edits major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-bound peptides in endocytic compartments and stabilizes empty MHCII molecules. Crystal structures of DM have revealed similarity to MHCII but not how DM and MHCII interact. We used mutagenesis to map a MHCII-interacting surface on DM. Mutations on this surface impair DM action on HLA-DR and -DP in cells and DM-dependent peptide loading in vitro. The orientation of DM and MHCII predicted by these studies guided design of soluble DM and DR molecules fused to leucine zippers via their beta chains, resulting in stable DM\/DR complexes. Peptide release from the complexes was fast and only weakly sequence dependent, arguing that DM diminishes the selectivity of the MHCII groove. Analysis of soluble DM action on soluble DR\/peptide complexes corroborates this conclusion.","4123":"T cells develop through distinct stages directed by a series of signals. We explored the roles of SWI\/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complexes in this process by progressive deletion of the ATPase subunit, Brg, through successive stages of early T cell development. Brg-deficient cells were blocked at each of the developmental transitions examined. Bcl-xL overexpression suppressed cell death without relieving the developmental blockades, leading to the accumulation of Brg-deleted cells that were unexpectedly cell cycle arrested. These defects resulted partly from the disruptions of pre-TCR and potentially Wnt signaling pathways controlling the expression of genes such as c-Kit and c-Myc critical for continued development. Our studies indicate that BAF complexes dynamically remodel chromatin to propel sequential developmental transitions in response to external signals.","4124":"The recent characterization of a mutant strain of mice generated five decades ago in a program to study ionizing radiation in mammals (and, ironically, derived from a nonmutagenized control animal) is helping to dissect a now resurgent area of immunology. Despite a vast literature during the 1970s, the study of suppressor T cells had been largely abandoned until the publication of several seminal papers rekindled interest in what are today generally referred to as regulatory T (TR) cells. The identification of the transcription factor Foxp3 as the gene responsible for the defect in scurfy mice, and subsequently, the demonstration of its critical involvement in the generation of TR cells, provides an important molecular insight into this essential cell lineage.","4125":"Type I helical cytokines are ligands for receptors structurally related by a common sequence signature. Here we analyze the 27 ligands and 34 human type I cytokine receptor encoded by the human genome. We compare these to ligands and receptors found in mouse and insects. We describe their structural relatedness to one another and discuss the evolution of these gene families.","4126":"","4127":"","4128":"The Th2 cytokine genes IL4, IL5, and IL13 are clustered and expressed in a cell lineage-specific manner. We investigated the global locus-specific regulation of these genes using BAC transgenic mice containing the murine Th2 cytokine cluster carrying an IL4 promoter-luciferase reporter. IL4 promoter activity in effector CD4 T cells from these transgenic mice was strong, Th2 specific, and copy number dependent, suggesting the presence of an LCR in the locus. The production of IL4 and IL13, but not IL5, by these cells was also copy number dependent. Deletion analysis defined a 25 kb fragment in the RAD50 gene as the region containing the LCR activity. Expression of the IL4 promoter-luciferase reporter was transactivated by GATA-3 irrespective of position in the locus, suggesting the global nature of this regulation. The LCR itself, however, does not respond directly to GATA-3.","4129":"A central issue in understanding the hematolymphoid system is the generation of appropriate mutant alleles in mice to reveal the function of regulatory genes. Here we describe a mouse strain, Plastic, with a point mutation in a zinc finger of Ikaros that disrupts DNA binding but preserves efficient assembly of the full-length protein into higher order complexes. Ikaros(Plastic) homozygosity is embryonically lethal with severe defects in terminal erythrocyte and granulocyte differentiation, excessive macrophage formation, and blocked lymphopoiesis, while heterozygotes display a partial block in lymphocyte differentiation. The contrast with more circumscribed effects of Ikaros alleles that ablate the full-length protein highlights the importance in mammals of generating recessive niche-filling alleles that inactivate function without creating a void in multimolecular assemblies.","4130":"DOCK2 is a mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans CED-5 and Drosophila melanogaster Myoblast City which are known to regulate actin cytoskeleton. DOCK2 is critical for lymphocyte migration, yet the role of DOCK2 in TCR signaling remains unclear. We show here that DOCK2 is essential for TCR-mediated Rac activation and immunological synapse formation. In DOCK2-deficient T cells, antigen-induced translocation of TCR and lipid rafts, but not PKC-theta and LFA-1, to the APC interface was severely impaired, resulting in a significant reduction of antigen-specific T cell proliferation. In addition, we found that the efficacy of both positive and negative selection was reduced in DOCK2-deficient mice. These results suggest that DOCK2 regulates T cell responsiveness through remodeling of actin cytoskeleton via Rac activation.","4131":"Although expression of the RAG1 and RAG2 genes is essential for lymphocyte development, the mechanisms responsible for the lymphoid- and developmental stage-specific regulation of these genes are poorly understood. We have identified a novel, evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer in the RAG locus, called Erag, which was essential for the expression of a chromosomal reporter gene driven by either RAG promoter. Targeted deletion of Erag in the mouse germline results in a partial block in B cell development associated with deficient V(D)J recombination, whereas T cell development appears unaffected. We found that E2A transcription factors bind to Erag in vivo and can transactivate Erag-dependent reporter constructs in cotransfected cell lines. These findings lead us to conclude that RAG transcription is regulated by distinct elements in developing B and T cells and that Erag is required for optimal levels of RAG expression in early B cell precursors but not in T cells.","4132":"Integrin ligation activates both cell adhesion and signal transduction, in part through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Plastins (also known as fimbrins) are actin-crosslinking proteins of the cortical cytoskeleton present in all cells and conserved from yeast to mammals. Here we show that plastin-deficient polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are deficient in killing the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in vivo and in vitro, despite normal phagocytosis. Like integrin beta2-deficient PMN, plastin-deficient PMN cannot generate an adhesion-dependent respiratory burst, because of markedly diminished integrin-dependent syk activation. Unlike beta2(-\/-) PMN, plastin-deficient PMN adhere and spread normally. Deficiency of plastin thus separates the classical integrin receptor functions of adhesion and spreading from intracellular signal transduction.","4133":"GATA-3 is expressed at higher levels in CD4 than in CD8 SP thymocytes. Here we show that upregulation of GATA-3 expression in DP thymocytes is triggered by TCR stimulation, and the extent of upregulation correlates with the strength of the TCR signal. Overexpression of GATA-3 or a partial GATA-3 agonist during positive selection inhibits CD8 SP cell development but is not sufficient to divert class I-restricted T cell precursors to the CD4 lineage. Conversely, expression of the GATA-3 antagonist ROG or of a GATA-3 siRNA hairpin markedly enhances development of CD8 SP cells and reduces CD4 SP development. We propose that GATA-3 contributes to linking the TCR signal strength to the differentiation program of CD4 and CD8 thymocytes.","4134":"Peripheral blood monocytes are a heterogeneous population of circulating leukocytes. Using a murine adoptive transfer system to probe monocyte homing and differentiation in vivo, we identified two functional subsets among murine blood monocytes: a short-lived CX(3)CR1(lo)CCR2(+)Gr1(+) subset that is actively recruited to inflamed tissues and a CX(3)CR1(hi)CCR2(-)Gr1(-) subset characterized by CX(3)CR1-dependent recruitment to noninflamed tissues. Both subsets have the potential to differentiate into dendritic cells in vivo. The level of CX(3)CR1 expression also defines the two major human monocyte subsets, the CD14(+)CD16(-) and CD14(lo)CD16(+) monocytes, which share phenotype and homing potential with the mouse subsets. These findings raise the potential for novel therapeutic strategies in inflammatory diseases.","4135":"Dendritic cells (DCs) present microbial antigens to T cells and provide inflammatory signals that modulate T cell differentiation. While the role of DCs in adaptive immunity is well established, their involvement in innate immune defenses is less well defined. We have identified a TNF\/iNOS-producing (Tip)-DC subset in spleens of Listeria monocytogenes-infected mice that is absent from CCR2-deficient mice. The absence of Tip-DCs results in profound TNF and iNOS deficiencies and an inability to clear primary bacterial infection. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to L. monocytogenes antigens are preserved in CCR2-deficient mice, indicating that Tip-DCs are not essential for T cell priming. Tip-DCs, as the predominant source of TNF and iNOS during L. monocytogenes infection, orchestrate and mediate innate immune defense against this intracellular bacterial pathogen.","4136":"Peptide:MHC II complexes derived from a fluorescent antigen were detected in vivo to identify the cells that present subcutaneously injected antigen to CD4 T cells. Skin-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that acquired the antigen while in the draining lymph nodes were the first cells to display peptide:MHC II complexes. Presentation by these cells induced CD69, IL-2 production, and maximal proliferation by the T cells. Later, DCs displaying peptide:MHC II complexes migrated from the injection site via a G protein-dependent mechanism. Presentation by these migrants sustained expression of the IL-2 receptor and promoted delayed type hypersensitivity. Therefore, presentation of peptide:MHC II complexes derived from a subcutaneous antigen occurs in two temporally distinct waves with different functional consequences.","4137":"The alpha integrin GPIIb is a marker of hematopoietic progenitors. Using a marking strategy based on Cre-loxP technology to trace the fate of GPIIb-expressing cells, we show that GPIIb is expressed during early definitive embryonic hematopoiesis. However, the marked fetal population is distinct from the hematopoietic cells that predominate in the adult, suggesting that at least two waves of progenitors arise concurrently or consecutively in the fetus. Furthermore, using an inactivated allele of gpIIb, we provide evidence for a functional role of GPIIb on progenitors. We observe an increase in hematopoietic progenitors in the yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow, an effect which may, in part, be explained by loss of binding to fibronectin.","4138":"V(H) replacement has been proposed as one way to modify unwanted antibody specificities, but analysis of this mechanism has been limited without a dynamic cellular model. We describe a human cell line that spontaneously undergoes serial V(H) gene replacement mediated by cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSS) located near the 3' end of V(H) genes. Recombination-activating gene products, RAG-1 and RAG-2, bind and cleave the cRSS to generate DNA deletion circles during the V(H) replacement process. A V(H) replacement contribution to normal repertoire development is revealed by the identification of V(H) replacement \"footprints\" in IgH sequences and double-stranded DNA breaks at V(H) cRSS sites in immature B cells. Surprisingly, the residual 3' sequences of replaced V(H) genes contribute charged amino acids to the CDR3 region, a hallmark of autoreactive antibodies.","4139":"Platelets are highly reactive components of the circulatory system with well-documented hemostatic function. Recent studies extend platelet function to modulation of local inflammatory events through the release of chemokines, cytokines, and a number of immunomodulatory ligands, including CD154. We hypothesized that platelet-derived CD154 modulates adaptive immunity. The data reported herein demonstrate that platelets, via CD154, induce dendritic cell maturation, B cell isotype switching, and augment CD8(+) T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Platelet transfusion studies demonstrate that platelet-derived CD154 alone is sufficient to induce isotype switching and augment T lymphocyte function during viral infection, leading to enhanced protection against viral rechallenge. Additionally, depletion of platelets in normal mice results in decreased antigen-specific antibody production.","4140":"It was recently proposed that cells of the dendritic family not only control immunity but also maintain tolerance to self-antigens, two complementary functions that would ensure the integrity of the organism in an environment full of pathogens. As they express a variety of receptors that specifically recognize microbial products, DCs are able to discriminate between self and nonself and may therefore enable the immune system to mount potent effector activity to pathogens while silencing self-reactive lymphocytes.","4141":"Peripheral monocyte heterogeneity is widely acknowledged in humans but until now comparable heterogeneity has not been characterized in mice. In this issue, Geissmann et al. use chemokine receptors to define two monocyte subsets and Serbina et al. highlight the importance of selective monocyte recruitment in the innate immune response to Listeria.","4142":"DNase I hypersensitivity assays and phylogenetic analyses previously led to the identification of multiple enhancers in the Th2 cytokine cluster. As described in this issue of Immunity, Lee et al. have now used a transgenic mouse assay to identify a locus control region (LCR) that supports integration site-independent, copy number-dependent transcription of Il4 and Il13.","4143":"T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells (APC) is regulated by positive and negative costimulatory molecules in the B7 family. Here we describe a novel addition in this family, designated as B7S1, which is uniquely anchored to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage. B7S1 is expressed on professional APC and widely distributed in nonlymphoid tissues. A soluble B7S1-Ig fusion protein binds to activated but not naive T cells. B7S1-Ig inhibits T cell activation and IL-2 production. A monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of B7S1 to its receptor enhances T cell proliferation in vitro and exacerbates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in vivo. This study identifies a novel negative regulator of T cell activation and further reveals complex costimulatory regulation of immune responses.","4144":"We identify a B7 family molecule, B7-H4, by protein sequence analysis and comparative molecular modeling. While B7-H4 mRNA is widely distributed in mouse and human peripheral tissues, cell surface expression of B7-H4 protein is limited and shows an inducible pattern on hematopoietic cells. Putative receptor of B7-H4 can be upregulated on activated T cells. By arresting cell cycle, B7-H4 ligation of T cells has a profound inhibitory effect on the growth, cytokine secretion, and development of cytotoxicity. Administration of B7-H4Ig into mice impairs antigen-specific T cell responses whereas blockade of endogenous B7-H4 by specific monoclonal antibody promotes T cell responses. B7-H4 thus may participate in negative regulation of cell-mediated immunity in peripheral tissues.","4145":"We demonstrate that the alpha chain of human C4b binding protein (C4BP) binds directly to CD40 on human B cells at a site that differs from that used by CD40 ligand. C4BP induces proliferation, upregulation of CD54 and CD86 expression, and IL4-dependent IgE isotype switching in normal B cells but not in B cells from patients with CD40 or IKKgamma\/NEMO deficiencies. Furthermore, C4BP colocalized with B cells in the germinal centers of human tonsils. These observations suggest that C4BP is an activating ligand for CD40 and establish a novel interface between complement and B cell activation.","4146":"The pre-B cell receptor triggers expansion and differentiation of pre-B cells (the pre-B cell transition), as well as inhibition of V(H) to DJ(H) recombination (allelic exclusion). The latter also accounts for counter-selection of pro-B cells expressing Dmu protein (Dmu selection). However, the signaling pathways responsible for these events remain poorly defined. Here we show complete arrest of B cell development at the pre-B cell transition in BASH\/CD19 double mutant mice, indicating partial redundancy of the two B cell-specific adaptors. Allelic exclusion remained intact in the double mutant mice, whereas Dmu selection was abolished in BASH mutant mice. Thus, distinct signals are required for these events. In addition, both mutant mice succumbed to pre-B cell leukemia, indicating that BASH and CD19 contribute to tumor suppression.","4147":"To understand how adaptive immune responses are generated against bacteria that avoid being delivered to lysosomes, interactions between professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila were examined. In contrast to murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), we show that dendritic cells (DCs) restrict the growth of intracellular Legionella. Similar to what has been reported in BMMs, phagosomes containing Legionella matured into endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles after DC internalization. Biogenesis of an ER-derived vacuole did not effectively sequester Legionella antigens from presentation on MHC class II molecules (MHC II). It was determined that proteins synthesized after Legionella had established residence in an ER-derived vacuole were presented by infected APCs. These data indicate that the ability of DCs to restrict intracellular growth of Legionella could be an important property that facilitates priming of protective T cell-mediated immune responses to vacuolar pathogens.","4148":"Helper T (Th) cell differentiation is accompanied by complex transcriptional changes. Although costimulatory receptors are important in Th differentiation, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examine the transcriptional mechanisms by which ICOS regulates Th2 differentiation and selective IL-4 expression by effector T cells. We found impaired expression of c-Maf transcription factor functionally associated with the IL-4 defect in ICOS(-\/-) cells. c-Maf expression in effector cells was regulated by IL-4 levels during Th differentiation. ICOS costimulation potentiated the T cell receptor (TcR)-mediated initial IL-4 production, possibly through the enhancement of NFATc1 expression. These data indicate that ICOS, by enhancing TcR signals at an early stage of T cell activation, regulates IL-4 transcription and T cell function in effector cells.","4149":"Galactocerebrosides (GCs) represent a major class of glycolipids in the nervous system. Here, we show that mice lacking the key enzyme to generate GCs, UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT(-\/-)), exhibit severe postnatal atrophy of all lymphoid organs, owing to a maturational arrest before the pro-B\/T cell stage. This lineage-specific defect originates from the bone marrow (BM) stroma since it is not transplantable to irradiated wild-type recipients. Remarkably, CGT(-\/-) long-term B lymphoid BM cultures displayed severe deficits in the number of CD45(neg)VCAM-1(pos) stromal cells and fibronectin matrix assembly, and produced floating macrophages rather than B lymphocytes. The fibronectin network was also altered in the CGT-deficient BM parenchyma. These results point to an essential role for galactolipids in the formation of fibronectin-enriched lymphoid-specific stromal niches in the BM.","4150":"Despite the importance of the Vav family proteins for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, their activation mechanisms remain poorly understood. We demonstrate here that adaptor molecules Grb2 and BLNK, in addition to Vav, are required for efficient Rac1 activation in response to BCR stimulation. Loss of either Grb2 or BLNK results in decreased translocation of Vav3 to membrane rafts. By expression of Vav3 as a raft-targeted construct, the defective Rac1 activation in Grb2- or BLNK-deficient B cells is restored. Hence, our findings suggest that Grb2 and BLNK cooperate to localize Vav into membrane rafts, thereby contributing to optimal activation of Vav in B cells.","4151":"Members of the MAGUK family proteins cluster receptors and intracellular signaling molecules at the neuronal synapse. We report that genetic inactivation of the MAGUK family protein CARD11\/Carma1\/Bimp3 results in a complete block in T and B cell immunity. CARD11 is essential for antigen receptor- and PKC-mediated proliferation and cytokine production in T and B cells due to a selective defect in JNK and NFkappaB activation. Moreover, B cell proliferation and JNK activation were impaired upon stimulation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide, indicating that CARD11 is involved in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Our results show that the same family of molecules are critical regulators of neuronal synapses and immune receptor signaling.","4152":"In a genome-wide ENU mouse mutagenesis screen a recessive mouse mutation, unmodulated, was isolated with profound defects in humoral immune responses, selective deficits in B cell activation by antigen receptors and T cell costimulation by CD28, and gradual development of atopic dermatitis with hyper-IgE. Mutant B cells are specifically defective in forming connections between antigen receptors and two key signaling pathways for immunogenic responses, NF-kappaB and JNK, but signal normally to calcium, NFAT, and ERK. The mutation alters a conserved leucine in the coiled-coil domain of CARMA-1\/CARD11, a member of the MAGUK protein family implicated in organizing multimolecular signaling complexes. These results define Carma-1 as a key regulator of the plasticity in antigen receptor signaling that underpins opposing mechanisms of immunity and tolerance.","4153":"Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) play a central role in innate and acquired mucosal immunity. They ensure early signaling to trigger an inflammatory response against pathogens. Moreover, IEC mediate transcytosis of dimeric IgA (dIgA), through the polymeric-immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), to provide secretory IgA, the major protective Ig in mucosal secretions. Using an in vitro model of polarized IEC, we describe an additional anti-inflammatory mechanism of dIgA-mediated protection against intracellular bacterial components involved in the proinflammatory activation of IEC. Specific dIgA colocalizes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the apical recycling endosome compartment, preventing LPS-induced NF-kappaB translocation and subsequent proinflammatory response. Thus, intracellular neutralization by dIgA limits the acute local inflammation induced by proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS.","4154":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes appears to involve the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and their error-prone repair. Here we show that DSBs occur at a high frequency in unrearranged (germline) Ig variable (V) genes, BCL6 and c-MYC. These DSBs are blunt, target the mutational RGYW\/RGY hotspot, and would be resolved through nonhomologous end-joining, as indicated by the presence of Ku70\/Ku86 on these DNA ends. Upon CD40-induced expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), DSBs increase in frequency and are resected to yield 5'- and 3'-protruding ends in hypermutating rearranged V genes, BCL6 and translocated c-MYC. 3'-protruding ends would direct DSB repair through homologous recombination, as indicated by their exclusive presence in S\/G2 and recruitment of Rad52\/Rad51, leading to SHM, upon mispair by error-prone DNA polymerases modulated by crosslinking of the B cell receptor for antigen.","4155":"In this issue of Immunity, Brodeur et al. show that C4b binding protein (C4BP), a regulator component of the classical complement (C) pathway, can bind to CD40 receptors on B cells and activate them. This suggests a novel way by which CD40 may function to bridge innate and adaptive immune responses.","4156":"In this issue of Immunity, examine the intracellular life of Legionella pneumophila in dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages, as well as the presentation of its antigens to CD4 T cells. Legionella is a particularly interesting bacterium because of the peculiarities inherent in its intracellular sojourn in phagocytes: it resides in an unusual vesicle characterized by ribosomes studded along its walls. In this compartment, Legionella proteins encoded by the dot gene inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion and endosomal acidification, yielding a vesicular structure conducive to the multiplication of Legionella, poor in lysosomal contents, and in MHC molecules.","4157":"Lymphocyte activation via antigen receptors initiates adaptive immune responses. Two papers in this issue of Immunity demonstrate that CARMA-1, a CARD carrying member of the MAGUK family proteins, is essential for lymphocyte activation. CARMA-1 functions by coupling antigen receptor signals to NF-kappaB induction and JNK activation.","4158":"Dendritic cells (DC) are inducers of immune responses par excellence. They also seem responsible for the induction of peripheral T cell tolerance. To investigate these opposite functions of DC, we generated a Cre\/LoxP-based system that allows inducible antigen presentation by DC in vivo. This enables us to study the immunogical consequences of antigen presentation by resting versus mature DC without adoptively transferring DC and with physiological numbers of endogenous, naive responder T cells. We found that presentation of LCMV-derived CTL epitopes by resting DC resulted in antigen-specific tolerance, which could not be broken by subsequent infection with LCMV. On the other hand, antigen presentation by activated DC primed endogenous CTL to expand and to develop protective effector function.","4159":"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to arise in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of embryo proper, although HSC activity can be detected in yolk sac (YS) and paraaortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp) when transplanted in newborn mice. We examined the role of Notch signaling in embryonic hematopoiesis. The activity of colony-forming cells in the YS from Notch1(-\/-) embryos was comparable to that of wild-type embryos. However, in vitro and in vivo definitive hematopoietic activities from YS and P-Sp were severely impaired in Notch1(-\/-) embryos. The population representing hemogenic endothelial cells, however, did not decrease. In contrast, Notch2(-\/-) embryos showed no hematopoietic deficiency. These data indicate that Notch1, but not Notch2, is essential for generating hematopoietic stem cells from endothelial cells.","4160":"We report that HDAC7, a class II histone deacetylase, is highly expressed in CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes. HDAC7 inhibits the expression of Nur77, an orphan receptor involved in apoptosis and negative selection, via the transcription factor MEF2D. HDAC7 is exported from the nucleus during T cell receptor activation, leading to Nur77 expression. A triple HDAC7 mutant (S155A, S318A, S448A) is not exported from the nucleus in response to TCR activation and suppresses TCR-mediated apoptosis. Conversely, a fusion of HDAC7 to the transcriptional activator VP16 activates Nur77 expression. Inhibition of HDAC7 expression by RNA interference causes increased apoptosis in response to TCR activation. These observations define HDAC7 as a regulator of Nur77 and apoptosis in developing thymocytes.","4161":"The Notch genes play a key role in cellular differentiation. The significance of Notch1 during thymocyte development is well characterized, but the function of Notch2 is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Notch2 but no other Notch family member is preferentially expressed in mature B cells and that conditionally targeted deletion of Notch2 results in the defect of marginal zone B (MZB) cells and their presumed precursors, CD1d(hi) fraction of type 2 transitional B cells. Among Notch target genes, the expression level of Deltex1 is prominent in MZB cells and strictly dependent on that of Notch2, suggesting that Deltex1 may play a role in MZB cell differentiation.","4162":"Allergic reactions are triggered via crosslinking of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E, F(c)epsilonRI. In humans, F(c)epsilonRI is expressed as a tetramer (alphabetagamma(2)) and a trimer (alphagamma(2)). The beta subunit is an amplifier of F(c)epsilonRI surface expression and signaling. Here, we show that as a consequence of alternative splicing, the F(c)epsilonRIbeta gene encodes two proteins with opposing and competing functions. One isoform is the full-length classical beta, the other a novel truncated form, beta(T). In contrast to beta, beta(T) prevents F(c)epsilonRI surface expression by inhibiting alpha chain maturation. Moreover, beta(T) competes with beta to control F(c)epsilonRI surface expression in vitro. We propose that the relative abundance of the products of the beta gene may control the level of F(c)epsilonRI surface expression and thereby influence susceptibility to allergic diseases.","4163":"Engagement of TNF receptor 1 by TNFalpha activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB but can also induce apoptosis. Here we show that upon TNFalpha binding, TNFR1 translocates to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts, where it associates with the Ser\/Thr kinase RIP and the adaptor proteins TRADD and TRAF2, forming a signaling complex. In lipid rafts, TNFR1 and RIP are ubiquitylated. Furthermore, we provide evidence that translocation to lipid rafts precedes ubiquitylation, which leads to the degradation via the proteasome pathway. Interfering with lipid raft organization not only abolishes ubiquitylation but switches TNFalpha signaling from NF-kappaB activation to apoptosis. We suggest that lipid rafts are crucial for the outcome of TNFalpha-activated signaling pathways.","4164":"In this report we identify an accessory cell that interacts with primed and memory T cells at sites where they collaborate with B cells. These cells are distinguished from conventional dendritic cells by their lack of response to Flt3 ligand and their inability to process antigen. Unlike dendritic cells, the CD4(+)CD3(-) cells have little CD80 or CD86 expression but do express high levels of the TNF ligands, OX40 ligand and CD30 ligand. We show that Th2-primed cells express the receptors for these TNF ligands and preferentially survive when cocultured with these cells. Furthermore, we show that the preferential survival of OX40(+) T cells and support of memory T cell help for B cells are linked to their association with CD4(+)CD3(-) cells in vivo.","4165":"CD8 T cells persist at high frequencies in peripheral organs after resolution of an immune response, and their presence in the periphery is important for resistance to secondary challenge. We show here that LCMV-specific T cells in peripheral tissue (peritoneal cavity, lung, fat pads) reacted much less with the apoptotic marker Annexin-V than those in spleen and lymph nodes. This was not due to a TCR-based selection. In comparison to lymphoid tissue, T cells in the periphery expressed lower levels of Fas and Fas ligand and were resistant to activation-induced cell death in vitro. This may contribute to the survival of nondividing peripheral memory T cells, enabling them to efficiently function without being driven into apoptosis.","4166":"Viral infection is the primary cause of respiratory morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) infants. Here, we identify that host factors allow increased virus replication and cytokine production, providing a mechanism for understanding the severity of virus disease in CF. Increased virus is due to lack of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) and 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 1 induction in response to virus or IFNgamma. This can be attributed to impairment of activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, a fundamental component to antiviral defense. NO donor or NOS2 overexpression provides protection from virus infection in CF, suggesting that NO is sufficient for antiviral host defense in the human airway and is one strategy for antiviral therapy in CF children.","4167":"Active suppression is mediated by a subpopulation of CD4(+) T cells that prevents autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms involved in their differentiation in vivo are currently under intensive research. Here we show that in vitro culture of bone marrow cells in the presence of IL-10 induces the differentiation of a distinct subset of dendritic cells with a specific expression of CD45RB. These CD11c(low)CD45RB(high) DCs are present in the spleen and lymph nodes of normal mice and are significantly enriched in the spleen of IL-10 Tg mice. These natural or in vitro-derived DCs display plasmacytoid morphology and an immature-like phenotype, and secrete high levels of IL-10 after activation. OVA peptide-pulsed CD11c(low)CD45RB(high) DCs specifically induce tolerance through the differentiation of Tr1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings identify a natural DC subset that induces the differentiation of Tr1 cells and suggest their therapeutic use.","4168":"This study challenges the concept that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency represents a silent infection that is ignored by the host immune system, and suggests antigen-directed retention of memory CD8(+) T cells. CD8(+) T cells specific for the immunodominant gB(498-505) HSV-1 epitope are selectively retained in the ophthalmic branch of the latently infected trigeminal ganglion, where they acquire and maintain an activation phenotype and the capacity to produce IFN-gamma. Some CD8(+) T cells showed TCR polarization to junctions with neurons. A gB(498-505) peptide-specific CD8(+) T cell clone can block HSV-1 reactivation from latency in ex vivo trigeminal ganglion cultures. We conclude that CD8(+) T cells provide active surveillance of HSV-1 gene expression in latently infected sensory neurons.","4169":"Although Notch receptors are widely expressed during hematopoiesis, their roles outside of the T cell lineage are not well characterized. Two reports in this issue of Immunity show that Notch1 and Notch2, respectively, are required to generate the earliest embryonic hematopoietic stem cells and splenic marginal zone B cells. Thus, different Notch receptors have specific and nonoverlapping functions that influence multiple hematopoietic lineages at various stages of development.","4170":"Memory CD8(+) T cells in lymphoid tissue exhibit an unexpectedly high apoptosis rate, while memory cells located in several nonlymphoid tissues do not. This may be because the lymphoid CD8(+) memory T cell repertoire is being continuously updated, while the tissue repertoire is more stable.","4171":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been thought to persist as a latent infection by completely extinguishing antigen expression. In this issue of Immunity, Khanna et al. challenge this view by showing that CTL specific for antigens normally associated with active viral replication are crucial participants in regulating virus latency.","4172":"The ability of IVIG to induce expression of Fc gamma RIIB and thereby prevent antibody-induced inflammation has been used as a probe to dissect the effector cell components in the KRNxNOD (K\/BxN) arthritis model. IVIG protection resulted from the induction of Fc gamma RIIB on infiltrating macrophages but not neutrophils, indicating a critical role for macrophage activation in this disease model. Disease induction but not IVIG protection was observed in CSF-1-deficient mice (op\/op) in K\/BxN arthritis, thus defining different macrophage subsets in these processes. These results suggest a two-step model for IVIG protection in which CSF-1-dependent macrophages act as innate \"sensors\" for the Fc fragment of IVIG, leading to the induction of Fc gamma RIIB on CSF-1-independent \"effector\" macrophages thereby raising the threshold required for Fc gamma RIII activation and preventing autoantibody-triggered inflammation.","4173":"We previously showed that HOXB4 is a potent stimulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation in vivo and ex vivo. As a result, HOXB4 overexpressing HSCs are 20- to 50-times more competitive than untransduced cells when transplanted into mice. By knocking down the expression of PBX1 (PBX1(K.D.)) in HOXB4 overexpressing cells, we now present the possibility of generating HSCs that are &gt;20-times more competitive than those that overexpress HOXB4. The differentiation activity of these cells appears intact, since they competitively contributed to the reconstitution of normal myeloid and lymphoid compartments in vivo. We also show that the in vivo expansion of HOXB4-PBX1(K.D.)-expressing HSCs regenerated normal stem cell pools and did not lead to HSC levels above those detected in unmanipulated mice. The vigorous competitive nature of these cells in vivo compared to HOXB4-transduced HSCs suggests the existence of a distinct, non-cell autonomous mechanism that limits the expansion of HOXB4-transduced hemopoietic stem cells in mice.","4174":"The spectrum of TCR V beta usage is compared for primary and recall CD8(+)D(b)PA(224)(+) T cell responses in mice with influenza pneumonia. Single-cell RT-PCR established that the same clonotypes were present in the lymphoid tissue and in the virus-infected lung. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the memory TCR repertoire reflects the primary response, with no decrease in diversity prior to (or after) secondary challenge. The re-engagement of memory T cells looked to be stochastic in this localized, transient infection. Analysis of clonotypes from the blood, spleen, regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, lung, and liver over a 200 day interval showed no evidence of selective localization or loss. The long-term distribution of memory T cells seemed to be essentially random.","4175":"T cell anergy may serve to limit autoreactive T cell responses. We examined early changes in gene expression after antigen-TCR signaling in the presence (activation) or absence (anergy) of B7 costimulation. Induced expression of GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes) was observed in anergic CD4(+) T cells. GRAIL is a type I transmembrane protein that localizes to the endocytic pathway and bears homology to RING zinc-finger proteins. Ubiquitination studies in vitro support GRAIL function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Expression of GRAIL in retrovirally transduced T cell hybridomas dramatically limits activation-induced IL-2 and IL-4 production. Additional studies suggest that GRAIL E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and intact endocytic trafficking are critical for cytokine transcriptional regulation. Expression of GRAIL after an anergizing stimulus may result in ubiquitin-mediated regulation of proteins essential for mitogenic cytokine expression, thus positioning GRAIL as a key player in the induction of the anergic phenotype.","4176":"ZAP-70, a member of the Syk family of tyrosine kinases, has been reported to be expressed exclusively in T and NK cells. We show here that it is expressed throughout B cell development and that it plays a role in the transition of pro-B to pre-B cells in the bone marrow, a checkpoint controlled by signals from the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR), which monitors for successful rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. Whereas mice deficient in Syk show a partial block at this step, mice mutant in both Syk and ZAP-70 show a complete block at the pro-B cell stage and a failure of heavy chain allelic exclusion, hallmarks of defective pre-BCR signaling.","4177":"FADD is an adaptor known to transmit apoptotic signals from members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. We show here that FADD has a domain implicated in cell proliferation. Mice bearing the Asp mutation in the serine 191 phosphorylation site are runted and anemic and display splenomegaly. Apoptosis is unimpaired in these mice, but they exhibit many immune developmental problems indicative of proliferative defects. Mutant FADD T cells are defective in cell cycle progression, suggesting that regulation of phosphorylation at serine 191 is essential for growth\/proliferation. Remarkably, serine 191 is conserved among mammalian FADD proteins, but this C-terminal region is absent in lower organisms, suggesting that FADD acquired a domain during evolution, rendering it a \"proliferation-apoptosis coupler\" that balances cell proliferation and apoptosis.","4178":"MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation is an essential step in the priming of CD8 T lymphocytes during immune responses to infection. While microbial growth and clearance have been accurately measured in mammalian hosts, the duration of functional antigen presentation during infection remains undefined in vivo. Herein we characterize the activation of naive and memory T cells at different times during bacterial infection. Surprisingly, the host's ability to prime T cells is of much shorter duration than bacterial infection, inversely correlating with the development of pathogen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes. Our studies demonstrate a feedback mechanism that limits the duration of effective in vivo antigen presentation, thereby modulating T cell responses by temporally restricting recruitment of naive T cells into the immune response.","4179":"The invariant chain (Ii) chaperone for MHC class II molecules is crucial for their effective function. Equally important is its removal. Cathepsins S or L are known to be required for the final stages of Ii removal in different APCs, but the enzymes which initiate Ii processing have not been identified. Here we show that this step can be performed in B lymphocytes by asparagine endopeptidase (AEP), which targets different asparagine residues in the lumenal domain of human and mouse invariant chain. Inhibition of AEP activity slows invariant chain processing and hinders the expression of an antigenic peptide engineered to replace the groove binding region of Ii (CLIP). However, the initiation of Ii removal can also be performed by other proteases, reflecting the importance of this step.","4180":"To determine the tissue-specific functions of SOCS-1, mice were generated in which the SOCS-1 gene could be deleted in individual tissues. A reporter gene of SOCS-1 promoter activity was also inserted. Using the reporter, high SOCS-1 expression was found at the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage in thymocyte development. To investigate the function of this expression, the SOCS-1 gene was specifically deleted throughout the thymocyte\/T\/NKT cell compartment. Unlike SOCS-1(-\/-) mice, these mice did not develop lethal multiorgan inflammation but developed multiple lymphoid abnormalities, including enhanced differentiation of thymocytes toward CD8(+) T cells and very high percentages of peripheral CD8(+) T cells with a memory phenotype (CD44(hi)CD25(lo)CD69(lo)). These phenotypes were found to correlate with hypersensitivity to the gamma-common family of cytokines.","4181":"Perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is essential for clearance of primary LCMV infection. BALB\/c-perforin-deficient (PKO) mice survived LCMV infection by deleting NP(118)-specific CD8(+) T cells whereas vaccination of PKO mice with Listeria expressing NP(118) generated a stable memory CD8(+) T cell population. However, &gt;85% of vaccinated BALB\/c-PKO mice died after LCMV infection. Mortality was associated with enormous expansion of NP(118)-specific CD8(+) T cells in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues and aberrant CD8(+) T cell cytokine production. Depletion of CD8(+) T cells or treatment with anti-IFNgamma antibody rescued vaccinated mice from mortality. Thus, perforin was essential for resistance to secondary LCMV infection, and, in the absence of perforin, vaccination resulted in lethal disease mediated by dysregulated CD8(+) T cell expansion and cytokine production.","4182":"There is abundant information on the distinguishing features of TCR-mediated signaling in Th1 and Th2 cells. However, the primary signals that determine the commitment and differentiation of naive T cells toward those T helper subsets, especially prior to the contribution of polarizing cytokines, remain elusive. This minireview discusses the potential contribution of SLAT in favoring differentiation along the Th2 lineage and how this may bring us closer to a framework model for Th1\/Th2 differentiation.","4183":"The type II bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) or major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) deficiency is a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that is characterized by the absence of constitutive and inducible expression of MHCII determinants on immune cells. Four complementation groups of BLS have been defined, and they result from mutations in DNA-bound activators and the coactivator for MHCII transcription. Recently, all complementation groups of BLS patients have been accounted for. Studies of the syndrome and specific mutations reveal important lessons for the genetics of the immune response.","4184":"HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected rhesus macaques who remain healthy despite long-term infection exhibit exceptionally low levels of virus replication and active antiviral cellular immune responses. In contrast, sooty mangabey monkeys that represent natural hosts for SIV infection do not develop AIDS despite high levels of virus replication and limited antiviral CD8(+) T cell responses. We report here that SIV-infected mangabeys maintain preserved T lymphocyte populations and regenerative capacity and manifest far lower levels of aberrant immune activation and apoptosis than are seen in pathogenic SIV and HIV infections. These data suggest that direct consequences of virus replication alone cannot account for progressive CD4(+) T cell depletion leading to AIDS. Rather, attenuated immune activation enables SIV-infected mangabeys to avoid the bystander damage seen in pathogenic infections and protects them from developing AIDS.","4185":"Most antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules are generated by proteasomes during protein breakdown. It is unknown whether these peptides are protected from destruction by cytosolic peptidases. In cytosolic extracts, most antigenic peptides are degraded by the metalloendopeptidase, thimet oligopeptidase (TOP). We therefore examined whether TOP destroys antigenic peptides in vivo. When TOP was overexpressed in cells, class I presentation of antigenic peptides was reduced. In contrast, TOP overexpression didn't reduce presentation of peptides generated in the endoplasmic reticulum or endosomes. Conversely, preventing TOP expression with siRNA enhanced presentation of antigenic peptides. TOP therefore plays an important role in vivo in degrading peptides released by proteasomes and is a significant factor limiting the extent of antigen presentation.","4186":"To further understand the interaction among GATA-3, Stat4, and T-bet in helper T cell development, we first showed that retroviral expression of GATA-3 in developing Th1 cells suppresses Th1 development through downregulation of Stat4 rather through downregulation of the IL-12Rbeta2 chain. Correspondingly, Stat4 levels are greatly suppressed during physiological Th2 development. Then, using cells doubly infected with GFP- and YFP-expressing retroviruses, we showed that retroviral GATA-3 expression in developing Th1 cells does not block Th1 development in cells coexpressing Stat4 but does so in cells coexpressing T-bet. Finally, we showed that retroviral Stat4 expression could facilitate Th2--&gt;Th1 conversion in cells bearing an IL-12Rbeta2 transgene, even in cells lacking T-bet. These findings reassert that Stat4 signaling is a central element of Th1\/Th2 development.","4187":"We describe the isolation of a protein, SWAP-70-like adapter of T cells (SLAT), which is expressed at high levels in thymocytes and differentiated Th2 cells. SLAT expression was upregulated in differentiating Th2 cells and downregulated in Th1 cells. Ectopic SLAT expression exerted positive or negative effects on IL-4 versus IFNgamma induction, respectively. TCR signaling induced translocation of SLAT to the immunological synapse and its association with ZAP-70 kinase. SLAT reduced the association of ZAP-70 with TCR-zeta and interfered with ZAP-70 but not Lck signaling. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of ZAP-70 also induced Th2 skewing. Thus, SLAT is a protein which plays a role in Th2 development and\/or activation, perhaps by interfering with ZAP-70 signaling.","4188":"NKT cells are specialized cells coexpressing NK and T cell receptors. Upon activation they rapidly produce high levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) and are therefore postulated to influence T(H)1\/T(H)2 immune responses. The precise role of the CD1\/NKT cell pathway in immune response to infection remains unclear. We show here that CD1d-restricted NKT cells from distinct genetic backgrounds differentially influence T(H)1\/T(H)2 polarization, proinflammatory cytokine levels, pathogenesis, and fatality in the P. berghei ANKA\/rodent model of cerebral malaria. The functional properties of CD1d-restricted NKT cells vary according to expression of loci of the natural killer complex (NKC) located on mouse chromosome 6, which is shown here to be a significant genetic determinant of murine malarial fatalities.","4189":"Tumor-secreted gp96-Ig is highly immunogenic and triggers CD8 T cell-mediated tumor rejection. In vivo secreted gp96-Ig and gp96-myc cause NK activation and clonal expansion of specific CD8(+) CTL in wild-type and in Fas-ligand-deficient (gld) mice but not in perforin- (PKO) or IFN-gamma-deficient (GKO) mice. Transfer of perforin-competent NK cells restores the ability of PKO mice to clonally expand CD8 CTL in response to gp96-Ig. The data demonstrate an essential role for perforin-mediated functions in the activation of innate and adaptive immunity by heat shock protein gp96-peptide complexes. Crosspresentation of antigens by heat shock proteins seems to require a perforin-dependent positive feedback loop between NK and DC for both sustained NK activation and clonal CTL expansion. The studies also explain how depressed NK activity in patients with tumors or after viral infections could diminish CTL responses.","4190":"We have established a novel immunotherapeutic approach involving dendritic cells (DCs) with potent immunoregulatory property (designated as regulatory DCs [rDCs]) for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and leukemia relapse in allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation (BMT) in mice bearing leukemia. rDCs displayed high levels of MHC molecules and extremely low levels of costimulatory molecules. A single injection of rDCs following allogeneic BMT controlled the ability of the transplanted T cells to induce acute GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in the recipients bearing leukemia, and that resulted in protection from the lethality caused by acute GVHD and tumor burden. Thus, the use of rDCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of acute GVHD and leukemia relapse in allogeneic BMT.","4191":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes employ Granzyme B as a potent initiator of apoptosis to cleave and activate effector caspases. Unexpectedly, cells transfected with Bcl-2 were resistant to granzyme B-induced killing, suggesting that a mitochondrial pathway was critical. Utilizing cells expressing a dominant-negative caspase 9, the current study demonstrated that caspase activation via the apoptosome was not required. Indeed, cleavage of caspase 3 to p20 still occurred in Bcl-2-transfectants but processing to p17 was blocked. This blockade was recapitulated by the Inhibitor-of-Apoptosis-Protein XIAP and relieved by Smac\/DIABLO. Thus granzyme B mediates direct cleavage of caspase 3 and also activates mitochondrial disruption, resulting in the release of proapoptotic proteins that suppress caspase inhibition. Engagement of both pathways is critical for granzyme-induced killing.","4192":"Using L929 cells, we quantitated the macroeconomics of protein synthesis and degradation and the microeconomics of producing MHC class I associated peptides from viral translation products. To maintain a content of 2.6 x 10(9) proteins, each cell's 6 x 10(6) ribosomes produce 4 x 10(6) proteins min(-1). Each of the cell's 8 x 10(5) proteasomes degrades 2.5 substrates min(-1), creating one MHC class I-peptide complex for each 500-3000 viral translation products degraded. The efficiency of complex formation is similar in dendritic cells and macrophages, which play a critical role in activating T cells in vivo. Proteasomes create antigenic peptides at different efficiencies from two distinct substrate pools: rapidly degraded newly synthesized proteins that clearly represent defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) and a less rapidly degraded pool in which DRiPs may also predominate.","4193":"We have explored the interactions between the NFkappaB and Cdk-Rb-E2F pathways in controlling T cell fate following antigen stimulation. The inhibition of NFkappaB in antigen-stimulated T cells results in apoptosis but does not inhibit E2F activation and S phase entry. IkappaB-induced apoptosis coincides with the superinduction of p73 expression and activity. G1 Cdk activity is required for IkappaB-induced apoptosis and the induction of p73. Importantly, p73 deficiency rescues activated T cells from the apoptosis resulting from the inhibition of NFkappaB. Thus, Cdk2 activation sends signals for both cell cycle progression and apoptosis, the latter of which must be blocked by NFkappaB to allow for proliferation.","4194":"Apoptosis in response to granzyme B involves activation of caspase-dependent target cell death pathways. Herein, we show that granzyme B initiates caspase processing but cannot fully process procaspase-3 in intact Jurkat T leukemia or NT2 neuronal cells. Rather, the release from mitochondria of proapoptotic mediators cytochrome c, Smac\/Diablo, and HtrA2\/Omi facilitates full activation of caspases that results from autoprocessing. Bcl-2 overexpression in mitochondria suppresses the release of these proapoptotic molecules, resulting in cell survival despite partial procaspase processing by granzyme B. We propose that binding of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins to partially processed procaspases inhibits cell death unless mitochondrial disruption also occurs in response to granzyme B or activated BH3-domain proteins such as truncated Bid.","4195":"Peptide ligands destined for binding MHC class I molecules are generated by the proteasome in the cytoplasm and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto newly synthesized class I molecules. A new study now provides a quantitative analysis of how total protein turnover in the cell relates to the efficiency of generating peptide epitopes presented by class I molecules.","4196":"We found that Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein (MINT) competed with the intracellular region of Notch for binding to a DNA binding protein RBP-J and suppressed the transactivation activity of Notch signaling. Although MINT null mutant mice were embryonic lethal, MINT-deficient splenic B cells differentiated about three times more efficiently into marginal zone B cells with a concomitant reduction of follicular B cells. MINT is expressed in a cell-specific manner: high in follicular B cells and low in marginal zone B cells. Since Notch signaling directs differentiation of marginal zone B lymphocytes and suppresses that of follicular B lymphocytes in mouse spleen, the results indicate that high levels of MINT negatively regulate Notch signaling and block differentiation of precursor B cells into marginal zone B cells. MINT may serve as a functional homolog of Drosophila Hairless.","4197":"The HIV Nef protein is thought to promote HIV immune evasion by downmodulating MHC-I and protecting infected cells from CTL killing. In addition, we demonstrated that Rev, an HIV regulatory protein needed for expression of the HIV late genes, can influence CTL killing. When Rev activity level was reduced by virtue of amino acid alterations in the Rev protein sequence, infected cells were more resistant to anti-Gag and anti-Env CTL killing. A screen of primary viral isolates revealed that viruses derived from asymptomatic, infected people had lower Rev activity, lower Gag levels, and greater resistance to anti-Gag CTL killing. Thus, rev alleles with low activity may have a selective advantage in infected people with effective immune responses.","4198":"BLys , a key cytokine that sustains B cell maturation and tolerance, binds three receptors: BR3, BCMA, and TACI. Results from knockout mice implicate a major functional role for BR3 and a redundant one for BCMA in B cell function. TACI's role is controversial based on defects in TI antibody responses accompanied by B cell hyperplasia in knockout mice. We have presently characterized a precise role for TACI in vivo. TACI(-\/-) mice develop fatal autoimmune glomerulonephritis, proteinurea, and elevated levels of circulating autoantibodies. Treatment of B cells with TACI agonistic antibodies inhibits proliferation in vitro and activation of a chimeric receptor containing the TACI intracellular domain induces apoptosis. These results demonstrate the critical requirement for TACI in regulating B cell homeostasis.","4199":"Respiratory dendritic cells (RDC) are believed to play a central role in the induction of adaptive immune responses to pulmonary infection. Herein we examine the basal migration of RDC from the lungs to secondary lymphoid tissues and their enhanced maturation\/migration after pulmonary infection\/inflammation. We demonstrate that the accelerated migration of RDC to the draining peribronchial lymph nodes occurs only during the first 24 hr after pulmonary virus infection. RDC are refractory to further migration thereafter in spite of ongoing virus replication and pulmonary inflammation. We further demonstrate that induction of this RDC refractory state suppresses additional RDC mobilization to subsequent pulmonary virus infection and results in concomitant suppression of an antiviral pulmonary CD8(+) T cell response.","4200":"The relative roles of CD8, TCR:pepMHC affinity, and TCR:pepMHC dissociation rate in T cell activation have remained controversial. To determine the relationships among these factors, we used T cells transfected with normal and in vitro engineered alphabeta TCRs, in the presence or absence of CD8. The TCRs exhibited a wide range of affinities (K(D) values of 80 microM to 5 nM). T cells with the highest affinity TCRs were efficiently stimulated by peptide, with or without CD8. In contrast, CD8 was required for T cells that expressed TCRs with affinities typical of syngeneic reactions (K(D) values above approximately 3 microM). The results suggest that virtually all normal syngeneic interactions require CD8, which enhances peptide sensitivity by one million-fold or more.","4201":"Upon encounter with antigen, B lymphocytes differentiate into Ig-secreting plasma cells. This step involves a massive development of secretory organelles, most notably the endoplasmic reticulum. To analyze the relationship between organelle reshaping and Ig secretion, we performed a dynamic proteomics study of B lymphoma cells undergoing in vitro terminal differentiation. By clustering proteins according to temporal expression patterns, it appeared that B cells anticipate their secretory role in a multistep process. Metabolic capacity and secretory machinery expand first to accommodate the mass production of IgM that follows.","4202":"Production of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) protein feeds back to terminate further V(H) gene recombination, a phenomenon also referred to as allelic exclusion. Here we provide evidence to support the proposition that allelic exclusion is the consequence of terminating signals that activate V(H) genes for recombination. For the largest V(H)J558 family of genes, this occurs by attenuating IL-7\/IL-7R signals in pre-B cells. Loss of these signals reverts the V(H) locus to a chromatin state that is associated with hypoacetylated histones and is less accessible to nucleases. Furthermore, hyperacetylation and accessibility of unrearranged V(H) genes can be restored in allelically excluded splenic B cells by activating this pathway. Thus, transient signals mediate V(H) gene activation and inactivation during development.","4203":"Basal complement activity presents a potential danger for \"self\" cells that are tightly protected by complement regulators including CD59. Mice express two Cd59 genes (mCd59a and mCd59b); mCd59b has approximately a 6-fold higher specific activity than mCd59a. Consistently, mCd59b knockout mice present a strong phenotype characterized by hemolytic anemia with increased reticulocytes, anisopoikilocytosis, echinocytosis, schistocytosis, free hemoglobin in plasma, hemoglobinuria with hemosiderinuria, and platelet activation. Remarkably, mCd59b(-\/-) males express a progressive loss of fertility associated with immobile dysmorphic and fewer sperm cells after 5 months of age. This work indicates that mCd59b is a key complement regulator in mice and that CD59 is critical in protecting self cells; it also provides a novel model to study complement regulation in human diseases.","4204":"TL is a nonclassical MHC class I molecule that modulates T cell activation through relatively high-affinity interaction with CD8alphaalpha. To investigate how the TL\/CD8alphaalpha interaction influences TCR signaling, we characterized the structure of the TL\/CD8alphaalpha complex using X-ray crystallography. Unlike antigen-presenting molecules, the TL antigen-binding groove is occluded by specific conformational changes. This feature eliminates antigen presentation, severely hampers direct TCR recognition, and prevents TL from participating in the TCR activation complex. At the same time, the TL\/CD8alphaalpha interaction is strengthened through subtle structure changes in the TL alpha3 domain. Thus, TL functions to sequester and redirect CD8alphaalpha away from the TCR, modifying lck-dependent signaling.","4205":"Memory T cells are divided into central and effector subsets with distinct functions and homing capabilities. We analyzed the composition and dynamics of the CD8(+) T cell repertoire of these subsets within the peripheral blood of four healthy individuals. Both subsets had largely distinct and autonomous TCRbeta repertoires. Their composition remained stable over a 9 month period, during which no cell passage between these subsets was detected despite important size variation of several clones. In one donor, four out of six TCRbeta clonotypes specific for the influenza A virus were detected in the central subset only, while the two others were shared. Altogether, these observations suggest that most effector memory T cells may not have derived from the central memory subset.","4206":"The degree of heavy chain (H) editing, the types of Vkappa editors, and the pattern of Jkappa usage are correlated with a range of the affinity of anti-DNA. This range was determined by the number and location of arginine (R) residues in the VH. We, here, changed a key arginine residue in the VH of anti-DNA transgene to glycine, which sharply reduces the affinity for dsDNA. However, complete reversion of this anti-DNA to germline enhances the affinity for phosphatidylserine (PS). The B cells of this low-affinity anti-DNA and anti-PS transgenic mouse are tightly regulated by receptor editing. Thus, anti-PS B cells are another example of a constitutive self-antigen regulated in the bone marrow.","4207":"CD4 gene regulation provides an ideal model for understanding the molecular events that drive T cell development. In this paper we use a transgenic approach to identify a CD4 LCR containing a stage-specific thymocyte enhancer (TE) and a region that protects against position effect variegation. Surprisingly, the TE acts indirectly through the previously defined proximal enhancer and is strongly induced upon commitment to the T cell lineage. We also describe a complex series of hierarchical control element interactions that orchestrate CD4 expression throughout thymopoiesis. These data provide a framework for understanding how CD4 gene expression is regulated in response to lineage commitment decisions.","4208":"The intricate mechanisms regulating fetomaternal interactions are still largely uncharacterized. Recent papers have revealed a major role for the innate immune system during abortion. Different experimental conditions-deletion of a complement regulator, injection of anti-phospholipid antibodies into mothers, or allo-recognition of fetuses in the presence of an IDO inhibitor-all lead to complement activation, inflammation, and fetal loss. These observations also raise new questions on the relationship between the adaptive and innate systems during pregnancy.","4209":"Antigen-specific suppression of a previously primed immune response is a major challenge for immunotherapy of autoimmune disease. RelB activation is required for myeloid DC differentiation. Here, we show that antigen-exposed DCs in which RelB function is inhibited lack cell surface CD40, prevent priming of immunity, and suppress previously primed immune responses. DCs generated from CD40-deficient mice similarly confer suppression. Regulatory CD4+ T cells induced by the DCs transfer antigen-specific \"infectious\" tolerance to primed recipients in an interleukin-10-dependent fashion. Thus CD40, regulated by RelB activity, determines the consequences of antigen presentation by myeloid DCs. These observations have significance for autoimmune immunotherapy and suggest a mechanism by which peripheral tolerance might be constitutively maintained by RelB(-) CD40(-) DCs.","4210":"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) couples actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to T cell activation, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here, we show that antigen-induced formation of T cell:APC conjugates and synapses is abrogated in WASp-deficient T cells and that CD2 engagement evokes interactions between the proline-rich region required for WASp translocation to the synapse and the PSTPIP1 adaptor SH3 domain and between the PSTPIp1 coiled-coil domain and both CD2 and another CD2-binding adaptor, CD2AP. The induced colocalization of these proteins at the synapse is disrupted by expression of coiled-coil domain-deleted PSTPIP1. These data, together with the impairment in CD2-induced actin polymerization observed in WASp-deficient cells, suggest that PSTPIP1 acts downstream of CD2\/CD2AP to link CD2 engagement to the WASp-evoked actin polymerization required for synapse formation and T cell activation.","4211":"T cells expand without intentional antigen stimulation when transferred into adult lymphopenic environments. In this study, we show that the physiologic lymphopenic environment existing in neonatal mice also supports CD4 T cell proliferation. Strikingly, naive CD4 T cells that proliferate within neonates acquire the phenotypic and functional characteristics of memory cells. Such proliferation is inhibited by the presence of both memory and naive CD4 T cells, is enhanced by 3-day thymectomy, is independent of IL-7, and requires a class II MHC-TCR interaction and a CD28-mediated signal. CD44(bright) CD4 T cells in neonates have a wide repertoire as judged by the distribution of Vbeta expression. Thus, lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation is a physiologic process that occurs during the early postnatal period.","4212":"Many viral proteins modulate class I expression, yet, in general, their mechanisms of specific class I recognition are poorly understood. The mK3 protein of gamma(2)-Herpesvirus 68 targets the degradation of nascent class I molecules via the ubiquitin\/proteasome pathway. Here, we identify cellular components of the MHC class I assembly machinery, TAP and tapasin, that are required for mK3 function. mK3 failed to regulate class I in TAP- or tapasin-deficient cells, and mK3 interacted with TAP\/tapasin, even in the absence of class I. Expression of mK3 resulted in the ubiquitination of TAP\/tapasin-associated class I, and mutants of class I incapable of TAP\/tapasin interaction were unaffected by mK3. Thus, mK3 subverts TAP\/tapasin to specifically target class I molecules for destruction.","4213":"We report essential roles of zinc finger transcription factor Gfi-1 in myeloid development. Gene-targeted Gfi-1(-\/-) mice lack normal neutrophils and are highly susceptible to abscess formation by gram-positive bacteria. Arrested, morphologically atypical, Gr1(+)Mac1(+) myeloid cells expand with age in the bone marrow. RNAs encoding primary but not secondary or tertiary neutrophil (granulocyte) granule proteins are expressed. The atypical Gr1(+)Mac1(+) cell population shares characteristics of both the neutrophil and macrophage lineages and exhibits phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity. Reexpression of Gfi-1 in sorted Gfi-1(-\/-) progenitors ex vivo rescues neutrophil differentiation in response to G-CSF. Thus, Gfi-1 not only promotes differentiation of neutrophils but also antagonizes traits of the alternate monocyte\/macrophage program.","4214":"Antigenic peptides generated by the proteasome have to survive a peptidase-containing environment for presentation by MHC class I molecules. We have visualized the fate and dynamics of intracellular peptides in living cells. We show that peptides are distributed over two different but interconnected compartments, the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and diffuse rapidly through and between these compartments. Since TAP is excluded from the nuclear face of the nuclear envelope, nuclear peptides have to leave the nucleus to contact TAP. Thereby, these peptides encounter cytosolic peptidases that degrade peptides within seconds unless bound to chromatin. Since peptide degradation is far more efficient than translocation, many peptides will be lost for antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules.","4215":"Regulation of the activity of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 is complex, involving transcriptional and translational control, precursor processing, a receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and a decoy receptor. Here we report that the soluble form of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (AcP) increases the affinity of binding of human IL-1alpha and IL-1beta to the soluble human type II IL-1 receptor by approximately 100-fold, while leaving unaltered the low binding affinity of IL-1ra. Soluble AcP is present in normal human serum at an average concentration greater than 300 ng\/ml. These findings suggest that the soluble form of IL-1R AcP contributes to the antagonism of IL-1 action by the type II decoy receptor, adding another layer of complexity to the regulation of IL-1 action.","4216":"V(D)J recombination is targeted by short recombination signal (RS) sequences that are relatively conserved but exhibit natural sequence variations. To evaluate the potential of RS sequence variations to determine the primary and peripheral TCRbeta repertoire, we generated mice containing specific replacement of the endogenous Vbeta14 RS with the 3'Dbeta1 RS (Vbeta14\/3'DbetaRS). These mice exhibited a dramatic increase in Vbeta14(+) thymocyte numbers at the expense of thymocytes expressing other Vbetas. In addition, the percentage of peripheral Vbeta14(+) alphabeta T lymphocytes was similarly increased. Strikingly, this altered Vbeta repertoire resulted predominantly from a higher relative level of primary Vbeta14\/3'DbetaRS rearrangement to DbetaJbeta complexes, despite the ability of the 3'Dbeta1 RS to break B12\/23 restriction and allow direct rearrangement of Vbeta14\/3'DbetaRS to Jbeta segments.","4217":"V(D)J recombination occurs efficiently only between gene segments flanked by recombination signals (RSs) containing 12 and 23 base pair spacers (the 12\/23 rule). A further limitation \"beyond the 12\/23 rule\" (B12\/23) exists at the TCRbeta locus and ensures Dbeta usage. Herein, we show that extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination substrates recapitulate B12\/23 restriction in nonlymphoid cells. We further demonstrate that the Vbeta coding flank, the 12-RS heptamer\/nonamer, and the 23-RS spacer each can significantly influence B12\/23 restriction. Finally, purified core RAG1 and RAG2 proteins (together with HMG2) also reproduce B12\/23 restriction in a cell-free system. Our findings indicate that B12\/23 restriction of V(D)J recombination is cemented at the level of interactions between the RAG proteins and TCRbeta RS sequences.","4218":"We have examined the basis for immunodominant or \"public\" TCR usage in an antiviral CTL response. Residues encoded by each of the highly selected genetic elements of an immunodominant clonotype recognizing Epstein-Barr virus were critical to the antigen specificity of the receptor. Upon recognizing antigen, the immunodominant TCR undergoes extensive conformational changes in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), including the disruption of the canonical structures of the germline-encoded CDR1alpha and CDR2alpha loops to produce an enhanced fit with the HLA-peptide complex. TCR ligation induces conformational changes in the TCRalpha constant domain thought to form part of the docking site for CD3epsilon. These findings indicate that TCR immunodominance is associated with structural properties conferring receptor specificity and suggest a novel structural link between TCR ligation and intracellular signaling.","4219":"Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, have a defect in natural killer (NK) cell-mediated functions. Here we show impairment in an activating receptor, NKG2D, in NOD NK cells. While resting NK cells from C57BL\/6 and NOD mice expressed equivalent levels of NKG2D, upon activation NOD NK cells but not C57BL\/6 NK cells expressed NKG2D ligands, which resulted in downmodulation of the receptor. NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production were decreased because of receptor modulation, accounting for the dysfunction. Modulation of NKG2D was mostly dependent on the YxxM motif of DAP10, the NKG2D-associated adaptor that activates phosphoinositide 3 kinase. These results suggest that NK cells may be desensitized by exposure to NKG2D ligands.","4220":"This study demonstrates that syndecan functions as an in trans HIV receptor. We show that syndecan, when expressed in nonpermissive cells, becomes the major mediator for HIV adsorption. This adsorption is mediated by the binding of gp120 to the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan. Although syndecan does not substitute for HIV entry receptors, it enhances the in trans infectivity of a broad range of primate lentiviruses including primary viruses produced from PBMCs. Furthermore, syndecan preserves virus infectivity for a week, whereas unbound virus loses its infectivity in less than a day. Moreover, we obtain evidence suggesting that the vast syndecan-rich endothelial lining of the vasculature can provide a microenvironment which boosts HIV replication in T cells.","4221":"The mechanism by which TCR signaling activates NF-kappaB is poorly understood. We demonstrate here that the IKK kinase complex is recruited to the immunological synapse and can be coprecipitated with the TCR after T cell activation. Using ZAP-70-deficient T cells expressing a hybrid molecule between the SH2 domain of ZAP-70 and NEMO\/IKKgamma, we showed that targeting NEMO to the immunological synapse, and more specifically its 120 N-terminal amino acids, was sufficient to selectively restore NF-kappaB activation in response to TCR ligation. Finally, we demonstrated that targeting of NEMO to the membrane of T cells was sufficient to induce constitutive NF-kappaB activation. This study shows that the localization of NEMO to the immunological synapse is important for TCR-induced NF-kappaB activation and offers a powerful system to dissect the NF-kappaB cascade in T cells.","4222":"Although our structural understanding of T cell recognition has rapidly evolved due to recent crystallographic results, the reality is that detailed answers to many of the most fundamental questions still remain elusive. In this issue, high-resolution insight into the phenomenon of TCR chain bias takes down another brick from the wall.","4223":"The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) offers great promise as a cancer therapeutic. Initially, soluble recombinant versions of the TRAIL molecule have exhibited specific tumoricidal activity against a variety of tumors alone, or in combination with other cancer treatments, and much anticipation awaits the outcomes from early clinical trials. More recently, the natural role of TRAIL has been explored in tumor and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation models in the mouse. Strikingly, the TRAIL effector pathway appears a vital component of immunosurveillance of spontaneous or resident tumor cells by both T cells and NK cells, stimulating more hope that manipulating TRAIL activity is a natural path to improved cancer immunotherapy.","4224":"The formation of lymph nodes (LN) and Peyer's patches (PP) can be distinguished by the requirement of RANK for LN but not IL-7R(alpha), which is essential for PP development. However, lymphotoxin-alphabeta (LT(alpha)beta) signaling is required for both organs. The cellular basis underlying this dichotomy was revealed by the finding that the fetal IL-7R(alpha)(+) population responded equally well to IL-7 and RANKL to express LT(alpha)beta. IL-7R(alpha)(+) cells harvested from TRAF6(-\/-) embryos expressed LTalphabeta in response to IL-7 but not RANKL, demonstrating that the RANK-TRAF6 signaling pathway regulates LT(alpha)beta expression in LN but not in PP. Soluble IL-7 administered to TRAF6(-\/-) embryos was sufficient to restore LN genesis indicating the functional similarities of the IL-7R(alpha)(+) inducer cells for LN and PP genesis.","4225":"To study the spatio\/temporal recruitment of lck during immunological synapse formation, we utilize high-speed time-lapse microscopy to visualize green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of lck and CD3zeta following agonist or altered peptide ligand (APL) stimulation. The dynamics of lck and CD3zeta recruitment are comparable; however, lck becomes excluded to the periphery of mature synapses, while most CD3zeta is centrally localized, suggesting a limited time frame within which lck can efficiently phosphorylate CD3 molecules during synapse maturation. Exposure of T cells to specific APLs affects the efficiency of conjugate formation and lck accumulation. Most surprisingly, we find an intracellular pool of lck associated with recycling endosomes that translocates to mature synapses within 10 min of calcium flux. This bolus of lck may contribute to intermediate-late signal transduction.","4226":"Long-term display of exogenous proteins on the cell surface may have important research and therapeutic implications. We report a novel method for the cell-surface display of proteins that involves generation of a chimeric protein with core streptavidin, biotinylation of cells, and \"decoration\" with the protein. A chimeric protein with the extracellular portions of FasL (SA-FasL) was efficiently displayed on the cell surface within 2 hr without detectable cellular toxicity. Biotin and SA-FasL persisted on the cell surface for weeks in vitro and in vivo. Immunomodulation with SA-FasL-decorated splenocytes effectively blocked alloreactive responses in naive and presensitized rodents and prevented the rejection of allogeneic pancreatic islets. This approach may serve as an alternative to gene transfer-based expression with broad research and therapeutic applications.","4227":"The B lineage commitment factor Pax5 (BSAP) is exclusively expressed in B lymphocytes of the blood system. To study the effect of Pax5 on the development of other hematopoietic lineages, we generated a heterozygous knockin mouse carrying a Pax5 minigene under the control of the Ikaros locus. Conditional and constitutive activation of the Ik(Pax5) allele demonstrated that precocious Pax5 expression in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors failed to interfere with myeloid development and only weakly affected erythroblast formation. Instead, pan-hematopoietic Pax5 expression strongly promoted B cell development at the expense of T lymphopoiesis. Pax5 thereby interfered with T lineage commitment and early thymocyte development by repressing the transcription of the T cell specification gene Notch1.","4228":"Inflammation occurs in the context of integrin-mediated adhesive interactions of cells with their extracellular matrix environment. We investigated the role of the collagen binding integrin alpha1beta1 in a model of colitis. alpha1beta1 was expressed on lamina propria T cells and monocytes during disease. Both alpha1 deficiency and anti-alpha1 mAb treatment (prophylactic and therapeutic) protected against colitis. In vivo alpha1beta1 blockade improved macroscopic and histologic scores, decreased inflammatory cytokine production, and profoundly affected the ability of lamina propria mononuclear cells to proliferate and produce IFN-gamma in vitro. Development and alpha1-mediated inhibition of colitis can be lymphocyte independent, suggesting that activated monocytes also represent a key alpha1beta1-expressing cell type involved in colitis. These results underscore the importance of innate immunity and, specifically, of leukocyte\/matrix interactions in regulating local inflammatory responses.","4229":"LCMV infection of H-2(b) mice generates a CD8(+) CTL response mainly directed toward three immunodominant epitopes. One of these, gp33, is presented by both H-2D(b) and H-2K(b) MHC class I molecules. The virus can escape immune recognition in the context of both these MHC class I molecules through single mutations of the peptide. In order to understand the underlying structural mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of both complexes. The structures reveal that the peptide is presented in two diametrically opposed manners by H-2D(b) and H-2K(b), with residues used as anchor positions in one MHC class I molecule interacting with the TCR in the other. Importantly, the peptide's N-terminal residue p1K protrudes from the binding cleft in H-2K(b). We present structural evidence that explains the functional consequences of single mutations found in escape variants.","4230":"The molecular interactions provided by the thymic microenvironment that predicate T cell development remain obscure. Here, we show that a bone marrow stromal cell line ectopically expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like-1 loses its ability to support B cell lymphopoiesis, but acquires the capacity to induce the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into CD4 CD8 double- and single-positive T cells. Both gammadelta-TCR(+) and alphabeta-TCR(+) T cells are generated, and CD8(+) TCR(hi) cells produce gamma-interferon following CD3\/TCR stimulation. These results establish that expression of Delta-like-1 on stromal cells provides key signals for the induction of T cell lineage commitment, stage-specific progenitor expansion, TCR gene rearrangement, and T cell differentiation in the absence of a thymus. Thus, it is likely that Delta-like-1\/Notch interactions by the thymus underpin its unique ability to promote lineage commitment and differentiation of T cells.","4231":"To explain why solid cancers grow or are rejected, we examined how the tumor stroma affected the level of antigen expression necessary to induce an immune response. We applied a tamoxifen-regulated Cre-loxP system to induce a model SIYRYYGL antigen recognized by the 2C T cell receptor. Solid tumors expressing the antigen at lower levels grew, whereas solid tumors expressing antigen induced to 26-fold higher levels were rejected. In contrast, mice rejected cell suspensions expressing higher or lower levels of the antigen. The antigen was likely crosspresented because draining lymph node responses required bone marrow-derived cells in the tumor stroma. Thus, tumor antigens expressed at levels sufficient for crosspresentation by bone marrow-derived stromal cells may overcome immunological \"ignorance\" to solid tumors.","4232":"To determine the precise regulatory effect of NKT cells on CD4(+) T cells involved in autoimmune diabetes, we developed an in vivo model in which transferred naive transgenic T cells are stimulated by their antigen in the presence or absence of NKT cells or in the presence of another conventional transgenic alphabeta T cell. The presence of NKT cells did not block the initial activation and expansion of the CD4(+) T cells but did inhibit their IL-2 and IFN-gamma production and later proliferation, resulting in an anergic phenotype. These CD4(+) T cells did not induce significant insulitis and were unable to destroy the beta cells. Thus, NKT cells prevent alphabeta CD4 T cell differentiation into effector cells.","4233":"The CD21\/35 receptor provides an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. Its importance during protective immune responses to encapsulated extracellular bacteria was assessed using a new line of mice completely deficient in CD21\/35 expression (CD21\/35(-\/-)). CD21\/35 expression was essential for the rapid trapping of C3dg-antigen complexes by B cells in vivo, especially in splenic marginal zones. Despite normal B cell development in CD21\/35(-\/-) mice, T cell-independent and -dependent antibody responses to low-dose antigens were significantly decreased, with a striking impairment in IgG3 responses. Accordingly, CD21\/35(-\/-) mice were more susceptible to acute lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Thus, CD21\/35 expression is critical for early protective antibody responses to lethal pathogens that rapidly multiply and quickly overwhelm the immune system.","4234":"Polarization of CD4(+) T helper cells toward either a Th1 or Th2 response can significantly influence host immunity to pathogens. IL-4 and IFN-gamma are the signature cytokines of Th2 and Th1 cells, respectively. IFN-gamma was shown to assist Th1 development by promoting IL-12 and IL-12 receptor expression. So far, direct influence of Th2 cytokine expression by IFN-gamma has not been described. We show here that IFN-gamma directly suppresses IL-4 gene expression. IRF-1 and IRF-2 induced by IFN-gamma bind to three distinct IL-4 promoter sites and function as transcriptional repressors. Our data demonstrate a direct negative feedback of IFN-gamma on expression of the Th2 cytokine gene IL-4 and, thus, provide evidence for another important mechanism by which IFNgamma assists Th1 and attenuates Th2 responses.","4235":"Infection of vertebrate hosts with pathogenic Mycobacteria, the agents of tuberculosis, produces granulomas, highly organized structures containing differentiated macrophages and lymphocytes, that sequester the pathogen. Adult zebrafish are naturally susceptible to tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium marinum. Here, we exploit the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos to image the events of M. marinum infection in vivo. Despite the fact that the embryos do not yet have lymphocytes, infection leads to the formation of macrophage aggregates with pathological hallmarks of granulomas and activation of previously identified granuloma-specific Mycobacterium genes. Thus, Mycobacterium-macrophage interactions can initiate granuloma formation solely in the context of innate immunity. Strikingly, infection can redirect normal embryonic macrophage migration, even recruiting macrophages seemingly committed to their developmentally dictated tissue sites.","4236":null,"4237":"SOCS-1 is a negative regulatory molecule of the JAK-STAT signal cascade. Here, we demonstrate that SOCS-1 is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. SOCS-1 expression was promptly induced in macrophages upon LPS stimulation. SOCS-1-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced shock and produced increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Introduction of SOCS-1 inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB and STAT1 activation in macrophages. Furthermore, LPS tolerance, a refractory state to second LPS stimulation, was not observed in SOCS-1-deficient mice. These results suggest SOCS-1 as an essential, negative regulator in LPS responses that protects the host from harmful overresponses to LPS and may provide new insight into the endotoxin-induced fatal syndrome that occasionally occurs following infection.","4238":"PU.1 and GATA transcription factors appear to antagonize each other's function in the development of distinct lineages of the hematopoietic system. In contrast, we demonstrate that PU.1, like GATA-2, is essential for the generation of mast cells. PU.1-\/- hematopoietic progenitors can be propagated in IL-3 and differentiate into mast cells or macrophages upon restoration of PU.1 activity. Using these progenitors and a conditionally activatable PU.1 protein, we show that PU.1 can negatively regulate expression of the GATA-2 gene. In the absence of GATA-2, PU.1 promotes macrophage but not mast cell differentiation. Reexpression of GATA-2 in such progenitors enables the generation of mast cells. We propose a developmental model in which cooperative function or antagonistic crossregulation by PU.1 of GATA-2 promotes distinct myeloid cell fates.","4239":"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is characterized by host immunosuppression and multiorganic involvement. CMV-infected dendritic cells (DC) were recently shown to display reduced immune functions, but their role in virus dissemination is not clear. In this report, we demonstrated that CMV could be captured by DC through binding on DC-SIGN and subsequently transmitted to permissive cells. Moreover, blocking DC-SIGN by specific antibodies inhibited DC infection by primary CMV isolates and expression of DC-SIGN or its homolog DC-SIGNR rendered susceptible cells permissive to CMV infection. We demonstrated that CMV envelope glycoprotein B is a viral ligand for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. These results provide new insights into the molecular interactions contributing to cell infection by CMV and extend DC-SIGN implication in virus propagation.","4240":"Previous in vitro studies defined the minimal regions of RAG1 and RAG2 essential for V(D)J recombination. In order to characterize the role of the C-terminal \"dispensable\" portion of RAG2, we generated core-RAG2 knock-in mice. We found that the core-RAG2-containing recombinase complex is selectively defective in catalyzing V-to-DJ rearrangement at the IgH and TCRbeta loci, resulting in partial developmental blocks in B and T lymphopoiesis. Analysis of recombination intermediates showed defects at the cleavage phase of the reaction. We also observed a reduction in overall recombinase activity in core-RAG2-expressing thymocytes, leading us to suggest that the interaction of a defective recombinase with RSS sequences unique to VH and Vbeta gene segments may underlie the specific V-to-DJ rearrangement defect in core-RAG2 mice.","4241":"Oxazolone colitis (OC) is an experimental colitis that has a histologic resemblance to human ulcerative colitis. Here we show that IL-13 production is a significant pathologic factor in OC since its neutralization by IL-13Ralpha2-Fc administration prevents colitis. We further show that OC is mediated by NK-T cells since it can be induced neither in mice depleted of NK-T cells nor in mice that cannot present antigen to NK-T cells and mice lacking an NK-T cell-associated TCR. Finally, we show that NK-T cells are the source of the IL-13, since they produce IL-13 upon stimulation by alpha-galactosylceramide, an NK-T cell-specific antigen. These data thus describe a cellular mechanism underlying an experimental colitis that may explain the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.","4242":"Two important Ras-guanyl nucleotide exchange factors, Sos and RasGRP1, control Ras activation in thymocytes. However, the relative contribution of these two exchange factors to Ras\/ERK activation and their resulting impact on positive and negative selection is unclear. We have produced two lines of RasGRP1(-\/-) TCR transgenic mice to determine the effect of RasGRP1 in T cell development under conditions of defined TCR signaling. Our results demonstrate that RasGRP1 is crucial for thymocytes expressing weakly selecting TCRs whereas those that express stronger selecting TCRs are more effective at utilizing RasGRP1-independent mechanisms for ERK activation and positive selection. Analysis of RasGRP1(-\/-) peripheral T cells also revealed hitherto unidentified functions of RasGRP1 in regulating T cell homeostasis and sustaining antigen-induced developmental programming.","4243":"An examination of differences in gene expression between memory and naive phenotype T cells revealed elevated levels of mRNA for several chemokines, especially RANTES, in memory phenotype T cells. Although RANTES mRNA is spliced and cytoplasmic, these cells do not contain or secrete significant amounts of RANTES protein without TCR stimulation. This secretion is independent of transcription, but requires translation. In vivo, CD8+ memory T cells proliferate continuously and slowly in response to IL-15; however, IL-15 does not stimulate RANTES secretion. These results show that memory phenotype CD8+ T cells use preexisting mRNA to produce and secrete RANTES rapidly following TCR stimulation. Such storage of preformed mRNAs for important inflammatory mediators may contribute to the speed of secondary immune responses.","4244":"The H60 minor histocompatibility (H) antigen peptide is derived from a glycoprotein that serves as a ligand for the stimulatory NKG2D receptor. We show that this peptide is remarkably immunodominant in that it competes effectively with MHC alloantigens, is efficiently crosspresented by host antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and readily elicits naive CD8 T cell responses in vitro. H60 immunodominance is neither a consequence of NKG2D engagement nor competition among minor H antigens on APCs. Instead, H60 immunodominance is a consequence of an abnormally high naive precursor frequency of H60 peptide reactive CD8 T cells. Understanding why the H60 peptide is so immunogenic has important implications in tissue transplantation and vaccine design.","4245":"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. We show here that the suppressor of cytokine-signaling-1 (SOCS1\/JAB) is rapidly induced by LPS and negatively regulates LPS signaling. SOCS1(+\/-) mice or SOCS1(-\/-) mice with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-deficient background were more sensitive to LPS-induced lethal effects than were wild-type littermates. LPS-induced NO(2)(-) synthesis and TNFalpha production were augmented in SOCS1(-\/-) macrophages. Furthermore, LPS tolerance, a protection mechanism against endotoxin shock, was also strikingly reduced in SOCS1(-\/-) cells. LPS-induced I-kappaB and p38 phosphorylation was upregulated in SOCS1(-\/-) macrophages, and forced expression of SOCS1 suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation. Thus, SOCS1 directly suppresses TLR4 signaling and modulates innate immunity.","4246":"Drosophila responds to Gram-negative infections by mounting an immune response that depends on components of the IMD pathway. We recently showed that imd encodes a protein with a death domain with high similarity to that of mammalian RIP. Using a two-hybrid screen in yeast, we have isolated the death protein dFADD as a molecule that associates with IMD. Our data show that loss of dFADD function renders flies highly susceptible to Gram-negative infections without affecting resistance to Gram-positive bacteria. By genetic analysis we show that dFADD acts downstream of IMD in the pathway that controls inducibility of the antibacterial peptide genes.","4247":"The requirement for cytokines in hematopoiesis is partly attributable to the protection of cells from apoptosis. Since IL-7 is required for normal T cell development, we evaluated the role of Bax in vivo by generating mice deficient in both Bax and the IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R). Starting at birth, we observed complete recovery of all stages of alphabeta thymocyte development up to 4 weeks of age. However, by 12 weeks of age, thymic cellularity had reverted to that of mice deficient in IL-7R alone. The BH3 only proteins, Bad and Bim, were also part of the death pathway repressed by IL-7. Thus, in young mice, Bax emerges as an essential protein in the death pathway induced by IL-7 deficiency.","4248":"Immature B cells differentiate in the spleen into mature B cells, a process that is essential for their participation in the immune response. Previously, we showed that the MHC class II chaperone, invariant chain (Ii), controls this differentiation to the mature stage. Ii cytosolic domain-induced B cell maturation involves activation of transcription mediated by the NF-kappaB p65\/RelA homodimer and requires the B cell enriched coactivator, TAF(II)105. In this study we show that the cytosolic region of Ii is cleaved within the plane of the membrane to generate a cytosolic fragment, which is essential for NF-kappaB activation and B cell differentiation. Our results suggest that Ii functions as a membrane-bound inactive inducer of NF-kappaB transcription that is activated by intramembrane proteolytic cleavage.","4249":"We report intriguing aspects of the contribution of IL-15Ralpha to IL-15 functions. Consistent with high-affinity interactions between IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha, these two molecules form stable complexes on the cell surface of activated monocytes. The formation of IL-15\/IL-15Ralpha complexes on cell surfaces induces a trans-endosomal recycling of IL-15 leading to the persistence of surface-bound IL-15 due to the constant reappearance of IL-15 on plasma membranes. This complex contributes to the long survival of T cells expressing IL-15Ralpha after IL-15 withdrawal. Finally, these complexes on activated monocytes present IL-15 in trans to target cells such as CD8(+) T cells that express only IL-2\/15Rbeta and gammac upon cell-cell interaction.","4250":"The lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTbetaR) plays critical roles in inflammation and lymphoid organogenesis through activation of NF-kappaB. In addition to activation of the classical NF-kappaB, ligation of this receptor induces the processing of the cytosolic NF-kappaB2\/p100 precursor to yield the mature p52 subunit, followed by translocation of p52 to the nucleus. This activation of NF-kappaB2 requires NIK and IKKalpha, while NEMO\/IKKgamma is dispensable for p100 processing. IKKbeta-dependent activation of canonical NF-kappaB is required for the expression but not processing of p100 and for the expression of proinflammatory molecules including VCAM-1, MIP-1beta, and MIP-2 in response to LTbetaR ligation. In contrast, IKKalpha controls the induction by LTbetaR ligation of chemokines and cytokines involved in lymphoid organogenesis, including SLC, BLC, ELC, SDF1, and BAFF.","4251":"The TNF-like ligand BAFF\/BLyS is a potent survival factor for B cells. It binds three receptors: TACI, BCMA, and BR3. We show that BR3 signaling promotes processing of the transcription factor NF-kappaB2\/p100 to p52. NF-kappaB2\/p100 cleavage was abrogated in B cells from A\/WySnJ mice possessing a mutant BR3 gene, but not in TACI or BCMA null B cells. Furthermore, wild-type mice injected with BAFF-neutralizing BR3-Fc protein showed reduced basal NF-kappaB2 activation. BR3-Fc treatment of NZB\/WF1 mice, which develop a fatal lupus-like syndrome, inhibited NF-kappaB2 processing and attenuated the disease process. Since inhibiting the BR3-BAFF interaction has therapeutic ramifications, the ligand binding interface of BR3 was investigated and found to reside within a 26 residue core domain. When stabilized within a structured beta-hairpin peptide, six of these residues were sufficient to confer binding to BAFF.","4252":"The physiologic role of eight CD19 tyrosines was examined in CD19-knockout mice expressing transgenic CD19 constructs. CD19 Y482 and Y513 were essential for normal B cell biology, including differentiation of B1 and marginal zone B cells and for T-dependent and -independent antibody responses. In immunized mice with mutations in CD19 Y482 and Y513, early germinal center B cells appeared normal in phenotype and number, but maturation in the germinal center was defective. This was associated with retarded progression through the cell cycle. Thus, Y482 and Y513 are essential for all functions of CD19 in vivo. Mutation of these reduces proliferation in germinal center B cells, providing a potential mechanism for the failure of maturation, which abrogates antibody responses.","4253":"Activating and inhibitory CD94\/NKG2 receptors regulate CTL responses by altering TCR signaling, thus modifying antigen activation thresholds set during thymic selection. To determine whether their expression was linked to TCR specificity, we examined the TCR repertoire of oligoclonal CTL expansions found in human blood and tissues. High-resolution TCR repertoire analysis revealed that commitment to inhibitory NKG2A expression was a clonal attribute developmentally acquired after TCR expression and during antigen encounter, whereas actual surface expression depended on recent TCR engagement. Further, CTL clones expressing sequence-related TCR, and therefore sharing the same antigen specificity, invariably shared the same NKG2A commitment. These findings suggest that TCR antigenic specificity dictates NKG2A commitment, which critically regulates subsequent activation of CTL.","4254":"The developmental progression from pro-B to pre-B cells is controlled by pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signaling which depends on BLNK (SLP-65) for coupling the Syk kinase to its downstream effector pathways. Here we identified BLNK as a direct target of the transcription factor Pax5 (BSAP). Restoration of BLNK expression in Ig(mu) transgenic Pax5(-\/-) pro-B cells resulted in constitutive pre-BCR signaling and increased cell proliferation without inducing progression to the pre-B cell stage. Ig(mu)(+) Pax5(-\/-) pro-B cells expressing a BLNK-estrogen receptor fusion protein initiated signaling immediately upon hormone addition, which facilitated analysis of pre-BCR-induced gene expression changes. The pre-BCR was shown to execute its checkpoint function by regulating genes involved in cell proliferation, intracellular signaling, growth factor responsiveness, and V(D)J recombination.","4255":"The first lineage commitment step of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) results in separation into distinct lymphoid and myeloid differentiation pathways, reflected in the generation of common lymphoid and myeloid progenitors (CLP and CMP, respectively). In this report we present the first evidence for a nonredundant regulator of this process, in that adult mice deficient in expression of the flt3 ligand (FL) have severely (10-fold) reduced levels of the CLP, accompanied by reductions in the earliest identifiable B and T cell progenitors. In contrast, CMP and HSC are unaffected in FL-deficient mice. Noteworthy, CLP express high levels of both the flt3 receptor and ligand, indicating a potential autocrine role of FL in regulation of the earliest lymphoid commitment step from HSC.","4256":"A major function of the B cell is the internalization of antigen through the BCR for processing and presentation to T cells. While there is evidence suggesting that lipid raft signaling may regulate internalization, the molecular machinery coordinating these two processes remains to be defined. Here we present a link between the B cell signaling and internalization machinery and show that Src-family kinase activity is required for inducible clathrin heavy chain phosphorylation, BCR colocalization with clathrin, and regulated internalization. An analysis of different B cell lines shows that BCR uptake occurs only when clathrin is associated with rafts and is tyrosine phosphorylated following BCR crosslinking. We therefore propose that lipid rafts spatially organize signaling cascades with clathrin to regulate BCR internalization.","4257":"We utilized gene targeting by homologous recombination to define the role that MEF, a transcriptional activating member of the ETS family of transcription factors, plays in lymphopoiesis. MEF-\/- mice have a profound reduction in the number of NK-T and NK cells. Purified MEF-\/- NK cells cannot lyse tumor cell targets and secrete only minimal amounts of IFNgamma. Perforin protein expression is severely impaired in MEF-deficient NK cells, likely accounting for the lack of tumor cell cytotoxicity. Promoter studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate that MEF and not ETS-1 directly regulates transcription of the perforin gene in NK cells. Our results uncover a specific role of MEF in the development and function of NK cells and in innate immunity.","4258":"While intrathymic MHC expression influences the specificity of developing thymocytes, we considered that peripheral MHC expression might influence the reactivity of postthymic T cells. We now report for CD4(+) T cells that peripheral MHC-II expression does influence their reactivity and self-tolerance. Upon transfer into MHC-II-deficient lymphopenic hosts, mature CD4(+) T cells were found to acquire an activated memory phenotype and to become: (1) autoreactive against syngeneic MHC-II(+) skin grafts, (2) hyperreactive against third-party MHC-II(+) skin grafts, and (3) functionally dysregulated, resulting in a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by intraepithelial infiltrations. Peripheral MHC-II expression appeared to influence CD4(+) T cell reactivity by two complementary mechanisms: maintenance of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (\"suppression\") and direct dampening of CD4(+) T cell reactivity (\"tuning\").","4259":"Neutrophils are released from the bone marrow in a regulated fashion to maintain homeostatic levels in the blood and to respond to physiological stresses, including infection. We show that under basal conditions granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is an essential regulator of neutrophil release from the bone marrow. Nonredundant signals generated by the membrane-proximal 87 amino acids of the G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) are sufficient to mediate this response. Surprisingly, G-CSFR expression on neutrophils is neither necessary nor sufficient for their mobilization from the bone marrow, suggesting that G-CSF induces neutrophil mobilization indirectly through the generation of trans-acting signals. Evidence is provided suggesting that downregulation of stromal cell-derived factor 1 expression in the bone marrow may represent such a signal.","4260":"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) is a leukocyte adhesion molecule involved in cell tether and rolling on activated endothelium. Our work shows that PSGL-1 associates with Syk. This association is mediated by the actin-linking proteins moesin and ezrin, which directly interact with Syk in an ITAM-dependent manner. PSGL-1 engagement induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and SRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Treatment of cells with the Syk inhibitor piceatannol and overexpression of either a Syk dead kinase mutant or an ITAM-mutated moesin abrogated PSGL-1-induced transcriptional activation. These data unveil a new functional role for the ERMs (ezrin\/radixin\/moesin) as adaptor molecules in the interactions of adhesion receptors and intracellular tyrosine kinases and show that PSGL-1 is a signaling molecule in leukocytes.","4261":"Recognition by T cells of their ligands at the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) leads to T cell activation, polarization of the T cell toward the APC, and formation of an immune synapse. Using ZAP-70-deficient T cells expressing zeta-GFP, we show that ZAP-70 signaling drives the TCR-dependent reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center thus leading to relocation of a zeta-GFP(+) intracellular compartment close to the APC. ZAP-70 is also necessary to supply the synapse with the signaling molecules PKC-theta and LAT. In contrast, ZAP-70 is not required for clustering of zeta-GFP and CD2 or exclusion of CD45 and CD43 from the synapse. These data show that ZAP-70-dependent signaling is required for formation of a functional immune synapse.","4262":"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by T cells. The involvement of IL-17 in human diseases has been suspected because of its detection in sera from asthmatic patients and synovial fluids from arthritic patients. In this study, we generated IL-17-deficient mice and investigated the role of IL-17 in various disease models. We found that contact, delayed-type, and airway hypersensitivity responses, as well as T-dependent antibody production, were significantly reduced in the mutant mice, while IL-17 deficiency of donor T cells did not affect acute graft-versus-host reaction. The results suggest that impaired responses were caused by the defects of allergen-specific T cell activation. Our findings indicate that IL-17 plays an important role in activating T cells in allergen-specific T cell-mediated immune responses.","4263":"CD4+CD3- cells are the predominant hematopoietic cells found in mouse fetal intestine. We prove their role as Peyer's patch (PP)-inducing cells by transfer into neonatal PP-deficient mice. To test the requirement of chemokines and adhesion molecules in induction of PP, we studied mice deficient in CXCR5 and\/or alpha4beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion. CXCR5-\/- mice have CD4+CD3- cells, which are inefficient in inducing PP formation. We show here that CXCR5\/CXCL13 signaling activates alpha4beta1 integrin on CD4+CD3- cells. Blocking of beta1 integrin or VCAM-1, the ligand of alpha4beta1 integrin, inhibits PP formation. This study demonstrates the link between chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules that regulates stromal\/hematopoietic cell interaction leading to PP formation.","4264":"Some exogenous antigens, such as heat shock proteins or apoptotic bodies, gain access to the MHC class I processing pathway and initiate CTL responses, a process called cross-priming. To be efficient in vivo, this process requires endocytosis of the antigen by dendritic cells via receptors which remain unidentified. Here, we report that scavenger receptors are the main HSP binding structures on human dendritic cells and identify LOX-1 as one of these molecules. A neutralizing anti-LOX-1 mAb inhibits Hsp70 binding to dendritic cells and Hsp70-induced antigen cross-presentation. In vivo, to target LOX-1 with a tumor antigen using an anti-LOX-1 mAb induces antitumor immunity. Thus, the scavenger receptor LOX-1 is certainly a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.","4265":"Marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B lymphocytes participate jointly in the early immune response against T-independent (TI) particulate antigens. Here we show that blood-derived neutrophil granulocytes and CD11c(lo) immature dendritic cells (DC) are the primary cells that efficiently capture and transport particulate bacteria to the spleen. In a systemic infection, CD11c(lo) DC, but not neutrophils, provide critical survival signals, which can be inhibited by TACI-Fc, to antigen-specific MZ B cells and promote their differentiation into IgM-secreting plasmablasts. In a local TI response, peritoneal cavity macrophages provide similar support to B1 B-derived Ag-specific blasts. In the absence of soluble TACI ligands, Ag-activated MZ- and B1-derived blasts lack survival signals and undergo apoptosis, resulting in severely impaired antibody responses.","4266":"After immunization with T cell-dependent antigens, the high-affinity B cells selected in germinal centers differentiate into memory B cells or long-lived antibody-forming cells. However, a role for germinal centers in development of these B lineage cells is still controversial. We show here that Bcl6-deficient B cells, which cannot develop germinal centers, differentiated into IgM and IgG1 memory B cells in the spleen but barely differentiated into long-lived IgG1 antibody-forming cells in the bone marrow. Mutation in the V-heavy gene was null in these memory B cells. Therefore, Bcl6 and germinal center formation are essential for somatic hypermutation, and generation of memory B cells can occur independently of germinal center formation, somatic hypermutation, and Ig class switching.","4267":"We created mice expressing transgene-encoded BCRs with \"dual reactivity\" for the hapten Ars and nuclear autoantigens. Expression of transgene-encoded BCRs was not evident in the memory compartment despite observation of transgene-expressing B cells in germinal centers following Ars immunization. In contrast, dual reactive mAbs were readily obtained from mice with enforced expression of Bcl-2 following secondary Ars immunization. However, while these mAbs were hypermutated and displayed increased affinity for Ars, all had reduced avidity for DNA and intracellular autoantigens. Thus, Bcl-2 alters dominant-negative selection of dual reactive B cells during the Ars response, but this is restricted to those with lowered autoreactivity, demonstrating a hierarchy of peripheral tolerance during memory B cell development.","4268":"With T cell receptor stimulation, intracellular pools of CD45 and spectrin move to the surface. These processes are coupled. In both peripheral lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells, betaI spectrin and ankyrin associate with CD45. In Jurkat T cells, betaI spectrin peptides suppress surface recruitment of CD45 and CD3 and abrogate T cell activation. Other glycoproteins such as CD43 are not altered by the spectrin peptides. Spectrin's effects are mediated by ankyrin, which binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (K(d) = 4.3 +\/- 3.0 nM). These data reveal a novel and unexpected contribution of the spectrin-ankyrin skeleton to the control of T lymphocyte function.","4269":"The monoclonal antibody M-DC8 defines a major subset of human blood dendritic cells (DCs). Here we identify the M-DC8 structure as 6-sulfo LacNAc, a novel carbohydrate modification of the P selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1). In contrast to previously described blood DCs, M-DC8+ DCs lack the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) on PSGL-1 and fail to bind P and E selectin. Yet they express anaphylatoxin receptors (C5aR and C3aR) and the Fcgamma receptor III (CD16), which recruit cells to inflammatory sites. While sharing with DC1 the expression of myeloid markers and a potent capacity to prime T cells in vitro, M-DC8+ DCs produce far more TNF-alpha in response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Thus, 6-sulfo LacNAc-expressing DCs appear as a novel proinflammatory DC subset.","4270":"Mice lacking the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit (c-Kit(W\/W)) have hematopoietic defects causing perinatal death. We have identified a viable c-Kit(W\/W) mouse, termed the \"Vickid\" mouse. Around birth, c-Kit plays a redundant role in T and no role in B cell development. Here, we show an age-dependent, progressive decline of pro-T and pro-B cells accompanied by loss of common lymphoid progenitors in the bone marrow in adult mice lacking c-Kit. Adult c-Kit(W\/W) hematopoietic stem cells can engraft in host bone marrow but fail to radioprotect, form spleen colonies, or establish sustained lymphopoiesis. These defects in adult T and B cell development are also evident in a second viable c-Kit(W\/W) strain, rescued by overexpression of erythropoietin.","4271":"To define the role of TRAF proteins in CD40-dependent isotype switching in B cells, we introduced wild-type (WT) and mutant CD40 transgenes that lacked the binding motifs for TRAF6 (CD40deltaTRAF6), TRAF2 and TRAF3 (CD40deltaTRAF2\/3), or both (CD40deltaTRAFs) into B cells of CD40(-\/-) mice. The in vivo isotype switch defect in CD40(-\/-) mice was fully corrected by WT and CD40deltaTRAF6, partially by CD40deltaTRAF2\/3, and not at all by CD40deltaTRAFs transgenes. CD40-mediated isotype switching, proliferation, and activation of p38, JNK, and NFkappaB in B cells were normal in WT and CD40deltaTRAF6 mice, severely impaired in CD40deltaTRAF2\/3, and absent in CD40deltaTRAFs mice. These results suggest that binding to TRAF2 and\/or TRAF3 but not TRAF6 is essential for CD40 isotype switching and activation in B cells.","4272":"We have identified a subset of genes that is specifically induced by stimulation of TLR3 or TLR4 but not by TLR2 or TLR9. Further gene expression analyses established that upregulation of several primary response genes was dependent on NF-kappaB, commonly activated by several TLRs, and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which was found to confer TLR3\/TLR4 specificity. Also identified was a group of secondary response genes which are part of an autocrine\/paracrine loop activated by the primary response gene product, interferon beta (IFNbeta). Selective activation of the TLR3\/TLR4-IRF3 pathway potently inhibited viral replication. These results suggest that TLR3 and TLR4 have evolutionarily diverged from other TLRs to activate IRF3, which mediates a specific gene program responsible for innate antiviral responses.","4273":"In order to definitively ascertain the functional contribution of lymphotoxin (LT) expressed by B cells, we produced mice with the LTbeta gene deleted from B cells (B-LTbeta KO mice). In contrast to systemic LTbeta deletion, in B-LTbeta KO mice only splenic microarchitecture was affected, while lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (PP) were normal, except for PP's reduced size. Even though B-LTbeta KO spleens retained a small number of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) which appeared to be dependent on LTbeta produced by T cells, IgG responses to sheep red blood cells were markedly reduced. Thus, the organogenic function of B-LTbeta is almost entirely restricted to spleen, where it supports the correct lymphoid architecture that is critical for an effective humoral immune response.","4274":"The first antibody produced in bacterial or viral infection results from B cell growth as plasmablasts. Dendritic cell-derived TNF-family ligands APRIL and\/or BAFF enhance plasmablast survival and differentiation to plasma cells. Expression of these ligands by dendritic cells is promoted by innate immune signals that can convert subliminal B cell activation to a productive response. While this may be lifesaving in the face of infection, it can predispose to autoantibody production.","4275":"Herpesvirus saimiri Tip associates with Lck and downregulates Lck signal transduction. Here we demonstrate that Tip targets a lysosomal protein p80, which consists of an N-terminal WD repeat domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Interaction of Tip with p80 facilitated lysosomal vesicle formation and subsequent recruitment of Lck into the lysosomes for degradation. Consequently, Tip interactions with Lck and p80 result in downregulation of T cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 surface expression. Remarkably, these actions of Tip are functionally and genetically separable: the N-terminal p80 interaction is responsible for TCR downregulation and the C-terminal Lck interaction is responsible for CD4 downregulation. Thus, lymphotropic herpesvirus has evolved an elaborate mechanism to deregulate lymphocyte receptor expression to disarm host immune control.","4276":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) respond to antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules. On most cells, these peptides are exclusively of endogenous, cytosolic origin. Bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells, however, harbor a unique pathway for MHC I presentation of exogenous antigens. This mechanism permits cross-presentation of pathogen-infected cells and the priming of CTL responses against intracellular microbial infections. Here, we report a novel diphtheria toxin-based system that allows the inducible, short-term ablation of dendritic cells (DC) in vivo. We show that in vivo DC are required to cross-prime CTL precursors. Our results thus define a unique in vivo role of DC, i.e., the sensitization of the immune system for cell-associated antigens. DC-depleted mice fail to mount CTL responses to infection with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes and the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii.","4277":"B7-1 and B7-2 are generally thought to have comparable structures and affinities for their receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4, each of which is assumed to be bivalent. We show instead (1) that B7-2 binds the two receptors more weakly than B7-1, (2) that, relative to its CTLA-4 binding affinity, B7-2 binds CD28 2- to 3-fold more effectively than B7-1, (3) that, unlike B7-1, B7-2 does not self-associate, and (4) that, in contrast to CTLA-4 homodimers, which are bivalent, CD28 homodimers are monovalent. Our results indicate that B7-1 markedly favors CTLA-4 over CD28 engagement, whereas B7-2 exhibits much less bias. We propose that the distinct structures and binding properties of B7-1 and B7-2 account for their overlapping but distinct effects on T cell responses.","4278":"CD4 T cells are pivotal for effective immunity, yet their initial differentiation into effector subsets after infection remains poorly defined. We examined CD4 T cells specific for the immunodominant Leishmania major LACK antigen using MHC\/peptide tetramers and IL-4 reporter mice. Comprising approximately 15 cells\/lymph node in naive mice, LACK-specific T cells expanded over 100-fold, and 70% acquired IL-4 expression by 96 hr. Despite their pathogenic role in susceptible mice, LACK-specific precursor frequency, expansion, and IL-4 expression were comparable between susceptible and resistant mice. When injected with unrelated antigen, Leishmania efficiently activated IL-4 expression from naive antigen-specific T cells. CD4 subset polarization in this highly characterized model occurs independently from IL-4 expression by naive T cells, which is activated indiscriminately after parasitism.","4279":"B cell terminal differentiation is associated with the onset of high-level antibody secretion and cell cycle arrest. Here the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p18(INK4c) is shown to be required within B cells for both terminating cell proliferation and differentiation of functional plasma cells. In its absence, B cells hyperproliferate in germinal centers and extrafollicular foci in response to T-dependent antigens but serum antibody titers are severely reduced, despite unimpaired germinal center formation, class switch recombination, variable region-directed hypermutation, and differentiation to antibody-containing plasmacytoid cells. The novel link between cell cycle control and plasma cell differentiation may, at least in part, relate to p18(INK4c) inhibition of CDK6. Cell cycle arrest mediated by p18(INK4C) is therefore requisite for the generation of functional plasma cells.","4280":"Lethal autoimmunity associated with IL-2Rbeta-deficient mice is prevented after thymic transgenic expression of wild-type IL-2Rbeta in IL-2Rbeta(-\/-) mice (Tg -\/- mice). Here, we show that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells were not readily detected in IL-2Rbeta(-\/-) mice, but the production of functional CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells was reconstituted in Tg -\/- mice. Adoptive transfer of normal CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells into neonatal IL-2Rbeta-deficient mice prevented this lethal autoimmune syndrome. The CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells in disease-free adult IL-2Rbeta-deficient recipient mice were present at a near normal frequency, were solely donor-derived, and depended on IL-2 for expansion. These observations indicate that the essential function of the IL-2\/IL-2R system primarily lies at the level of the production of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells.","4281":"Immunological synapse assembly relies on the clustering of lipid rafts and is required for optimal T cell activation. We demonstrate that the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is recruited to lipid rafts immediately after TCR and CD28 triggering and is required for the movements of lipid rafts. T cells from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) patients, lacking WASP, proliferate poorly after TCR\/CD28 activation and have impaired capacities to cluster the lipid raft marker GM1 and to upregulate GM1 cell surface expression. T cell proliferation and lipid raft clustering are restored by retroviral transfer of the WASP gene. These results demonstrate that WASP plays a central role in the movements of lipid rafts and identify a potential mechanism underlying the T cell defect affecting WAS patients.","4282":"Several gamma-herpesviruses encode homologs of host regulators of complement activation (RCA) proteins, suggesting that they have evolved immune evasion strategies targeting complement. We evaluated the role of complement factor C3 (C3) and the murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) RCA protein in viral pathogenesis. Deletion of the gammaHV68 RCA protein decreased virulence during acute CNS infection, and this attenuation was specifically reversed by deletion of host C3. The gammaHV68 RCA protein was also important for persistent viral replication and virulence in IFNgammaR(-\/-) mice. In addition, C3 played a role in regulating latency, but this was not counteracted by the gammaHV68 RCA protein. We conclude that complement is a key host defense against gamma-herpesvirus infection and that gamma-herpesviruses have evolved an immune evasion strategy that is effective against complement-mediated antiviral responses during acute but not latent infection.","4283":"Although it is clear that positive selection of T cells involves recognition of specific self-peptide\/MHC complexes, the nature of these self-ligands and their relationship to the cognate antigen are controversial. Here we used two complementary strategies to identify naturally occurring self-peptides able to induce positive selection of T cells bearing a specific T cell receptor, OT-I. Both the bioassay- and bioinformatics-based strategies identified the same self-peptides, derived from F-actin capping protein and beta-catenin. These peptides displayed charge conservation at two key TCR contact residues. The biological activity of 43 other self-peptides and of complex peptide libraries directly correlated to the extent of conservation at TCR contact residues. These results demonstrate that selecting self-peptides are rare and can be identified by homology-based search strategies.","4284":"Viable Lin(-) CD27(+) c-kit(Hi) Sca-1(Hi) GFP(+) cells recovered from heterozygous RAG1\/GFP knockin mice progressed through previously defined stages of B, T, and NK cell lineage differentiation. In contrast to the GFP(-) cohort, there was minimal myeloid or erythroid potential in cells with an active RAG1 locus. Partial overlap with TdT(+) cells suggested that distinctive early lymphocyte characteristics are not synchronously acquired. Rearrangement of Ig genes initiates before typical lymphoid lineage patterns of gene expression are established, and activation of the RAG1 locus transiently occurs in a large fraction of cells destined to become NK cells. These early lymphocyte progenitors (ELP) are distinct from stem cells, previously described prolymphocytes, or progenitors corresponding to other blood cell lineages.","4285":"Secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A (SIgA) is essential in protecting mucosal surfaces. It is composed of at least two monomeric IgA molecules, covalently linked through the J chain, and secretory component (SC). We show here that a dimeric\/polymeric IgA (IgA(d\/p)) is more efficient when bound to SC in protecting mice against bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. We demonstrate that SC ensures, through its carbohydrate residues, the appropriate tissue localization of SIgA by anchoring the antibody to mucus lining the epithelial surface. This in turn impacts the localization and the subsequent clearance of bacteria. Thus, SC is directly involved in the SIgA function in vivo. Therefore, binding of IgA(d\/p) to SC during the course of SIgA-mediated mucosal response constitutes a crucial step in achieving efficient protection of the epithelial barrier by immune exclusion.","4286":"The phenotype and development of T cells from transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor with specificity for insulin presented by the MHC class Ib molecule Qa-1(b) was investigated. Peripheral T cells from the transgenic mice express CD8 and, after activation, kill Qa-1(b)-positive lymphoid target cells in the presence of soluble insulin. Thymic selection requires expression of Qa-1(b) but not the dominant Qa-1-associated peptide, Qdm. In contrast to conventional T cells, selection is at least as efficient when the selecting ligand is expressed only on hematopoietic lineage cells as compared to expression on epithelial cells in the thymus. Our findings suggest that there is a dedicated population of Qa-1-restricted T cells that are selected by interaction with Qa-1 and that the cellular requirements for selection may differ from conventional T cells.","4287":"Murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a useful model for the demyelinating, autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis. In the EAE system, the immunodominant N-terminal epitope of myelin basic protein (MBP) is an unusually short, weakly binding peptide antigen which elicits highly biased TCR chain usage. In the 2.2 A crystal structure of I-A(u)\/MBP1-11 complex, only MBP residues 1-7 are bound toward one end of the peptide binding cleft. The fourth residue of MBP1-11 is located in an incompatible p6 pocket of I-A(u), thus explaining the short half-life of I-A(u) complexed with Ac1-11. MBP peptides extended at the C terminus of Ac1-11 result in dramatic affinity increases, likely attributed to register shifting to a higher affinity cryptic epitope, which could potentially mask the presentation of the immunodominant MBP1-11 peptide during thymic education.","4288":"Memory T cells differ from naive T cells in that they respond more rapidly and in greater numbers. In addition, memory T cells are generally believed to be less susceptible to tolerance induction than naive T cells. In this study, we show that this is not the case. Using two different methods of tolerance induction, peptide-induced tolerance and crosstolerance, we present evidence that memory CD8(+) T cells are as susceptible to tolerance as naive cells. These results have a direct impact on manipulating T cell responses to self-antigens in order to improve immunotherapy of cancer and autoimmune diseases.","4289":"STAT3 has been described as an essential component of G-CSF-driven cell proliferation and granulopoiesis. This notion was tested by conditional gene ablation in transgenic mice. Contrary to expectation, granulocytes developed from STAT3 null bone marrow progenitors, and STAT3 null neutrophils displayed mature effector functions. Rather than a deficit in granulopoiesis, mice lacking STAT3 in their hematopoietic progenitors developed neutrophilia, and bone marrow cells were hyperresponsive to G-CSF stimulation. These studies provide direct evidence for STAT3-independent granulopoiesis and suggest that STAT3 directs a negative feedback loop necessary for controlling neutrophil numbers, possibly through induced expression of the signaling inhibitor, SOCS3.","4290":"Blimp-1, a transcriptional repressor, drives the terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells. Using DNA microarrays, we found that introduction of Blimp-1 into B cells blocked expression of a remarkably large set of genes, while a much smaller number was induced. Blimp-1 initiated this cascade of gene expression changes by directly repressing genes encoding several transcription factors, including Spi-B and Id3, that regulate signaling by the B cell receptor. Blimp-1 also inhibited immunoglobulin class switching by blocking expression of AID, Ku70, Ku86, DNA-PKcs, and STAT6. These findings suggest that Blimp-1 promotes plasmacytic differentiation by extinguishing gene expression important for B cell receptor signaling, germinal center B cell function, and proliferation while allowing expression of important plasma cell genes such as XBP-1.","4291":"Differentiation of naive T cells into mature Th2 cells is associated with the appearance of a complex pattern of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites within the IL-4\/IL-13 cytokine gene cluster. We show here that targeted deletion of an inducible DH site, V(A), and the adjacent conserved DH site V (CNS-2) selectively compromises IL-4 gene transcription by differentiated Th2 cells and mast cells. In mast cells, the deletion abrogates IL-4 mRNA induction, an effect mimicked by deletion of the transcription factor NFAT1 (NFATc2), which binds DH site V(A). In T cells, the deletion impairs a process of response maturation, defined by progressive increases in IL-4 levels as Th2 differentiation proceeds. These results identify an essential enhancer which regulates IL-4 gene expression in two important cell lineages in vivo.","4292":"Initiation of nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) development is independent of the programmed cytokine cascade necessary for the formation of Peyer's patches (PP) and peripheral lymph nodes (PLN), a cytokine cascade which consists of IL-7R, LTalpha1beta2\/LTbetaR, and NIK. However, the subsequent organization of NALT seems to be controlled by these cytokine signaling cascades since the maturation of NALT structure is generally incomplete in those cytokine cascade-deficient mice. NALT as well as PP and PLN are completely absent in Id2(-\/-) mice. NALT organogenesis is initiated following the adoptive transfer of CD3(-)CD4(+)CD45(+) cells into Id2(-\/-) mice, constituting direct evidence that CD3(-)CD4(+)CD45(+) inducer cells can provide an IL-7R-, LTalpha1beta2\/LTbetaR-, and NIK-independent tissue organogenesis pathway for secondary lymphoid tissue development.","4293":"Little is known concerning the stimulatory receptors responsible for tumor cell lysis by NK cells. We generated a monoclonal antibody specific for murine NKG2D in order to investigate its function. Blocking of NKG2D inhibited natural cytotoxicity of all tumor cells tested that express ligands for the receptor. Staining analysis showed that NKG2D is also expressed by activated CD8(+) T cells and macrophages, and subsets of TCRgammadelta(+) and NK1.1(+) T cells. Contradicting reports that NKG2D is solely a costimulatory receptor, we observed that cross-linking of NKG2D directly stimulates NK cells and activated macrophages. In contrast, NKG2D costimulates activated CD8(+) T cells. Thus, NKG2D engagement directly stimulates NK cells and macrophages, costimulates CD8(+) T cells, and plays a substantial role in natural killing.","4294":"Functional redundancy is highly prevalent among the Th2 interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13. To define the critical functions of these cytokines, we have generated a novel panel of compound Th2 cytokine-deficient mice (from single to quadruple cytokine knockouts). We find that these Th2 cytokines are not essential for fetal survival even during allogeneic pregnancy. Using intestinal parasite infection and a pulmonary granuloma model, we demonstrate cryptic roles for IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 in these responses. Significantly, although IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 add to the speed and magnitude of the response, a threshold is reached at which IL-4 alone can activate all Th2 effector functions. These mice reveal distinct spatial, temporal, and hierarchical cytokine requirements in immune function.","4295":"The importance of CD8 T cells in the pathogenesis of organ-specific autoimmune diseases has not previously been well recognized. Recent evidence, however, indicates that autoreactive CD8 T cells can contribute substantially to tissue damage in both murine and human autoimmune disorders. As such, these T cells now become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.","4296":"Threshold levels of individual NFAT factors appear to be critical for apoptosis induction in effector T cells. In these cells, the short isoform A of NFATc1 is induced to high levels due to the autoregulation of the NFATc1 promoter P1 by NFATs. P1 is located within a CpG island in front of exon 1, represents a DNase I hypersensitive chromatin site, and harbors several sites for binding of inducible transcription factors, including a tandemly arranged NFAT site. A second promoter, P2, before exon 2, is not controlled by NFATs and directs synthesis of the longer NFATc1\/B+C isoforms. Contrary to other NFATs, NFATc1\/A is unable to promote apoptosis, suggesting that NFATc1\/A enhances effector functions without promoting apoptosis of effector T cells.","4297":"Notch proteins influence cell fate decisions in many developmental systems. During lymphoid development, Notch1 signaling is essential to direct a bipotent T\/B precursor toward the T cell fate, but the role of Notch1 at later stages of T cell development remains controversial. We have recently reported that tissue-specific inactivation of Notch1 in immature (CD44(-) CD25(+)) thymocytes does not affect subsequent T cell development. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Notch1 signaling at an earlier (CD44(+)CD25(+)) developmental stage results in severe perturbation of alpha beta but not gamma delta lineage development. Immature Notch1(-\/-) thymocytes show impaired VDJ beta rearrangement and aberrant pre-TCR-independent survival. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Notch1 controls several nonredundant functions necessary for alpha beta lineage development.","4298":"Complement and Fc receptor (FcR)-positive cells mediate effector functions of antibodies. Antibody-dependent immunity against the melanosome membrane glycoprotein gp75\/tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP-1) of melanocytes leads to autoimmune hypopigmentation (vitiligo) in mice. Hypopigmentation occurred in mice deficient in activating FcR containing the common gamma subunit (Fc gamma R gamma(-\/-)) and in mice deficient in the C3 complement component. Mice doubly deficient in both Fc gamma R gamma and C3 did not develop hypopigmentation, suggesting that complement and Fc gamma R formed redundant mechanisms. Following passive immunization with antibody, no further adaptive immune responses were required. Chimeric Fc gamma R gamma(-\/-),C3(-\/-) mice reconstituted with bone marrow from either Fc gamma R gamma(-\/-) or C3(-\/-) mice or adoptively transferred with Fc gamma R gamma(+\/-) macrophages did develop antibody-mediated hypopigmentation. Thus, either complement or macrophages expressing activating Fc gamma R can independently and alternatively mediate disease in a model of autoimmune vitiligo.","4299":"Tick saliva has pleiotropic properties that facilitate persistence of the arthropod upon the host. We now describe a feeding-inducible protein in Ixodes scapularis saliva, Salp15, that inhibits CD4(+) T cell activation. The mechanism involves the repression of calcium fluxes triggered by TCR ligation and results in lower production of interleukin-2. Salp15 also inhibits the development of CD4(+) T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo, demonstrating the functional importance of this protein. Salp15 provides a molecular basis for understanding the immunosuppressive activity of I. scapularis saliva and vector-host interactions.","4300":"The immunological synapse formed during mature T cell activation consists of a central cluster of TCR and MHC molecules surrounded by a ring of LFA-1 and ICAM-1. We examined synapse formation in thymocytes undergoing activation in a lipid bilayer system by following the movement of fluorescent MHC and ICAM-1 molecules. Immature CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes formed a decentralized synapse with multiple foci of MHC accumulation corresponding to areas of exclusion of ICAM-1. The MHC clusters and ICAM-1 holes were mobile and transient and correlated with active and sustained signaling, as shown by staining with antibodies against phosphotyrosine and activated Lck. Our findings show that signaling in immature thymocytes can result from a novel, multifocal pattern of receptor accumulation.","4301":"Alpha beta and gamma delta T cells are distinguished by the clonotypic subunits contained within their TCRs. Although the alpha beta TCR has been well characterized, much less is known about the gamma delta TCR. Here, we report that, unlike alpha beta T CRs, most gamma delta TCRs expressed on ex vivo gamma delta T cells lack CD3 delta. Despite this structural difference, signal transduction by the gamma delta TCR is superior to that of the alpha beta TCR, as measured by its ability to induce calcium mobilization, ERK activation, and cellular proliferation. Additionally, the TCR complexes expressed on primary gamma delta T cells contain only zeta zeta homodimers; however, following activation and expansion, Fc epsilon R1 gamma is expressed and is included in the gamma delta TCR complex. These results reveal fundamental differences in the primary structure and signaling potential of the alpha beta- and gamma delta TCR complexes.","4302":"Regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell homeostasis is crucial for maintenance of innate immunity and the ability of the body to respond to injury and infection. In this report, we demonstrate that progenitor cell numbers and cycling status in vivo are dramatically increased in mice deficient in Stat6 and decreased in mice deficient in Stat4, targeted mutations which also alter T helper cell polarization. Experiments using mice that have T cell restricted transgenic expression of Stat4 or Stat6 or have been in vivo depleted of T cell subsets demonstrate that CD4(+) T cells regulate progenitor cell activity. Injection of the Th1 cytokine Oncostatin M but not other cytokines into Stat4-deficient mice recovers progenitor cell activity to wild-type levels. Thus, T helper cells actively regulate hematopoietic progenitor cell homeostasis.","4303":"T cell differentiation and repertoire selection depend critically on several distinct thymic epithelial cell types, whose lineage relationships are unclear. We have investigated these relationships via functional analysis of the epithelial populations within the thymic primordium. Here, we show that mAbs MTS20 and MTS24 identify a population of cells that, when purified and grafted ectopically, can differentiate into all known thymic epithelial cell types, attract lymphoid progenitors, and support CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell development in nude mice. In contrast, other epithelial populations in the thymic primordium can fulfill none of these functions. These data establish that the MTS20(+)24(+) population is sufficient to generate a functional thymus in vivo and thus argue strongly that all thymic epithelial cell types derive from a common progenitor cell.","4304":"IgM and IgA to the Cryptococcus neoformans capsular glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) promote complement-independent phagocytosis by macrophages with efficiency comparable to that of IgG1. IgM- and IgA-mediated phagocytosis of C. neoformans was proportional to CR3 expression, inhibited by Abs to CR3 (CD11b\/CD18) and CR4 (CD11c\/CD18), and dramatically reduced with macrophages of CD18-deficient mice. IgM and IgA promoted ingestion of yeast cells by CHO cells expressing CR3 and CR4. In contrast, IgG1-mediated phagocytosis was only partially inhibited by Abs to CR3 and CR4. Phagocytosis by IgM and IgA but not IgG1 was inhibited by soluble GXM, which binds CD18. Involvement of CR in antibody-mediated complement-independent phagocytosis indicates a new link between innate and adaptive immune systems.","4305":"An efficient Th1-driven adaptive immune response requires activation of the T cell receptor and secretion of the T cell stimulatory cytokine IL-12 by activated antigen-presenting cells. IL-12 triggers Th1 polarization of naive CD4(+) T cells and secretion of IFN-gamma. We describe a new heterodimeric cytokine termed IL-27 that consists of EBI3, an IL-12p40-related protein, and p28, a newly discovered IL-12p35-related polypeptide. IL-27 is an early product of activated antigen-presenting cells and drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4(+) T cells. It also strongly synergizes with IL-12 to trigger IFN-gamma production of naive CD4(+) T cells. IL-27 mediates its biologic effects through the orphan cytokine receptor WSX-1\/TCCR.","4306":"Lymphocyte activation initiates a program of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation that increases metabolic demand. Although T cells increase glucose uptake and glycolysis during an immune response, the signaling pathways that regulate these increases remain largely unknown. Here we show that CD28 costimulation, acting through phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, is required for T cells to increase their glycolytic rate in response to activation. Furthermore, CD28 controls a primary response pathway, inducing a level of glucose uptake and glycolysis in excess of that needed to maintain cellular ATP\/ADP levels or macromolecular synthesis. These data suggest that CD28 costimulation functions to increase glycolytic flux, allowing T cells to anticipate energetic and biosynthetic needs associated with a sustained response.","4307":"At the end of the T cell response, the majority of the activated T cells die. We activated Vbeta8(+) T cells with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in vivo and monitored the expansion and deletion of Vbeta8(+) T cells. We found that, in response to SEB, activated T cells died in vivo in the absence of Fas or TNF-R signaling but not when they overexpressed human Bcl-2. We also found that Vbeta8(+) T cells from Bim-deficient mice are resistant to SEB-induced deletion. While Bim levels did not change, endogenous Bcl-2 levels within Vbeta8(+) T cells decrease following SEB injection. Thus, the death of superantigen-stimulated T cells in vivo is mediated by Bim and may be modulated by a decrease in Bcl-2.","4308":"Tight control of Th1 immunity is essential to prevent immunopathology. Central to control of the IFN-gamma gene is the transcription factor T-bet, whose induction is Stat-1 dependent. IL-12 is dominant in directing Th1 development, while synergizing with IL-18 for IFNgamma production from differentiated Th1 cells. In this issue of Immunity, IL-27 is described, which acts in synergy with IL-12 early in Th1 development from naive T cells via the receptor TCCR\/WSX-1. We review the coordination of these checkpoints in Th1 development and function.","4309":"We have used latent infection with the human herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus to track the dispersal of memory B cells from the mucosal lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring (tonsils\/adenoids). EBV is evenly distributed between the memory compartments of Waldeyer's ring and the peripheral blood. However, it has an approximately 20-fold higher preference for Waldeyer's ring over the spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes. These observations are consistent with a model whereby the virus preferentially establishes persistent infection within memory B cells from Waldeyer's ring. The virus then colonizes the entire peripheral lymphoid system, at a low level, by trafficking with these memory B cells as they circulate through the body and back to Waldeyer's ring. This pathway may reflect that of normal memory B cells derived from nasopharyngeal and other mucosal lymph nodes.","4310":"IL-4 is important in Th2 differentiation and in cell expansion. Stat6 is necessary and sufficient for both functions. Although Gata3 is critical for Th2 polarization, it is not sufficient to mediate IL-4-driven cell expansion. We report that growth factor independent-1 (Gfi-1), a Stat6-dependent transcriptional repressor, strikingly increases Th2 cell expansion by promoting proliferation and preventing apoptosis. Cells infected with a Gfi-1 retrovirus show striking enhancement of IL-2-induced Stat5 phosphorylation and repression of p27(Kip-1) expression, suggesting a potential mechanism for the Gfi-1 growth effect. The synergy of Gfi-1 and Gata3 provides a mechanism through which IL-4 could selectively promote Th2 cell expansion.","4311":"We followed the fate of K(d)- or I-A(g7)-restricted beta cell-autoreactive T cells in monoclonal TCR-transgenic NOD mice expressing or lacking CD154. 8.3-NOD.RAG-2(-\/-)\/CD154(-\/-) mice, which bear autoreactive CD8(+) T cells, developed diabetes with the same incidence and tempo as 8.3-NOD.RAG-2(-\/-)\/CD154(+) mice. Recruitment of CD154(-\/-) 8.3-CD8(+) CTL was accelerated by CD154(+)CD4(+) T cells, by expression of a B7.1 transgene in beta cells or by treatment of the mice with CpG-DNA or an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody. In contrast, the autoreactive CD4(+) T cells maturing in 4.1-NOD.RAG-2(-\/-) mice lost their diabetogenic potential if they lacked CD154, even in the presence of CD154(+)CD4(+) T cells, B7.1 molecules on beta cells, CpG-DNA treatment, or systemic CD40 ligation. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel, CD154-dependent pathway of CD4(+) T cell activation that is independent of CD40-mediated activation of APCs.","4312":"Editing of autoreactive antigen receptors by secondary V(D)J recombination efficiently rescues B lymphocyte precursors from apoptosis induced by negative selection, but its role has not been rigorously assessed in T cell development. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse model in which self-reactive thymocytes could edit their TCR by secondary recombination at the TCR alpha locus. For this purpose, the V alpha J alpha exon of a male-specific TCR was inserted into the TCR alpha locus followed by Cre-loxP-mediated deletion of the TCR delta locus. In this model, only few thymocytes escaped negative selection by change of specificity, probably through recombination before encounter of autoantigen. In the absence of the restricting MHC element, however, developing thymocytes replaced the inserted TCR alpha exon efficiently.","4313":"Endocytosed microbial antigens are primarily delivered to lysosomal compartments where antigen binding to MHC and CD1 molecules occurs in an acidic and proteolytically active environment. Signal-dependent delivery to lysosomes has been suggested for these antigen-presenting molecules, but molecular interactions with vesicular coat proteins and adaptors that direct their lysosomal sorting are poorly understood. Here CD1b but not other CD1 isoforms bound the AP-3 adaptor protein complex. In AP-3-deficient cells derived from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS-2), CD1b failed to efficiently gain access to lysosomes, resulting in a profound defect in antigen presentation. Since MHC class II traffics normally in AP-3-deficient cells, defects in CD1b antigen presentation may account for recurrent bacterial infections in HPS-2 patients.","4314":"The heat shock (HS) response is a universal response activated after exposure to various stimuli. The major HS protein (HSP) is the 72 kDa HSP70 with strong homology in different eukaryotic species. We demonstrate that HS treatment of mice leads to a strong induction of HSP70 in several organs and confers significant protection against lethality induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). HS prevents high production of interleukin-6 and nitric oxide and reduces severe damage and apoptosis of the enterocytes in the bowel. Mice deficient in the inducible hsp70.1 gene were no longer protected by HS treatment. We show that HS can be applied successfully in an antitumor protocol based on TNF and interferon-gamma, leading to a significant inhibition of lethality but not to a reduction of antitumoral capacity.","4315":"The emergence of the first adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during mammalian ontogeny has been under intense investigation. It is as yet unresolved whether these first HSCs are derived from intraembryonic hemangioblasts, hemogenic endothelial cells, or other progenitors. Thus, to examine the spatial generation of functional HSCs within the mouse embryo, we used the well-known HSC marker, Sca-1, and a transgenic approach with an Ly-6A (Sca-1) GFP marker gene. Our results show that this transgene marker is expressed in all functional HSCs in the midgestation aorta. Immunohistology of aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) regions show that GFP(+) cells are specifically localized to the endothelial layer lining the wall of the dorsal aorta but not to the mesenchyme, strongly suggesting that HSC activity arises within a few cells within the endothelium of the major vasculature.","4316":"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are first found in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and vitelline and umbilical arteries of the midgestation mouse embryo. Runx1 (AML1), the DNA binding subunit of a core binding factor, is required for the emergence and\/or subsequent function of HSCs. We show that all HSCs in the embryo express Runx1. Furthermore, HSCs in Runx1(+\/-) embryos are heterogeneous and include CD45(+) cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells. Comparison with wild-type embryos showed that the distribution of HSCs among these various cell populations is sensitive to Runx1 dosage. These data provide the first morphological description of embryonic HSCs and contribute new insight into their cellular origin.","4317":"The relation of CpG methylation to gene silencing is well established, but the contribution of DNA demethylation to gene expression during cell differentiation remains unclear. We show that the IL-4 locus undergoes a complex series of methylation and demethylation steps during T helper cell differentiation. The 5' region of the IL-4 locus is hypermethylated in naive T cells and becomes specifically demethylated in Th2 cells, whereas a highly conserved DNase I-hypersensitive region at the 3' end shows the converse behavior, being hypomethylated in naive T cells and becoming methylated during Th1 differentiation. 5' demethylation is not required for chromatin remodeling or primary transcription of the IL-4 gene but is strongly associated with efficient, high-level induction of IL-4 transcripts by differentiated Th2 cells.","4318":"The developmental and subset-specific expression of the CD8 genes is under the control of a complex array of regulatory elements distributed along the locus and characterized by DNaseI hypersensitivity. Here we describe the phenotype of mice in which hypersensitive sites 1 and 2 (HSS1 and 2) of DNaseI hypersensitive Cluster II (CII), which are located upstream of the CD8 alpha gene, were deleted by targeted homologous recombination of the endogenous locus. Knockout mice exhibit a variegated expression of the CD8 alpha gene, particularly among the immature CD4(+)8(+) TCR(lo) thymocyte population. We propose that HSS Cluster II regulatory elements are essential in ensuring initiation of chromatin remodeling and establishment of an open configuration in all developing thymocytes that undergo the double-negative to double-positive transition. Furthermore, these sequences contribute to the levels of expression of the CD8 alpha gene.","4319":"Developmental stage-, subset-, and lineage-specific CD8 enhancers have been identified recently by transgenic reporter analyses. Enhancer E8(II) (CIV-4,5) is active in both immature double-positive thymocytes (DP) and mature CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes and T cells, whereas E8(I) (CIII-1,2) directs expression only in mature cells. In mice lacking either E8(I) (CIII-1,2) or E8(II) (CIV-4,5), there was no effect on CD8 expression in DP thymocytes. However, deletion of both enhancers resulted in variegated expression of CD8, with appearance of CD4(+)CD8(-) SP thymocytes expressing surface markers characteristic of DP thymocytes. Consequently, fewer mature CD8(+) T cells developed from the reduced pool of DP cells. These results suggest that the initiation of CD8 expression is mediated by cis-regulatory elements that are distinct from any that may be involved in maintenance of expression.","4320":"An important but laborious approach to understanding the concepts underlying T cell lineage commitment is to characterize the cis-acting control elements governing the expression of CD4 and CD8. Previous studies on the CD4 gene have shown that lineage commitment information is directed by the intronic silencer; however, a similarly simple mechanism for controlling CD8 gene expression has not been uncovered. In this issue of Immunity, two groups have investigated the role of putative enhancers in the CD8 locus. The deletion of three different elements in the intergeneic region between CD8 beta and CD8 alpha provides evidence for control at the level of chromatin accessibility.","4321":"To assess the role of the DNA-PKcs nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) protein in Ig heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR), we assayed CSR ability of DNA-PKcs-deficient (DP-T) B cells generated via complementation of DP-T mice with Ig heavy chain and light chain knock-in transgenes (DP-T\/HC\/LC mice). DP-T\/HC\/LC mice were severely deficient for all serum IgH isotypes except IgM and, unexpectedly, IgG1. Upon appropriate stimulation, DP-T\/HC\/LC B cells showed normal proliferation, germline C(H) gene transcription, and AID induction, indicating that DNA-PKcs deficiency did not affect cellular events upstream to CSR. Yet, in vitro activated DP-T\/HC\/LC B cells again underwent switching only to IgG1 and, like wild-type cells, frequently underwent CSR to gamma1 on both chromosomes. We conclude that DNA-PKcs is required for CSR to most C(H) genes but that CSR to gamma1 occurs via a DNA-PKcs-independent mechanism.","4322":"TCR signaling can result in cell fates ranging from activation to tolerance to apoptosis. Organization of molecules in an \"immunological synapse\" between mature T cells and APCs correlates with the strength of TCR signaling. To investigate synapse formation during thymic selection, we have established a reaggregate system in which molecular recruitment of GFP fusion proteins to thymocyte:stromal cell interfaces can be visualized in real time. We demonstrate that negative selection is associated with efficient conjugate formation and rapid recruitment of p56(lck) and CD3zeta to an immunological synapse. Interestingly, CD3zeta-GFP does not accumulate at the center of the synapse, as in mature T cells, but at the periphery across a wide range of ligand densities. This implicates differences in synapse geometry in initiation of alternate signals downstream of the TCR.","4323":"NKT cells are specialized cells of the immune system that bear both T cell and NK cell markers. Classical NKT cells display TCRs of restricted heterogeneity (Valpha14-Jalpha281) and recognize lipid antigens (e.g., alpha-galactosyl ceramide) presented by nonpolymorphic CD1 molecules. Recently, other nonclassical NKT subsets have been recognized, including NKT cells not reactive with CD1d-alpha-galactosyl ceramide complexes. The biological functions of these cells are unknown. Here, we show that nonclassical NKT cells that are CD1d restricted but nonreactive to alpha-GalCer are activated in response to hepatocytes expressing hepatitis B viral antigens in a transgenic mouse model of acute hepatitis B virus infection. Our results document the first in vivo function for such nonclassical NKT cells and suggest a role for these cells in the host response to HBV infection.","4324":"Among 631 substitutions present in 90 nurse shark immunoglobulin light chain somatic mutants, 338 constitute 2-4 bp stretches of adjacent changes. An absence of mutations in perinatal sequences and the bias for one mutating V gene in adults suggest that the diversification is antigen dependent. The substitutions shared no patterns, and the absence of donor sequences, including from family members, supports the idea that most changes arose from nontemplated mutation. The tandem mutations as a group are distinguished by consistently fewer transition changes and an A bias. We suggest this is one of several pathways of hypermutation diversifying shark antigen-receptor genes--point mutations, tandem mutations, and mutations with a G-C preference--that coevolved with or preceded gene rearrangement.","4325":"IFNalpha\/beta, IL-12, and IL-15 regulate NK cell activation and expansion, but signals triggering resolution of the NK response upon induction of adaptive immunity remain to be defined. We now report that IL-21, a product of activated T cells, may serve this function. Mice lacking IL-21R (IL-21R(-\/-)) had normal NK cell development but no detectable responses to IL-21. IL-21 enhanced cytotoxic activity and IFNgamma production by activated murine NK cells but did not support their viability, thus limiting their duration of activation. Furthermore, IL-21 blocked IL-15-induced expansion of resting NK cells, thus preventing the initiation of further innate responses. In contrast, IL-21 enhanced the proliferation, IFNgamma production, and cytotoxic function of CD8(+) effector T cells in an allogeneic MLR. These observations suggest that IL-21 promotes the transition between innate and adaptive immunity.","4326":"The Syk tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in the signaling machinery of various receptors of the adaptive immune system. Here we show that Syk is also an essential component of integrin signaling in neutrophils. syk(-\/-) neutrophils failed to undergo respiratory burst, degranulation, or spreading in response to proinflammatory stimuli while adherent to immobilized integrin ligands or when stimulated by direct crosslinking of integrins. Signaling from the beta(1), beta(2), or beta(3) integrins was defective in syk(-\/-) cells. Syk colocalized with CD18 during cell spreading and initiated downstream signaling events leading to actin polymerization. Surprisingly, these defects in integrin-mediated activation did not impair the integrin-dependent in vitro or in vivo migration of syk(-\/-) neutrophils or of cells deficient in Src-family kinases. Thus, integrins use different signaling mechanisms to support migration and adherent activation.","4327":"Autoreactive B cells that appear to be inactivated can be found in healthy individuals. In this study, we examined the potential of these anergic cells to become activated. We show that anergy of anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) B cells in BALB\/c mice is readily reversed, requiring only the provision of T cell help. We further show that spontaneous loss of anergy among anti-dsDNA B cells in autoimmune lpr\/lpr mice occurs in two phases: an abortive initial response to T help followed by full loss of tolerance. Strikingly, the abortive response can be reproduced in nonautoimmune mice when CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells are administered in conjunction with CD4+ T helper cells, suggesting that loss of B cell tolerance may require both the production of T cell help and the overcoming of T suppression.","4328":"The diverse effects of TCR agonists and antagonists on T cell activation are believed to be modified by the differential recruitment of CD4 or CD8 coreceptors to the TCR-MHCp complex. We used three-dimensional live cell imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CD3zeta and CD4 fused to variants of the green fluorescent protein to investigate TCR-CD4 interactions during T cell activation. We demonstrate that recognition of agonist MHCp complexes triggers intermolecular interaction between CD4 and TCR, detectable across the T-hybridoma-APC contact area. This interaction is blocked by the presence of antagonist ligands without decreasing the recruitment of zeta and CD4 or preventing their partial colocalization in the immunological synapse.","4329":"The loading of MHC class I molecules with their peptide cargo is undertaken by a multimolecular peptide loading complex within the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that MHC class I molecules can optimize their peptide repertoire over time and that this process is dependent on tapasin. Optimization of the peptide repertoire is both quantitatively and qualitatively improved by tapasin. The extent of optimization is maximal when MHC class I molecules are allowed to load within the fully assembled peptide loading complex. Finally, we identify a single natural polymorphism (116D&gt;Y) in HLA-B*4402 that permits tapasin-independent loading of HLA-B*4405 (116Y). In the presence of tapasin, the tapasin-independent allele B*4405 (116Y) acquires a repertoire of peptides that is less optimal than the tapasin-dependent allele B*4402 (116D).","4330":"This study addresses the biological function of the p53-effector genes Gadd45a and p21 in the immune system. We find that Gadd45a is a negative regulator of T cell proliferation because, compared to wild-type cells, Gadd45a(-\/-) T cells have a lower threshold of activation and proliferate to a greater extent following primary T cell receptor stimulation. Gadd45a(-\/-) mice develop an autoimmune disease, similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by high titers of anti-dsDNA, anti-ssDNA, and anti-histone autoantibodies, severe hematological disorders, autoimmune glomerulonephritis, and premature death. Here we show that the lack of both Gadd45a and p21 dramatically accelerates the development of autoimmunity observed in each individual single-gene disruption mutant, demonstrating that these genes play nonredundant roles in the immune response.","4331":"The viral Nef protein is important for the progression of the human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV\/SIV) infection. So far, experimental evidence has suggested that Nef enhances viral replication and infectivity through a combination of different effects. Recent insights, however, indicate that its functions are more complex than previously anticipated. By targeting the T cell receptor, Nef may not only prime viral replication but, more importantly, ensure viral survival through distinct mechanisms of immune evasion and antiapoptosis.","4332":"DR3 is a death domain-containing receptor that is upregulated during T cell activation and whose overexpression induces apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation in cell lines. Here we show that an endothelial cell-derived TNF-like factor, TL1A, is a ligand for DR3 and decoy receptor TR6\/DcR3 and that its expression is inducible by TNF and IL-1alpha. TL1A induces NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis in DR3-expressing cell lines, while TR6-Fc protein antagonizes these signaling events. Interestingly, in T cells, TL1A acts as a costimulator that increases IL-2 responsiveness and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that interaction of TL1A with DR3 promotes T cell expansion during an immune response, whereas TR6 has an opposing effect.","4333":"Several experimental evidences suggested that beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is important for their function in the bone marrow (BM). Using induced deletion of the beta1 integrin gene restricted to the hematopoietic system, we show that beta1 integrin is not essential for HSC retention in the BM, hematopoiesis, and trafficking of lymphocytes. However, immunization with a T cell-dependent antigen resulted in virtually no IgM production and an increased secretion of IgG in mutant mice, while the response to a T cell-independent type 2 antigen showed decreases in both IgM and IgG. These data suggest that beta1 integrins are necessary for the primary IgM antibody response.","4334":"Many mammalian genes, including those encoding antigen receptors, contain more than one enhancer element. Deleting one element often does not prevent expression, but functional redundancy has never been directly demonstrated by gene targeting of multiple elements. We demonstrate that simultaneous deletion of two enhancer\/LCR-like elements in the TCR Cgamma1 cluster, HsA and 3'E(Cgamma1), severely diminishes TCRgamma transcription, selectively impairs development of gammadelta thymocyte subsets, but only modestly reduces TCRgamma gene rearrangement, while deletion of each element separately has little effect. In contrast to these results in thymocytes, deletion of HsA alone reduces transcription of one Vgamma gene specifically in peripheral gammadelta T cells. Thus, the two elements exhibit functional redundancy in thymocytes but also have unique functions in other settings.","4335":"Mast cells are key regulators in allergy and inflammation, and release histamine upon clustering of their IgE receptors. Here we demonstrate that murine mast cell responses are exacerbated in vitro and in vivo by autocrine signals through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and require functional phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma). Adenosine, acting through the A(3) adenosine receptor (A(3)AR) as well as other agonists of G(alphai)-coupled GPCRs, transiently increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) exclusively via PI3Kgamma. PI3Kgamma-derived PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) was instrumental for initiating a sustained influx of external Ca(2+) and degranulation. Mice lacking PI3Kgamma did not form edema after intradermal injection of adenosine and when challenged by passive systemic anaphylaxis. PI3Kgamma thus relays inflammatory signals through various G(i)-coupled receptors and is central to mast cell function.","4336":"IL-12-deficient mice exposed to nonlethal infections with intracellular pathogens or repeatedly immunized with a pathogen extract developed lowered but nevertheless substantial numbers of IFN-gamma(+) CD4(+) T cells compared to those observed in wild-type animals. Moreover, the CD4(+) responses in these knockout animals failed to default to a Th2 pattern. The protective efficacy of the Th1 cells developing in an IL-12-deficient setting was found to be limited by IL-10 since mice doubly deficient in IL-10 and IL-12 survived, while animals deficient in IL-12 alone succumbed to pathogen challenge. In contrast to IL-12 knockout mice, MyD88-deficient animals exposed to a Th1 microbial stimulus developed a pure Th2 response, arguing that this signaling element plays a more critical function than IL-12 in determining pathogen-induced CD4 polarization.","4337":"The mechanism underlying perforin (PFN)-dependent delivery of apoptotic granzymes during cytotoxic cell granule-mediated death remains speculative. Granzyme B (GrB) and perforin were found to coexist as multimeric complexes with the proteoglycan serglycin (SG) in cytotoxic granules, and cytotoxic cells were observed to secrete exclusively macromolecular GrB-SG. Contrary to the view that PFN acts as a gateway for granzymes through the plasma membrane, monomeric PFN and, strikingly, PFN-SG complexes were shown to mediate cytosolic delivery of macromolecular GrB-SG without producing detectable plasma membrane pores. These results indicate that granule-mediated apoptosis represents a phenomenon whereby the target cell perceives granule contents as a multimeric complex consisting of SG, PFN, and granzymes, which are, respectively, the scaffold, translocator, and targeting\/informational components of this modular delivery system.","4338":"Systemic treatment with antibody to CD40 ligand (aCD40L) can prevent autoimmunity and transplant rejection in several animal models and is currently under evaluation in clinical trials. While it is known that aCD40L administration inhibits expansion and effector functions of aggressive T cells, it is still unclear whether additional regulatory mechanisms are operative. Here we demonstrate that a single episode of CD40L blockade during development of the autoaggressive immune response completely prevented autoimmune disease in the RIP-LCMV mouse model for virally induced type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, protection could be transferred by a highly potent, bitypic cell population sharing phenotypic and functional properties of both natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells (DC). Furthermore, protection of prediabetic recipients was autoantigen specific and did not result in generalized immunosuppression. The origin, function, and therapeutic potential of these bitypic NK\/DC regulatory cells is discussed.","4339":"The high-affinity receptor for IgG, FcgammaRI, shares its capacity to bind IgG2a immune complexes (IgG2a-IC) with the low-affinity receptor FcgammaRIII and complement factors, hampering the definition of its biological role. Moreover, in vivo, FcgammaRI is occupied by monomeric IgG2a, reducing its accessibility to newly formed IgG2a-IC. By using a variety of FcgammaR(-\/-) mice, we demonstrate that in the absence of FcgammaRI, the IgG2a-IC-induced cellular processes of phagocytosis, cytokine release, cellular cytotoxicity, and antigen presentation are impaired. FcgammaRI(-\/-) mice showed impaired hypersensitivity responses, strongly reduced cartilage destruction in an arthritis model, and impaired protection from a bacterial infection. We conclude that FcgammaRI contributes substantially to a variety of IgG2a-IC-dependent immune functions and immunopathological responses.","4340":"The inactivation of the mouse high-affinity IgG Fc receptor FcgammaRI resulted in a wide range of defects in antibody Fc-dependent functions. These studies showed the primary importance of FcgammaRI in endocytosis of monomeric IgG, kinetics, and extent of phagocytosis of immune complexes, in macrophage-based ADCC, and in immune complex-dependent antigen presentation to primed T cells. In the absence of FcgammaRI, antibody responses were elevated, implying the removal of a control point by the deletion of FcgammaRI. In addition, FcR-gamma chain-deficient mice were found to express partially functional FcgammaRI. Thus, FcgammaRI is an early participant in Fc-dependent cell activation and in the development of immune responses.","4341":"A novel adoptive transfer system was used to track the fate of naive Salmonella-specific CD4 T cells in vivo. These cells showed signs of activation in the Peyer's patches as early as 3 hr after oral infection. The activated CD4 T cells then produced IL-2 and proliferated in the T cell areas of these tissues before migrating into the B cell-rich follicles. In contrast, Salmonella-specific CD4 T cells were not activated in the spleen and very few of these cells migrated to the liver, despite the presence of bacteria in both organs. These results show that the T cell response to pathogenic Salmonella infection is localized to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and does not extend efficiently to the major sites of late infection.","4342":"The origin and specificity of alphabeta TCR(+) T cells that express CD8alphaalpha have been controversial issues. Here we provide direct evidence that precursors of functional CD8alphaalpha T cells are positively selected in the thymus in the presence of agonist self-peptides. Like conventional positive selection, this agonist selection process requires functional TCR alpha-CPM, whereas it is independent of CD8beta expression. Furthermore, CD8alphaalpha expression on mature, agonist-selected T cells does not imply selection by MHC class I, and CD8alphaalpha(+) T cells can be either class I or class II restricted. Our data define a distinct agonist-dependent, positive selection process in the thymus, and they suggest a function for CD8alphaalpha distinct from the conventional TCR coreceptor function of CD8alphabeta or CD4.","4343":"The elongated complementary-determining region (CDR) 3beta found in the unliganded KB5-C20 TCR protrudes from the antigen binding site and prevents its docking onto the peptide\/MHC (pMHC) surface according to a canonical diagonal orientation. We now present the crystal structure of a complex involving the KB5-C20 TCR and an octapeptide bound to the allogeneic H-2K(b) MHC class I molecule. This structure reveals how a tremendously large CDR3beta conformational change allows the KB5-C20 TCR to adapt to the rather constrained pMHC surface and achieve a diagonal docking mode. This extreme case of induced fit also shows that TCR plasticity is primarily restricted to CDR3 loops and does not propagate away from the antigen binding site.","4344":"Integrin-mediated adhesion is essential for the formation of stable contacts between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We show that Vav1 controls integrin-mediated adhesion of thymocytes and T cells to ECM proteins and ICAM1 following TCR stimulation. In a peptide-specific system, Vav1 is required for T cell adhesion to peptide-loaded APCs. Intriguingly, TCR-induced cell adhesion and aggregation of integrins occurs independent of WASP. Whereas LFA-1 and actin caps colocalize in wasp(-\/-) T cells in response to TCR stimulation, loss of WASP uncouples TCR caps from actin patches. Our data reveal a novel role for Vav1 and WASP in the regulation of TCR-induced integrin clustering and cell adhesion and show that integrin and TCR clustering are controlled by distinct pathways.","4345":"Successful immunity against Salmonella infections is dependent on the generation of CD4(+) T helper cells and to a lesser extent on antibody production and CD8(+) T cells. The cells within the lymphatic tissue of the gut are likely to be central for the orchestration of a proper and rapid response. The anatomical restriction of the pathogen may also determine the distribution of effector cells. In this issue of Immunity, McSorley et al. address both of these processes using identifiable CD4 T cells that are specific for Salmonella typhimurium. Such cells localize to the Peyer's patches of the small intestine when the bacteria are delivered orally.","4346":"CD4(+)CD25(+) immunoregulatory T cells represent a unique lineage of thymic-derived cells that potently suppress both in vitro and in vivo effector T cell function. We analyzed CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells by DNA microarray, identifying 29 genes differentially expressed in the resting subpopulations, and 77 that were differentially expressed following activation. Most of these genes were elevated in the CD4(+)CD25(+) population, suggesting a previously activated phenotype. Among these were a number of genes that antagonize signaling, including members of the SOCS family, which may contribute to their anergic phenotype. Multiple cell surface receptors also had increased expression in CD4(+)CD25(+) cells, including GITR, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Importantly, antibodies to GITR abrogated suppression, demonstrating a functional role for this receptor in regulating the CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell subset.","4347":"Development of the lymphoid system is dependent on the Ets family transcription factor PU.1. We demonstrate that PU.1(-\/-) hematopoietic progenitors fail to express IL-7Ralpha transcripts. Promoter and chromatin crosslinking analyses suggest that PU.1 directly regulates transcription of the IL-7Ralpha gene. Retroviral transduction of IL-7Ralpha into PU.1(-\/-) progenitors restores IL-7-dependent proliferation and induces, at low frequency, the generation of pro-B cells undergoing an apparently normal program of differentiation. Although the related factor Spi-B can substitute for PU.1 in early B cell development, it is not required. These results demonstrate that PU.1 functions to regulate early B cell development in part by controlling the expression of the IL-7Ralpha gene.","4348":"The essential hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 is expressed in multipotent thymic precursors but downregulated during T lineage commitment. The significance of PU.1 downregulation was tested using retroviral vectors to force hematopoietic precursors to maintain PU.1 expression during differentiation in fetal thymic organ culture. PU.1 reduced thymocyte expansion and blocked development at the pro-T cell stage. PU.1-expressing cells could be rescued by switching to conditions permissive for macrophage development; thus, the inhibition depends on both lineage and developmental stage. An intact DNA binding domain was required for these effects. PU.1 expression can downregulate pre-Talpha, Rag-1, and Rag-2 in a dose-dependent manner, and higher PU.1 levels induce Mac-1 and Id-2. Thus, downregulation of PU.1 is specifically required for progression in the T cell lineage.","4349":"Mice sensitized for a Th2 response to Leishmania LACK antigen developed allergic airway inflammation upon exposure to LACK aerosol. Using multimers of I-A(d) molecules bound to a LACK peptide as probes, we tracked the migration of LACK-specific Th2 cells to the airways. Elevated numbers of LACK-specific Th2 cells remained in the airways for 5 weeks after the last aerosol. Substantial numbers of DC presenting LACK peptides were found in the airways, but not in other compartments, for up to 8 weeks after antigen exposure. These LACK-presenting airway DC expressed CD11c and CD11b as well as high levels of surface molecules involved in uptake and costimulation. Taken together, our results may explain the chronic Th2 airway inflammation characteristic of allergic asthma.","4350":"Despite the established role of dendritic cells (DCs) in regulating T lymphocyte activation, intracellular mechanisms responsible for controlling DC function are largely undefined. Here, we have studied DCs from mice deficient in the p50, RelA, and cRel subunits of the immunomodulatory NF-kappaB transcription factor. Although DC development and function was normal in mice lacking individual NF-kappaB subunits, development of doubly deficient p50(-\/-)RelA(-\/-) DCs was significantly impaired. In contrast, DCs from p50(-\/-)cRel(-\/-) mice developed normally, but CD40L- and TRANCE-induced survival and IL-12 production was abolished. Surprisingly, no significant impairment in MHC and costimulatory molecule expression was seen, despite significantly reduced kappaB site binding activity. These results therefore indicate essential, subunit-specific functions for NF-kappaB proteins in regulating DC development, survival, and cytokine production.","4351":"Surface expression of B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) containing Ig and Igalpha\/Igbeta generates signals required to transit discrete developmental checkpoints. The mechanism by which BCR components collaborate to initiate signals is still unclear. The expression of Iglambda1 in SJL mice is 50-fold lower than in other strains. Here, we demonstrate by gene targeting that a point mutation, which changes a glycine to a valine in the lambda1 constant region, is responsible for this defect. In vitro experiments show that Ig receptors bearing this mutation, while expressed normally, are deficient in signaling. These findings reveal a direct involvement of the Ig light chain (IgL) in B cell signaling and development beyond the requirement of light chains for BCR assembly.","4352":"Notch1 signaling drives T cell development at the expense of B cell development from a common precursor, an effect that is dependent on a C-terminal Notch1 transcriptional activation domain. The function of Deltex1, initially identified as a positive modulator of Notch function in a genetic screen in Drosophila, is poorly understood. We now demonstrate that, in contrast to Notch1, enforced expression of Deltex1 in hematopoietic progenitors results in B cell development at the expense of T cell development in fetal thymic organ culture and in vivo. Consistent with these effects, Deltex1 antagonizes Notch1 signaling in transcriptional reporter assays by inhibiting coactivator recruitment. These data suggest that a balance of inductive Notch1 signals and inhibitory signals mediated through Deltex1 and other modulators regulate T-B lineage commitment.","4353":"B cells possess a variety of immune functions that are involved in normal and abnormal immune responses, including autoimmune disorders. Through murine models of intestinal inflammation, we here demonstrate a B cell subset that is induced in gut-associated lymphoid tissues and is characterized by CD1d upregulation. This B cell subset appears under a chronic inflammatory environment, produces IL-10, and suppresses progression of intestinal inflammation by downregulating inflammatory cascades associated with IL-1 upregulation and STAT3 activation rather than by altering polarized T helper responses. This study indicates that B cells, by producing cytokines such as IL-10, can act as regulatory cells in immunologically mediated inflammatory reactions.","4354":"Most T lymphocytes are generated within the thymus. It is unclear, however, how newly generated T cells relocate out of the thymus to the circulation. The present study shows that a CC chemokine CCL19 attracts mature T cells out of the fetal thymus organ culture. Another CC chemokine CCL21, which shares CCR7 with CCL19 but has a unique C-terminal extension containing positively charged amino acids, failed to show involvement in thymic emigration. Neonatal appearance of circulating T cells was defective in CCL19-neutralized mice as well as in CCR7-deficient mice but not in CCL21-neutralized mice. In the thymus, CCL19 is predominantly localized in the medulla including endothelial venules. These results indicate a CCL19- and CCR7-dependent pathway of thymic emigration, which represents a major pathway of neonatal T cell export.","4355":"WIP stabilizes actin filaments and is important for filopodium formation. To define the role of WIP in immunity, we generated WIP-deficient mice. WIP(minus sign\/minus sign) mice have normal lymphocyte development, but their T cells fail to proliferate, secrete IL-2, increase their F-actin content, polarize and extend protrusions following T cell receptor ligation, and are deficient in conjugate formation with superantigen-presenting B cells and anti-CD3 bilayers. In contrast, WIP-deficient B lymphocytes have enhanced proliferation and CD69 expression following B cell receptor ligation and mount normal antibody responses to T-independent antigens. Both WIP-deficient T and B cells show a profound defect in their subcortical actin filament networks. These results suggest that WIP is important for immunologic synapse formation and T cell activation.","4356":"Inflammation can activate self-reactive CD8(+) T cells and induce autoimmunity. Here we show in a CD8(+) T cell-mediated model of type 1 diabetes that CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells prevent beta cell destruction following localized inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. These Treg cells accumulate preferentially in the pancreatic lymph nodes and islets but not other lymph nodes or spleen. PLN-derived Treg cells are extremely potent; only 2 x 10(3) cells are needed to prevent diabetes development, and their capacity to regulate is dependent on TNF-related activation induced cytokine-receptor activator of NFkappaB signals. Indeed, blockade of this pathway results in decreased frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells in the PLN, resulting in intra-islet differentiation of CD8(+) T cells into CTLs and rapid progression to diabetes.","4357":"Crosspresentation of self-antigens by antigen-presenting cells is critical for the induction of peripheral tolerance. As apoptosis facilitates the entry of antigens into the crosspresentation pathway, we sought to prevent the development of autoimmune diabetes by inducing pancreatic beta cell apoptosis before disease onset. Accordingly, young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice injected with a single low dose of streptozotocin (SZ), a drug cytotoxic for beta cells, exhibited impaired T cell responses to islet antigens and were protected from spontaneous diabetes. Furthermore, beta cell apoptosis was necessary for protection since SZ did not protect RIP-CrmA transgenic NOD mice in which beta cells expressed the caspase inhibitor CrmA. Our results support a model in which apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells induces the development of regulatory cells leading to the tolerization of self-reactive T cells and protection from diabetes.","4358":"K\/BxN T cell receptor transgenic mice are a model of inflammatory arthritis, similar to rheumatoid arthritis. Disease in these animals is focused specifically on the joints but stems from autoreactivity to a ubiquitously expressed antigen, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI). T and B cells are both required for disease initiation, but anti-GPI immunoglobulins (Igs), alone, can induce arthritis in lymphocyte-deficient recipients. Here, we show that the arthritogenic Igs act through both Fc receptors (in particular, FcgammaRIII) and the complement network (C5a). Surprisingly, the alternative pathway of complement activation is critical, while classical pathway components are entirely dispensable. We suggest that autoimmune disease, even one that is organ specific, can occur when mobilization of an adaptive immune response results in runaway activation of the innate response.","4359":"DC-SIGN, a dendritic cell (DC)-specific lectin, mediates clustering of DCs with T lymphocytes, a crucial event in the initiation of immune responses. DC-SIGN also binds HIV envelope glycoproteins, allowing efficient virus capture by DCs. We show here that DC-SIGN surface levels are upregulated in HIV-1-infected DCs. This process is caused by the viral protein Nef, which acts by inhibiting DC-SIGN endocytosis. Upregulation of DC-SIGN at the cell surface dramatically increases clustering of DCs with T lymphocytes and HIV-1 transmission. These results provide new insights into how HIV-1 spreads from DCs to T lymphocytes and manipulates immune responses. They help explain how Nef may act as a virulence factor in vivo.","4360":"Fusion of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to the plasma membrane of target cells is mediated by interaction of its envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with CD4 and appropriate chemokine receptors. gp120 additionally binds to DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin expressed on immature dendritic cells. This interaction does not result in viral fusion, but instead contributes to enhanced infection in trans of target cells that express CD4 and chemokine receptors. Here we show that DC-SIGN mediates rapid internalization of intact HIV into a low pH nonlysosomal compartment. Internalized virus retains competence to infect target cells. Removal of the DC-SIGN cytoplasmic tail reduced viral uptake and abrogated the trans-enhancement of T cell infection. We propose that HIV binds to DC-SIGN to gain access to an intracellular compartment that contributes to augmentation or retention of viral infectivity.","4361":"Somatic hypermutation (SHM) is investigated in related immunoglobulin transgenes that differ in a short artificial sequence designed to vary the content of hotspot motifs and the potential to form RNA or DNA secondary structures. Mutability depends on hotspots, not secondary structure. Hotspot motifs predict about 50% of the mutations; the rest are in neutral and coldspots. Clusters of mutations and the sequential addition of mutations found in cell pedigrees suggest epigenetic attributes of SHM. Sometime in SHM, an essential factor seems to become limiting. Particular error-prone DNA polymerases appear to create mutations in hotspots on the top and bottom DNA strands throughout the target and the SHM process. One transgene is superhypermutable in all regions, suggesting the presence of a cis-element that enhances SHM.","4362":"Efficient unidirectional killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) requires translocation of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) to the target cell contact site. Here we utilize modulated polarization microscopy and computerized 3D reconstruction of tubulin and LFA-1 immunofluorescence images to investigate how this is accomplished. The results show that the MTOC is drawn vectorially to the contact site by a microtubule sliding mechanism. Once the MTOC arrives at the contact site, it oscillates laterally. Microtubules loop through and anchor to a ring-shaped zone (pSMAC) defined by the dense clustering of LFA-1 at the target contact site. Microtubules that run straight between the MTOC and pSMAC and then turn sharply may indicate the action of a microtubule motor such as dynein.","4363":"MHC class I molecules expressed in a calreticulin-deficient cell line (K42) assembled with beta 2-microglobulin (beta2-m) normally, but their subsequent loading with optimal peptides was defective. Suboptimally loaded class I molecules were released into the secretory pathway. This occurred despite the ability of newly synthesized class I to interact with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) loading complex. The efficiency of peptide loading was reduced by 50%-80%, and impaired T cell recognition was observed for three out of four antigens tested. The peptide-loading function was specific to calreticulin, since the defect in K42 could be rectified by transfection with calreticulin but not a soluble form of calnexin, which shares its lectin-like activity.","4364":"The presence of a disulfide bond inside the peptide binding groove of MHC class I molecules and of the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 in the class I loading complex suggests that disulfide bond isomerization may play a role in peptide loading. Here we show that ERp57 and tapasin are disulfide linked inside the loading complex. Mutagenesis of cysteine 95 in tapasin not only abolishes formation of the ERp57-tapasin bond but also prevents complete oxidation of the class I heavy chain in the loading complex. The resulting MHC class I-beta2m heterodimers are poorly loaded with high-affinity peptides in the ER but nevertheless escape to the cell surface where they are unstable. These findings suggest a role for disulfide bond isomerization in tapasin-mediated peptide loading.","4365":"Induced by retinoic acid and implicated in playing a role in development, rodent RAE-1 proteins are ligands for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D, widely expressed on natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages. RAE-1 proteins (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) are distant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I homologs, comprising isolated alpha1alpha2 platform domains. The crystal structure of RAE-1beta was distorted from other MHC homologs and displayed noncanonical disulfide bonds. The loss of any remnant of a peptide binding groove was facilitated by the close approach of the groove-defining helices through a hydrophobic, leucine-rich interface. The RAE-1beta-murine NKG2D complex structure resembled the human NKG2D-MICA receptor-ligand complex and further demonstrated the promiscuity of the NKG2D ligand binding site.","4366":"B1 cells are a predominant cell type in body cavities and an important source of natural antibody. Here we report that in mice lacking the chemokine, CXCL13, B1 cells are deficient in peritoneal and pleural cavities but not in spleen. CXCL13 is produced by cells in the omentum and by peritoneal macrophages, and in adoptive transfers, B1 cells home to the omentum and the peritoneal cavity in a CXCL13-dependent manner. CXCL13(-\/-) mice are deficient in preexisting phosphorylcholine (PC)-specific antibodies and in their ability to mount an anti-PC response to peritoneal streptococcal antigen. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of B1 cell homing and establish a critical role for B1 cell compartmentalization in the production of natural antibodies and for body cavity immunity.","4367":"We identified intracellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2) in a genetic screen as an activator of the PI3K\/AKT pathway leading to inhibition of apoptosis. ICAM-2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin and PI3K kinase membrane translocation, resulting in phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 production, PDK-1 and AKT activation, and subsequent phosphorylation of AKT targets BAD, GSK3, and FKHR. ICAM-2 clustering protected primary human CD19+ cells from TNFalpha- and Fas-mediated apoptosis as determined by single-cell analysis. ICAM-2 engagement by CD19+ cells of its natural receptor, LFA-1, on CD4+ naive cells specifically induced AKT activity in the absence of an MHC-peptide interaction. These results attribute a novel signaling function to ICAM-2 that might suggest mechanisms by which ICAM-2 signals intracellular communication at various immunological synapses.","4368":"B cell lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL-B) are neoplastic B cells that show dysregulated B lymphocyte growth characteristics. Unlike normal B cells, aggressive NHL-B cells show constitutive expression of nuclear NF-kappaB by maintaining an assembled, scaffold-like signaling platform, called a Signalosome within the lipid raft microdomain, extending from the cell membrane. The CD40 Signalosome appears to be initiated through autochthonous production and cognate binding of CD154 (CD40L, gp39) to CD40 by the lymphoma cell. Constitutive expression of NF-kappaB in NHL-B can be downregulated by treatment with antibodies to CD40 or CD154 that disrupt Signalosomes, inhibit lymphoma cell growth, and induce cell death. CD40 Signalosomes may provide a potentially vulnerable target for therapeutic intervention in NHL-B cells.","4369":"CD28 and CTLA-4 engagement with B7 expressed by APCs generates critical regulatory signals for T cell activation. CD28 is expressed on the T cell surface and enhances T cell expansion, while CTLA-4 localizes primarily to an intracellular compartment and inhibits T cell proliferation. We demonstrate that CTLA-4 has several unique trafficking properties that may regulate its ability to attenuate a T cell response. Importantly, accumulation of CTLA-4 at the immunological synapse is proportional to the strength of the TCR signal, suggesting that cells receiving stronger stimuli are more susceptible to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. This may represent a novel feedback control mechanism in which a stimulatory signal regulates the recruitment of an inhibitory receptor to a functionally relevant site on the cell surface.","4370":"E2A and HEB are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors essential for T cell development. Complete inhibition of their activities through transgenic overexpression of their inhibitors Id1 and Tal1 leads to a dramatic loss of thymocytes. Here, we suggest that bHLH proteins play important roles in establishing thresholds for pre-TCR and TCR signaling. Inhibition of their function allows double-negative cells to differentiate without a functional pre-TCR, while anti-CD3 stimulation downregulates bHLH activities. We also find that the transcription factor NF-kappaB becomes activated in transgenic thymocytes. Further activation of NF-kappaB exacerbates the loss of thymocytes, whereas inhibition of NF-kappaB leads to the rescue of double-positive thymocytes. Therefore, we propose that E2A and HEB negatively regulate pre-TCR and TCR signaling and their removal causes hyperactivation and apoptosis of thymocytes.","4371":"Lymphocytes are covered with sugars. Some of the oligosaccharides on lymphocytes may be recognized by specific lectins such as the selectins, but what other functions do all of these oligosaccharides serve? Two recent papers in Cell (Moody et al., 2001) and Immunity (Daniels et al., 2001) describe a novel role for glycosylation in the thymus--regulating the interaction of MHC class I molecules with CD8 during thymocyte maturation.","4372":"Tissue-selective trafficking of memory and effector T and B lymphocytes is mediated by unique combinations of adhesion molecules and chemokines. The discovery of several related epithelial-expressed chemokines (TECK\/CCL25 in small intestine, CTACK\/CCL27 in skin, and MEC\/CCL28 in diverse mucosal sites) now highlights an important role for epithelial cells in controlling homeostatic lymphocyte trafficking, including the localization of cutaneous and intestinal memory T cells, and of IgA plasma cells. Constitutively expressed epithelial chemokines may help determine the character of local immune responses and contribute to the systemic organization of the immune system.","4373":"CD8 serves both as an adhesion molecule for class I MHC molecules and as a coreceptor with the TCR for T cell activation. Here we study the developmental regulation of CD8-mediated binding to noncognate peptide\/MHC ligands (i.e., those not bound by the TCR). We show that CD8's ability to bind soluble class I MHC tetramers and to mediate T cell adhesion under shear flow conditions diminishes as double-positive thymocytes mature into CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this decreased CD8 binding results from increased T cell sialylation upon T cell maturation. These data suggest that CD8's ability to interact with class I MHC is not fixed and is developmentally regulated through the T cell's glycosylation state.","4374":"NKG2D is known to trigger the natural killer (NK) cell lysis of various tumor and virally infected cells. In the NKG2D\/ULBP3 complex, the structure of ULBP3 resembles the alpha1 and alpha2 domains of classical MHC molecules without a bound peptide. The lack of alpha3 and beta2m domains is compensated by replacing two hydrophobic patches at the underside of the class I MHC-like beta sheet floor with a group of hydrophilic and charged residues in ULBP3. NKG2D binds diagonally across the ULBP3 alpha helices, creating a complementary interface, an asymmetrical subunit orientation, and local conformational adjustments in the receptor. The interface is stabilized primarily by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Unlike the KIR receptors that recognize a conserved HLA region by a lock-and-key mechanism, NKG2D recognizes diverse ligands by an induced-fit mechanism.","4375":"One hallmark of innate immunity apparently conserved from primitive life forms through to humans is the ability of the host to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Since macrophage pattern recognition receptors are not well defined in Drosophila, we set out to identify such receptors. Our findings reveal that Drosophila macrophages express multiple pattern recognition receptors and that the Drosophila scavenger receptor, dSR-CI, is one such receptor capable of recognizing both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but not yeast. Our data indicate that scavenger receptor bacterial recognition is conserved from insects to humans and may represent one of the most primitive forms of microbial recognition.","4376":"The hematopoietic cell-specific adaptor protein, SLP-76, is critical for T cell development and mature T cell receptor (TCR) signaling; however, the structural requirements of SLP-76 for mediating thymopoiesis and mature T cell function remain largely unknown. In this study, transgenic mice were generated to examine the requirements for specific domains of SLP-76 in thymocytes and peripheral T cells in vivo. Examination of mice expressing various mutants of SLP-76 on the null background demonstrates a differential requirement for specific domains of SLP-76 in thymocytes and T cells and provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying SLP-76 function.","4377":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can suppress and evade the immune system. We have identified as a mechanism the ability of HCMV to infect dendritic cells (DC), which initiate the antiviral immune response. HCMV-infected DC show enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules. In contrast, MHC molecules are partially downregulated, leading to a reduced antigen-presenting capacity. Moreover, the apoptosis-inducing ligands CD95L (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are upregulated, thereby enabling HCMV-infected DC to delete activated T lymphocytes. This additional layer of viral defense is complemented by nondeletional mechanisms, which suppress surviving T cells. Thus, infection of DC allows the virus to blunt the antiviral T cell response by a multilayered defense strategy and could play a pivotal role in HCMV-triggered immunosuppression.","4378":"We have characterized a cytokine produced by Th2 cells, designated as IL-25. Infusion of mice with IL-25 induced IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 gene expression. The induction of these cytokines resulted in Th2-like responses marked by increased serum IgE, IgG(1), and IgA levels, blood eosinophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs and digestive tract that included eosinophilic infiltrates, increased mucus production, and epithelial cell hyperplasia\/hypertrophy. In addition, our studies show that IL-25 induces Th2-type cytokine production by accessory cells that are MHC class II(high), CD11c(dull), and lineage(-). These results suggest that IL-25, derived from Th2 T cells, is capable of amplifying allergic type inflammatory responses by its actions on other cell types.","4379":"The 70 kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (Mtb HSP70) stimulates mononuclear cells to release CC-chemokines. We now show that this function of Mtb HSP70, but not human HSP70, is dependent on the cell surface expression of CD40. Deletion of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail abolished, and CD40 antibody inhibited, Mtb HSP70 stimulation of CC-chemokine release. Mtb HSP70 stimulated THP1, KG1 cells, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells to produce RANTES. Specific binding of CD40-transfected HEK 293 cells to Mtb HSP70 was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Coimmunoprecipitation of Mtb HSP70 with CD40 indicates a physical association between these molecules. The results suggest that CD40 is critical in microbial HSP70 binding and stimulation of RANTES production.","4380":"E2Fs are important regulators of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here we characterize the phenotype of mice deficient in E2F2. We show that E2F2 is required for immunologic self-tolerance. E2F2(-\/-) mice develop late-onset autoimmune features, characterized by widespread inflammatory infiltrates, glomerular immunocomplex deposition, and anti-nuclear antibodies. E2F2-deficient T lymphocytes exhibit enhanced TCR-stimulated proliferation and a lower activation threshold, leading to the accumulation of a population of autoreactive effector\/memory T lymphocytes, which appear to be responsible for causing autoimmunity in E2F2-deficient mice. Finally, we provide support for a model to explain E2F2's unexpected role as a suppressor of T lymphocyte proliferation. Rather than functioning as a transcriptional activator, E2F2 appears to function as a transcriptional repressor of genes required for normal S phase entry, particularly E2F1.","4381":"Receptor editing is a means by which immature bone marrow B cells can become self-tolerant. Rearrangements of heavy (H) and\/or light (L) chain genes are induced by encounter with autoantigens to change the specificity from self to nonself. We have developed site-directed transgenic mice (sd-tg) whose transgenes code for the H chain of antibodies that bind DNA. B cells that express the transgenic H chain associate mainly with four of the 93 functional Vkappa genes of the mouse. Numerous aspartate residues that might inhibit DNA binding by the V(H) domain distinguish these L chain Vkappa sequences, but engaging these Vkappa editors often requires multiple rearrangements. Among the edited B cells is a subset of multispecific cells that express multiple receptors. One consequence of multispecificity is partial autoreactivity; these multispecific B cells may contribute to autoimmunity.","4382":"Evidence has gathered that CD28 costimulation facilitates T cell activation by potentiating TCR intrinsic-signaling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that, by enhancing T cell\/APC close contacts, CD28 facilitates TCR signal transduction. Moreover, the signal supplied by CD28 does not lead to increased Zap-70 and Lat phosphorylation, but amplifies PLCgamma1 activation and Ca(2+) response. We provide evidence that the PTK Itk controls the latter function. Our data suggest that CD28 binding to B7 contributes to setting the level of TCR-induced phosphorylated Lat for recruiting signaling complexes, whereas the CD28 signal boosts multiple pathways by facilitating PLCgamma1 activation. These results should provide a conceptual framework for understanding quantitative and qualitative aspects of CD28-mediated costimulation.","4383":"Since CD28 provides cosignals in T cell responses, a key question is whether the coreceptor operates exclusively via TCRzeta\/CD3 or also operates as an independent signaling unit. In this study, we show that CD28 can cooperate with VAV\/SLP-76 adaptors to upregulate interleukin 2\/4 transcription independently of TCR ligation. CD28 signaling is dependent on VAV\/SLP-76 complex formation and induces membrane localization of these complexes. CD28-VAV\/SLP-76 also functions in nonlymphoid cells to promote nuclear entry of NFAT, indicating that these adaptors are the only lymphoid components needed for this pathway. Further downstream, CD28-VAV\/SLP-76 synergizes with Rac1 and causes F-actin remodelling proximal to receptor. Autonomous CD28 signaling may account for the distinct nature of the second signal and in trans amplification of T cell responses.","4384":"NK1.1(+) T cells develop and function through interactions with cell surface CD1 complexes. In I-A(b) mice lacking the invariant chain (Ii) processing enzyme, cathepsin S, NK1.1(+) T cell selection and function are impaired. In vitro, thymic dendritic cells (DCs) from cathepsin S(-\/-) mice exhibit defective presentation of the CD1-restricted antigen, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer). CD1 dysfunction is secondary to defective trafficking of CD1, which colocalizes with Ii fragments and accumulates within endocytic compartments of cathepsin S(-\/-) DCs. I-A(k), cathepsin S(-\/-) mice do not accumulate class II-associated Ii fragments and accordingly do not display CD1 abnormalities. Thus, function of CD1 is critically linked to processing of Ii, revealing MHC class II haplotype and cathepsin S activity as regulators of NK T cells.","4385":"Endosomal trafficking is an essential component of the CD1 pathway of lipid antigen presentation to T cells. We demonstrate that CD1d access to endosomal compartments is under dual regulation by an intrinsic tyrosine-based motif, which governs intense recycling between the plasma membrane and the endosome, and by the invariant chain, with which CD1d associates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both pathways independently enhance antigen presentation to V(alpha)14(+) NKT cells, the main subset of CD1d-restricted T cells. These results reveal the complexity of CD1d trafficking and suggest that the invariant chain was a component of ancestral antigen presentation pathways prior to the evolution of MHC and CD1.","4386":"CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are thought to control hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and so we investigated why this response fails in persistently infected individuals. The HCV quasispecies in three persistently infected chimpanzees acquired mutations in multiple epitopes that impaired class I MHC binding and\/or CTL recognition. Most escape mutations appeared during acute infection and remained fixed in the quasispecies for years without further diversification. A statistically significant increase in the amino acid replacement rate was observed in epitopes versus adjacent regions of HCV proteins. In contrast, most epitopes were intact when hepatitis C resolved spontaneously. We conclude that CTL exert positive selection pressure against the HCV quasispecies and the outcome of infection is predicted by mutations in class I MHC restricted epitopes.","4387":"Why HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells ultimately fail to clear or control HIV infection is not known. We show here that HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells exhibit increased sensitivity to CD95\/Fas-induced apoptosis. This apoptosis is 3-fold higher compared to CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells from the same patients. HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells express the CD45RA(-)CD62L(-) but lack the CD45RA(+)CD62L(-) T cell effector memory (T(EM)) phenotype. This skewing is not found in CMV- and EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in HIV-infected individuals. CD95\/Fas-induced apoptosis is much higher in the CD45RA(-)CD62L(-) T(EM) cells. However, cytotoxicity and IFNgamma production by HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells is not impaired. Our data suggest that the survival and differentiation of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells may be compromised by CD95\/Fas apoptosis induced by FasL-expressing HIV-infected cells.","4388":"Many viruses establish life-long infections in their natural host with few if any clinical manifestations. The relationship between virus and host is a dynamic process in which the virus has evolved the means to coexist by reducing its visibility, while the host immune system attempts to suppress and eliminate infection without damage to itself. This short review describes a variety of strategies that are employed by viruses to evade host immune responses. These include virus-associated escape from T cell recognition, and resistance to apoptosis and counterattack, with special reference to two papers published in this issue of Immunity (Mueller et al., 2001; Raftery et al., 2001).","4389":"The CD1 family of MHC class I-related proteins present foreign and self-lipid antigens for specific recognition by T cells. Based on previous experience with MHC class I and II molecules, it seems likely that a thorough knowledge of the intracellular trafficking and localization of CD1 proteins will be essential to fully understand their functions in antigen presentation and immune responses. Two studies in this issue of Immunity take a detailed look at factors affecting the localization of mouse CD1 proteins to the endocytic system of antigen-presenting cells. Their results provide intriguing evidence for the involvement of two critical components of the MHC class II endosomal processing pathway, cathepsin S and the invariant chain, in the normal functioning of CD1.","4390":"One mechanism cytotoxic T lymphocytes use to kill targets is exocytosis of cytotoxic agents from lytic granules, a process that requires Ca(2+) influx. We investigated the role of Ca(2+) influx in granule exocytosis using TALL-104 human leukemic cytotoxic T cells triggered via a bispecific antibody containing an anti-CD3 F(ab') to kill Raji B lymphoma cells. Using a novel fluorescence method, we detected target-directed release of approximately 15% of lytic granules during killing. Consistent with previous work, we observed sustained CTL Ca(2+) gradients during killing, but gradients reflect the behavior of Fura-2 in granules. Rapid imaging experiments suggest that Ca(2+) channels are not polarized during killing, indicating that Ca(2+) influx does not direct granule reorientation. Furthermore, we find that Ca(2+) acts via a high-affinity interaction to promote granule exocytosis.","4391":"TWEAK is a member of the TNF ligand family that induces angiogenesis in vivo. We report cloning of a receptor for TWEAK (TweakR) from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) library. The mature form of TweakR has only one hundred and two amino acids and six cysteine residues in its extracellular region. Five different assays demonstrate TWEAK-TweakR binding, and the interaction affinity constant (Kd) is within a physiologically relevant range of 2.3 +\/- 0.1 nM. The TweakR cytoplasmic domain binds TRAFs 1, 2, and 3. Cross-linking of TweakR induces HUVEC growth, and mRNA levels are upregulated in vitro by a variety of agents and in vivo following arterial injury. Soluble TweakR inhibits endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo.","4392":"The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a secreted protein that lacks a signal peptide and does not follow currently known pathways of secretion. Its efficient release from activated immune cells requires a secondary stimulus such as extracellular ATP acting on P2X(7) receptors. We show that human THP-1 monocytes shed microvesicles from their plasma membrane within 2-5 s of activation of P2X(7) receptors. Two minutes after such stimulation, the released microvesicles contained bioactive IL-1beta, which only later appeared in the vesicle-free supernatant. We conclude that microvesicle shedding is a major secretory pathway for rapid IL-1beta release from activated monocytes and may represent a more general mechanism for secretion of similar leaderless secretory proteins.","4393":"The IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) plays critical roles in expansion and V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development. Here we demonstrate that cytokine stimulation rapidly recruits Stat5 and transcriptional coactivators to the Jgamma germline promoter and induces histone acetylation, germline transcription, and accessibility in Ba\/F3 cells. We also show that histone acetylation of the TCRgamma locus is significantly reduced in IL-7R-deficient thymocytes and that the introduction of active Stat5 restores the histone acetylation and accessibility of the locus. Furthermore, treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor recovers the histone acetylation and accessibility in IL-7R-deficient thymocytes. Therefore, these results suggest that Stat5 may recruit the transcriptional coactivators to the Jgamma germline promoter and control the accessibility of the TCRgamma locus by histone acetylation.","4394":"The interaction between the TNF receptor family member CD27 and its ligand CD70 provides a costimulatory signal for T cell expansion. Normally, tightly regulated expression of CD70 ensures the transient availability of this costimulatory signal. Mice expressing constitutive CD70 on B cells had higher peripheral T cell numbers that showed increased differentiation toward effector-type T cells. B cell numbers in CD70 transgenic (TG) mice progressively decreased in primary and secondary lymphoid organs. This B cell depletion was caused by CD27-induced production of IFNgamma in T cells. We conclude that apart from its role in controlling the size of the activated T cell pool, CD27 ligation contributes to immunity by facilitating effector T cell differentiation.","4395":"Viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms to target many aspects of the host's immune response. The cytokine IFN-gamma plays a central role in resistance of the host to infection via direct antiviral effects as well as modulation of the immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immediate-early protein, BZLF1, inhibits the IFN-gamma signaling pathway. BZLF1 decreases the ability of IFN-gamma to activate a variety of important downstream target genes, such as IRF-1, p48, and CIITA, and prevents IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC surface expression. Additionally, BZLF1 inhibits IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Finally, we demonstrate that BZLF1 decreases expression of the IFN-gamma receptor, suggesting a mechanism by which EBV may escape antiviral immune responses during primary infection.","4396":"The major murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility locus, Sle1, corresponds to three loci independently affecting loss of tolerance to chromatin in the NZM2410 mouse. The congenic interval corresponding to Sle1c contains Cr2, which encodes complement receptors 1 and 2 (CR1\/CR2, CD35\/CD21). NZM2410\/NZW Cr2 exhibits a single nucleotide polymorphism that introduces a novel glycosylation site, resulting in higher molecular weight proteins. This polymorphism, located in the C3d binding domain, reduces ligand binding and receptor-mediated cell signaling. Molecular modeling based on the recently solved CR2 structure in complex with C3d reveals that this glycosylation interferes with receptor dimerization. These data demonstrate a functionally significant phenotype for the NZM2410 Cr2 allele and strongly support its role as a lupus susceptibility gene.","4397":"The role of DNA methylation and of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 in the epigenetic regulation of developmental stage- and cell lineage-specific gene expression in vivo is uncertain. This is addressed here through the generation of mice in which Dnmt1 was inactivated by Cre\/loxP-mediated deletion at sequential stages of T cell development. Deletion of Dnmt1 in early double-negative thymocytes led to impaired survival of TCRalphabeta(+) cells and the generation of atypical CD8(+)TCRgammadelta(+) cells. Deletion of Dnmt1 in double-positive thymocytes impaired activation-induced proliferation but differentially enhanced cytokine mRNA expression by naive peripheral T cells. We conclude that Dnmt1 and DNA methylation are required for the proper expression of certain genes that define fate and determine function in T cells.","4398":"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) rapidly destroy their targets. Here we show that although target cell death occurs within 5 min of CTL-target cell contact, an immunological synapse similar to that seen in CD4 cells rapidly forms in CTL, with a ring of adhesion proteins surrounding an inner signaling molecule domain. Lytic granule secretion occurs in a separate domain within the adhesion ring, maintaining signaling protein organization during exocytosis. Live and fixed cell studies show target cell plasma membrane markers are transferred to the CTL as the cells separate. Electron microscopy reveals continuities forming membrane bridges between the CTL and target cell membranes, suggesting a possible mechanism for this transfer.","4399":"The large mucin CD43 is actively excluded from T cell\/APC interaction sites, concentrating in a membrane domain distal to the site of TCR engagement. The cytoplasmic region of CD43 was necessary and sufficient for this antipodal movement. ERM cytoskeletal adaptor proteins colocalized with CD43 in this domain. An ERM dominant-negative mutant blocked the distal accumulation of CD43 and another known ERM binding protein, Rho-GDI. Inhibition of ERM function decreased the production of IL-2 and IFNgamma, without affecting PKC(theta) focusing or CD69 upregulation. These results indicate that ERM proteins organize a complex distal to the T cell\/APC interaction site and provide evidence that full T cell activation may involve removal of inhibitory proteins from the immunological synapse.","4400":"Here we show that activated Th1 and Th2 cells have distinct patterns of membrane compartmentalization into lipid rafts. TCR complex members are recruited efficiently to rafts and aggregate with rafts at the site of MHC\/peptide contact in Th1 cells but not Th2 cells. TCR\/raft association in Th1 cells is deficient in the absence of CD4, suggesting that CD4 aids recruitment of the TCR to rafts. We show differential utilization of rafts in Th1 and Th2 cells by cholesterol depletion studies, which alters calcium signaling in Th1 but not Th2 cells. Furthermore, Th2 cells have a decreased ability to respond to low-affinity peptide stimulation. These studies indicate that components of membrane microdomains are differentially regulated in functionally distinct CD4 T cells.","4401":"Dynamic interactions between membrane and cytoskeleton components are crucial for T cell antigen recognition and subsequent cellular activation. We report here that the membrane-microfilament linker ezrin plays an important role in these processes. First, ezrin relocalizes to the contact area between T cells and stimulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs), accumulating in F-actin-rich membrane protrusions at the periphery of the immunological synapse. Second, T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated intracellular signals are sufficient to induce ezrin relocalization, indicating that this protein is an effector of TCR signaling. Third, overexpression of the membrane binding domain of ezrin perturbs T cell receptor clustering in the T cell-APC contact area and inhibits the activation of nuclear factor for activated T cells (NF-AT).","4402":"The positive selection of CD4 or CD8 single-positive mature peripheral T lymphocytes and the deletion of self-reactive cells are crucial for central tolerance in the peripheral immune system. Previously, the guanine nucleotide binding protein Rac-1 has been shown to control pre-T cell development. The present report now describes the actions of Rac-1 in thymocyte selection. The study reveals that this molecule has the striking and unique ability to efficiently divert cells from positive selection into a pathway of negative selection and deletion. The ability of Rac-1 to switch thymocytes from a destiny of positive to negative selection identifies this molecule as a critical regulator of the developmental processes in T cells that are essential for immune homeostasis.","4403":"Formation of the immunological synapse requires TCR signal-dependent protein redistribution. However, the specific molecular mechanisms controlling protein relocation are not well defined. Moesin is a widely expressed phospho-protein that links many transmembrane molecules to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Here, we demonstrate that TCR-induced exclusion of the large sialoprotein CD43 from the synapse is an active event mediated by its reversible binding to moesin. Our results also reveal that relocalization of moesin is associated with changes in the phosphorylation status of this cytoskeletal adaptor protein. Finally, these findings raise the possibility that the change in moesin localization resulting from TCR engagement modifies the overall topology of the lymphocyte membrane and facilitates molecular interactions at the site of presenting cell contact.","4404":"HIV-1 budding appears to require Vps4 and Tsg101-two proteins that have links to endosomal sorting machinery. A picture emerges wherein divergent viruses recruit endosomal proteins like Tsg101 to gain access to ubiquitin processes that play a crucial role during viral budding.","4405":"The immunological synapse is characterized by the reorganization of membrane proteins at the immunological synapse. Active cytoskeletal mechanisms are involved in recruiting the TCR, accessory molecules, and the integrin LFA-1 to the contact area. Other molecules like CD43 are excluded from the contact area, but the mechanism of exclusion is unknown. Three papers in this issue of Immunity demonstrate that CD43 exclusion involves the ERM family of cytoskeletal proteins.","4406":"Although HIV-1 gene expression is detected in naive, resting T cells in vivo, such cells are resistant to productive infection in vitro. However, we found that the endogenous microenvironment of human lymphoid tissues supports de novo infection and depletion of this population. Cell cycle analysis and DNA labeling experiments established that these cells were definitively quiescent and thus infected de novo. Quantitation of the \"burst size\" within naive cells further demonstrated that these cells were productively infected and contributed to the local viral burden. These findings demonstrate that lymphoid tissues support active HIV-1 replication in resting, naive T cells. Moreover, these cells are not solely reservoirs of latent virus but are permissive hosts for viral replication that likely targets them for elimination.","4407":"Flt3 has emerged as a potential regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Sixty percent of cells in the mouse marrow Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) HSC pool expressed flt3. Although single cell cloning showed comparable high proliferative, myeloid, B, and T cell potentials of Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) and Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(-) cells, only Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(-) cells supported sustained multilineage reconstitution. In striking contrast, Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) cells rapidly and efficiently reconstituted B and T lymphopoiesis, whereas myeloid reconstitution was exclusively short term. Unlike c-kit, activation of flt3 failed to support survival of HSC, whereas only flt3 mediated survival of Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) reconstituting cells. Phenotypic and functional analysis support that Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+)flt3(+) cells are progenitors for the common lymphoid progenitor. Thus, upregulation of flt3 expression on Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) HSC cells is accompanied by loss of self-renewal capacity but sustained lymphoid-restricted reconstitution potential.","4408":"TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) is a unique TRAF protein because it lacks a RING finger domain and is predominantly expressed in activated lymphocytes. To elucidate the function of TRAF1, we generated TRAF1-deficient mice. TRAF1(-\/-) mice are viable and have normal lymphocyte development. TRAF1(-\/-) T cells exhibit stronger than wild-type (WT) T cell proliferation to anti-CD3 mAb, which persisted in the presence of IL-2 or anti-CD28 antibodies. Activated TRAF1(-\/-) T cells, but not TRAF1(+\/+) T cells, responded to TNF by proliferation and activation of the NF-kappa B and AP-1 signaling pathways. This TNF effect was mediated by TNFR2 (p75) but not by TNFR1 (p55). Furthermore, skin from TRAF1(-\/-) mice was hypersensitive to TNF-induced necrosis. These findings suggest that TRAF1 is a negative regulator of TNF signaling.","4409":"Vaccination with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) attachment (G) protein results in immune-mediated lung injury after natural RSV infection with pathogenic features characteristic of an exaggerated Th2 response. Here we demonstrate that approximately half of the CD4(+) T cells infiltrating the lungs of G-primed mice utilize a single V beta gene (V beta 14) with remarkably limited CDR3 diversity. Furthermore, elimination of these V beta 14-bearing CD4(+) T cells in vivo abolishes the type 2-like pulmonary injury. These results suggest that a novel subset of CD4(+) T cells may be crucial in the development of pathology during human RSV infection and that genetic or environmental factors prior to or at the time of G antigen exposure may affect the commitment of this discrete antigen-specific T cell subset to Th2 differentiation.","4410":"The murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 K3 (MK3) is a PHD\/LAP finger protein that downregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression. In transfected cell lines, MK3 was expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it bound the cytoplasmic tail of newly synthesized H-2D(b) glycoproteins and targeted them for degradation. Proteasome inhibitors blocked the degradation and led to an accumulation of ubiquitinated H-2D(b). Because this retained its native conformation, ubiquitination preceded any denaturation or dislocation to the cytosol. The PHD\/LAP finger of MK3 was not required for H-2D(b) binding but was essential for its ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, gamma-herpesviruses have adapted the cellular PHD\/LAP motif to immune evasion, apparently for the catalysis of MHC class I ubiquitination.","4411":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related cytokines regulate cell death and survival and provide strong selective pressures for viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), to evolve counterstrategies in order to persist in immune-competent hosts. Signaling by the lymphotoxin (LT)-beta receptor or TNF receptor-1, but not Fas or TRAIL receptors, inhibits the cytopathicity and replication of human CMV by a nonapoptotic, reversible process that requires nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-dependent induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Efficient induction of IFN-beta requires virus infection and LT signaling, demonstrating the need for both host and viral factors in the curtailment of viral replication without cellular elimination. LT alpha-deficient mice and LT beta R-Fc transgenic mice were profoundly susceptible to murine CMV infection. Together, these results reveal an essential and conserved role for LTs in establishing host defense to CMV.","4412":"To investigate the role of the Lyn kinase in establishing signaling thresholds in hematopoietic cells, a gain-of-function mutation analogous to the Src Y527F-activating mutation was introduced into the Lyn gene. Intriguingly, although Lyn is widely expressed within the hematopoietic system, these mice displayed no propensity toward hematological malignancy. By contrast, analysis of aging cohorts of both loss- and gain-of-function Lyn mutant mice revealed that Lyn(-\/-) mice develop splenomegaly, increased numbers of myeloid progenitors, and monocyte\/macrophage (M phi) tumors. Biochemical analysis of cells from these mutants revealed that Lyn is essential in establishing ITIM-dependent inhibitory signaling and for activation of specific protein tyrosine phosphatases within myeloid cells. Loss of such inhibitory signaling may predispose mice lacking this putative protooncogene to tumorigenesis.","4413":"We earlier proposed that a human endogenous retroviral (HERV) superantigen (SAg) IDDMK(1,2)22 may cause type I diabetes by activating autoreactive T cells. Viral infections and induction of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are tightly associated with the onset of autoimmunity. Here we establish a link between viral infections and IFN-alpha-regulated SAg expression of the polymorphic and defective HERV-K18 provirus. HERV-K18 has three alleles, IDDMK(1,2)22 and two full-length envelope genes, that all encode SAgs. Expression of HERV-K18 SAgs is inducible by IFN-alpha and this is sufficient to stimulate V beta 7 T cells to levels comparable to transfectants constitutively expressing HERV-K18 SAgs. Endogenous SAgs induced via IFN-alpha by viral infections is a novel mechanism through which environmental factors may cause disease in genetically susceptible individuals.","4414":"Superantigens (SAgs) are proteins produced by pathogenic microbes to elicit potent, antigen-independent T cell responses that are believed to enhance the microbes' pathogenicity. Here we show that the human lymphotropic herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transcriptionally activates the env gene of an endogenous retrovirus, HERV-K18, that possesses SAg activity. SAg activity was demonstrated by MHC class II dependent preferential activation of TCRVB13 T cells in response to murine B cells transfected with the HERV-K18 env gene. This is a unique demonstration of a pathogen inducing a host-encoded Sag and accounts for the previously described EBV associated Sag activity. The T cell activation elicited by the Sag could play a central role in EBV infection and associated diseases.","4415":"WSX-1 is a class I cytokine receptor with homology to the IL-12 receptors. The physiological role of WSX-1, which is expressed mainly in T cells, was investigated in gene-targeted WSX-1-deficient mice. IFN-gamma production was reduced in isolated WSX-1(-\/-) T cells subjected to primary stimulation in vitro to induce Th1 differentiation but was normal in fully differentiated and activated WSX-1(-\/-) Th1 cells that had received secondary stimulation. WSX-1(-\/-) mice were remarkably susceptible to Leishmania major infection, showing impaired IFN-gamma production early in the infection. However, IFN-gamma production during the later phases of the infection was not impaired in the knockout. WSX-1(-\/-) mice also showed poorly differentiated granulomas with dispersed accumulations of mononuclear cells when infected with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Thus, WSX-1 is essential for the initial mounting of Th1 responses but dispensable for their maintenance.","4416":"GM-CSF gene targeted (GM(-\/-)) mice are susceptible to respiratory infections and develop alveolar proteinosis due to defects in innate immune function and surfactant catabolism in alveolar macrophages (AMs), respectively. Reduced cell adhesion, phagocytosis, pathogen killing, mannose- and Toll-like receptor expression, and LPS- or peptidoglycan-stimulated TNFalpha release were observed in AMs from GM(-\/-) mice. The transcription factor PU.1 was markedly reduced in AMs of GM(-\/-) mice in vivo and was restored by selective expression of GM-CSF in the lungs of SPC-GM\/GM(-\/-) transgenic mice. Retrovirus-mediated expression of PU.1 in AMs from GM(-\/-) mice rescued host defense functions and surfactant catabolism by AMs. We conclude that PU.1 mediates GM-CSF-dependent effects on terminal differentiation of AMs regulating innate immune functions and surfactant catabolism by AMs.","4417":"PU.1(+\/-)Spi-B(-\/-) mice exhibit reduced numbers of immature and mature B lymphocytes, which exhibit severe defects in response to BCR-mediated stimulation and poor survival. We found that expression of c-rel, a member of the Rel\/NF-kappa B family, is dramatically reduced in PU.1(+\/-)Spi-B(-\/-) splenic B cells. Analysis of the murine c-rel promoter identified three PU.1\/Spi-B binding sites critical for c-rel promoter activity. Furthermore, reintroduction of Rel protein restored wild-type B cell numbers to mice reconstituted with PU.1(+\/-)Spi-B(-\/-) bone marrow. These findings are the first to demonstrate that a member of the Rel\/NF-kappa B family is directly regulated by Ets proteins and dissect the molecular basis for the function of two Ets factors, PU.1 and Spi-B, in promoting B lymphocyte survival.","4418":"Mice without secreted TNF but with functional, normally regulated and expressed membrane-bound TNF (memTNF(Delta\/Delta) mice) were created by knocking-in the uncleavable Delta 1-9,K11E TNF allele. In contrast to TNF-deficient mice (TNF(-\/-)), memTNF supported many features of lymphoid organ structure, except generation of primary B cell follicles. Splenic chemokine expression was near normal. MemTNF-induced apoptosis was mediated through both TNF-R1 and TNF-R2. That memTNF is suboptimal for development of inflammation was revealed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Disease severity was reduced in memTNF(Delta\/Delta) mice relative to wild-type mice, and the nature of spinal cord infiltrates resembled that in TNF(-\/-) mice. We conclude that memTNF supports many processes underlying lymphoid tissue structure, but secreted TNF is needed for optimal inflammatory lesion development.","4419":"B lymphocyte development is regulated at multiple checkpoints, mediated by signals originating both inside and outside the cell. Two signaling pathways known to be essential in this process are interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the pre-B cell receptor (pBCR). We have shown previously that these signaling pathways intersect functionally. Specifically, response to low concentrations of IL-7 requires pBCR expression. In this report, we identify the ERK\/MAP kinase pathway as a key regulatory component of this response. We propose a molecular mechanism for the selective expansion of pBCR(+) precursors and for the culling of inappropriately rearranged pro-B cells.","4420":"While beta 2 integrin ligand-receptor recognition interactions are well characterized, less is known about how these events trigger signal transduction cascades to regulate the transition from tethering to firm adhesion, spreading, and transendothelial migration. We have identified critical positive and negative regulatory components of this cascade in monocytes. Whereas the Syk tyrosine kinase is essential for beta 2 integrin signaling and cell spreading, the Src family kinase Fgr is a negative regulator of this pathway. Fgr selectively inhibits beta 2 but not beta 1 integrin signaling and Syk kinase function via a direct association between the Fgr SH2 domain and Syk tyrosine Y342. The inhibitory effects of Fgr are independent of its kinase activity, are dose dependent, and can be overcome by chemokines and inflammatory mediators.","4421":"We usually think of superantigens (SAg) as dangerous toxins that may cause toxic shock syndrome and death. Now, based on two papers in this issue of Immunity, it seems that we all have SAg genes within us, lying dormant and waiting to be activated under special circumstances.","4422":"Immune cells are in constant need of energy for both basic housekeeping and specific immune functions. Increased energy demand during lymphocyte stimulation is coordinated by signal transduction pathways. This review explores the interface between lymphocyte signaling and energy metabolism. In particular, it discusses recent work that allows weighing signaling routes with respect to their role in the regulation of energy metabolism during lymphocyte activation.","4423":"We have traced emerging hematopoietic cells along human early ontogeny by culturing embryonic tissue rudiments in the presence of stromal cells that promote myeloid and B cell differentiation, and by assaying T cell potential in the NOD-SCID mouse thymus. Hematogenous potential was present inside the embryo as early as day 19 of development in the absence of detectable CD34+ hematopoietic cells, and spanned both lymphoid and myeloid lineages from day 24 in the splanchnopleural mesoderm and derived aorta where CD34+ progenitors appear at day 27. By contrast, hematopoietic cells arising in the third week yolk sac, as well as their progeny at later stages, were restricted to myelopoiesis and therefore are unlikely to contribute to definitive hematopoiesis in man.","4424":"The relative contribution of yolk sac and intraembryonic precursors to hematopoiesis has been a matter of long-standing controversy. As reconstitution activity has so far only been found in embryonic tissues after the onset of circulation, the origin of reconstituting cells could not be formally established. Here, we separated yolk sac and intraembryonic splanchnopleura prior to circulation and maintained the explants in organ culture before transfer. Precursors derived from the intraembryonic site generated multilineage hematopoietic progeny in adult mice for more than 6 months. Yolk sac cells only provided myeloid short-term reconstitution. The results reveal a differential hematopoietic capacity of precirculation embryonic tissues in vivo, and indicate that the only cells capable of adult long-term hematopoiesis are of intraembryonic origin.","4425":"MHC class I ligands are produced mainly by proteasomal proteolysis, in conjunction with an unknown extent of trimming by peptidases. Trimming of precursor peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, a process postulated to be class I dependent, may substantially enhance the efficiency of antigen presentation. However, monitoring of luminal peptide processing has not so far been possible. Here we show that several precursor peptides with amino-terminal extensions are rapidly converted to HLA-A2 ligands by one or several highly efficient metallo-peptidases found on the outer surface of, but also within, microsomes. Surprisingly, luminal trimming is fully active in HLA class I- or TAP-deficient microsomes and precedes peptide association with HLA class I molecules. Trimmed peptides are rapidly depleted from, and become undetectable in, microsomes lacking the restricting class I molecules.","4426":"In this report, we show that the Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) plays an important role in thymocyte development. SLAP expression is developmentally regulated; it is low in CD4-CD8- thymocytes, it peaks in the CD4+CD8+ subset, and it decreases to low levels in more mature cells. Disruption of the SLAP gene leads to a marked upregulation of TCR and CD5 expression at the CD4+CD8+ stage. The absence of SLAP was also developmentally significant because it enhanced positive selection in mice expressing the DO11.10 transgenic T cell receptor. Moreover, SLAP deletion at least partially rescued the development of ZAP-70-deficient thymocytes. These results demonstrate that SLAP participates in a novel mechanism of TCR downregulation at the CD4+CD8+ stage and regulates positive selection.","4427":"It is important to understand which molecules are essential for long-lived immunity. We show that OX40 (CD134) is required with CD28 for the survival of CD4 T cells following antigen-driven expansion. In contrast to CD28-\/- T cells, which show defects early, OX40-\/- T cells are relatively unimpaired in IL-2 production, cell division, and expansion. However, OX40-\/- T cells fail to maintain high levels of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 4-8 days after activation, and undergo apoptosis. Conversely, OX40 stimulation promotes Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and suppresses apoptosis. Moreover, retroviral transduction of OX40-\/- T cells with Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 reverses their survival defect. Thus, a temporal relationship exists between CD28 and OX40, with OX40 being a critical regulator of antigen-driven T cell survival.","4428":"The Nba2 locus is a major genetic contribution to disease susceptibility in the (NZB x NZW)F(1) mouse model of systemic lupus. We generated C57BL\/6 mice congenic for this NZB locus, and these mice produced antinuclear autoantibodies characteristic of lupus. F(1) offspring of congenic and NZW mice developed high autoantibody levels and severe lupus nephritis similar to (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice. Expression profiling with oligonucleotide microarrays revealed only two differentially expressed genes, interferon-inducible genes Ifi202 and Ifi203, in congenic versus control mice, and both were within the Nba2 interval. Quantitative PCR localized increased Ifi202 expression to splenic B cells and non-T\/non-B cells. These results, together with analyses of promoter region polymorphisms, strain distribution of expression, and effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, implicate Ifi202 as a candidate gene for lupus.","4429":"Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are abundant, evolutionarily conserved T cells, commonly enriched in T cell receptor (TCR) gammadelta expression. However, their primary functional potential and constitutive activation state are incompletely understood. To address this, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) was applied to murine TCRgammadelta+ and TCRalphabeta+ intestinal IELs directly ex vivo, identifying 15,574 unique transcripts that collectively portray an \"activated yet resting,\" Th1-skewed, cytolytic, and immunoregulatory phenotype applicable to multiple subsets of gut IELs. Expression of granzymes, Fas ligand, RANTES, prothymosin beta4, junB, RGS1, Btg1, and related molecules is high, whereas expression of conventional cytokines and high-affinity cytokine receptors is low. Differentially expressed genes readily identify heterogeneity among TCRalphabeta+ IELs, whereas differences between resident TCRgammadelta+ IELs and TCRalphabeta+ IELs are less obvious.","4430":"A complete list of molecular components for immune system function is now available with the completion of the human and mouse genome sequences. However, identification and functional annotation of genes involved in immunological processes require a discovery methodology that can efficiently and broadly analyze the complex interplay of these components in vivo. Our recent experience indicates that genome-wide chemical mutagenesis in the mouse is an extremely powerful methodology for the identification of genes required for complex immunological processes.","4431":"Genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in both human patients and animal models. Recent progress in experimental systems and human linkage analysis is providing key insights into the genetic basis for susceptibility and elucidating the manner in which genetic interactions mediate severe disease pathogenesis. Genes in multiple pathways appear to participate in specific elements of the disease, and epistatic interactions among these genes play an important role in both aggravating and suppressing disease development.","4432":"Populations of humans and mice contain alleles at many loci that protect from immune-mediated diseases. Identification of these alleles, some which are likely to function in immune recognition, tolerance, and regulation, will facilitate the development of diagnostics as well as therapeutics that alter disease progression.","4433":"A compendium of global gene expression measurements from DNA microarray analysis of immune cells identifies gene expression signatures defining various lineages, differentiation stages, and signaling pathways. Germinal center (GC) B cells represent a discrete stage of differentiation with a unique gene expression signature. This includes genes involved in proliferation, as evidenced by high expression of G2\/M phase regulators and low expression of ribosomal and metabolic genes that are transcriptional targets of c-myc. GC B cells also lack expression of the NF-kappaB signature genes, which may favor apoptosis. Finally, the transcriptional repression signature of BCL-6 reveals how this factor can prevent terminal differentiation of B cells and cause B cell lymphomas.","4434":"HLA class I and NK receptors are encoded within dense clusters of immune loci. The MHC, at 6p21.3, and the complex containing the KIR loci, at 19q13.4, both feature variation in the number of genes, as well as sequence polymorphism. In addition to T cell receptors, several variable class I-related molecules interact with polymorphic NK receptors. Some of the lectin-related NK receptor genes, at 12p13.1, also have ligands belonging to the extended class I family. The expanding clusters of class I-related sequences and their receptors, some of which evolved recently, reveal further complexity in immune recognition of disease.","4435":"MHC gene organization (size, complexity, gene order) differs markedly among different species, and yet all nonmammalian vertebrates examined to date have a true \"class I region\" with tight linkage of genes encoding the class I presenting and processing molecules. Three paralogous regions of the human genome contain sets of linked genes homologous to various loci in the MHC class I, class II, and\/or class III regions, providing insight into the organization of the \"proto MHC\" before the emergence of the adaptive immune system in the jawed vertebrates.","4436":"The availability of the complete genomic sequences of the human and mouse T cell receptor loci opens up new opportunities for understanding T cell receptors (TCRs) and their genes. The full complement of TCR gene segments is finally known and should prove a valuable resource for supporting functional studies. A rational nomenclature system has been implemented and is widely available through IMGT and other public databases. Systematic comparisons of the genomic sequences within each locus, between loci, and across species enable precise analyses of the various diversification mechanisms and some regulatory signals. The genomic landscape of the TCR loci provides fundamental insights into TCR evolution as highly localized and tightly regulated gene families.","4437":"","4438":"Environmental factors essential for the first stages of B lymphopoiesis remain elusive. Here, we report that immediately after commitment to B lineage, precursors become dependent on a chemokine SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 using mutant and radiation chimeric mice. In bone marrow, generation of the earliest identifiable B cell precursor populations requires CXCR4. In fetal liver, we identified Lin(-)CD19(-)c-kit(+)IL-7Ralpha(+)AA4.1(+), the earliest unipotent B cell precursor population, and found that its development was severely affected in SDF-1(-\/-) embryos but not in IL-7(-\/-) embryos. Lin(-) T cell progenitors appeared normal in SDF-1(-\/-) embryos. Moreover, SDF-1 exhibited specific biologic activities on the earliest B cell precursors. SDF-1 provides the first example of a cytokine responsible for the earliest B lineage stages.","4439":"Mast cells play a pivotal role in innate host immune response to gram-negative bacteria. We report that Janus kinase 3 plays a role in mast cell-mediated bacterial clearance and neutrophil recruitment by regulating the release of tumor necrosis factor from mast cells. The role of JAK3 in mast cell-facilitated neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance was investigated by comparing the neutrophil influxes and bacterial clearance in mast cell-deficient W\/W(v) mice reconstituted with JAK3(+\/+) or JAK(-\/-) mast cells. The neutrophil influx, bacterial clearance, and survival outcome in W\/W(v) mice reconstituted with JAK3(+\/+) mast cells was better than in W\/W(v) mice reconstituted with JAK3(-\/-) mast cells. These findings provide evidence that JAK3 is a key regulator of mast cell-mediated innate immunity against gram-negative bacteria.","4440":"Effector T cells mediate adaptive immunity and immunopathology, but methods for tracking such cells in vivo are limited. We engineered knockin mice expressing IL-4 linked via a viral IRES element with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Reporter T cells primed under Th2 conditions showed sensitive and faithful EGFP expression and maintained endogenous IL-4. After Nippostrongylus infection, reporter expression demonstrated the evolution of type 2 immunity from tissue lymphocytes and thence to lymph node CD4(+) T cells, which subsequently migrated into tissue. The appearance of EGFP(+) CD4(+) T cells in tissue, but not in lymph nodes, was Stat6-dependent. Transferred EGFP(+) CD4(+) T cells from infected animals conferred protection against Nippostrongylus to immunodeficient mice. These mice will provide a valuable reagent for assessing immunity in vivo.","4441":"BLyS and APRIL have similar but distinct biological roles, mediated through two known TNF receptor family members, TACI and BCMA. We show that mice treated with TACI-Ig and TACI-Ig transgenic mice have fewer transitional T2 and mature B cells and reduced levels of circulating immunoglobulin. TACI-Ig treatment inhibits both the production of collagen-specific Abs and the progression of disease in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In BLyS-deficient mice, B cell development is blocked at the transitional T1 stage such that virtually no mature B cells are present, while B-1 cell numbers are relatively normal. These findings further elucidate the roles of BLyS and APRIL in modulating B cell development and suggest that BLyS is required for the development of most but not all mature B cell populations found in the periphery.","4442":"Polycomb group (PcG) gene products regulate homeobox gene expression in Drosophila and vertebrates and also cell cycle progression of immature lymphocytes. In a gene-disrupted mouse for polycomb group gene mel-18, mature peripheral T cells exhibited normal anti-TCR-induced proliferation; however, the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) was significantly reduced, whereas production of IFNgamma was modestly enhanced. Th2 cell differentiation was impaired, and the defect was associated with decreased levels in demethylation of the IL-4 gene. Significantly, reduced GATA3 induction was demonstrated. In vivo antigen-induced IgG1 production and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-induced eosinophilia were significantly affected, reflecting the deficit in Th2 cell differentiation. Thus, the PcG gene products play a critical role in the control of Th2 cell differentiation and Th2-dependent immune responses.","4443":"This study describes abnormalities of the thymus in mice in which the Stat3 gene has been specifically disrupted behind the keratin 5 promoter. In these mice, virtually all of the thymic epithelial cells (TEC) were deficient for Stat3 activation. Adult mutant mice developed severe thymic hypoplasia, which included alterations in the cortical TEC architecture that coincided with the loss of thymocytes. Even during the asymptomatic period of preadolescence, these mice exhibited a higher susceptibility of the thymus to suboptimal doses of dexamethasone or gamma-irradiation, while their thymocytes per se were no more sensitive than controls. These results indicate that Stat3 in TEC plays an essential role in maintaining thymic architecture and thymocyte survival.","4444":"Cdc42 and WASP are critical regulators of actin polymerization whose function during T cell signaling is poorly understood. Using a novel reagent that specifically detects Cdc42-GTP in fixed cells, we found that activated Cdc42 localizes to the T cell:APC contact site in an antigen-dependent manner. TCR signaling alone was sufficient to induce localization of Cdc42-GTP, and functional Lck and Zap-70 kinases were required. WASP also localized to the T cell:APC contact site in an antigen-dependent manner. Surprisingly, WASP localization was independent of the Cdc42 binding domain but required the proline-rich domain. Our results indicate that localized WASP activation requires the integration of multiple signals: WASP is recruited via interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins and is activated by Cdc42-GTP concentrated at the same site.","4445":"Lymphocytes home to lymph nodes, using L-selectin to bind specific ligands on high endothelial venules (HEV). In vitro studies implicate GlcNAc-6-sulfate as an essential posttranslational modification for ligand activity. Here, we show that genetic deletion of HEC-GlcNAc6ST, a sulfotransferase that is highly restricted to HEV, results in the loss of the binding of recombinant L-selectin to the luminal aspect of HEV, elimination of lymphocyte binding in vitro, and markedly reduced in vivo homing. Reactivity with MECA 79, an adhesion-blocking mAb that stains HEV in lymph nodes and vessels in chronic inflammatory sites, is also lost from the luminal aspects of HEV. These results establish a critical role for HEC-GlcNAc6ST in lymphocyte trafficking and suggest it as an important therapeutic target.","4446":"Notch-1 signaling is essential for lymphoid progenitors to undergo T cell commitment, but the mechanism has not been defined. Here we show that thymocytes ectopically expressing Lunatic Fringe, a modifier of Notch-1 signaling, induce lymphoid progenitors to develop into B cells in the thymus. This cell fate switch resulted from Lunatic Fringe-mediated inhibition of Notch-1 function, as revealed by experiments utilizing lymphoid progenitors in which Notch-1 activity was genetically manipulated. These data identify Lunatic Fringe as a potent regulator of Notch-1 during the T\/B lineage decision and show that an important function of Notch-1 in T cell commitment is to suppress B cell development in the thymus.","4447":"In contrast to the current model of MHC class I trafficking, which predicts that once a MHC class I molecule leaves the ER, it moves to the cell surface by bulk flow, we show that HLA-G that is loaded with suboptimal peptides is retrieved from post-ER compartments to the ER. Loading of HLA-G with high-affinity peptides abrogates this retrieval due to the lack of binding affinity to coatomer. Moreover, the loss of the endocytosis motif in the truncated cytoplasmic tail results in the prolonged half-life of HLA-G on the cell surface. Our findings reveal that surface expression of HLA-G can be further regulated in post-ER compartments and that the truncated cytoplasmic tail plays a critical role in such quality-control mechanisms.","4448":"NKG2D is a potent activating receptor on natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages. Mouse NKG2D interacts with two cell surface ligands related to class I MHC molecules: RAE1 and H60. We used soluble versions of NKG2D, RAE1, and H60 to characterize their interactions. RAE1 and H60 each bind NKG2D with nanomolar affinities, indicating tighter binding than most cell surface immune interactions, but NKG2D binds to H60 with approximately 25-fold higher affinity than to RAE1. RAE1 and H60 compete directly for occupancy of NKG2D, and, thus, NKG2D can be occupied by only one ligand at a time. The NKG2D-H60 interaction is more temperature dependent and makes greater use of electrostatic interactions than the NKG2D-RAE1 interaction. The distinct thermodynamic profiles provide insights into the different molecular mechanisms of the binding interactions.","4449":"Four transcriptional enhancers lie downstream of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus: Calpha3'\/hs3a, hs1,2, hs3b, and hs4. Although individually weak, these elements have strong transcriptional synergies when combined and they altogether behave as a locus control region. Previous knockout experiments in the 3' region have shown that both hs3a and hs1,2 are dispensable for normal expression and rearrangement of the IgH locus but that their replacement with a transcribed neo gene severely affects class switch recombination. Here we show that even in the absence of a neo gene, joint deletion of the last two 3' enhancers, hs3b and hs4, severely impairs germline transcription and class switching to most isotypes and may in addition affect mu gene expression in resting B cells.","4450":"The mechanisms responsible for degeneration of germinal centers (GC) and follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks during progression to AIDS remain elusive. Here, we show that CD4(+) T cells from CD4C\/HIV-1 Tg mice, which develop a severe AIDS-like disease, express low levels of CD40 ligand. Accordingly, GC formation, FDC networks, and immunoglobulin isotype switching are impaired in these animals. However, Tg B cells respond to in vitro CD40 stimulation. Total serum IgG levels are reduced in Tg mice, whereas total IgM levels are increased with a significant amount showing DNA specificity. IFN-gamma- and IL-6-deficient CD4C\/HIV Tg mice also develop the AIDS-like disease and produce auto-Ab. Thus, CD4C\/HIV Tg mice have immune dysfunction accompanied by autoimmune responses.","4451":"The interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) chain is an essential component of high-affinity IL-2 receptors. Accordingly, IL-2Ralpha expression helps to regulate T cell growth and other lymphoid functions. Lineage-restricted and activation-dependent IL-2Ralpha transcription is controlled by three upstream positive regulatory regions (PRRs). We now describe an additional IL-2 response element, PRRIV, within intron 1, in humans and mice. PRRIV activity requires GAS motifs that bind Stat5 proteins and additional upstream HMG-I(Y) binding sites. Moreover, IL-2 induces the binding of HMG-I(Y), Stat5a, and Stat5b in vivo to PRRIV and PRRIII, which also functions as an IL-2 response element. Thus, the IL-2 inducibility of the IL-2Ralpha gene is unexpectedly mediated by two widely separated regulatory Stat5-dependent elements, located both upstream and downstream of the transcription initiation sites.","4452":"An aberrant T cell response to enteric bacteria is important in inflammatory bowel disease. However, the identity of relevant microbial antigens is unknown. Here, we report the presence of I2, a Crohn's disease-associated microbial gene, in the murine intestine. The I2 protein induced a proliferative and IL-10 response by CD4(+) T cells from unimmunized mice. The I2 response was dependent on MHC class II-mediated recognition but did not require antigen processing. Selective activation was observed for the TCR-Vbeta5 subpopulation. These findings indicate that the I2 protein is a new class of T cell superantigen and suggest that colonization by the I2 microorganism in susceptible hosts may provide a superantigenic stimulus pertinent to Crohn's disease pathogenesis.","4453":"The clinical association between viral infection and onset or exacerbation of autoimmune disorders remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the relative roles of molecular mimicry and nonspecific inflammatory stimuli in progression from infection to autoimmune disease. Murine herpes virus 1 (HSV-1 KOS) infection triggers T cell-dependent autoimmune reactions to corneal tissue. We generated an HSV-1 KOS point mutant containing a single amino acid exchange within the putative mimicry epitope as well as mice expressing a TCR transgene specific for the self-peptide mimic to allow dissection of two pathogenic mechanisms in disease induction. These experiments indicate that viral mimicry is essential for disease induction after low-level viral infection of animals containing limited numbers of autoreactive T cells, while innate immune mechanisms become sufficient to provoke disease in animals containing relatively high numbers of autoreactive T cells.","4454":"The mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of complement activation is part of the innate immune defense. The binding of MBL to microbial carbohydrates activates the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which recruit the complement factors, C4 and C2, to generate the C3 convertase or directly activate C3. We present a phylogenetically highly conserved member of the MBL complex, MASP-3, which is generated through alternative splicing of the MASP-1\/3 gene. The designation of MASP-3 as a protease is based on homology to known MASPs. Different MBL oligomers were found to have distinct MASP composition and biological activities. MASP-1, MAp19, and direct C3-cleaving activity are associated with smaller oligomers whereas MASP-3 is found together with MASP-2 on larger oligomers. MASP-3 downregulate the C4 and C2 cleaving activity of MASP-2.","4455":"E-, P-, and L-selectin counterreceptor activities, leukocyte trafficking, and lymphocyte homing are controlled prominently but incompletely by alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase FucT-VII-dependent fucosylation. Molecular determinants for FucT-VII-independent leukocyte trafficking are not defined, and evidence for contributions by or requirements for other FucTs in leukocyte recruitment is contradictory and incomplete. We show here that inflammation-dependent leukocyte recruitment retained in FucT-VII deficiency is extinguished in FucT-IV(-\/-)\/FucT-VII(-\/-) mice. Double deficiency yields an extreme leukocytosis characterized by decreased neutrophil turnover and increased neutrophil production. FucT-IV also contributes to HEV-born L-selectin ligands, since lymphocyte homing retained in FucT-VII(-\/-) mice is revoked in FucT-IV(-\/-)\/FucT-VII(-\/-) mice. These observations reveal essential FucT-IV-dependent contributions to E-, P-, and L-selectin ligand synthesis and to the control of leukocyte recruitment and lymphocyte homing.","4456":"Unassembled Ig heavy chains are retained in the ER via the binding of BiP to the C(H)1 domain, which remains unoxidized. Interestingly, this domain folds rapidly, albeit nonproductively, when heavy chains are released from BiP in vitro with ATP. The in vivo cycling of BiP from heavy chains was monitored using BiP ATPase mutants as kinetic traps. Our data suggest that BiP does not cycle from the C(H)1 domain of free heavy chains. However, heavy and light chain assembly occurs rapidly and requires the ATP-dependent release of BiP. We propose that BiP's ATPase cycle is stalled or nonproductive when it is bound to free heavy chains. The binding of light chains to the complex reactivates the cycle and releases BiP.","4457":"The large set of peptides presented by MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I molecules are generated by proteolysis of diverse precursors in the cytoplasm and possibly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To define the potential peptide trimming events in the ER, we analyzed proteolytic products generated in isolated microsomes. The residues flanking the N terminus of the final antigenic peptide were rapidly removed within the microsomes but only in the presence of appropriate MHC molecules. Remarkably, the precursor peptide was bound to the MHC molecules in a distinct conformation and required an aminopeptidase activity to generate the optimal peptide. The MHC molecules are therefore not only the final repositories of antigenic peptides, but they can also direct their excision from longer precursors.","4458":"Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells comprise 2%-5% of human peripheral blood T cells, recognize ubiquitous nonpeptide antigens, and expand up to 50-fold during microbial infection. It is not clear why these Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells expand only after microbial infection. We show here that the stress-inducible molecule, MICA, is induced on the surface of dendritic and epithelial cells by infection with M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo. MICA engagement by the activating receptor, NKG2D, present on Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells, resulted in a substantial enhancement of the TCR-dependent Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cell response to nonpeptide antigens and protein superantigens alike. Thus, a MICA-NKG2D interaction may be necessary for an effective innate immune response to microbe-associated antigens that also are constitutively present in vivo.","4459":"Kinetic features of TCR:MHC\/peptide interactions dictate their outcome in vitro, some important parameters of which include the number of molecules engaged and the duration of engagement. We explored the in vivo significance of these findings in transgenic mice expressing TCRs in a quantitatively and temporally controlled manner. As anticipated, reduced TCR levels resulted in attenuated reactivity, but response thresholds were substantially lower than expected-at as low as 1\/20th the normal TCR numbers and with no indication of phenotypic skewing at suboptimal levels. We also studied survival of T lymphocytes stripped of their TCRs. Unlike B cells, T cells lacking antigen receptors did not die precipitously; instead, populations decayed gradually, just as previously reported in the absence of MHC molecules.","4460":"The widely accepted kinetic proofreading theory proposes that rapid TCR dissociation from a peptide\/MHC ligand allows for stimulation of early but not late T cell activation events, explaining why low-affinity TCR ligands are poor agonists. We identified a low-affinity TCR ligand which stimulated late T cell responses but, contrary to predictions from kinetic proofreading, inefficiently induced early activation events. Furthermore, responses induced by this ligand were kinetically delayed compared to its high-affinity counterpart. Using peptide\/MHC tetramers, we showed that activation characteristics could be dissociated from TCR occupancy by the peptide\/MHC ligands. Our data argue that T cell responses are triggered by a cumulative signal which is reached at different time points for different TCR ligands.","4461":"The transcription factor NFAT5\/TonEBP is evolutionarily the oldest member of the NFAT\/Rel family of transcription factors. We show that NFAT5 is uniquely related to NF-kappaB and is the only member of the Rel\/NFAT family to be activated by osmotic stress. Like Rel\/NF-kappaB proteins but unlike the calcium-regulated NFAT proteins, NFAT5 is constitutively dimeric, and dimerization is essential for DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Using dominant-negative proteins that inhibit NFAT5 dimerization, we show that NFAT5 regulates expression of the TNFalpha and lymphotoxin-beta genes in osmotically stressed T cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that NFAT5 binds to the TNFalpha promoter in vivo. We suggest that NFAT5 participates in specific aspects of host defense by upregulating TNF family genes and other target genes in T cells.","4462":"Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a dimeric cytokine that plays a central role in suppressing inflammatory responses. These activities are dependent on the interaction of IL-10 with its high-affinity receptor (IL-10R1). This intermediate complex must subsequently recruit the low-affinity IL-10R2 chain before cell signaling can occur. Here we report the 2.9 A crystal structure of IL-10 bound to a soluble form of IL-10R1 (sIL-10R1). The complex consists of two IL-10s and four sIL-10R1 molecules. Several residues in the IL-10\/sIL-10R1 interface are conserved in all IL-10 homologs and their receptors. The data suggests that formation of the active IL-10 signaling complex occurs by a novel molecular recognition paradigm where IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 both recognize the same binding site on IL-10.","4463":"We have found that DR6, a member of the TNF receptor family, is highly expressed in resting T cells and downregulated in activated T cells. DR6-targeted mutant mice were generated and showed normal development. However, DR6(-\/-) CD4(+) T cells hyperproliferated in response to TCR-mediated stimulation and protein antigen challenge. Activated DR6(-\/-) CD4(+) T cells exhibited upregulated CD25 expression and enhanced proliferation in response to exogenous IL-2 stimulation. In addition, increased CD28 and reduced CTLA-4 expression were observed in these cells. Enhanced Th2 cytokine production by activated DR6(-\/-) CD4(+) T cells was associated with the increased transcription factor NF-ATc in nuclei. DR6, therefore, functions as a regulatory receptor for mediating CD4(+) T cell activation and maintaining proper immune responses.","4464":"Using a combination of local gene delivery and tolerizing DNA vaccination, we demonstrate that codelivery of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene and a DNA vaccine encoding the self-peptide proteolipid protein 139-151 (PLP139-151) provides protective immunity against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide evidence for a mechanism whereby IL-4 expressed from the naked DNA is secreted and acts locally on autoreactive T cells via activation of STAT6 to shift their cytokine profile to T helper 2. We also show that DNA vaccines can be used to reverse established EAE by covaccination with the genes for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and IL-4. This treatment strategy combines the antigen-specific effects of DNA vaccination and the beneficial effects of local gene delivery.","4465":"","4466":"","4467":"Although IgE binding to mast cells is thought to be a passive presensitization step, we demonstrate herein that monomeric IgE (mIgE) in the absence of antigen (Ag) stimulates multiple phosphorylation events in normal murine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). While mIgE does not induce degranulation or leukotriene synthesis, it leads to a more potent production of cytokines than IgE + Ag. Moreover, mIgE prevents the apoptosis of cytokine-deprived BMMCs, likely by maintaining Bcl-X(L) levels and producing autocrine-acting cytokines. The addition of Ag does not increase this IgE-induced survival. Since IgE concentrations as low as 0.1 microg\/ml enhance BMMC survival, elevated plasma IgE levels in humans with atopic disorders may contribute to the elevated mast cell numbers seen in these individuals.","4468":"Mast cells play critical roles in hypersensitivity and in defense against certain parasites. We provide evidence that mouse mast cell survival and growth are promoted by monomeric IgE binding to its high-affinity receptor, Fc epsilon RI. Monomeric IgE does not promote DNA synthesis but suppresses the apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation. This antiapoptotic effect occurs in parallel with IgE-induced increases in Fc epsilon RI surface expression but requires the continuous presence of IgE. This process does not involve the FasL\/Fas death pathway or several Bcl-2 family proteins and induces a distinctly different signal than Fc epsilon RI cross-linking. The ability of IgE to enhance mast cell survival and Fc epsilon RI expression may contribute to amplified allergic reactions.","4469":"The B lineage commitment factor Pax5 (BSAP) is expressed throughout B cell development. To investigate its late function, we generated a mouse strain carrying a floxed Pax5 allele that was conditionally inactivated by CD19-cre or Mx-cre expression. Pax5 deletion resulted in the preferential loss of mature B cells, inefficient lymphoblast formation, and reduced serum IgG levels. Mature B cells radically changed their gene expression pattern in response to Pax5 inactivation. Most B cell antigens were downregulated on the cell surface, and the transcription of B cell-specific genes was decreased, whereas the expression of non-B lymphoid genes was activated in Pax5-deficient B cells. These data demonstrate that Pax5 is essential for maintaining the identity and function of B cells during late B lymphopoiesis.","4470":"Gene expression profiling was used to explore the role of Nef in HIV. Nef induces a transcriptional program in T cells that is 97% identical to that of anti-CD3 T cell activation. This program is inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin. A requirement for TCR zeta and ZAP-70 is demonstrated for formation of the complete profile. Among eight factors particular to the anti-CD3 activation profile are IL16 and YY1, negative regulators of HIV transcription. In contrast, Nef exclusively upregulates factors positively regulating HIV, including Tat-SF1, U1 SNRNP, and IRF-2. New genes associated with Nef include CDK9, the induction of which enhances Tat function. Thus, Nef acts as a master switch early in the viral life cycle, forcing an environment conducive to dynamic viral production.","4471":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill virus-infected target cells and play a critical role in host recovery from viral infections. Granzyme B (GrB) is a cytotoxic lymphocyte granule protease that plays a critical role in mediating cytotoxicity. In these studies, we demonstrate that the adenovirus assembly protein L4--100K (100K) is a GrB substrate that prevents cytotoxic lymphocyte granule-induced apoptosis in infected target cells by potently inhibiting GrB. This inhibition is absolutely dependent on Asp-48 in 100K, found within a classic GrB consensus motif. 100K is the first viral protein described that exclusively targets the GrB pathway. It represents a novel class of viral protease inhibitor, in which an essential, multifunctional viral protein, which is vulnerable to specific proteolysis by GrB, expresses inhibitory function against that protease.","4472":"We have investigated the mechanisms that control MHC class II (MHC II) expression in immature and activated dendritic cells (DC) grown from spleen and bone marrow precursors. Degradation of the MHC II chaperone invariant chain (Ii), acquisition of peptide cargo by MHC II, and delivery of MHC II-peptide complexes to the cell surface proceeded similarly in both immature and activated DC. However, immature DC reendocytosed and then degraded the MHC II-peptide complexes much faster than the activated DC. MHC II expression in DC is therefore not controlled by the activity of the protease(s) that degrade Ii, but by the rate of endocytosis of peptide-loaded MHC II. Late after activation, DC downregulated MHC II synthesis both in vitro and in vivo.","4473":"Interferon-alpha and -beta inhibit the interleukin-7-mediated growth and survival of T and B lymphoid progenitors via an unknown, STAT1-independent pathway. Gene expression profile analysis of interferon-beta-treated progenitor B cells revealed enhanced Daxx expression, with concomitant Daxx protein increase and nuclear body translocation. The interferon effects included downregulation of cell cycle regulating genes and cell cycle arrest, followed by Bcl-2 downregulation and apoptosis. Daxx antisense oligonucleotides rescued the interferon-treated pro-B cells from growth arrest and apoptosis in parallel with the reduction of nuclear Daxx. These findings implicate the gene repressor function of Daxx in interferon-induced apoptosis of lymphoid progenitors.","4474":"T cell apoptosis is critical to development and homeostasis of the immune system. The most salient feature of apoptosis is the lack of an attendant inflammatory response or tissue damage. Here, we present evidence that apoptotic T cells release TGF-beta, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive milieu. Apoptotic T cells released not only latent but also bio-active TGF-beta. Nonetheless, TGF-beta transcription was not upregulated, suggesting release of existing rather than synthesis of new TGF-beta. Localized within the intracellular membrane-bound compartment, which includes mitochondria, TGF-beta was redistributed into the cytosol following loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. TGF-beta secreted from apoptotic T cells inhibited proinflammatory cytokine production by activated macrophages to foster immune suppression. These findings broaden the potential mechanisms whereby induction of immune tolerance or deficiency occurs through T cell deletion.","4475":"During acute inflammation, leukocyte recruitment is characterized by an initial infiltration of neutrophils, which are later replaced by a more sustained population of mononuclear cells. Based on both clinical and experimental evidence, we present a role for IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) in controlling this pattern of leukocyte recruitment during peritoneal inflammation. Liberation of sIL-6R from the initial neutrophil infiltrate acts as a regulator of CXC and CC chemokine expression, which contributes to a suppression of neutrophil recruitment and the concurrent attraction of mononuclear leukocytes. Soluble IL-6R-mediated signaling is therefore an important intermediary in the resolution of inflammation and supports transition between the early predominantly neutrophilic stage of an infection and the more sustained mononuclear cell influx.","4476":"Neutrophil accumulation is a hallmark of immune complex-mediated inflammatory disorders. Current models of neutrophil recruitment envision the capture of circulating neutrophils by activated endothelial cells. We now demonstrate that immobilized immune complexes alone support the rapid attachment of neutrophils, under physiologic flow conditions. Initial cell tethering requires the low-affinity Fc gamma receptor IIIB (Fc gamma RIIIB), and the beta(2) integrins are additionally required for the subsequent shear-resistant adhesion. The attachment function of Fc gamma RIIIB may be facilitated by its observed presentation on neutrophil microvilli. In vivo, in a model of acute antiglomerular basement membrane nephritis in which immune complexes are accessible to circulating neutrophils, Fc gamma RIII-deficient mice had a significant reduction in neutrophil recruitment. Thus, the interaction of immune complexes with Fc gamma RIII may mediate early neutrophil recruitment in immune complex-mediated inflammation.","4477":"The mechanism of T cell receptor signaling is unclear. Included among models for TCR signaling is ligand-induced oligomerization in a fashion analogous to other cell surface receptors. Published kinetic, saturation binding, and light scattering experiments have been interpreted to suggest a propensity for soluble alpha beta TCR\/peptide\/MHC ectodomain complexes to oligomerize. Upon performing these experiments with soluble ectodomains of human class I and class II restricted alpha beta TCRs, we find no evidence for dimerization or oligomerization of complexes. Apparently, oligomerization in solution to a detectable extent is not a general property of soluble alpha beta TCRs or their complexes with ligand. Our results suggest that membrane-anchored, fully assembled TCRs should be studied to determine the role oligomerization plays in T cell signaling.","4478":"To elucidate the process of TCR-mediated signaling pathways in lipid rafts, we constructed a chimeric molecule that localizes activated SHP-1 to rafts. Raft targeting of activated SHP-1 in Jurkat-derived transfectants completely inhibited the expression of CD69 and transcriptional factors after TCR cross-linking. Whereas the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR zeta and ZAP-70 and the kinase activity of Lck were intact, phosphorylated LAT was rapidly dephosphorylated by raft targeting of activated SHP-1, leading to defects in LAT activation and subsequent downstream signaling events. Intriguingly, recruitment of endogenous SHP-1 to rafts and its association with LAT were dramatically increased after TCR engagement, suggesting that SHP-1 is involved in raft-mediated T cell activation.","4479":"","4480":"","4481":"","4482":"Ig somatic mutations would be introduced by a polymerase (pol) while repairing DNA outside main DNA replication. We show that human B cells constitutively express the translesion pol zeta, which effectively extends DNA past mismatched bases (mispair extender), and pol eta, which bypasses DNA lesions in an error-free fashion. Upon B cell receptor (BCR) engagement and coculture with activated CD4+ T cells, these lymphocytes upregulated pol zeta, downregulated pol eta, and mutated the Ig and bcl-6 genes. Inhibition of the pol zeta REV3 catalytic subunit by specific phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides impaired Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation and UV damage-induced DNA mutagenesis, without affecting cell cycle or viability. Thus, pol zeta plays a critical role in Ig and bcl-6 hypermutation, perhaps facilitated by the downregulation of pol eta.","4483":"Approximately 9% of in-frame mu heavy chain transcripts found in normal human pro-B cells encode proteins that can be expressed on the cell surface in the absence of surrogate or conventional light chains. These unusual mu heavy chains demonstrate preferential use of certain VH genes (VH3-23), frequent expression of DH regions in underrepresented reading frames, and an increased number of positively charged amino acids within the CDR3 region. Transcripts for these proteins are not found in pre-B cells or in mature B cells. When expressed in Jurkat T cells with the Ig(alpha)\/Ig(beta) signal transduction module, these aberrant mu heavy chains induce cell activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that some mu heavy chains elicit negative selection at the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition.","4484":"The rate of pathogen elimination determines the extent and consequences of an infection. In this context, the spleen with its highly specialized lymphoid compartments plays a central role in clearing blood-borne pathogens. Splenic marginal zone B cells (MZ), by virtue of their preactivated state and topographical location, join B1 B cells to generate a massive wave of IgM producing plasmablasts in the initial 3 days of a primary response to particulate bacterial antigens. Because of the intensity and rapidity of this response, combined with the types of antibodies produced, splenic MZ and B1 B cells endowed with a \"natural memory\" provide a bridge between the very early innate and the later appearing adaptive immune response.","4485":"Most splenic B cells in mice that lack Aiolos are mature IgD(hi)IgM(lo) follicular lymphocytes, suggesting that maturation signals delivered via the BCR are enhanced in the absence of Aiolos. The enhanced maturation of follicular B cells is accompanied by the absence of MZ B lymphocytes and the downregulation of CD21 expression in follicular B cells, all of which depend on the generation of signals via Btk, which is in epistasis to Aiolos. The inverse relationship between the strength of BCR signaling and MZ B cell development is supported by an examination of MZ B cells in CD21 null mice. These data support the view that antigens (in contrast to \"tonic\" signals) drive the development of naive B cells.","4486":"In this study, we have compared the effector functions and fate of a number of human CTL clones in vitro or ex vivo following contact with variant peptides presented either on the cell surface or in a soluble multimeric format. In the presence of CD8 coreceptor binding, there is a good correlation between TCR signaling, killing of the targets, and FasL-mediated CTL apoptosis. Blocking CD8 binding using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I results in much reduced signaling and reduced killing of the targets. Surprisingly, however, FasL expression is induced to a similar degree on these CTLs, and apoptosis of CTL is unaffected. The ability to divorce these events may allow the deletion of antigen-specific and pathological CTL populations without the deleterious effects induced by full CTL activation.","4487":"The p38 and JNK stress-activated MAPK signal transduction pathways are activated by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and are required for IFN-gamma production by TH1 effector cells. Here, we show that the expression of GADD45gamma is induced during T cell activation and that the level of expression is higher in TH1 cells than in TH2 cells. TH1 cells from GADD45gamma(-\/-) mice are severely compromised in their abilities to activate p38 and JNK in response to TCR signaling, produce much less IFN-gamma upon restimulation, and are deficient in activation-induced cell death (AICD). Additionally, GADD45gamma deficiencies caused reduced contact hypersensitivity in mice. Thus, GADD45gamma mediates activation of the p38 and JNK pathways and effector function of TH1 cells.","4488":"TACI is a TNFR homolog expressed by mature B lymphocytes that has been implicated in the positive regulation of B cell growth and antibody production, as well as in the development of autoimmune disease. Its biology is complex due to the existence of two ligands, BLyS and APRIL, and a homologous receptor, BCMA, that similarly binds both ligands. To determine its critical biological role, we generated TACI knockout mice. Surprisingly, these mice demonstrated a 2-fold increase in numbers of circulating and splenic B cells, apparently due to increased proliferation rate. Maturation of B cells and T-dependent antibody production was normal, but responses to T-independent type II antigens were almost completely abolished. It appears that TACI provides an essential costimulatory signal for the T-independent humoral response.","4489":"Mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding a lymphoid-expressed orphan G protein-coupled receptor, G2A, demonstrate a normal pattern of T and B lineage differentiation through young adulthood. As G2A-deficient animals age, they develop secondary lymphoid organ enlargement associated with abnormal expansion of both T and B lymphocytes. Older G2A-deficient mice (&gt;1 year) develop a slowly progressive wasting syndrome, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration into various tissues, glomerular immune complex deposition, and anti-nuclear autoantibodies. G2A-deficient T cells are hyperresponsive to TCR stimulation, exhibiting enhanced proliferation and a lower threshold for activation. Our findings demonstrate that G2A plays a critical role in controlling peripheral lymphocyte homeostasis and that its ablation results in the development of a novel, late-onset autoimmune syndrome.","4490":"Homing behavior and function of autoimmune CD4+ T cells in vivo was analyzed before and during EAE, using MBP-specific T cells retrovirally engineered to express the gene of green fluorescent protein. The cells migrate from parathymic lymph nodes to blood and to the spleen. Preceding disease onset, large numbers of effector cells invade the CNS, with only negligible numbers left in the periphery. In early EAE, most (&gt;90%) infiltrating CD4+ cells were effector cells. Migratory effector cells downregulate activation markers (CD25, OX-40) but upregulate several chemokine receptors and adsorb MHC class II on their membranes. Within the CNS, the effector cells are reactivated, with upregulated proinflammatory cytokines and downmodulated T cell receptor-associated structures, presumably reflecting autoantigen recognition in situ.","4491":"Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), also known as STAT-induced STAT inhibitor-1 (SSI-1), is a negative feedback molecule for cytokine signaling, and its in vivo deletion induces fulminant hepatitis. However, elimination of the STAT1 or STAT6 gene or deletion of NKT cells substantially prevented severe hepatitis in SOCS-1-deficient mice, while administration of IFN-gamma and IL-4 accelerated its development. SOCS-1 deficiency not only sustained IFN-gamma\/IL-4 signaling but also eliminated the cross-inhibitory action of IFN-gamma on IL-4 signaling. These results suggest that SOCS-1 deficiency-induced persistent activation of STAT1 and STAT6, which would be inhibited by SOCS-1 under normal conditions, may induce abnormal activation of NKT cells, thus leading to lethal pathological changes in SOCS-1-deficient mice.","4492":"PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, is essential for embryogenesis. We used the Cre-loxP system to generate a T cell-specific deletion of the Pten gene (Pten(flox\/-) mice). All Pten(flox\/-) mice develop CD4+ T cell lymphomas by 17 weeks. Pten(flox\/-) mice show increased thymic cellularity due in part to a defect in thymic negative selection. Pten(flox\/-) mice exhibit elevated levels of B cells and CD4+ T cells in the periphery, spontaneous activation of CD4+ T cells, autoantibody production, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Pten(flox\/-) T cells hyperproliferate, are autoreactive, secrete increased levels of Th1\/Th2 cytokines, resist apoptosis, and show increased phosphorylation of PKB\/Akt and ERK. Peripheral tolerance to SEB is also impaired in Pten(flox\/-) mice. PTEN is thus an important regulator of T cell homeostasis and self-tolerance.","4493":"IE\/DR MHC class II molecules have an extensive H-bonding network under the bound peptide. In IE(k), two alpha chain acidic amino acids in the core of this network were mutated to amides. At low pH, the mutant molecule exchanged peptide much more rapidly than the wild-type. The crystal structure of the mutant IE(k) revealed the loss of a single buried water molecule and a reorganization of the predicted H-bonding network. We suggest that these mutations enhance the transition of MHC class II to an open conformation at low pH allowing the bound peptide to escape. In wild-type IE(k), the need to protonate these amino acids also may be a bottleneck in the return to a closed conformation after peptide binding.","4494":"We previously reported that treatment of mice with a neutralizing mAb against listeriolysin O (LLO), the pore-forming toxin of Listeria monocytogenes, provided resistance to this intracellular bacterium. We evaluated whether anti-LLO mAb would affect Listeria handling by macrophages, essential cells in Listeria resistance. Macrophages infected in the presence of anti-LLO mAb showed a marked reduction in intracellular Listeria growth, with a concomitant block in LLO-dependent Listeria passage from phagosome to cytosol. Anti-LLO mAb did not opsonize Listeria but, rather, acted within macrophages to neutralize LLO. Importantly, anti-LLO mAb effects on Listeria growth were independent of Fcgamma receptor expression, IFNgamma signaling, and production of nitric oxide and superoxide. These results identify a novel mechanism for antibody control of bacteria within macrophages.","4495":"","4496":"","4497":"The present study has assessed the impact of the intracellular domains of CD4 and CD8 on positive selection and lineage direction of MHC class I-restricted thymocytes. Contrary to current presumption, we found that the CD4 tail promotes the generation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without preference for the CD4+ T cell lineage. We also found that the identity of the coreceptor tail and hence the strength of coreceptor signaling determine the number of thymocytes undergoing positive selection but not their ultimate CD4\/CD8 phenotype. These findings demonstrate that the strength of coreceptor signaling has a significant quantitative but not qualitative impact on positive selection and provide a simple explanation for the greater numbers of CD4+ than CD8+ T cells selected in the normal thymus.","4498":"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis, is induced by activating a subset of myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells that have escaped tolerance induction. Here, we define the tolerance mechanisms that eliminate the majority of MBP-specific T cells from the periphery. We show that MBP-specific T cells undergo central tolerance mediated by bone marrow-derived antigen-presenting cells presenting exogenously derived MBP epitopes. The efficiency of tolerance is age dependent, reflecting the developmentally regulated expression of MBP. Dependence of tolerance on the amount of MBP expressed in vivo results in an age window of susceptibility to EAE in mice that peaks during puberty. These results suggest that factors regulating expression of self-antigens in vivo can influence susceptibility to autoimmunity.","4499":"Type I interferons (IFN-I) are rapidly induced following infection and play a key role in nonspecific inhibition of virus replication. Here we have investigated the effects of IFN-I on the generation of antigen-specific antibody responses. The data show that IFN-I potently enhance the primary antibody response to a soluble protein, stimulating the production of all subclasses of IgG, and induce long-lived antibody production and immunological memory. In addition, endogenous production of IFN-I was shown to be essential for the adjuvant activity of CFA. Finally, IFN-I enhanced the antibody response and induced isotype switching when dendritic cells were the only cell type responding to IFN-I. The data reveal the potent adjuvant activity of IFN-I and their important role in linking innate and adaptive immunity.","4500":"Using a transgenic approach, we examined distal regulatory elements located in the IL-4 locus and the role of GATA-3 at these elements. The intergenic DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSS) showed strong enhancement, and the intronic enhancer (IE) and HS5\/HS5a sites showed weaker enhancement of the IL-4 promoter. Elements in the 3' region of the IL-4 gene contributed to Th2 specificity. All individual enhancers were T cell activation dependent but not Th2 specific, with the exception of IE. However, when these distal elements were combined into a \"minilocus,\" expression was strongly enhanced and Th2 specific. GATA-3 mediated strong enhancement of IL-4 promoter activity in Th1 cells when the promoter was embedded in the minilocus or linked to HSS and IE, demonstrating that GATA-3 acts through these elements to regulate IL-4 gene expression.","4501":"","4502":"","4503":"","4504":"","4505":"","4506":"","4507":"","4508":"","4509":"","4510":"","4511":"Human gammadelta T cells expressing the Vgamma2Vdelta2 antigen receptors recognize nonpeptide prenyl pyrophosphate and alkylamine antigens. We find that they also recognize staphylococcal enterotoxin A superantigens in a manner distinct from the recognition of nonpeptide antigens. Using chimeric and mutant toxins, SEA amino acid residues 20-27 were shown to be required for gammadelta TCR recognition of SEA. Residues at 200-207 that are critical for specific alphabeta TCR recognition of SEA do not affect gammadelta TCR recognition. SEA residues 20-27 are located in an area contiguous with the binding site of V beta chains. This study defines a superantigen recognition site for a gammadelta T cell receptor and demonstrates the differences between Vgamma2Vdelta2+ T cell recognition of superantigens and nonpeptide antigens.","4512":"T cell activation induces functional changes in cell shape and cytoskeletal architecture. To facilitate the collection of dynamic, high-resolution images of activated T cells, we plated T cells on coverslips coated with antibodies to the T cell receptor (TCR). Using these images, we were able to quantitate the morphological responses of individual cells over time. Here, we show that TCR engagement triggers the formation and expansion of contacts bounded by continuously remodeled actin-rich rings. These processes are associated with the extension of lamellipodia and require actin polymerization, tyrosine kinase activation, cytoplasmic calcium increases, and LAT, an important hematopoietic adaptor. In addition, the maintenance of the resulting contact requires sustained calcium influxes, an intact microtubule cytoskeleton, and functional LAT.","4513":"Complexes of the heat shock protein gp96 and antigenic peptides are taken up by antigen-presenting cells and presented by MHC class I molecules. In order to explain the unusual efficiency of this process, the uptake of gp96 had been postulated to occur through a receptor, identified recently as CD91. We show here that complexes of peptides with heat shock proteins hsp90, calreticulin, and hsp70 are also taken up by macrophages and dendritic cells and re-presented by MHC class I molecules. All heat shock proteins utilize the CD91 receptor, even though some of the proteins have no homology with each other. Postuptake processing of gp96-chaperoned peptides requires proteasomes and the transporters associated with antigen processing, utilizing the classical endogenous antigen presentation pathway.","4514":"Adhesion molecules are believed to facilitate infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS of mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The role of the adhesion molecule CD62L (L-selectin) in the immunopathology of EAE is not known. To study this, we crossed CD62L-deficient mice with myelin basic protein-specific TCR (MBP-TCR) transgenic mice. CD62L-deficient MBP-TCR transgenic mice failed to develop antigen-induced EAE, and, despite the presence of leukocyte infiltration, damage to myelin in the CNS was not seen. EAE could, however, be induced in CD62L-deficient mice upon adoptive transfer of wild-type macrophages. Our results suggest that CD62L is not required for activation of autoimmune CD4 T cells but is important for the final destructive function of effector cells in the CNS and support a novel mechanism whereby CD62L expressed on effector cells is important in mediating myelin damage.","4515":"Abnormalities of chromosome 1q21 are common in B cell malignancies, but their target genes are largely unknown. By cloning the breakpoints of a (1;14) (q21;q32) chromosomal translocation in a myeloma cell line, we have identified two novel genes, IRTA1 and IRTA2, encoding cell surface receptors homologous to the Fc and inhibitory receptor families. Both genes are selectively expressed in mature B cells: IRTA1 in marginal zone B cells and IRTA2 in centrocytes, marginal zone B cells, and immunoblasts. As a result of the t(1;14), IRTA1 is fused to the immunoglobulin Calpha domain to produce a chimeric IRTA1\/Calpha fusion protein. In tumor cell lines with 1q21 abnormalities, IRTA2 expression is deregulated. Thus, IRTA1 and IRTA2 are novel immunoreceptors implicated in B cell development and lymphomagenesis.","4516":"Lymphocytes leave the blood using a sequential adhesion cascade. Vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VAP-1) is a surface-expressed endothelial glycoprotein, which belongs to a distinct subgroup of monoamine oxidases. We show here that catalytic activity of VAP-1 on primary endothelial cells directly regulates lymphocyte rolling under defined laminar shear. VAP-1 seems to bind to a primary amino group presented on the lymphocyte surface and oxidatively deaminate it in a reaction, which results in the formation of a transient covalent bond between the two cell types. Instead, soluble reaction products (aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide) are not needed for the VAP-1-dependent rolling. Enzymatic regulation of lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium provides a previously unrecognized rapid way of controlling the extravasation process.","4517":"Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions in multiple lineages. We demonstrate in this report that retroviral expression of activated Notch1 in mouse thymocytes abrogates differentiation of immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes into both CD4 and CD8 mature single-positive T cells. The ability of Notch1 to inhibit T cell development was observed in vitro and in vivo with both normal and TCR transgenic thymocytes. Notch1-mediated developmental arrest was dose dependent and was associated with impaired thymocyte responses to TCR stimulation. Notch1 also inhibited TCR-mediated signaling in Jurkat T cells. These data indicate that constitutively active Notch1 abrogates CD4+ and CD8+ maturation by interfering with TCR signal strength and provide an explanation for the physiological regulation of Notch expression during thymocyte development.","4518":"To characterize the ligand binding properties of a naive T cell repertoire capable of responding to a foreign antigen, we analyzed T cell populations from T cell receptor (TCR) beta transgenic mice using a novel, single cell peptide\/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer dissociation assay. The largely CD4+CD8(-\/low) antigen-specific thymocyte repertoire exhibited a broad, bimodal distribution of tetramer binding half-lives (t(1\/2)s), with a significant underrepresentation in the intermediate half-life range in which the majority of the peripheral repertoire lies. Thus, cells with the potential to bind foreign antigen with the lowest and highest stability are likely to be selectively removed from the repertoire prior to their establishment in the periphery. These studies provide direct evidence that thymic selection biases the naive peripheral T cell repertoire toward TCR-ligand interactions that fall within a moderate half-life \"window.\"","4519":"The K(bm1) and K(bm8) natural mutants of the murine MHC class I molecule H-2K(b) were originally identified by allograft rejection. They also bind viral peptides VSV8 and SEV9 with high affinity, but their peptide complexes have substantially decreased thermostability, and the K(bm1) complexes do not elicit alloreactive T cell responses. Crystal structures of the four mutant complexes at 1.7-1.9 A resolution are similar to the corresponding wild-type K(b) structures, except in the vicinity of the mutated residues, which alter the electrostatic potential, topology, hydrogen bonding, and local water structure of the peptide binding groove. Thus, these natural K(b) mutations define the minimal perturbations in the peptide environment that alter antigen presentation to T cells and abolish alloreactivity.","4520":"Transcription factor NF-kappaB, whose activation depends on the IKKbeta catalytic subunit of the IkappaB kinase, was assigned with both anti- and proapoptotic functions in T lymphocytes. To critically evaluate these functions, we transferred Ikkbeta-\/- or wild-type (wt) fetal liver (FL) stem cells into lethally irradiated mice. Ikkbeta-\/- radiation chimeras show thymic rudiments, aberrant lymphoid organs, and absence of T cells. T lymphopoiesis is rescued when Ikkbeta-\/- stem cells are cotransferred with wt bone marrow, suggesting that IKKbeta may mediate its lymphopoietic function via extrinsic factors. However, almost normal development of Ikkbeta-\/- T cells is observed upon removal of type 1 TNFalpha receptor, indicating that TNFalpha signaling accounts for the absence of Ikkbeta-\/- T cells. Indeed, Ikkbeta-\/- radiation chimeras exibit elevated circulating TNFalpha, and Ikkbeta-\/- thymocytes display increased TNFalpha sensitivity.","4521":"Naive CD4+ T cells activated through TCR\/CD28 under Th1 or Th2 conditions expressed canonical cytokine patterns irrespective of cell division. Only cells that had divided fewer than four times were capable of reexpressing alternative cytokines when restimulated under opposing conditions. Although T cells transcribed both IFN-gamma and IL-4 within hours in a Stat4-\/Stat6-independent manner, neither T-bet nor GATA-3 was induced optimally without Stat signals, and polarized cytokine expression was not sustained. Cytokine genes were positioned apart from heterochromatin in resting T cell nuclei, consistent with rapid expression. After polarization, the majority of silenced cytokine alleles were repositioned to heterochromatin. Naive T cells transit through sequential stages of cytokine activation, commitment, silencing, and physical stabilization during polarization into differentiated effector subsets.","4522":"","4523":"To investigate the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-regulated biological responses, we generated transgenic mice with a targeted mutation of their G-CSF receptor (termed d715F) that abolishes G-CSF-dependent STAT-3 activation and attenuates STAT-5 activation. Homozygous mutant mice are severely neutropenic with an accumulation of immature myeloid precursors in their bone marrow. G-CSF-induced proliferation and granulocytic differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors is severely impaired. Expression of a constitutively active form of STAT-3 in d715F progenitors nearly completely rescued these defects. Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative form of STAT-3 in wild-type progenitors results in impaired G-CSF-induced proliferation and differentiation. These data suggest that STAT-3 activation by the G-CSFR is critical for the transduction of normal proliferative signals and contributes to differentiative signals.","4524":"In T cell-dependent immune responses, high-affinity B cells are selected and differentiate into memory cells; however, the mechanism behind this process remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the selection of high-affinity B cells within germinal centers (GCs) is impaired in Fas-deficient lpr mice in the primary response, probably owing to inefficient negative selection. The memory compartment in control mice is mostly established by precursors generated from the early GCs, whereas the lpr defect expands the memory compartment by the increased recruitment of newly generated precursors from the late GCs, resulting in the accumulation of heavily mutated memory B cells at high frequency. These results suggest that Fas is required for clonal selection within GCs and the establishment of the memory B cell repertoire.","4525":"The CD19\/CD21 complex functions to significantly enhance B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling in response to complement-tagged antigens. Recent studies showed that following antigen binding the BCR translocates into plasma membrane lipid rafts that serve as platforms for BCR signaling. Here, we show that the binding of complement-tagged antigens stimulates the translocation of both the BCR and the CD19\/CD21 complex into lipid rafts, resulting in prolonged residency in and signaling from the rafts, as compared to BCR cross-linking alone. When coligated to the BCR, the CD19\/CD21 complex retards the internalization and degradation of the BCR. The colocalization and stabilization of the BCR and the CD19\/CD21 complex in plasma membrane lipid rafts represents a novel mechanism by which a coreceptor enhances BCR signaling.","4526":"OCA-B is a B lymphocyte-specific transcription coactivator that mediates tissue- and stage-restricted transcription of immunoglobulin genes. Earlier genetic studies revealed that OCA-B is essential for germinal center formation and production of secondary immunoglobulin isotypes. Biochemically purified OCA-B contains p35 and p34 isoforms, and a further analysis has now revealed that p35 is derived from a newly found isoform, p40. More importantly, it has been found that p35 is myristoylated in vivo and that this leads to dramatic changes (including localization to membrane compartments) in its properties. These results suggest that the p35 isoform of OCA-B has functions distinct from those of the nuclear p34 and that it might be a component of a signaling pathway that is required for late-stage B cell development.","4527":"The requirement for CTLA-4 during the induction of peripheral T cell tolerance in vivo was investigated using naive TCR transgenic T cells lacking CTLA-4. CTLA-4(-\/-) T cells are resistant to tolerance induction, as demonstrated by their proliferative responses, IL-2 production, and progression into the cell cycle. Following exposure to a tolerogenic stimulus in vivo and restimulation in vitro, wild-type T cells are blocked at the late G1 to S restriction point of the cell cycle. In contrast, CTLA-4(-\/-) T cells enter into the S phase of the cell cycle, as shown by downregulation of p27(kip1), elevated cdk2 kinase activity, and Rb hyperphosphorylation. Thus, CTLA-4 has an essential role in determining the outcome of T cell encounter with a tolerogenic stimulus.","4528":"While activated T cells are known to have enhanced biological responses to antigen stimulation, the biophysical basis of this increased sensitivity remains unknown. Here, we show that, on activated T cells, the TCR avidity for peptide-MHC complexes is 20- to 50-fold higher than the TCR avidity of naive T cells. This increased avidity for peptide-MHC depends on TCR reorganization and is sensitive to the cholesterol content of the T cell membrane. Analysis of the binding data indicates the enhanced avidity is due to increases in cross-linking of TCR on activated T cells. Activation-induced membrane (AIM) changes in TCR avidity represent a previously unrecognized means of increasing the sensitivity of activated T cells to small amounts of antigen in the periphery.","4529":"The human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein, UL16, binds to two members of a novel family of molecules, the ULBPs, and to the MHC class I homolog, MICB. The ULBPs are GPI-linked glycoproteins belonging to the extended MHC class I family but are only distantly related to MICB. The ULBP and MICB molecules are ligands for the activating receptor, NKG2D\/DAP10, and this interaction is blocked by a soluble form of UL16. The ULBPs stimulate cytokine and chemokine production from NK cells, and expression of ULBPs in NK cell-resistant target cells confers susceptibility to NK cell cytotoxicity. Masking of NK cell recognition of ULBP or MIC antigens by UL16 provides a potential mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus-infected cells might evade attack by the immune system.","4530":"A recombinant antibody-lymphotoxin-alpha fusion protein induced an adaptive immune response protecting mice from melanoma. Importantly, this fusion protein elicited the formation of a lymphoid-like tissue in the tumor microenvironment containing L-selectin+ T cells and MHC class II+ antigen-presenting cells, as well as B and T cell aggregates. Furthermore, PNAd+\/TCA4+ high endothelial venules were observed within the tumor, suggesting entry channels for naive T cell infiltrates. Over the course of therapy, a marked clonal expansion of certain TCR specificities occurred among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that displayed reactivity against melanoma cells and the TRP-2(180-188) peptide. Consequently, naive T cells may have been recruited to as well as primed and expanded in the lymphoid-like tissue induced by the lymphotoxin-alpha fusion protein at the tumor site.","4531":"","4532":"MHC class II molecules possess two binding sites for bacterial superantigens (SAGs): a low-affinity site on the alpha chain and a high-affinity, zinc-dependent site on the beta chain. Only the former has been defined crystallographically. We report the structure of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPE-C) complexed with HLA-DR2a (DRA*0101, DRB5*0101) bearing a self-peptide from myelin basic protein (MBP). SPE-C binds the beta chain through a zinc bridge that links the SAG and class II molecules. Surprisingly, SPE-C also makes extensive contacts with the MBP peptide, such that peptide accounts for one third of the surface area of the MHC molecule buried in the complex, similar to TCR-peptide\/MHC complexes. Thus, SPE-C may optimize T cell responses by mimicking the peptide dependence of conventional antigen presentation and recognition.","4533":"The rat MHC class Ia molecule RT1-Aa has the unusual capacity to bind long peptides ending in arginine, such as MTF-E, a thirteen-residue, maternally transmitted minor histocompatibility antigen. The antigenic structure of MTF-E was unpredictable due to its extraordinary length and two arginines that could serve as potential anchor residues. The crystal structure of RT1-Aa-MTF-E at 2.55 A shows that both peptide termini are anchored, as in other class I molecules, but the central residues in two independent pMHC complexes adopt completely different bulged conformations based on local environment. The MTF-E epitope is fully exposed within the putative T cell receptor (TCR) footprint. The flexibility demonstrated by the MTF-E structures illustrates how different TCRs may be raised against chemically identical, but structurally dissimilar, pMHC complexes.","4534":"Measles virus (MV) causes profound immunosuppression, resulting in high infant mortality. The mechanisms are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of a suitable animal model. Here, we report that particular MV proteins, in the absence of MV replication, could generate a systemic immunosuppression in mice through two pathways: (1) via MV-nucleoprotein and its receptor FcgammaR on dendritic cells; and (2) via virus envelope glycoproteins and the MV-hemagglutinin cellular receptor, CD46. The effects comprise reduced hypersensitivity responses associated with impaired function of dendritic cells, decreased production of IL-12, and the loss of antigen-specific T cell proliferation. These results introduce a novel model for testing the immunosuppressive potential of anti-measles vaccines and reveal a specific mechanism of MV-induced modulation of inflammatory reactions.","4535":"The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) functions to initiate signaling and to internalize antigen for processing from within Lyn kinase-enriched membrane lipid rafts. The signaling function of the BCR is blocked by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), which is constitutively phosphorylated by Lyn. Here, we show that LMP2A resides in lipid rafts and excludes the BCR from entering rafts by Lyndependent mechanisms, thus blocking both BCR signaling and antigen transport. Mutant LMP2A that permits BCR signaling and raft translocation still blocks antigen trafficking, indicating independent control of these BCR functions. Thus, EBV coopts the lipid rafts to disarm both the signaling and antigen-processing functions of the BCR by independent mechanisms.","4536":"Germline inactivation of c-myc in mice causes embryonic lethality. Therefore, we developed a LoxP\/Cre-based conditional mutation approach to test the role of c-myc in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and mature B lymphocytes. Cre expression resulted in reduced proliferation of wild-type MEFs, but c-Myc-deficient MEFs showed a further reduction. In contrast to fibroblasts, Cre expression had no apparent affect on wild-type B cell proliferation. Deletion of both c-Myc genes in B cells led to severely impaired proliferation in response to anti-CD40 plus IL-4. However, treated cells did upregulate several early activation markers but not CD95 or CD95 ligand. We discuss these findings with respect to potential c-Myc functions in proliferation and apoptosis and also discuss potential limitations in the Cre-mediated gene inactivation approach.","4537":"Available evidence indicates that B cell tolerance is attained by receptor editing, anergy, or clonal deletion. Here, we describe a p-azophenylarsonate (Ars)-specific immunoglobulin transgenic mouse in which B cells become anergic as a consequence of cross-reaction with autoantigen in the bone marrow. Developing bone marrow B cells show no evidence of receptor editing but transiently upregulate activation markers and appear to undergo accelerated development. Mature B cells are present in normal numbers but are refractory to BCR-mediated induction of calcium mobilization, tyrosine phosphorylation, and antibody responses. Activation marker expression and acquisition of the anergic phenotype is prevented in bone marrow cultures by monovalent hapten. In this model, it appears that induction of anergy in B cells can be prevented by monovalent hapten competing with autoantigen for the binding site.","4538":"By combining a TCRbeta transgene with a TCRalpha minilocus comprised of a single V and two J gene segments, we engineered a mouse line exhibiting ample but focused TCR diversity, restricted to CDR3alpha. Using single-cell PCR and high-throughput sequencing, we have exploited this system to scrutinize T cell repertoire selection and evolution. Some striking observations emerged: (1) thymic selection produces a repertoire that is very \"bumpy,\" with marked overrepresentation of a subset of sequences; (2) MHC class I- and class II-restricted TCRs can be distinguished by minute, single-residue changes in CDR3alpha; and (3) homeostatic expansion and survival in the periphery can markedly remold the postselection repertoire, likely reflecting variability in the potential of cells displaying different TCRs to respond to homeostatic cues.","4539":"NFAT transcription factors play critical roles in gene transcription during immune responses. To investigate further the two most prominent NFAT family members, NFATc1 and NFATc2, we generated mice bearing lymphoid systems devoid of both. Doubly deficient T cells displayed cell surface markers of activation yet were significantly deficient in the development of multiple effector functions, including Th cytokine production, surface effector molecule expression, and cytolytic activity. Nevertheless, doubly deficient B cells were hyperactivated, as evidenced by extremely elevated serum IgG1 and IgE, as well as plasma cell expansion and infiltration of end organs. Thus, in T cells, NFATc1 and NFATc2 are dispensable for inflammatory reactivity but are required for effector differentiation, while in B cells, NFATs regulate both normal homeostasis and differentiation.","4540":"CD4 cells from mice heterozygous for an IL-4 and a GFP\/IL-4 gene frequently express a single allele. Analysis of IL-4 or GFP production by cells from recently primed Th2 cells indicates that essentially all are competent to transcribe either allele but have a low probability of doing so. By contrast, long-term Th2 clones show distinct and heritable ratios in the proportion of cells that express IL-4 or GFP. We conclude that in the course of Th2 priming an early efficient event renders both alleles capable of being inefficiently transcribed; a second, less frequent event occurs that renders one allele more competent, accounting for the differential expression of IL-4 and GFP in different clones.","4541":"","4542":"","4543":"It has been assumed that upon dissociation from TAP, MHC class I molecules exit the ER by nonselective bulk flow. We now show that exit must occur by association with cargo receptors. Inconsistent with exit by bulk flow, loading of MHC class I molecules with high-affinity peptides triggers dissociation from TAP but has no effect on rates of ER-to-Golgi transport. Moreover, peptide-loaded MHC class I molecules accumulate at ER exit sites from which TAP molecules are excluded. Consistent with receptor-mediated exit, ER-to-Golgi transport of MHC class I molecules is independent of their cytoplasmic tails, which themselves lack ER export motifs. In addition, we show that MHC class I molecules associate with the putative cargo receptor BAP31.","4544":"How negative selection shapes a polyclonal population of self-reactive T cells has been difficult to address directly because of the lack of means to isolate T cells reactive to a particular self-peptide. Here, using mice transgenic for the TCR-beta chain of a CTL clone directed against a male-specific peptide, we compared the preimmune repertoire reactive to this peptide in male and female animals. Surprisingly, in the presence of the deleting ligand, as many as 25%-40% of reactive T cells escaped clonal deletion. A correlation was found between T cell avidity, TCRalpha structures, and susceptibility to negative selection. These results suggest that numerous low-affinity self-specific T cells persist in the periphery and show that a deleting ligand can specifically narrow the structural diversity of the TCR repertoire.","4545":"Tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins permits the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-associated protein tyrosine kinases to regulate downstream effector molecules. Here, we report the identification of a novel B cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), termed BCAP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP is mediated by Syk and Btk, thereby providing binding site(s) for the p85 subunit of PI3K. Disruption of the BCAP gene in the DT40 B cell line inhibits BCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generation, leading to impaired Akt response. Moreover, recruitment of PI3K to glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) is significantly attenuated in the absence of BCAP. Hence, these data suggest that BCAP bridges BCR-associated kinases to the PI3K pathway by regulating PI3K localization.","4546":"Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine produced by immune and nonimmune cells and exhibits functional pleiotropy and redundancy. IL-6 plays an important role in the differentiation of several cell types. Here, we describe a novel function of IL-6: the negative regulation of CD4+ Th1 cell differentiation. While IL-6-directed CD4+ Th2 differentiation is mediated by IL-4, inhibition of Th1 differentiation by IL-6 is independent of IL-4. IL-6 upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) expression in activated CD4+ T cells, thereby interfering with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation induced by interferon gamma (IFNgamma). Inhibition of IFNgamma receptor-mediated signals by IL-6 prevents autoregulation of IFNgamma gene expression by IFNgamma during CD4+ T cell activation, thereby preventing Th1 differentiation. Thus, IL-6 promotes CD4+ Th2 differentiation and inhibits Th1 differentiation by two independent molecular mechanisms.","4547":"Type I IFNs induce gene expression through Stat1 and Stat2, which can in turn associate either to form Stat1 homodimers or the transcription factor ISGF-3. Stat1 homodimers also transduce signals for IFN-gamma. To explore the unique properties of Stat2 and ISGF-3 in type I IFN signaling, its gene was targeted for deletion. Stat2 null mice exhibit a number of defects in immune response. This includes an increased susceptibility to viral infection and the loss of a type I IFN autocrine\/ paracrine loop, which in turn regulates several aspects of immune response. Intriguingly, Stat2-deficient fibroblasts exhibit a more significant defect in their response to type I IFNs than macrophages, highlighting tissue-specific differences in the response to this family of ligands.","4548":"In vivo antigenic competition of naive CD4+ TCR transgenic T cells was visualized by tracking cell division. Competition reduced both recruitment into cell division and burst size per recruited precursor cell, minimizing the effect of differences in precursorfrequency while maintaining the dose-response relationship with antigen. Competition was restricted to T cells of the same specificity, indicating that cells were competing for access to Ag-MHC complexes rather than for Ag nonspecific factors. Moreover, the qualitative distinction between the responses to i.v. peptide and s.c. peptide\/CFA was unaffected by precursor frequency. These data explain the paradoxical ability of the immune system to tailor responses to the type and dose of Ag even in individuals with large differences in initial precursor frequency.","4549":"Using multimers of MHC class II molecules linked to a peptide derived from the Leishmania LACK antigen, we have compared the fate of parasite-specific CD4+ T cells in resistant and susceptible mice transgenic for the beta chain of a LACK-specific TCR. Activated T cells were readily detected in the draining lymph nodes of infected animals. Although the kinetics of activation and expansion were similar in both strains, T cells from susceptible and resistant mice expressed low- and high-affinity TCR, respectively. As T cells from resistant mice produced more IFN-gamma and less IL-4 than those from susceptible animals, our results suggest that differences in TCR usage between MHC-matched animals may influence the development of the antiparasite immune response.","4550":"Chemokines trigger rapid integrin-dependent lymphocyte arrest to vascular endothelium. We show that the chemokines SLC, ELC, and SDF-1alpha rapidly induce lateral mobility and transient increase of affinity of the beta2 integrin LFA-1. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) activity blocks mobility but not affinity changes and prevents lymphocyte adhesion to ICAM-1 immobilized at low but not high densities, suggesting that mobility enhances the frequency of encounters between high-affinity integrin and ligand but that at higher ligand density affinity changes are sufficient for arrest. Thus, chemokines trigger, through distinct signaling pathways, both a high-affinity state and lateral mobility of LFA-1 that can coordinately determine the vascular arrest of circulating lymphocytes under physiologic conditions.","4551":"Central to immune and inflammatory responses are the integrin-mediated adhesive interactions of cells with their extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich environment. Using a comprehensive and quantitative mRNA profiling technique, we analyzed the effect of ECM-induced attachment on monocyte gene expression, its regulation by growth factors, and the integrin specificity of this event. Adhesion of cells to fibronectin resulted in increased expression of a large number of genes, which was strongly potentiated by the presence of growth factors. Adhesion activated both the NF-kappaB and Jak\/STAT pathways of gene transcription and increased expression of genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, revealing the importance of ECM-integrin interactions in these processes.","4552":"The low affinity receptor for IgG, FcgammaRIIB, functions to dampen the antibody response and reduce the risk of autoimmunity. This function is reportedly mediated in part by inhibition of B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated p21ras activation, though the basis of this inhibition is unknown. We show here that FcgammaRIIB-BCR coaggregation leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the RasGAP-binding protein p62dok, with a concomitant increase in its binding to RasGAP. These effects require the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase SHIP, which further recruits p62dok via the latter's phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Using chimeric FcgammaRIIB containing the RasGAP-binding domain of p62dok, we demonstrate that p62dok contains all structural information required to mediate the inhibitory effect of FcgammaRIIB on Erk activation.","4553":"Most lineage marker-negative (Lin-)TdT+ cells from murine marrow lack CD34 but display c-kit at low density as well as IL-7Ralpha and Flk-2\/Flt-3 receptors. Single cells with these characteristics generated CD45RA+CD19- as well as CD19+ lymphocytes in culture. CD45RA+CD19- marrow cells were resolved into three nonoverlapping subsets. One subset, lacking DX5 and Ly-6C antigens, yielded CD19+ cells in culture. Further analysis demonstrated CD24 on most Lin-TdT+ cells and all CD45R+CD19-DX5-Ly-6C- cells. Mac-1\/CD11b was absent from these two subsets of B lineage precursors, while IL-7Ralpha was retained during subsequent differentiation to a CD19+ and stromal cell-independent stage. These findings contrast with previous descriptions of B lymphocyte precursors and suggest a sequence of early differentiation events.","4554":"GATA-3 is a T cell-specific transcription factor and is essential for the development of the T cell lineage. Recently, it was shown that the expression of GATA-3 is further induced in CD4+ helper T cells upon differentiation into type 2 but not type 1 effector cells. Here, we report the molecular cloning of a GATA-3 interacting protein, repressor of GATA (ROG). ROG is a lymphoid-specific gene and is rapidly induced in Th cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3. In in vitro assays, ROG represses the GATA-3-induced transactivation. Furthermore, overexpression of ROG in Th clones inhibits the production of Th cytokines. Taken together, our results suggest that ROG might play a critical role in regulating the differentiation and activation of Th cells.","4555":"Thymocytes carrying MHC class I-restricted TCRs differentiate into CD8 T cells, while those recognizing MHC class II become CD4 T cells. The mechanisms underlying how MHC class recognition, coreceptor expression, and effector function are coordinated are not well understood. Since the tyrosine kinase Lck binds with more affinity to CD4 than CD8, it has been proposed as a candidate to mediate this process. By using transgenic mice with altered Lck activity, we show that thymocytes carrying a class II-restricted TCR develop into functional CD8 T cells when Lck activity is reduced. Conversely, thymocytes carrying a class I-restricted TCR develop into functional CD4 T cells when Lck activity is increased. These results directly show that quantitative differences in the Lck signal control the CD4\/CD8 lineage decision.","4556":"The adapter protein RIP plays a crucial role in NF-kappaB activation by TNF. Here we show that triggering of the p55 TNF receptor induces binding of RIP to NEMO (IKKgamma), a component of the I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) \"signalosome\" complex, as well as recruitment of RIP to the receptor together with the three major signalosome components, NEMO, IKK1 and IKK2, and some kind of covalent modification of the recruited RIP molecules. It also induces binding of NEMO to the signaling inhibitor A20, and recruitment of A20 to the receptor. Enforced expression of NEMO in cells revealed that NEMO can both promote and block NF-kappaB activation and dramatically augments the phosphorylation of c-Jun. The findings suggest that the signaling activities of the IKK signalosome are regulated through binding of NEMO to RIP and A20 within the p55 TNF receptor complex.","4557":"The critical function of NFAT proteins in maintaining lymphoid homeostasis was revealed in mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 (DKO). DKO mice exhibit increased lymphoproliferation, decreased activation-induced cell death, and impaired induction of FasL. The transcription factors Egr2 and Egr3 are potent activators of FasL expression. Here we find that Egr2 and Egr3 are NFAT target genes. Activation of FasL occurs via the NFAT-dependent induction of Egr3, as demonstrated by the ability of exogenously provided NFATp to restore Egr-dependent FasL promoter activity in DKO lymph node cells. Further, Egr3 expression is enriched in Th1 cells, suggesting a molecular basis for the known preferential expression of FasL in the Th1 versus Th2 subset.","4558":"Phagocytosis of pathogens by macrophages initiates the innate immune response, which in turn orchestrates the adaptive immune response. Amphiphysin II participates in receptor-mediated endocytosis, in part, by recruiting the GTPase dynamin to the nascent endosome. We demonstrate here that a novel isoform of amphiphysin II associates with early phagosomes in macrophages. We have ablated the dynamin-binding site of this protein and shown that this mutant form of amphiphysin II inhibits phagocytosis at the stage of membrane extension around the bound particles. We define a signaling cascade in which PI3K is required to recruit amphiphysin II to the phagosome, and amphiphysin II in turn recruits dynamin. Thus, amphiphysin II facilitates a critical initial step in host response to infection.","4559":"T lymphocyte activation evokes distinct changes in cell surface O-glycans. CD8+ T cells undergo an elimination of sialic acid on core 1 O-glycans and an induction of core 2 O-glycans until either apoptotic death or differentiation into memory cells. We find that the ST3Gal-I sialyltransferase is required for core 1 O-glycan sialylation and its deficiency induces core 2 O-glycan biosynthesis. Apoptosis ensues with the loss of peripheral CD8+ T cells in the absence of immune stimulation. Cell surface ligation of the ST3Gal-I substrate CD43 recapitulates this phenotype by a caspase 3-independent mechanism. Control of core 1 O-glycan sialylation in T lymphocytes by ST3Gal-I comprises a homeostatic mechanism that eliminates CD8+ T cells by apoptosis while facilitating the production of viable CD8+ memory T cells.","4560":"A 65 kDa mycobacterial heat shock protein (hsp65), fused to a polypeptide that contains an octapeptide (SIYRYYGL) agonist for a particular T cell receptor (2C TCR), stimulated C57BL\/6 mice as well as CD4-deficient mice to produce CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) to the fusion partner's octapeptide. This and other hsp65 fusion proteins but not native hsp65 itself stimulated dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo to upregulate the levels of MHC (class I and II) and costimulatory (B7.2) molecules. The results suggest a mechanism for the general finding that hsp fusion proteins, having fusion partners of widely differing lengths and sequences, elicit CD8 CTL to peptides from the fusion partners without requiring exogenous adjuvants or the participation of CD4+ T cells.","4561":"A longstanding question in T cell receptor signaling is how structurally similar ligands, with similar affinities, can have substantially different biological activity. The crystal structure of the 2C TCR complex of H-2Kb with superagonist peptide SIYR at 2.8 A elucidates a structural basis for TCR discrimination of altered peptide ligands. The difference in antigen potency is modulated by two cavities in the TCR combining site, formed mainly by CDRs 3alpha, 3beta, and 1beta, that complement centrally located peptide residues. This \"functional hot spot\" allows the TCR to finely discriminate amongst energetically similar interactions within different ligands for those in which the peptide appropriately stabilizes the TCR\/pMHC complex and provides a new structural perspective for understanding differential signaling resulting from T cell cross-reactivity.","4562":"A series of novel chemically defined soluble oligomers of the human MHC class II protein HLA-DR1 was constructed to probe the molecular requirements for initiation of T cell activation. MHC dimers, trimers, and tetramers stimulated T cells, as measured by upregulation of the activation markers CD69 and CD25, and by internalization of activated T cell receptor subunits. Monomeric MHC-peptide complexes engaged T cell receptors but did not induce activation. For a given amount of receptor engagement, the extent of activation was equivalent for each of the oligomers and correlated with the number of T cell receptor cross-links induced. These results suggest that formation or rearrangement of a T cell receptor dimer is necessary and sufficient for initiation of T cell signaling.","4563":"Antigen-presenting cells (APC) degrade proteins intracellularly to generate peptides, which are then bound by products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and exposed on the surface of the APC for recognition by T cells. The supply of antigenic peptides and their association with MHC molecules requires the concerted action of a cohort of accessory molecules that includes chaperones, transporters of peptides, and the proteases that degrade the antigens.","4564":"The production of antimicrobial peptides is an important aspect of host defense in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, seven antimicrobial peptides with different spectra of activities are synthesized by the fat body during the immune response and secreted into the hemolymph. Using GFP reporter transgenes, we show here that all seven Drosophila antimicrobial peptides can be induced in surface epithelia in a tissue-specific manner. The imd gene plays a critical role in the activation of this local response to infection. In particular, drosomycin expression, which is regulated by the Toll pathway during the systemic response, is regulated by imd in the respiratory tract, thus demonstrating the existence of distinct regulatory mechanisms for local and systemic induction of antimicrobial peptide genes in Drosophila.","4565":"LIR-1 is an inhibitory receptor that recognizes class I MHC molecules and the human cytomegalovirus class I homolog UL18. Here, we report the 2.1 A resolution crystal structure of the ligand binding portion of LIR-1 (domains 1 and 2 [D1D2]) and localize the binding region for UL18. LIR-1 D1D2 is composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains arranged at an acute angle to form a bent structure resembling the structures of natural killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs). The LIR-1 binding site comprises a portion of D1 distant from the interdomain hinge region that constitutes the KIR binding site, consistent with differences in LIR-1 and KIR recognition properties and functions.","4566":"A novel sequence discovered in a computational screen appears distantly related to the p35 subunit of IL-12. This factor, which we term p19, shows no biological activity by itself; instead, it combines with the p40 subunit of IL-12 to form a novel, biologically active, composite cytokine, which we term IL-23. Activated dendritic cells secrete detectable levels of this complex. IL-23 binds to IL-12R beta 1 but fails to engage IL-12R beta 2; nonetheless, IL-23 activates Stat4 in PHA blast T cells. IL-23 induces strong proliferation of mouse memory (CD4(+)CD45Rb(low)) T cells, a unique activity of IL-23 as IL-12 has no effect on this cell population. Similar to IL-12, human IL-23 stimulates IFN-gamma production and proliferation in PHA blast T cells, as well as in CD45RO (memory) T cells.","4567":"The role of the germline transcriptional promoter, PD beta 1, in V(D)J recombination at the T cell receptor beta locus was investigated. Deletion of PD beta 1 caused reduced germline transcription and DNA hypermethylation in the Dbeta1-J beta 1 region and decreased D beta 1 rearrangement. Analyses of methylation levels surrounding recombination signal sequences (RSS) before, during, and after recombination revealed that under physiological conditions cleavage of hypomethylated alleles was preferred over hypermethylated alleles. Methylation of a specific CpG site within the heptamer of the 3' D beta 1 RSS was incompatible with cleavage by the V(D)J recombinase. These findings suggest that methylation can regulate V(D)J recombination both at a general level by influencing regional chromatin accessibility and specifically by blocking RSS recognition or cleavage by the V(D)J recombinase.","4568":"Athymic cytokine receptor gamma chain mutant mice that lack the thymus, Peyer's patches, cryptopatches (CP), and intestinal T cells were reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow cells. Bone marrow-derived TCR(-) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) first appeared within villous epithelia of small intestine overlying the regenerated CP, and these TCR(-) IEL subsequently emerged throughout the epithelia. Thereafter, TCR(+) IEL increased to a comparable number to that in athymic mice and consisted of TCRgammadelta and TCRalphabeta IEL. In gut-associated lymphoid tissues of wild-type mice, only CP harbored a large population of c-kit(high)IL-7R(+)CD44(+)Thy-1(+\/-)CD4(+\/-)CD25(low\/-)alpha(E) beta(7)(-)Lin(-) (Lin, lineage markers) lymphocytes that included cells expressing germline but not rearranged TCRgamma and TCRbeta gene transcripts. These findings provide direct evidence that gut CP develop progenitor T cells for extrathymic IEL descendants.","4569":"Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B and pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) expression is tightly correlated during thymocyte development. Inhibition of NF-kappa B in isolated thymocytes in vitro results in spontaneous apoptosis of cells expressing the pre-TCR, whereas inhibition of NF-kappa B in transgenic mice through expression of a mutated, superrepressor form of I kappa B alpha leads to a loss of beta-selected thymocytes. In contrast, the forced activation of NF-kappa B through expression of a dominant-active I kappa B kinase allows differentiation to proceed to the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage in a Rag1(-\/-) mouse that cannot assemble the pre-TCR. Therefore, signals emanating from the pre-TCR are mediated at least in part by NF-kappa B, which provides a selective survival signal for developing thymocytes with productive beta chain rearrangements.","4570":"TCR downmodulation following ligation by MHC:peptide complexes is considered to be a pivotal event in T cell activation. Here, we analyzed the dynamics of TCR:CD3 cell surface expression on resting and antigen-activated T cells. We show that the TCR:CD3 complex is very stable and is rapidly internalized and recycled in resting T cells. Surprisingly, the internalization rate is not increased following TCR ligation by MHC:peptide complexes, despite significant TCR downmodulation, suggesting that constitutive internalization rather than ligation-induced downmodulation serves as the force that drives serial ligation. Furthermore, TCR downmodulation is mediated by the intracellular retention of ligated complexes and degradation by lysosomes and proteasomes. Thus, our data demonstrate that ligation induces TCR downmodulation by preventing recycling rather than inducing internalization.","4571":"Infection and gene expression by the human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in vivo have been thought to be confined to CD4(+) T lymphocytes. We show here that, in natural HTLV-I infection, a significant proportion of CD8(+) T lymphocytes are infected by HTLV-I. Interestingly, HTLV-I-specific but not Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes were shown to be infected. Furthermore, HTLV-I protein expression in naturally infected CD8(+) T lymphocytes renders them susceptible to fratricide mediated by autologous HTLV-I-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Fratricide among virus-specific CTLs could impair the immune control of HTLV-I and possibly other lymphotropic viruses.","4572":"The balanced action of cytokines is known to be critical for the maintenance of homeostatic immune responses. Here, we report the development of an inflammatory skin disease involving CD8(+) T cells, in mice lacking the transcription factor, interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2). CD8(+) T cells exhibit in vitro hyper-responsiveness to antigen stimulation, accompanied with a notable upregulation of the expression of genes induced by interferon-alpha\/beta (IFN-alpha\/beta). Furthermore, both disease development and CD8(+) T cell abnormality are suppressed by the introduction of nullizygosity to the genes that positively regulate the IFN-alpha\/beta signaling pathway. IRF-2 may represent a unique negative regulator, attenuating IFN-alpha\/beta-induced gene transcription, which is necessary for balancing the beneficial and harmful effects of IFN-alpha\/beta signaling in the immune system.","4573":"The class IV semaphorin CD100\/Sema4D differentially utilizes two distinct receptors: plexin-B1 in nonlymphoid tissues, such as brain and kidney, and CD72 in lymphoid tissues. We have generated CD100-deficient mice and demonstrated that they have functional defects in their immune system, without apparent abnormalities in other tissues. The number of CD5(+) B-1 cells was considerably decreased in the mutant mice, whereas conventional B cells and T cells appeared to develop normally. In vitro proliferative responses and immunoglobulin production were reduced in CD100-deficient B cells. The humoral immune response against a T cell-dependent antigen and in vivo priming of T cells were also defective in the mutant mice. These results demonstrate nonredundant and essential roles of CD100-CD72 interactions in the immune system.","4574":"We have identified the lymphocyte semaphorin CD100\/Sema4D as a CD40-inducible molecule by subtractive cDNA cloning. CD100 stimulation significantly enhanced the effects of CD40 on B cell responses. Administration of soluble CD100 markedly accelerated in vivo antigen-specific antibody responses. CD100 receptors with different binding affinities were detected on renal tubular cells (K(d) = approximately 1 x 10(-9)M) and lymphocytes (K(d) = approximately 3 x 10(-7)M). Expression cloning revealed that the CD100 receptor on lymphocytes is CD72, a negative regulator of B cell responsiveness. CD72 thus represents a novel class of semaphorin receptors. CD100 stimulation induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of CD72 and dissociation of SHP-1 from CD72. Our findings indicate that CD100 plays a critical role in immune responses by the novel mechanism of turning off negative signaling by CD72.","4575":"Although affinity maturation constitutes an integral part of T-dependent humoral responses, its structural basis is less well understood. We compared the physicochemical properties of antigen binding of several independent antibody panels derived from both germline and secondary responses. We found that antibody maturation essentially reflects modulations in entropy-control of the association, but not dissociation, step of the binding. This influence stems from variations in conformational heterogeneity of the antigen-combining site, which in turn regulates both the affinity and specificity for antigen. Thus, the simple device of manipulating conformational flexibility of paratope provides a mechanism wherein the transition from a degenerate recognition capability to a high-fidelity effector response is readily achieved, with the minimum of somatic mutations.","4576":"Lnk is an SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein expressed preferentially in lymphocytes. To illuminate the importance of Lnk, we generated lnk(-\/-) mice. Whereas T cell development was unaffected, pre-B and immature B cells accumulated in the spleens. In the bone marrow, B-lineage cells were proportionately increased, reflecting enhanced production of pro-B cells that resulted in part from hypersensitivity of precursors to SCF, the ligand for c-kit. Hence, Lnk ordinarily acts to regulate B cell production. Further characterization of lnk(-\/-) mice also revealed that full-length Lnk is a 68 kDa protein containing a conserved proline-rich region and a PH domain. Lnk is a representative of a multigene adaptor protein family whose members act, by analogy with Lnk, to modulate intracellular signaling.","4577":"How rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are further diversified by somatic hypermutation is unknown. Using VDJ passenger Ig heavy chain (IgH) knockin mouse strains, we now demonstrate a high frequency of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the targeted VDJ passenger gene of germinal center (GC) B cells. These DSBs parallel the distribution of mutations in the targeted hypermutation domain and are found preferentially at RGYW motifs, the intrinsic hot spots of somatic hypermutation. The introduction of DSBs appears to depend on transcriptional activity. Thus, secondary diversification of rearranged V gene segments relates to an error-prone nonhomologous DSB repair system acting in B cells of the GC.","4578":"","4579":"Interleukin-9 is a cytokine produced by Th2 cells and is a candidate gene for asthma and atopy. We have generated IL-9-deficient mice to delineate the specific roles of IL-9 in Th2 responses. Using a pulmonary granuloma model, we have demonstrated a distinct requirement for IL-9 in the rapid and robust generation of pulmonary goblet cell hyperplasia and mastocytosis in response to lung challenge. In contrast, eosinophilia and granuloma formation were not affected. IL-9 was not required for T cell development or differentiation, the generation of naive or antigen-driven antibody responses, or the expulsion of the intestinal parasitic nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Thus, deletion of IL-9 manifests as a highly defined phenotype in Th2 responses modulating mucus production and mast cell proliferation.","4580":"Janus kinases (Jaks) play an important role in signal transduction via cytokine receptors. Tyk2 is a Janus kinase, and we developed tyk2-deficient mice to study the requirement for tyk2 in vivo. Tyk2-deficient mice show no overt developmental abnormalities; however, they display a lack of responsiveness to a small amount of IFNalpha, although a high concentration of IFNalpha can fully transduce its signal even in the absence of tyk2. Furthermore, IL-12-induced T cell function is defective in these mice. In contrast, these mice respond normally to IL-6 and IL-10, both of which activate tyk2 in vitro. These observations demonstrate that tyk2 plays only a restricted role in mediating IFNalpha-dependent signaling while being required in mediating IL-12-dependent biological responses.","4581":"To assess the role of the Janus kinase (Jak) family member Tyk2, we have generated Tyk2-\/- mice. In contrast to other Jaks, where inactivation leads to a complete loss of the respective cytokine receptor signal, Tyk2-\/- mice display reduced responses to IFNalpha\/beta and IL-12 and a selective deficiency in Stat3 activation in these pathways. Unexpectedly, IFNgamma signaling is also impaired in Tyk2-\/- mice. Tyk2-\/- macrophages fail to produce nitric oxide upon lipopolysaccharide induction. Tyk2-\/- mice are unable to clear vaccinia virus and show a reduced T cell response after LCMV challenge. These data imply a selective contribution of Tyk2 to the signals triggered by various biological stimuli and cytokine receptors.","4582":"Induction of the interferon (IFN)-alpha\/beta gene transcription in virus-infected cells is an event central to innate immunity. Mice lacking the transcription factor IRF-3 are more vulnerable to virus infection. In embryonic fibroblasts, virus-induced IFN-alpha\/beta gene expression levels are reduced and the spectrum of the IFN-alpha mRNA subspecies altered. Furthermore, cells additionally defective in IRF-7 expression totally fail to induce these genes in response to infections by any of the virus types tested. In these cells, a normal profile of IFN-alpha\/beta mRNA induction can be achieved by coexpressing both IRF-3 and IRF-7. These results demonstrate the essential and distinct roles of thetwo factors, which together ensure the transcriptional efficiency and diversity of IFN-alpha\/beta genes for the antiviral response.","4583":"T cell responsiveness to an epitope is affected both by its affinity for the presenting MHC molecule and the affinity of the MHC-peptide complex for TCR. One limitation of cancer immunotherapy is that natural tumor antigens elicit relatively weak T cell responses, in part because high-affinity T cells are rendered tolerant to these antigens. We report here that amino acid substitutions in a natural MHC class I-restricted tumor antigen that increase the stability of the MHC-peptide-TCR complex are significantly more potent as tumor vaccines. The improved immunity results from enhanced in vivo expansion of T cells specific for the natural tumor epitope. These results indicate peptides that stabilize the MHC-peptide-TCR complex may provide superior antitumor immunity through enhanced stimulation of specific T cells.","4584":"HLA-DM removes CLIP and other loosely bound peptides from MHC class II molecules. The crystal structures of class II molecules and of HLA-DM have not permitted identification of their interaction sites. Here, we describe mutations in class II that impair interactions with DM. Libraries of randomly mutagenized DR3 alpha and beta chains were screened for their ability to cause cell surface accumulation of CLIP\/DR3 complexes in EBV-B cells. Seven mutations were associated with impaired peptide loading in vivo, as detected by SDS stability assays. In vitro, these mutant DR3 molecules were resistant to DM-catalyzed CLIP release and showed reduced binding to DM. All mutations localize to a single lateral face of HLA-DR, which we propose interacts with DM during peptide exchange.","4585":"Several bone marrow cells and lymphocyte subpopulations, known as \"veto cells,\" were shown to induce transplantation tolerance across major histocompatibility antigens. Recently, it has been suggested that anti-third party CTLs depleted of alloreactivity are endowed with marked veto activity and therefore might potentially facilitate bone marrow allografting without graft versus host disease (GVHD). The veto mechanism is still obscure. While early studies emphasized the role of CD8-mediated apoptosis, more recent evidence indicates a role for Fas-FasL. In the present study we show, by using blocking anti-CD8 antibody, by generating CTLs from FasL or perforin mutated mice, and by gene transfer of FasL, that the veto activity of anti-third party CD8+ CTLs is dependent upon the simultaneous expression of both CD8 and FasL.","4586":"Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells in vivo demonstrate three distinct patterns of latent gene expression, depending on the differentiation stage of the cell. Tonsillar naive B cells express the EBNA2-dependent lymphoblastoid phenotype, characteristic of direct infection. Germinal center centroblasts and centrocytes as well as tonsillar memory B cells express a more restricted pattern of latent genes (EBNA1(Q-K)+, LMP1+, LMP2+, EBNA2-) that has only been seen previously in EBV-positive tumors. Peripheral memory cells express an even more restricted pattern where no latent genes are expressed, with the possible exception of LMP2. These results are consistent with a model where EBV uses the normal biology of B lymphocytes to gain access to and persist within the long-lived memory B cell compartment.","4587":"Infection of humans with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may cause infectious mononucleosis (IM). Analysis of single EBV-infected cells from tonsils of IM patients for rearranged immunoglobulin genes revealed two strategies of EBV for rapid and massive spread in the B cell compartment: the direct infection of many naive as well as memory and\/or germinal center B cells and the expansion of the latter cells to large clones. In IM, the generation of virus-harboring memory B cells from naive B cells passing through a germinal center reaction likely plays no role. Members of clones can show distinct morphologies and likely also EBV gene expression patterns, and this ability implies a mechanism by which EBV-harboring cells can evade immune surveillance and establish a pool of persisting EBV-infected B cells.","4588":"The structure of the A6 alphabetaTCR\/HTLV-1 Tax-peptide\/MHC I complex with proline 6 of Tax substituted with alanine (P6A), an antagonist, is nearly identical to the structure with wild-type Tax agonist. Neither the proline in the agonist nor the alanine in the antagonist is contacted by the alphabetaTCR. Here, we demonstrate that antagonist activity of P6A is associated with low affinity of the A6 alphabetaTCR for Tax-P6A\/HLA-A2. We show that stepwise repair of a packing defect in the TCR\/MHC interface using N-alkylated amino acids results in stepwise increases in TCR affinity and activity. Kinetic and thermodynamic measurements suggest that for some ligands the range of T cell outcomes does not correlate with either their alphabetaTCR affinity or the half-life of the alphabetaTCR\/peptide\/MHC complex.","4589":"Stimulation of T cells via the antigen and costimulatory receptors leads to the organization of a supramolecular activation cluster called the immune synapse. We report that loss of the molecular adaptor Cbl-b in T cells frees antigen receptor-triggered receptor clustering, lipid raft aggregation, and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation from the requirement for CD28 costimulation. Introduction of the cbl-b mutation into a vav1-\/- background relieved the functional defects of vav1-\/- T cells and caused spontaneous autoimmunity. Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) was found to be essential for deregulated proliferation and membrane receptor reorganization of cbl-b mutant T cells. Antigen receptor-triggered Ca2+ mobilization, cytokine production, and receptor clustering can be genetically uncoupled in cbl-b mutant T cells. Thus, Cbl-b functions as a negative regulator of receptor clustering and raft aggregation in T cells.","4590":"CD40 ligation triggers IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that CD40 cross-linking alone is not sufficient to induce IL-12 production by DC in vivo. Indeed, resting DC make neither the IL-12 p35 nor IL-12 p40 subunits and express only low levels of CD40. Nevertheless, after DC activation by microbial stimuli that primarily upregulate IL-12 p40 and augment CD40 expression, CD40 ligation induces a significant increase in IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p70 heterodimer production. Similarly, IL-12 p70 is produced during T cell activation in the presence but not in the absence of microbial stimuli. Thus, production of bioactive IL-12 by DC can be amplified by T cell-derived signals but must be initiated by innate signals.","4591":"To determine the role of the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-beta in B cells, we generated mice lacking the TGF-beta receptor (TbetaR) type II selectively in this cell type through conditional mutagenesis (Cre\/loxP). The absence of TbetaRII in B cells leads to a reduced life span of conventional B cells, expansion of peritoneal B-1 cells, B cell hyperplasia in Peyer's patches, elevated serum immunoglobulin, and substantial IgG3 responses to a normally weak immunogen. This B cell hyperresponsiveness is associated with a virtually complete serum IgA deficiency. The data reveal differential roles of TbetaR in homeostasis and antigen responsiveness of B cell subpopulations and establish a critical function of the TGF-beta receptor ligand pair in the induction of IgA responses in vivo.","4592":"Immunoglobulin light chain (LC) normally is a soluble, secreted protein, but some LC assemble into ordered fibrils whose deposition in tissues results in amyloidosis and organ failure. Here we reconstitute fibril formation in vitro and show that preformed fibrils can nucleate polymerization of soluble LC. This prion-like behavior has important physiological implications, since somatic mutations generate multiple related LC sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fibril formation in vitro and aggregation of whole LC within cells are inhibited by BiP and by a synthetic peptide that is identical to a major LC binding site for BiP. We propose that LC form fibrils via an interprotein loop swap and that the underlying conformational change should be amenable to drug therapy.","4593":"The AML1:CBFbeta transcription factor complex is essential for definitive hematopoiesis. Null mutations in mouse AML1 result in midgestational lethality with a complete lack of fetal liver hematopoiesis. While the cell autonomous nature and expression pattern of AML1 suggest an intrinsic role for this transcription factor in the developing hematopoietic system, no direct link to a functional cell type has been made. Here, we examine the consequences of AML1 loss in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of the mouse embryo. We demonstrate an absolute requirement for AML1 in functional HSCs. Moreover, haploinsufficiency results in a dramatic change in the temporal and spatial distribution of HSCs, leading to their early appearance in the normal position in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and also in the yolk sac.","4594":"","4595":"","4596":"Although somatic mutation contributes to the diversity of only a minor fraction of B cells in mouse spleen or blood, its contribution to the diversity of serum immunoglobulin is unknown. We have devised an immunoassay to monitor mutated antibodies in serum using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a VK only when mutated at its major intrinsic hot spot. Mutation makes essentially no contribution to the diversity of endogenous serum IgM, IgG, or IgA in young mice. However, in response to environmental antigens, the titer of mutated immunoglobulin in T cell-proficient mice rises strikingly with age, such that the major proportion of serum immunoglobulin in adults is somatically mutated, with the mutation load in IgG being some 10-fold greater than in IgM.","4597":"The c-fes protooncogene encodes a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Fes) implicated in cytokine receptor signal transduction, neutrophil survival, and myeloid differentiation. To determine the role of Fes in embryonic development and hematopoiesis, we engineered a null mutation of the murine c-fes locus. c-fes-\/- mice are viable but not born in the expected Mendelian ratios. Live born c-fes-\/- mice exhibit lymphoid\/myeloid homeostasis defects, compromised innate immunity, and increased Stat activation in response to GM-CSF and IL-6 signaling. Therefore, increased cytokine responsiveness in the absence of Fes leads to abnormal myeloid proliferation and functional defects in the macrophage lineage.","4598":"Fc receptors play a major role in immune defenses against pathogens and in inflammatory processes. The crystal structure of a human immunoglobulin receptor, FcgammaRIIIb, has been determined to 1.8 A resolution. The overall fold consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains with an acute interdomain hinge angle of approximately 50 degrees. Trp-113, wedged between the N-terminal D1 and the C-terminal D2 domains, appears to further restrict the hinge angle. The putative Fc binding region of the receptor carries a net positive charge complementary to the negative-charged receptor binding regions on Fc. A 1:1 binding stoichiometry between the receptor and Fc was measured by both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium size-exclusion chromatography. Two separate parallel dimers are observed in the crystal lattice, offering intriguing models for receptor aggregation.","4599":"IgE antibodies mediate antiparasitic immune responses and the inflammatory reactions of allergy and asthma. We have solved the crystal structure of the human IgE-Fc Cepsilon3-Cepsilon4 domains to 2.3 A resolution. The structure reveals a large rearrangement of the N-terminal Cepsilon3 domains when compared to related IgG-Fc structures and to the IgE-Fc bound to its high-affinity receptor, FcepsilonRI. The IgE-Fc adopts a more compact, closed configuration that places the two Cepsilon3 domains in close proximity, decreases the size of the interdomain cavity, and obscures part of the FcepsilonRI binding site. IgE-Fc conformational flexibility may be required for interactions with two distinct IgE receptors, and the structure suggests strategies for the design of therapeutic compounds for the treatment of IgE-mediated diseases.","4600":"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) K3 and K5 proteins dramatically downregulate MHC class I molecules. However, although MHC class I downregulation may protect KSHV-infected cells from cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition, these cells become potential targets for natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis. We now show that K5 also downregulates ICAM-1 and B7-2, which are ligands for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity receptors. As a consequence, K5 expression drastically inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, de novo expression of B7-2 and ICAM-1 resensitizes the K5-expressing cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This is a novel viral immune evasion strategy where KSHV K5 achieves immune avoidance by downregulation of cellular ligands for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity receptors.","4601":"KARAP\/DAP12 is a transmembrane polypeptide with an intracytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). KARAP\/DAP12 is associated with several activating cell surface receptors in hematopoietic cells. Here, we report that knockin mice bearing a nonfunctional KARAP\/DAP12 ITAM present altered innate immune responses. Although in these mice NK cells are present and their repertoire of inhibitory MHC class I receptors is intact, the NK cell spectrum of natural cytotoxicity toward tumor cell targets is restricted. KARAP\/DAP12 loss-of-function mutant mice also exhibit a dramatic accumulation of dendritic cells in muco-cutaneous epithelia, associated with an impaired hapten-specific contact sensitivity. Thus, despite its homology with CD3zeta and FcRgamma, KARAP\/DAP12 plays a specific role in innate immunity, emphasizing the nonredundancy of these ITAM-bearing polypeptides in hematopoietic cells.","4602":"DAP12 is an ITAM-bearing membrane adaptor molecule implicated in the activation of NK and myeloid cells. In mice rendered DAP12 deficient by targeted gene disruption, lymphoid and myeloid development was apparently normal, although the activating Ly49 receptors on NK cells were downregulated and nonfunctional. To analyze the consequences of DAP12 deficiency in vivo, we examined the susceptibility of DAP12-\/- mice to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). DAP12-\/- mice were resistant to EAE induced by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide. Resistance was associated with a strongly diminished production of IFNgamma by myelin-reactive CD4+ T cells due to inadequate T cell priming in vivo. These data suggest that DAP12 signaling may be required for optimal antigen-presenting cell (APC) function or inflammation.","4603":"Despite thousands of genetic polymorphisms among MHC matched mouse strains, a few unknown histocompatibility antigens are targeted by the cytotoxic T cells specific for tissue grafts. We isolated the cDNA of a novel BALB.B antigen gene that defines the polymorphic H28 locus on chromosome 3 and yields the naturally processed ILENFPRL (IFL8) peptide for presentation by Kb MHC to C57BI\/6 CTL. The CTL specific for the IFL8\/Kb and our previously identified H60\/Kb complexes represent a major fraction of the B6 anti-BALB.B immune response. The immunodominance of these antigens can be explained by their differential transcription in the donor versus the host strains and their expression in professional donor antigen-presenting cells.","4604":"Cognate interactions of naive T cells with antigen-presenting dendritic cells require physical cell-cell contacts leading to signal induction and T cell activation. Using a three-dimensional collagen matrix videomicroscopy model for ovalbumin peptide-specific activation of murine and oxidative mitogenesis of human T cells, we show that T cells maintain vigorous migration upon cognate interactions to DC (dendritic cell), continuously crawl across the DC surface, and rapidly detach (median within 6-12 min). These dynamic and short-lived encounters favor sequential contacts with the same or other DC and trigger calcium influx, upregulation of activation markers, T blast formation, and proliferation. We conclude that a tissue environment supports the accumulation of sequential signals, implicating a numeric or \"digital\" control mechanism for an ongoing primary immune response.","4605":"CD28 and CTLA-4 are related members of a family of T lymphocyte cell surface receptors that function to regulate T cell activation. We have found that the cytoplasmic domains of both CTLA-4 and CD28 can associate with members of the PP2A family of serine\/threonine phosphatases. The association of PP2A with CD28 was negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. Inhibition of PP2A activity in Jurkat leukemia T cells by treatment with okadaic acid or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant enhanced T cell activation induced by CD28 engagement. Interactions between cell surface receptors such as CTLA-4 and CD28 and serine\/threonine phosphatases may represent a novel mechanism for modulating the intracellular signal transduction pathways associated with cell activation.","4606":"CD86 is an important costimulatory molecule for the priming and activation of naive and memory T cells, respectively. Here, we show that soluble CD86 is detected in human serum. Soluble CD86 is produced by resting monocytes and results from an alternatively spliced transcript (CD86deltaTM) characterized by deletion of the transmembrane domain. Recombinant CD86deltaTM binds to CD28 and CTLA-4 and induces the activation of T cells after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb. CD86deltaTM also induces IFNgamma production by virus-specific CD8+ memory human T cells stimulated with the Flu M1 peptide. The concentrations of soluble CD86 found in human serum are sufficient to induce biological activity. Soluble CD86 molecule, therefore, appears to be a functional costimulatory molecule playing a potentially important role in immune surveillance.","4607":"Proliferation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells are often correlated, but it is not clear whether they are mechanistically linked. When antigen-specific T cells are present at high frequency in vivo, they all respond to antigenic peptide stimulation by expressing activation markers, but only a subset begins to proliferate. However, noncycling cells may synthesize the effector cytokine IFNgamma even though their cell cycle is blocked in G1. These data show that proliferation and effector function are not rigidly linked in T cells. Instead, CD4+ T cells have the flexibility to engage in or bypass clonal expansion based on the integration of multiple signals, including the frequency of other responding T cells.","4608":"","4609":"By virtue of its ability to couple the BCR to an inhibitory pathway, FcgammaRIIB can potentially determine the fate of B cells upon IgG immune complex engagement. We now provide evidence for FcgammaRIIB as a component of a peripheral tolerance pathway with the observation that RIIB-\/- mice develop autoantibodies and autoimmune glomerulonephritis in a strain-dependent fashion. Transfer of the autoimmune phenotype is associated with the presence of donor RIIB-\/- B cells, with the RIIB+\/+ myeloid cells primarily derived from the recipient. These results suggest that deficiency of RIIB on B cells leads to autoimmune disease in specific genetic backgrounds, thus identifying it as a susceptibility factor under the influence of epistatic modifiers for the development of autoimmunity.","4610":"We generated the DUC18 T cell receptor transgenic mouse expressing an H-2Kd -restricted transgenic T cell receptor specific for the syngeneic CMS5 fibrosarcoma rejection antigen mutated ERK2(136-144). DUC18 mice were capable of specifically eliminating lethal CMS5 tumor challenges, and transfer of DUC18 splenocytes to naive nontransgenic recipients conferred protection from subsequent and established CMS5 tumor burdens. Eradication of established tumor burdens by adoptive transfer of DUC18 splenocytes was dose and time dependent. Transferred tumor-specific T cells remained functional in vivo and capable of rejecting small tumors even in the presence of large, established tumor burdens. These findings highlight the kinetic battle between tumor growth and the production of a tumor-specific response and have critical implications for effective adoptive immunotherapy.","4611":"The structural basis for the T cell recognition of lipoglycans remains to be elucidated. We have described autoreactive T cells responsive to GM1 ganglioside presented by CD1b. We show that glycosphingolipids bind to CD1b on the cell surface at neutral pH and are recognized without internalization or processing. Furthermore, soluble GM-CD1b complexes stimulate specific T cells. Oligosaccharide groups containing five or more sugars are required to build a minimal epitope for TCR recognition. This suggests a mechanism for T cell recognition of glycosphingolipids in which much of the CD1b-bound ligand is exposed. Binding to CD1b is a highly reversible process and other ceramide-containing glycosphingolipids displace GM1. These nonantigenic compounds act as blockers and may prevent harmful autoreactivity in vivo.","4612":"Pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) expression is critical for B lineage development. The signaling events initiated by the pre-BCR, however, remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that lipid rafts are the major functional compartment for human pre-B cell activation. A fraction of pre-BCR was constitutively raft associated, and receptor engagement enhanced this association. These events promoted Lyn activation and Igbeta phosphorylation and led to the generation of a raft-associated signaling module composed of tyrosine phosphorylated Lyn, Syk, BLNK, PI3K, Btk, VAV, and PLCgamma2. Formation of this module was essential for pre-BCR calcium signaling. Together, these observations directly link the previously identified genetic requirement for the components of this module in B lineage development with theirfunctional role(s) in human preBCR signaling.","4613":"The OX2 membrane glycoprotein (CD200) is expressed on a broad range of tissues including lymphoid cells, neurons, and endothelium. We report the characterization of an OX2 receptor (OX2R) that is a novel protein restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage. OX2 and its receptor are both cell surface glycoproteins containing two immunoglobulin-like domains and interact with a dissociation constant of 2.5 microM and koff 0.8 s(-1), typical of many leukocyte protein membrane interactions. Pervanandate treatment of macrophages showed that OX2R could be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Blockade of the OX2-OX2R interaction with an OX2R mAb exacerbated the disease model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These data, together with data from an OX2-deficient mouse (R. M. Hoek et al., submitted), suggest that myeloid function can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner by the OX2-OX2R interaction.","4614":"Hypotension and shock observed in sepsis, SIRS, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or cytokine-based cancer treatment are the consequence of excessive nitric oxide (NO) production and subsequent soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation. We demonstrate here that, while NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors exacerbated toxicity, inhibitors of sGC activation protected against TNF-induced lethality, bradycardia, and hypotension. Importantly, sGC inhibition did not interfere with the antitumor activity of TNF. Using NOS inhibitors or iNOS-deficient animals, we furthermore observed that no protection against TNF toxicity could be obtained in the absence of NO. These data imply that iNOS- (and not eNOS-) derived NO is an endogenous protective molecule indispensable to survive a TNF challenge and exerting this beneficial effect via sGC-independent mechanisms.","4615":"Loading of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex class I molecules involves a multifactorial complex that includes tapasin (TPN), a membrane protein that tethers empty class I glycoproteins to the transporter associated with antigen processing. To evaluate the in vivo role of TPN, we have generated Tpn mutant mice. In these animals, most class I molecules exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the absence of stably bound peptides. Consequently, mutant animals have defects in class I cell surface expression, antigen presentation, CD8+ T cell development, and immune responses. These findings reveal a critical role of TPN for ER retention of empty class I molecules. Tpn mutant animals should prove useful for studies on alternative antigen-processing pathways that involve post-ER peptide loading.","4616":"BCL-6, a transcriptional repressor frequently translocated in lymphomas, regulates germinal center B cell differentiation and inflammation. DNA microarray screening identified genes repressed by BCL-6, including many lymphocyte activation genes, suggesting that BCL-6 modulates B cell receptor signals. BCL-6 repression of two chemokine genes, MIP-1alpha and IP-10, may also attenuate inflammatory responses. Blimp-1, another BCL-6 target, is important for plasmacytic differentiation. Since BCL-6 expression is silenced in plasma cells, repression of blimp-1 by BCL-6 may control plasmacytic differentiation. Indeed, inhibition of BCL-6 function initiated changes indicative of plasmacytic differentiation, including decreased expression of c-Myc and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1. These data suggest that malignant transformation by BCL-6 involves inhibition of differentiation and enhanced proliferation.","4617":"The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is involved in the development of many tissues. Here we show that sonic hedgehog (Shh) is involved in thymocyte development. Our data suggest that termination of Hh signaling is necessary for differentiation from CD4-CD8-double-negative (DN) to CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocyte. Shh is produced by the thymic stroma, and Patched and Smoothened (Smo), the transmembrane receptors for Shh, are expressed in DN thymocytes. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody against Shh increases differentiation of DN to DP thymocytes, and Shh protein arrests thymocyte differentiation at the CD25+ DN stage, after T cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) gene rearrangement. We show that one consequence of pre-TCR signaling is downregulation of Smo, allowing DN thymocytes to proliferate and differentiate.","4618":"Glucocorticoids are believed to play a role in T cell development and selection, although their precise function is controversial. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-deficient mice were used to directly investigate this problem. GR-deficient thymocytes were resistant to dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis, confirming the absence of glucocorticoid responsiveness. An absence of GR signaling had no impact on thymocyte development either in vivo or in vitro. T cell differentiation, including positive selection, was normal as assessed by normal development of CD4+CD8+, alphabetaTCR+CD4+, and alphabetaTCR+CD8+ thymocytes. Negative selection, mediated by the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), or anti-CD3\/CD28, was also normal in the absence of GR signaling. In contrast to earlier reports, these data demonstrate that GR signaling is not essential for intrathymic T cell development or selection.","4619":"The ETS gene Fli-1 is involved in the induction of erythroleukemia in mice by Friend murine leukemia virus and Ewings sarcoma in children. Mice with a targeted null mutation in the Fli-1 locus die at day 11.5 of embryogenesis with loss of vascular integrity leading to bleeding within the vascular plexus of the cerebral meninges and specific downregulation of Tek\/Tie-2, the receptor for angiopoietin-1. We also show that dysmegakaryopoiesis in Fli-1 null embryos resembles that frequently seen in patients with terminal deletions of 11q (Jacobsen or Paris-Trousseau Syndrome). We map the megakaryocytic defects in 14 Jacobsen patients to a minimal region on 11q that includes the Fli-1 gene and suggest that dysmegakaryopoiesis in these patients may be caused by hemizygous loss of Fli-1.","4620":"During hematopoiesis, myeloid progenitor cells give rise to granulocytes and macrophages. To study the role for ICSBP, a hematopoietic cell-specific transcription factor in myeloid cell development, the gene was introduced into myeloid progenitor cells established from ICSBP-\/- mice. ICSBP retrovirus-transduced cells differentiated into mature macrophages with phagocytic activity, which coincided with the induction of specific target DNA binding activity. Similar to macrophages in vivo, ICSBP-transduced cells were growth arrested, expressed many macrophage-specific genes, and responded to macrophage activation signals. Contrary to this, ICSBP transducion led to repression of granulocyte-specific genes and inhibited G-CSF-mediated granulocytic differentiation in these and other myeloid progenitor cells. Together, ICSBP has a key role in the myeloid cell lineage selection and macrophage maturation.","4621":"We report an in vitro stroma-dependent system for the clonal growth and differentiation of natural killer (NK) cells from lymphoid-restricted bone marrow progenitors or bone marrow NK1.1+ cells. Strikingly, the potential to initiate expression of specific Ly49 receptors becomes increasingly restricted as NK cells develop. Moreover, when NK cells express a Ly49 receptor specific for stromal cell class I MHC, they are less likely to initiate expression of another Ly49 receptor in the clonal culture system. The results indicate multiple roles for stromal cells in NK cell development, in supporting clonal growth, in initiation of Ly49 receptor expression, and in formation of the NK cell receptor repertoire.","4622":"The double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is considered to play an important role in interferon's (IFN's) response to viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking PKR are predisposed to lethal intranasal infection by the usually innocuous vesicular stomatitis virus, and also display increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection. Our data indicate that in normal cells, PKR primarily prevents virus replication by inhibiting the translation of viral mRNAs through phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, while concomitantly assisting in the production of autocrine IFN and the establishment of an antiviral state. These results show that PKR is an essential component of innate immunity that acts early in host defense prior to the onset of IFN counteraction and the acquired immune response.","4623":"Antigenic peptides are translocated by the TAP peptide transporter from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto MHC class I molecules. Peptides that fail to bind need to be removed from the ER. Here we provide evidence that peptide export utilizes the Sec61p translocon as demonstrated by blocking this channel with bacterial exotoxin. Peptide export interferes with the retrotranslocation of beta2-microglobulin from the ER to the cytosol, suggesting similar pathways for the disposal of proteins and oligopeptides. Peptide export requires ATP supply to the ER lumen but is independent of ATP hydrolysis.","4624":"Previous analyses of NOD mice have shown that some genes control the development of both insulitis and diabetes, while other loci influence diabetes without reducing insulitis. Evidence for the existence of a gene only influencing diabetes, Idd9 on mouse chromosome 4, is provided here by the development of a novel congenic mouse strain, NOD.B10 Idd9. NOD.B10 Idd9 mice display profound resistance to diabetes even though nearly all develop insulitis. Subcongenic analysis has demonstrated that alleles of at least three B10 genes, Idd9.1, Idd9.2, and Idd9.3 are required to produce Idd9-mediated diabetes resistance. Candidate genes with amino acid differences between the NOD and B10 strains have been localized to the 5.6 cM Idd9.2 interval (Tnfr2, Cd30) and to the 2.0 cM Idd9.3 interval (Cd137).","4625":"While CD28 is critical for expansion of naive T cells, recent evidence suggests that the activation of effector T cells is largely independent of CD28\/B7. We suggest that ICOS, the third member of the CD28\/CTLA-4 family, plays an important role in production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFNgamma from recently activated T cells and contributes to T cell-dependent B help in vivo. Inhibition of ICOS attenuates lung mucosal inflammation induced by Th2 but not Th1 effector populations. Our data indicate a critical function for the third member of the CD28 family in T cell-dependent immune responses.","4626":"TCR signaling leading to thymocyte apoptosis is mediated through the expression of the Nur77 family of orphan nuclear receptors. MEF2 has been shown to be the major transcription factor responsible for calcium-dependent Nur77 transcription. Cabin1 was recently identified as a transcriptional repressor of MEF2, which can be released from MEF2 in a calcium-dependent fashion. The molecular basis of repression of MEF2 by Cabin1, however, has remained unknown. We report that Cabin1 represses MEF2 by two distinct mechanisms. Cabin1 recruits mSin3 and its associated histone deacetylases 1 and 2; Cabin1 also competes with p300 for binding to MEF2. Thus, activation of MEF2 and the consequent transcription of Nur77 are controlled by the association of MEF2 with the histone deacetylases via the calcium-dependent repressor Cabin1.","4627":"Notch proteins regulate many developmental processes. Notch1 is highly expressed on thymocytes, but its role in regulating their development is not known. We show that activation of Notch1 signaling in CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes promotes the maturation of both CD4+ and CD8+ single positive thymocytes and that this occurs in the absence of interactions between the T cell receptor and MHC molecules expressed on thymic epithelial cells. We have also identified several genes that are transcriptionally regulated by Notch1 in T cells and show that they are upregulated during maturation into both single positive lineages. These observations suggest that Notch1 signaling plays a role in promoting maturation into both the CD4 and CD8 T cell lineages.","4628":"A central paradigm of T cell development is that CD4+8+ (DP) thymocytes differentiate into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in response to intrathymic signals that extinguish transcription of the inappropriate coreceptor molecule. Contrary to this prevailing paradigm, we now demonstrate that signaled DP thymocytes initially terminate CD8 transcription even when differentiating into CD8+ T cells. Remarkably, thymocytes that have selectively terminated CD8 transcription can be signaled by IL-7 to differentiate into CD8+ T cells by silencing CD4 transcription and reinitiating CD8 transcription, events we refer to as \"coreceptor reversal.\" These observations significantly alter our understanding of CD8+ T cell differentiation and lead to a new perspective (\"kinetic signaling\") on CD4\/CD8 lineage determination in the thymus. These observations also suggest a novel mechanism by which bipotential cells throughout development can determine their appropriate cell fate.","4629":"CD19 regulates constitutive and antigen receptor-induced signaling thresholds in B lymphocytes through its unique cytoplasmic domain. Herein, we demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism where interactions between CD19 and Lyn amplify basal and antigen receptor-induced Src family kinase activation. Lyn expression was required for CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation in primary B cells. Experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that CD19-Y513 was Lyn's initial phosphorylation and binding site. This led to processive phosphorylation of CD19-Y482, which recruited a second Lyn molecule, allowing for transphosphorylation and amplification of Lyn activation. In vivo, CD19 deficiency impaired, and CD19 overexpression enhanced, Lyn kinase activity. Thus, CD19 functions as a specialized adapter protein for the amplification of Src family kinases that is crucial for intrinsic and antigen receptor-induced signal transduction.","4630":"All rearranging antigen receptor genes have one or two highly diverse complementarity determining regions (CDRs) among the six that typically form the ligand binding surface. We report here that, in the case of antibodies, diversity at one of these regions, CDR3 of the V(H) domain, is sufficient to permit otherwise identical IgM molecules to distinguish between a variety of hapten and protein antigens. Furthermore, we find that somatic mutation can allow such antibodies to achieve surprisingly high affinities. These results are consistent with a model in which the highly diverse CDR3 loops are the key determinant of specificity in antigen recognition in both T cell receptors (TCR) and antibodies, whereas the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 sequences are much more cross-reactive.","4631":"Many receptors activate phospholipase Cgamma1 or -gamma2. To assess the role of PLCgamma2, we derived enzyme-deficient mice. The mice are viable but have decreased mature B cells, a block in pro-B cell differentiation, and B1 B cell deficiency. IgM receptor-induced Ca2+ flux and proliferation to B cell mitogens are absent. IgM, IgG2a, and IgG3 levels are reduced, and T cell-independent antibody production is absent. The similarity to Btk- or Blnk-deficient mice demonstrates that PLCgamma2 is downstream in Btk\/Blnk signaling. FcRgamma signaling is also defective, resulting in a loss of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, mast cell FcepsilonR function, and NK cell FcgammaRIII and 2B4 function. The results define a signal transduction pathway broadly utilized by immunoglobulin superfamily receptors.","4632":"Lymphocyte enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1) is a member of the LEF-1\/TCF family of transcription factors, which have been implicated in Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis. LEF-1 was originally identified in pre-B and T cells, but its function in B lymphocyte development remains unknown. Here we report that LEF-1-deficient mice exhibit defects in pro-B cell proliferation and survival in vitro and in vivo. We further show that Lef1-\/- pro-B cells display elevated levels of fas and c-myc transcription, providing a potential mechanism for their increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Finally, we establish a link between Wnt signaling and normal B cell development by demonstrating that Wnt proteins are mitogenic for pro-B cells and that this effect is mediated by LEF-1.","4633":"The current structural model of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) describes it as a symmetric protein complex in which one membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecule (mIg) is noncovalently bound on each side by an Ig-alpha\/Ig-beta heterodimer. Using peptide-tagged Ig-alpha proteins, blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), and biosynthetical labeling of B cells, we find that the mIg:Ig-alpha\/Ig-beta complex has a stoichiometry of 1:1 and not 1:2. An anti-Flag stimulation of B cells coexpressing Flag-tagged and wild-type Ig-alpha proteins results in the phosphorylation of both Ig-alpha proteins, suggesting that on the surface of living B cells, several BCR monomers are in contact with each other. A BN-PAGE analysis after limited detergent lysis provides further evidence for an oligomeric BCR structure.","4634":"","4635":"Here we describe a family of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins that function as ligands for the mouse activating NKG2D receptor. These molecules are encoded by the retinoic acid early inducible (RAE-1) and H60 minor histocompatibility antigen genes on mouse chromosome 10 and show weak homology with MHC class I. Expression of the NKG2D ligands is low or absent on normal, adult tissues; however, they are constitutively expressed on some tumors and upregulated by retinoic acid. Ectopic expression of RAE-1 and H60 confers target susceptibility to NK cell attack. These studies identify a family of ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor on NK and T cells, which may play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity.","4636":"Minor or histocompatibility (H) antigens are recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes as short polymorphic peptides associated with MHC molecules. They are the targets of graft versus host and graft versus leukemia responses following bone marrow transplantation between HLA-identical siblings. Several genes encoding class I-restricted minor H epitopes have been identified, but approaches used for these have proved difficult to adapt for cloning class II-restricted minor H genes. We have combined the unique antigen-presenting properties of dendritic cells and high levels of episomal expression following transfection of COS cells to identify a Y chromosome gene encoding two HY peptide epitopes, HYAb and HYEk.","4637":"We have determined the crystal structure of I-Ag7, an integral component in murine type I diabetes development. Several features distinguish I-Ag7 from other non-autoimmune-associated MHC class II molecules, including novel peptide and heterodimer pairing interactions. The binding groove of I-Ag7 is unusual at both terminal ends, with a potentially solvent-exposed channel at the base of the P1 pocket and a widened entrance to the P9 pocket. Peptide binding studies with variants of the hen egg lysozyme I-Ag7 epitope HEL(11-25) support a comprehensive structure-based I-Ag7 binding motif. Residues critical for T cell recognition were investigated with a panel of HEL(11-25)-restricted clones, which uncovered P1 anchor-dependent structural variations. These results establish a framework for future experiments directed at understanding the role of I-Ag7 in autoimmunity.","4638":"That NK cell receptors engage fast-evolving MHC class I ligands suggests that they, too, evolve rapidly. To test this hypothesis, the structure and class I specificity of chimpanzee KIR and CD94:NKG2 receptors were determined and compared to their human counterparts. The KIR families are divergent, with only three KIR conserved between chimpanzees and humans. By contrast, CD94:NKG2 receptors are conserved. Whereas receptors for polymorphic class I are divergent, those for nonpolymorphic class I are conserved. Although chimpanzee and human NK cells exhibit identical receptor specificities for MHC-C, they are mediated by nonorthologous KIR. These results demonstrate the rapid evolution of NK cell receptor systems and imply that \"catching up\" with class I is not the only force driving this evolution.","4639":"Immunity against MHC class II tumors can be mediated by CD4+ T cells in the effector phase through an unknown mechanism. We show that this is IFN gamma dependent but does not require IFN gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) expression on tumor cells, T cells, or other hematopoietic cells and that IFN gamma R expression is not necessary in the priming phase. However, tumor immunity requires IFN gamma R expression on nonhematopoietic cells in the effector phase and involves inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis. This shows that an effective anti-tumor response involves communication between CD4+ T cells and nonhematopoietic cells, most likely within the tumor stroma, and that tumor immunity must not entirely rely on direct tumor cell killing.","4640":"Noninflamed skin venules support constitutive leukocyte rolling. P-selectin controls the rolling frequency, whereas E-selectin dictates rolling velocity (Vroll). Fucosylated selectin ligands are essential for all interactions, as rolling was absent in mice doubly deficient in alpha1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT)-IV and FucT-VII. The rolling fraction was reduced in FucT-VII-\/- animals but normal in FucT-IV-\/- mice. However, Vroll was markedly increased in both strains. P-selectin ligands generated by FucT-VII are crucial for initial leukocyte tethering, whereas E-selectin ligands that permit maximum slowing of Vroll require simultaneous expression of FucT-IV and FucT-VII. These results demonstrate a role for FucT-IV in selectin-dependent adhesion and suggest that the endothelial selectins and FucTs have distinct but overlapping functions in the immunosurveillance of the skin.","4641":"Homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into hematopoietic organs is a prerequisite for the establishment of hematopoiesis during embryogenesis and after bone marrow transplantation. We show that beta1 integrin-deficient HSCs from the para-aortic splanchnopleura and the fetal blood had hematolymphoid differentiation potential in vitro and in fetal organ cultures but were unable to seed fetal and adult hematopoietic tissues. Adult beta1 integrin null HSCs isolated from mice carrying loxP-tagged beta1 integrin alleles and ablated for beta1 integrin expression by retroviral cre transduction failed to engraft irradiated recipient mice. Moreover, absence of beta1 integrin resulted in sequestration of HSCs in the circulation and their reduced adhesion to endothelioma cells. These findings define beta1 integrin as an essential adhesion receptor for the homing of HSCs.","4642":"By DNase I hypersensitivity analysis, we have identified an inducible, cyclosporin A-sensitive enhancer located 3' of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene. The enhancer binds the Th2-specific transcription factor GATA3 in vivo but is not perceptibly influenced by the absence of a second Th2-specific factor, cMaf. The antigen-inducible transcription factor NFAT1 binds the IL-4 enhancer and the IL-4 promoter only in stimulated Th2 cells; conversely, NFAT1 binds to the interferon (IFN)-gamma promoter only in stimulated Th1 cells. Our results support a model whereby transcription factors such as NFAT1, which are nonselectively induced in antigen-stimulated T cells, gain access to cytokine regulatory regions only in the appropriate subset of differentiated T cells in vivo. This restricted access enables antigen-dependent and subset-specific transcription of cytokine genes.","4643":"Casper (c-FLIP) associates with FADD and caspase-8 in signaling complexes downstream of death receptors like Fas. We generated Casper-deficient mice and cells and noted a duality in the physiological functions of this molecule. casper-\/- embryos do not survive past day 10.5 of embryogenesis and exhibit impaired heart development. This phenotype is reminiscent of that reported for FADD-\/- and caspase-8-\/- embryos. However, unlike FADD-\/- and caspase-8-\/- cells, casper-\/- embryonic fibroblasts are highly sensitive to FasL- or TNF-induced apoptosis and show rapid induction of caspase activities. NF-kappaB and JNK\/SAPK activation is intact in TNF-stimulated casper-\/- cells. These results suggest that Casper has two distinct roles: to cooperate with FADD and caspase-8 during embryonic development and to mediate cytoprotection against death factor-induced apoptosis.","4644":"Granzyme B (GzmB) is a component of cytotoxic lymphocyte granules that can rapidly initiate apoptosis in target cells. While several procaspases are cleaved and activated by GzmB, the absolute requirement of caspase activation for GzmB-induced apoptosis is controversial. In this report, we demonstrate that GzmB can initiate apoptosis in the absence of caspase-3 activity by directly cleaving DFF45\/ICAD to liberate activated DFF40\/CAD. DFF45\/ICAD cleavage occurs less efficiently in cells that lack caspase-3 activity, suggesting that the caspases normally amplify the GzmB death signal. DFF45\/ICAD-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts are partially resistant to GzmB-induced death, demonstrating the biological importance of DFF45\/ICAD for GzmB-mediated apoptosis.","4645":"Fas (APO-1\/CD95) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) trigger apoptosis by recruiting the apoptosis initiator caspase-8 through the adaptor FADD. Fas binds FADD directly, whereas TNFR1 binds FADD indirectly, through TRADD. TRADD alternatively recruits the NF-kappaB-inducing adaptor RIP. The TNF homolog Apo2L\/TRAIL triggers apoptosis through two distinct death receptors, DR4 and DR5; however, receptor over-expression studies have yielded conflicting results on the ligand's signaling mechanism. Apo2L\/TRAIL induced homomeric and heteromeric complexes of DR4 and DR5 and stimulated recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 and caspase-8 activation in nontransfected cells. TRADD and RIP, which bound TNFR1, did not bind DR4 and DR5. Thus, Apo2L\/TRAIL and FasL initiate apoptosis through similar mechanisms, and FADD may be a universal adaptor for death receptors.","4646":"Apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL\/APO-2L) has been shown to exert important functions during various immunological processes. The involvement of the death adaptor proteins FADD\/MORT1, TRADD, and RIP and the apoptosis-initiating caspases-8 and -10 in death signaling by the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2) are controversial. Analysis of the native TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) revealed ligand-dependent recruitment of FADD\/MORT1 and caspase-8. Differential precipitation of ligand-stimulated TRAIL receptors demonstrated that FADD\/MORT1 and caspase-8 were recruited to TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 independently of each other. FADD\/MORT1- and caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells expressing only TRAIL-R2 were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Thus, FADD\/MORT1 and caspase-8 are essential for apoptosis induction via TRAIL-R2.","4647":"","4648":"Caspases are intracellular proteases that mediate mammalian cell apoptosis. Caspase-1 (Casp-1) is a unique caspase because it activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18. Shigella flexneri, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery, induces macrophage apoptosis, which requires Casp-1 and results in the release of mature IL-1beta and IL-18. Here we show that casp-1(-\/-) mice infected with S. flexneri do not develop the acute inflammation characteristic of shigellosis and are unable to resolve the bacterial infection. Using casp-1(-\/-) mice supplemented with recombinant cytokines and experiments with IL-1beta(-\/-) and IL-18(-\/-) mice, we show that IL-1beta and IL-18 are both required to mediate inflammation in S. flexneri infections. Together, these data demonstrate the importance of Casp-1 in acute inflammation and show the different roles of its substrates, IL-1beta and IL-18, in this response.","4649":"We have isolated two Drosophila lines that carry point mutations in the gene coding for the NF-KB-like factor DIF. Like mutants of the Toll pathway, Dif mutant flies are susceptible to fungal but not to bacterial infections. Genetic epistasis experiments demonstrate that Dif mediates the Toll-dependent control of the inducibility of the antifungal peptide gene Drosomycin. Strikingly, DIF alone is required for the antifungal response in adults, but is redundant in larvae with Dorsal, another Rel family member. In Drosophila, Dif appears to be dedicated to the antifungal defense elicited by fungi and gram-positive bacteria. We discuss in this light the possibility that NF-KB1\/p50 might be required more specifically in the innate immune response against gram-positive bacteria in mammals.","4650":"Mast cells generated from Rac2-deficient (-\/-) mice demonstrated defective actin-based functions, including adhesion, migration, and degranulation. Rac2(-\/-) mast cells generated lower numbers and less mast cell colonies in response to growth factors and were deficient in vivo. Rac2(-\/-) mast cells demonstrated a significant reduction in growth factor-induced survival, which correlated with the lack of activation of Akt and significant changes in the expression of the Bcl-2 family members BAD and Bcl-XL, in spite of a 3-fold induction of Rac1 protein. These results suggest that Rac2 plays a unique role in multiple cellular functions and describe an essential role for Rac2 in growth factor-dependent survival and expression of BAD\/Bcl-XL.","4651":"The enormous diversity of the T cell pool makes it difficult to determine whether inherent biases in the naive TCR repertoire can influence T cell responsiveness. In C57BL\/6 mice the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to an immunodominant HSV-1 determinant (gB) is characterized by a prominent bias in Vbeta element usage, associated with a conserved and preferentially D element-encoded CDR3 sequence. Comparison of naive and gB-specific T cell populations revealed a similar enrichment of germline D element-encoded CDR3 sequences in the preimmune repertoire. Strikingly, eliminating the germline coding of the gB-specific CDR3 sequence caused an almost complete loss of the dominant subset of gB-specific T cells, illustrating that CDR3 biases can significantly alter both the composition and strength of an immune response.","4652":"The T lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck) is an essential component of the TCR-mediated signal transduction complex. Lck knockout mice have reduced numbers of double-positive thymocytes and very few mature single-positive cells, particularly of the CD4 lineage. Here we demonstrate the ability of a tetracycline-based tissue-specific inducible Lck transgene to restore expansion of early thymocytes and maturation of single-positive cells in Lckneg mice upon induction with doxycycline. Restoration of Lck expression is particularly important for positive selection to the CD4+ lineage but has a lesser impact on selection to the CD8+ lineage, suggesting activation of Lck is an important component of the signals involved in lineage choice during thymic differentiation.","4653":"The linker molecule LAT is a substrate of the tyrosine kinases activated following TCR engagement of T cells. LAT is also expressed in platelets, NK, and mast cells. Although LAT-deficient mice contain normal numbers of mast cells, we found that LAT-deficient mice were resistant to IgE-mediated passive systemic anaphylaxis. LAT-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) showed normal growth and development. Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc(epsilon)RI, Syk, and Vav was intact in LAT-deficient BMMCs following Fc(epsilon)RI engagement, tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, PLC-gamma1, and PLC-gamma2 and calcium mobilization were dramatically reduced. LAT-deficient BMMCs also exhibited profound defects in activation of MAPK, degranulation, and cytokine production after Fc(epsilon)RI cross-linking. These results show that LAT plays a critical role in Fc(epsilon)RI-mediated signaling in mast cells.","4654":"Genetics studies have identified the gene for the high-affinity IgE receptor (FC(epsilon)RI) beta subunit as a candidate gene for atopy. We have shown that beta is an intrinsic signaling amplifier leading to enhanced allergic responses in vivo. Here we report that beta has a second amplification function: the amplification of Fc(epsilon)RI cell surface expression. This function is due to an early association of beta with alpha, resulting in improved trafficking and maturation of alpha and receptor complexes. These data provide a possible molecular explanation for the large difference in Fc(epsilon)RI density between beta-cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and beta+ effector cells (mast cells, basophils). In beta+ cells, the combined signaling and expression amplification results in an estimated 12- to 30-fold amplification of downstream events.","4655":"Reactivity to intestinal epithelium-specific antigen was studied by transgenic expression of cytosolic ovalbumin controlled by an enterocyte-specific promoter. Transferred OVA-specific CD8 cells (OT-I) preferentially expanded in mucosal lymphoid tissues and the epithelium but failed to cause tissue damage. In contrast, concomitant VSV-ova infection induced OT-I-mediated epithelial cell destruction that correlated with antigen density. OT-I cells retained in the epithelium exhibited high levels of lytic activity but were unable to produce cytokines. The mice were systemically tolerant to OVA since endogenous CD8 cells were nonresponsive to VSV-ova infection. Thus, intestinal antigen gained access to peripheral tissues via absorption from effete epithelial cells. This system demonstrated a requirement for inflammation to drive pathogenic autoreactivity against enterocytes and identified pathways of intestine-specific immunoregulation.","4656":"Chemokine-directed migration of leukocyte subsets may contribute to the qualitative differences between systemic and mucosal immunity. Here, we demonstrate that in mice lacking the chemokine receptor CCR6, dendritic cells expressing CD11c and CD11b are absent from the subepithelial dome of Peyer's patches. These mice also have an impaired humoral immune response to orally administered antigen and to the enteropathic virus rotavirus. In addition, CCR6(-\/-) mice have a 2-fold to 15-fold increase in cells of select T lymphocyte populations within the mucosa, including CD4+ and CD8+ alphabeta-TCR T cells. By contrast, systemic immune responses to subcutaneous antigens in CCR6(-\/-) mice are normal. These findings demonstrate that CCR6 is a mucosa-specific regulator of humoral immunity and lymphocyte homeostasis in the intestinal mucosa.","4657":"The generation of an adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens requires the recruitment of effector T cells to sites of infection. Here we show that the chemokine IP-10, a specific chemoattractant for activated T cells, controls this process in mice naturally infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Neutralization of IP-10 in infected mice inhibited the massive influx of T cells into tissues and impaired antigen-specific T cell effector functions. This resulted in &gt;1000-fold increase in tissue parasite burden and a marked increase in mortality compared to control antibody-treated mice. These observations suggest that IP-10 may play a broader role in the localization and function of effector T cells at sites of Th1 inflammation.","4658":"CXCR5, the receptor for B lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC), is required for normal development of Peyer's patches, inguinal lymph nodes, and splenic follicles. To test the in vivo activity of BLC in isolation of other lymphoid organizers, transgenic mice were generated expressing BLC in the pancreatic islets. In addition to attracting B cells, BLC expression led to development of lymph node-like structures that contained B and T cell zones, high endothelial venules, stromal cells, and the chemokine SLC. Development of these features was strongly dependent on B lymphocytes and on lymphotoxin alpha1beta2 and could be reversed by blocking lymphotoxin alpha1beta2. These findings establish that BLC is sufficient to activate a pathway of events leading to formation of organized lymphoid tissue.","4659":"The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) has been linked to the development of several autoimmune diseases. By adapting the tetracycline-regulated gene transcription system, we generated a murine model where islet-specific expression of TNFalpha could be repressed\/derepressed within 48 hr following introduction\/removal of tetracycline in the drinking water. Here we describe the temporal importance of TNFalpha in diabetes development in mice expressing islet-specific B7-1 and TNFalpha. We show that the duration of TNFalpha-mediated inflammation, not the putative maturity of the immune system at the time of TNFalpha expression, determines diabetes progression. Further, we have described an interval between 21 and 25 days following initiation of TNFalpha expression where the fate of islet-reactive T cells is decided.","4660":"","4661":"The developmental potential of individual cells in the Lin-c-kit+CD45+IL-7R+ (IL-7R+) population from murine fetal liver was investigated using a clonal assay capable of determining the potential of a progenitor to give rise to myeloid, T, and B cells. Unipotent progenitors generating T cells (p-T) or B cells (p-B) but not other types of progenitors were found in the IL-7R+ population. A large proportion of progenitors at day 12 of gestation are p-T, whereas the frequency of p-T dramatically decreases with gestational age. In marked contrast, p-B are very rare by day 12, but they rapidly increase thereafter. These findings strongly suggest that the commitment of multipotent progenitors to T and B cell lineages occurs independently.","4662":"CD28\/B7 costimulation has been implicated in the induction and progression of autoimmune diseases. Experimentally induced models of autoimmunity have been shown to be prevented or reduced in intensity in mice rendered deficient for CD28 costimulation. In sharp contrast, spontaneous diabetes is exacerbated in both B7-1\/B7-2-deficient and CD28-deficient NOD mice. These mice present a profound decrease of the immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells, which control diabetes in prediabetic NOD mice. These cells are absent from both CD28KO and B7-1\/B7-2KO mice, and the transfer of this regulatory T cell subset from control NOD animals into CD28-deficient animals can delay\/prevent diabetes. The results suggest that the CD28\/ B7 costimulatory pathway is essential for the development and homeostasis of regulatory T cells that control spontaneous autoimmune diseases.","4663":"The death domain kinase RIP and the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) are essential effectors in TNF signaling. To understand the mechanism by which RIP and TRAF2 regulate TNF-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, we investigated their respective roles in TNF-R1-mediated IKK activation using both RIP-\/- and TRAF2-\/- fibroblasts. We found that TNF-R1-mediated IKK activation requires both RIP and TRAF2 proteins. Although TRAF2 or RIP can be independently recruited to the TNF-R1 complex, neither one of them alone is capable of transducing the TNF signal that leads to IKK activation. Moreover, we demonstrated that IKK is recruited to the TNF-R1 complex through TRAF2 upon TNF treatment and that IKK activation requires the presence of RIP in the same complex.","4664":"The contribution of the CD8beta subunit to CD8 coreceptor function is poorly understood. We now demonstrate that the CD8beta extracellular domain increases the avidity of CD8 binding to MHC I, and that the intracellular domain of CD8beta enhances association with two intracellular molecules required for TCR signal transduction, Lck and LAT. By assessing CD8+ T cell differentiation in CD8beta-deficient mice reconstituted with various transgenic CD8beta chimeric molecules, we also demonstrate that the intracellular and extracellular domains of CD8beta can contribute independently to CD8+ T cell development, but that both CD8beta domains together are most efficient. Thus, this study identifies the molecular functions of the CD8beta intracellular and extracellular domains and documents their contributions to CD8+ T cell development.","4665":"The serine\/threonine kinase HPK1 is a member of the germinal center kinase (GCK) family that has been implicated in the regulation of MAP kinase pathways. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of HPK1 in antigen receptor signaling. Engagement of the TCR or the BCR resulted in a marked induction of HPK1 catalytic activity. Subsequent analysis revealed that Src and Syk\/ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases and the adaptor proteins LAT, SLP-76, BLNK, Grb2, and Grap are involved in HPK1 activation. Overexpression of HPK1 inhibited TCR activation of AP-1 and ERK2, whereas the kinase-inactive mutant of HPK1 potentiated these responses. Neither form of HPK1 affected PMA or v-Ras activation of AP-1 and ERK2. Thus, HPK1 is a negative regulator of the TCR-induced AP-1 response pathway.","4666":"Protein antigens require limited proteolytic processing to generate peptides for binding to class II MHC molecules, but the proteases and processing sites involved are largely unknown. Here we analyze the effect of eliminating the three major asparagine endopeptidase (AEP)-processing sites in the microbial antigen tetanus toxin C fragment. The mutant antigen is highly resistant to proteolysis by AEP and crude lysosomal extracts and is dramatically impaired in its ability to be processed and presented to T cells. Remarkably, processing at a single asparagine residue (1219) is obligatory for optimal presentation of many T cell epitopes in this antigen. These studies demonstrate that cleavage at a single processing site can be crucial for effective antigen presentation.","4667":"We undertook a kinetic analysis of the generation of mature T cells in TCR and coreceptor transgenic mice using BrdU labeling. We observed that the selection efficiency of mature CD4-CD8+ and CD4+CD8- thymocytes could be as high as 40% and 90% of CD4+CD8+ precursors, respectively. The surprisingly high efficiency of selection favors an instructional model of lineage commitment and is incompatible with a stochastic model in which the efficiency of selection would be no greater than 100% in both lineages combined.","4668":"","4669":"","4670":"The mouse Ly6 gene family encodes proteins found in lymphocytes and other cells. Some are involved in cell activation; no ligands have been found. A ligand for Ly6d (ThB) was identified on lymphocytes using microspheres loaded with Ly6d and the cDNA isolated from a spleen\/thymus library by panning on Ly6d. The Ly6d ligand (Ly6d-L) is a nonglycosylated protein of 9 kDa of broad distribution, rich in cysteine, with no discernable transmembrane sequence. Its N and C termini are on the cell surface, where it associates with a 30 kDa protein. Ly6d-L is homologous with an EGF repeat of Notch.","4671":"NKT cells are associated with immunological control of autoimmune disease and cancer and can recognize cell surface mCD1d without addition of exogenous antigens. Cellular antigens presented by mCD1d have not been identified, although NKT cells can recognize a synthetic glycolipid, alpha-GalCer. Here we show that after addition of a lipid extract from a tumor cell line, plate-bound mCD1d molecules stimulated an NKT cell hybridoma. This hybridoma also responded strongly to three purified phospholipids, but failed to recognize alpha-GalCer. Seven of sixteen other mCD1d restricted hybridomas also showed a response to certain purified phospholipids. These findings suggest NKT cells can recognize cellular antigens distinct from alpha-GalCer and identify phospholipids as potential self-antigens presented by mCD1d.","4672":"While the critical role of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) in the microbicidal activity of polymorphonuclear granulocytes is well established, the function of the nonoxidative effector mechanisms in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that mice deficient in the neutrophil granule serine proteases elastase and\/or cathepsin G are susceptible to fungal infections, despite normal neutrophil development and recruitment. The protease deficiencies but not the absence of ROI leads to enhanced resistance to the lethal effects of endotoxin LPS, although normal levels of TNFalpha are produced. The data demonstrate a critical role of the nonoxidative effector mechanisms of neutrophils in host immunity and immunopathology and identify elastase and cathepsin G as effectors in the endotoxic shock cascade downstream of TNFalpha.","4673":"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are defined by self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potentials. In order to uncover the genetic program of HSC, we utilized high-density arrays to compare gene expression in highly purified mouse HSC and their mature progeny. One molecule specifically expressed in immature cells is CD27, a member of the TNF receptor family previously shown to play roles in lymphoid proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We show here that the CD27 protein is expressed by about 90% of cells in a purified HSC population. Interestingly, the CD27pos cells are enriched for cells with short-term hematopoietic activities (colony forming potential in vivo and in vitro), while the minority CD27neg population is more effective in clonal long-term transplantation.","4674":"We have proposed that glucocorticoids antagonize TCR-mediated activation and influence which TCR avidities result in positive or negative selection. We now analyze the immune response of mice whose thymocytes express antisense transcripts to the glucocorticoid receptor (TKO mice). TKO mice responded normally to the complex antigen PPD but were proliferative nonresponders to pigeon cytochrome c 81-104 (PCC), having a large decrease in the frequency of PCC-responsive CD4+ T cells. Unlike wild-type T cells, few TKO T cells in PCC-specific cell lines expressed V alpha11+Vbeta3+. Furthermore, for naive CD4+ T cells from unimmunized TKO mice, the frequencies of many of the molecular features common to the CDR3 regions of PCC-responsive V alpha11+Vbeta3+ cells were substantially decreased. Thus, thymocyte glucocorticoid hyporesponsiveness resulted in loss of cells capable of responding to PCC, corresponding to an antigen-specific \"hole\" in the T cell repertoire.","4675":"Targeted mutation of TGFbeta1 in mice demonstrated that TGFbeta1 is one of the key negative regulators of immune homeostasis, as its absence leads to activation of a self-targeted immune response. Nevertheless, because of the highly pleiotropic properties of TGFbeta and the presence of TGFbeta receptors on most cell types, its biologic role in the regulation of immune homeostasis is not yet understood. To limit the consequences of TGFbeta effects to a single cell type, we developed a transgenic approach to abrogate the TGFbeta response in key immune cells. Specifically, we expressed a dominant-negative TGFbeta receptor type II under a T cell-specific promoter and created a mouse model where signaling by TGFbeta is blocked specifically in T cells. Using this transgenic model, we show that T cell homeostasis requires TGFbeta signaling in T cells.","4676":"Downregulation of the TCR complex is believed to be intimately tied to T cell activation, allowing serial triggering of receptors and desensitization of stimulated cells. We studied transfected and transgenic T cells expressing CD3zeta chimeras to demonstrate that ligand engagement of the TCR or chimeras causes comodulation of nonengaged receptors. Comodulation required protein tyrosine kinase activity but not trans-phosphorylation of nonengaged receptors. The TCR appears to be downregulated by at least two mechanisms. One mechanism requires direct engagement, independent of signaling. The second requires signaling and downregulates nontriggered receptors. These results shed new light on the process of TCR downregulation and indicate that the number of downregulated TCRs cannot be assumed to equal the number of engaged receptors.","4677":"Vav and PKCtheta play an early and important role in the TCR\/CD28-induced stimulation of MAP kinases and activation of the IL-2 gene. Vav is also essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and TCR capping. Here, we report that PKCtheta function was selectively required in a Vav signaling pathway that mediates the TCR\/CD28-induced activation of JNK and the IL-2 gene and the upregulation of CD69 expression. Vav also promoted PKCtheta translocation from the cytosol to the membrane and cytoskeleton and induced its enzymatic activation in a CD3\/CD28-initiated pathway that was dependent on Rac and on actin cytoskeleton reorganization. These findings reveal that the Vav\/Rac pathway promotes the recruitment of PKCtheta to the T cell synapse and its activation, essential processes for T cell activation and IL-2 production.","4678":"Previously, we described AGM-derived endothelial cell lines that either inhibited or permitted the development of erythroid or B cells. We utilized a differential gene expression method to isolate a chemokine, termed WECHE, from one of these cell lines. WECHE inhibited the formation of erythroid cells but had no effect on either myeloid or B cell formation. WECHE repressed BFU-E development from either mouse fetal liver or bone marrow progenitor cells but had no effect on colony formation induced by IL-3 or IL-7. WECHE reduced HPP-CFC production from fetal liver-derived stem cells. WECHE hindered the growth of yolk sac-derived endothelial cells. WECHE was also chemotactic for bone marrow cells. Thus, WECHE is a novel chemokine that regulates hematopoietic differentiation.","4679":"Interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4) plays an important role in immunoregulatory gene expression in B and T lymphocytes and is also highly expressed in human T cell leukemia virus type 1 infected cells. In this study, we characterize a novel interaction between IRF-4 and the FK506-binding protein 52 (FKBP52), a 59 kDa member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (PPIase). IRF-4-FKBP52 association inhibited IRF4-PU.1 binding to the immunoglobulin light chain enhancer E(lambda2-4) as well as IRF-4-PU.1 transactivation, effects that were dependent on functional PPIase activity. FKBP52 association also resulted in a structural modification of IRF-4, detectable by immunoblot analysis and by IRF-4 partial proteolysis. These results demonstrate a novel posttranslational mechanism of transcriptional control, mediated through the interaction of an immunophilin with a transcriptional regulator.","4680":"","4681":"By stimulating human lymphocytes with an autologous renal carcinoma, we obtained CTL recognizing an antigen derived from a novel, ubiquitous protein. The CTL failed to lyse autologous EBV-transformed B cells, even though the latter express the protein. This is due to the presence in these cells of immunoproteasomes, which, unlike standard proteasomes, cannot produce the antigenic peptide. We show that dendritic cells also carry immunoproteasomes and fail to present this antigen. This may explain why the relevant CTL escape thymic deletion and are not regularly activated in the periphery. Lack of cleavage by the immunoproteasome was also observed for melanoma differentiation antigen Melan-A26-35\/HLA-A2, currently used for antitumoral vaccination. For immunization with such antigens, proteins should be less suitable than peptides, which do not require proteasome digestion in dendritic cells.","4682":"We generated a series of knockin mouse lines, in which the cytokine receptor gp130-dependent STAT3 and\/or SHP2 signals were disrupted, by replacing the mouse gp130 gene with human gp130 mutant cDNAs. The SHP2 signal-deficient mice (gp130F759\/F759 were born normal but displayed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and an enhanced acute phase reaction. In contrast, the STAT3 signal-deficient mice (gp130FXQ\/FXXQ) died perinatally, like the gp130-deficient mice (gp130D\/D). The gp130F759\/F759 mice showed prolonged gp130-induced STAT3 activation, indicating a negative regulatory role for SHP2. Th1-type cytokine production and IgG2a and IgG2b production were increased in the gp130F759\/F759 mice, while they were decreased in the gp130FXXQ\/FXXQ immune system. These results indicate that the balance of positive and negative signals generated through gp130 regulates the immune responses.","4683":"Following influenza virus infection, the numbers of mouse TCD8+ cells responding to five different determinants vary more than 50-fold in primary responses but less so in secondary responses. Surprisingly, each determinant elicits a highly diverse and highly sensitive TCD8+ response. Inefficient antigen processing by virus-infected cells accounts for the poor immunogenicity of just one of the subdominant determinants. Overexpressing class I-peptide complexes using vaccinia virus revealed that the poor immunogenicity of two subdominant determinants reflects limitations in T cell responses unrelated to TCR diversity or sensitivity. Despite greatly enhanced expression, the immunodominant determinant is actually less immunogenic when overexpressed by vaccinia virus. Immunodominance is also modulated by determinant-specific variations in the capacity of TCD8+ to suppress responses to other determinants.","4684":"We have identified a type II Ca2+-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity, exclusively expressed by Langerhans cells (LC), and named Langerin. LC are uniquely characterized by Birbeck granules (BG), which are organelles consisting of superimposed and zippered membranes. Here, we have shown that Langerin is constitutively associated with BG and that antibody to Langerin is internalized into these structures. Remarkably, transfection of Langerin cDNA into fibroblasts created a compact network of membrane structures with typical features of BG. Langerin is thus a potent inducer of membrane superimposition and zippering leading to BG formation. Our data suggest that induction of BG is a consequence of the antigen-capture function of Langerin, allowing routing into these organelles and providing access to a nonclassical antigen-processing pathway.","4685":"AIDS and the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) are severe combined immunodeficiencies. BLS results from mutations in genes that regulate the expression of class II major histocompatibility (MHC II) determinants. One of these is the class II transactivator (CIITA). HIV and its transcriptional transactivator (Tat) also block the expression of MHC II genes. By binding to the same surface in the cyclin T1, which together with CDK9 forms the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, Tat inhibits CIITA. CIITA can also activate transcription when tethered artificially to RNA. Moreover, a dominant-negative CDK9 protein inhibits the activity of MHC II promoters. Thus, CIITA is a novel cellular coactivator that binds to P-TEFb for the expression of its target genes.","4686":"B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) are glycoproteins expressed on antigen-presenting cells. The binding of these molecules to the T cell homodimers CD28 and CTLA-4 (CD152) generates costimulatory and inhibitory signals in T cells, respectively. The crystal structure of the extracellular region of B7-1 (sB7-1), solved to 3 A resolution, consists of a novel combination of two Ig-like domains, one characteristic of adhesion molecules and the other previously seen only in antigen receptors. In the crystal lattice, sB7-1 unexpectedly forms parallel, 2-fold rotationally symmetric homodimers. Analytical ultracentrifugation reveals that sB7-1 also dimerizes in solution. The structural data suggest a mechanism whereby the avidity-enhanced binding of B7-1 and CTLA-4 homodimers, along with the relatively high affinity of these interactions, favors the formation of very stable inhibitory signaling complexes.","4687":"Using immunoglobulin heavy chain transgenic mice, we show that B cell clones reaching the long-lived pool are heterogeneous: some are enriched in the CD21(high) compartment (mostly marginal zone [MZ]), others reside primarily in the follicles (FO). Altering the composition of the B cell receptor through N region additions decreases the rate of clonal production and the MZ enrichment. This process can be recapitulated by purified CD21(low) B cells and is due to a preferential clonal survival that requires a functional btk tyrosine kinase. We also show that generation of the MZ population is dependent on CD19. These findings suggest that the MZ B cell repertoire is positively selected and have functional implications for antigenic responses effected by B cells from this microenvironment.","4688":"The initial source of IL-4-inducing Th2 development and the mechanism of stable Th2 commitment remain obscure. We found the reduced level of IL-4 production in Stat6-deficient T cells to be significantly higher than in Th1 controls. Using a novel cell surface affinity matrix technique, we found that IL-4-secreting Stat6-deficient T cells stably expressed GATA-3 and Th2 phenotype. Introducing GATA-3 into Stat6-deficient T cells completely restored Th2 development, inducing c-Maf, Th2-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in the IL-4 locus, and Th2 cytokine expression. The fact that GATA-3 fully reconstitutes Th2 development in Stat6-deficient T cells indicates it is a master switch in Th2 development. Finally, GATA-3 exerts Stat6-independent autoactivation, creating a feedback pathway stabilizing Th2 commitment.","4689":"E2A, HEB, E2-2, and daughterless are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that play key roles in multiple developmental pathways. The DNA binding activity of E2A, HEB, and E2-2 is regulated by a distinct class of inhibitor HLH proteins, the Id gene products. Here, we show that Id3 is required for major histocompatability (MHC) class I- and class II-restricted thymocyte positive selection. Additionally, H-Y TCR-mediated negative selection is severely perturbed in Id3 null mutant mice. Finally, we show that E2A and Id3 interact genetically to regulate thymocyte development. These observations identify the HLH inhibitory protein Id3 as an essential component required for proper thymocyte maturation.","4690":"The MAP kinase (MAPK) p38 plays a key role in regulating inflammatory responses. Here, we demonstrate that beta1 integrin ligation on human NK cells results in the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which is required for integrin-triggered IL-8 production. In addition, we identified some of the upstream events accompanying the beta1 integrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation, namely, the activation of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) p95 Vav, the small G protein Rac1, and the cytoplasmic kinases Pak1 and MKK3. Finally, we provide direct evidence that p95 Vav and Rac control the activation of p38 MAPK triggered by beta1 integrins.","4691":"","4692":"The tumor necrosis factor family molecule Ox40-ligand (Ox40L) has been identified as a potential costimulatory molecule and also has been implicated in T cell homing and B cell activation. To ascertain the essential functions of Ox40L, we generated and characterized Ox40L-deficient mice. Mice lacking Ox40L exhibit an impaired contact hypersensitivity response, a dendritic cell-dependent T cell-mediated response, due to defects in T cell priming and cytokine production. In contrast, Ox40L-deficient mice do not have defects in T cell homing or humoral immune responses. In vitro, Ox40L-deficient dendritic cells are defective in costimulating T cell cytokine production. Thus, Ox40L has a critical costimulatory function in vitro and in vivo for dendritic cell:T cell interactions.","4693":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members can induce a context-dependent apoptosis or cell activation. However, the mechanisms by which these opposing programs are selected remain unclear. We show that in T cells, TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B) signaling is dramatically affected by the intracellular mediator RIP, a protein Ser\/Thr kinase required for NF-kappaB activation by TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A). In the presence of RIP, TNFR2 triggers cell death, whereas in the absence of RIP, TNFR2 activates NF-kappaB. RIP is induced during IL2-driven T cell proliferation, and its inhibition reduces susceptibility to TNF-dependent apoptosis. Evidence that signaling outputs are shaped by intracellular constraints helps reconcile conflicting views of TNFR1 and TNFR2 as apoptotic mediators.","4694":"Accumulation of the V(D)J recombinase protein RAG-2 is restricted to G0\/G1 cells by phosphorylation-mediated degradation at the G1-S boundary. Here cyclin A\/CDK2 is shown to oppose RAG-2 accumulation; conversely, RAG-2 is induced by p27Kip1 and related CDK inhibitors. Coinduction of RAG-2 and G1 delay by p27Kip1 is accompanied by strong stimulation of V(D)J recombination. Unexpectedly, induction of RAG-2 accumulation in the absence of G1 delay has no effect on recombination frequency. p27Kip1 may stimulate V(D)J recombination by coordinating accumulation of RAG-2 with prolongation of G1, when nonhomologous end joining is preferentially active. Consistent with this, enforced expression of RAG-2 throughout cell cycle is associated with accumulation of aberrant recombination products reminiscent of those formed in the absence of nonhomologous end joining.","4695":"The induction of apoptosis by death receptors serves to regulate immune responses by eliminating unwanted and harmful cells. Mature lymphocytes express FLICE inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) that block death receptor-induced cell death. Here, we show that both B and T cells downregulate c-FLIP upon activation in vitro. Retrovirus-mediated expression of c-FLIP blocks Fas-induced apoptosis of activated lymphocytes but does not affect cell death resulting from cytokine withdrawal. In vivo, c-FLIP expression results in defective superantigen-mediated elimination of T cells, the accumulation of activated B cells, the production of autoantibodies, and the development of autoimmune disease. No effect was seen on negative selection of thyomocytes. These results suggest that activation-dependent downregulation of c-FLIP renders mature lymphocytes sensitive to death receptor-mediated apoptosis and is required to maintain self-tolerance.","4696":"We investigated the differentiation and trafficking of inflammatory monocytes that phagocytosed subcutaneously injected fluorescent microspheres. As expected, most of the monocytes became microsphere+ macrophages, which remained in subcutaneous tissue. However, about 25% of latex+ cells migrated to the T cell area of draining lymph nodes, where they expressed dendritic cell (DC)-restricted markers and high levels of costimulatory molecules. Microsphere-transporting cells were distinct from resident skin DCs, and this transport was reduced by more than 85% in monocyte-deficient osteopetrotic mice. Thus, a substantial minority of inflammatory monocytes carry phagocytosed particles to lymph nodes and differentiate into DCs.","4697":"The ability to sample relevant intracellular compartments is necessary for effective antigen presentation. To detect peptide antigens, MHC class I and II molecules differentially sample cytosolic and endosomal compartments. CD1 constitutes another lineage of lipid antigen-presenting molecules. We show that CD1b traffics deeply into late endosomal compartments, while CD1a is excluded from these compartments and instead traffics independently in the recycling pathway of the early endocytic system. Further, CD1b but not CD1a antigen presentation is dependent upon vesicular acidification. Since lipids and various bacteria are known to traffic differentially, either penetrating deeply into the endocytic system or following the route of recycling endosomes, these findings elucidate efficient monitoring of distinct components of the endocytic compartment by CD1 lipid antigen-presenting molecules.","4698":"Using a variety of techniques, including limiting dilution assays (LDA), intracellular IFNgamma assays, and Db-IgG1 MHC dimer staining to measure viral peptide-specific T cell number and function, we show here that heterologous virus infections quantitatively delete and qualitatively alter the memory pool of T cells specific to a previously encountered virus. We also show that a prior history of a virus infection can alter the hierarchy of the immunodominant peptide response to a second virus and that virus infections selectively reactivate memory T cells with distinct specificities to earlier viruses. These results are consistent with a model for the immune system that accommodates memory T cell populations for multiple pathogens over the course of a lifetime.","4699":"Viral infection or double-stranded (ds) RNA induce interferons (IFN) and other cytokines. Transcription factors mediating IFN induction are known, but the signaling pathways that regulate them are less clear. We now describe two such pathways. The first pathway leading to NF-kappaB depends on the dsRNA-responsive protein kinase (PKR), which in turn activates IKB kinase (IKK) through the IKKbeta subunit. The second viral-and dsRNA-responsive pathway is PKR independent and involves Jun kinase (JNK) activation leading to stimulation of AP-1. Both IKKbeta and JNK2 are essential for efficient induction of type I IFN and other cytokines in response to viral infection or dsRNA. This study establishes a general role for these kinases in activation of innate immune responses.","4700":"The activation of STAT3 by the cytokine receptor gp130 is required for both the G1 to S cell cycle transition and antiapoptosis. We found that Pim-1 and Pim-2 are targets for the gp130-mediated STAT3 signal. Expression of a kinase-defective Pim-1 mutant attenuated gp130-mediated cell proliferation. Constitutive expression of Pim-1 together with c-myc, another STAT3 target, fully compensated for loss of the STAT3-mediated cell cycle progression, antiapoptosis, and bcl-2 expression. We also identified valosine-containing protein (VCP) as a target gene for the Pim-1-mediated signal. Expression of a mutant VCP led cells to undergo apoptosis. These results indicate that Pim-family proteins play crucial roles in gp130-mediated cell proliferation and explain the synergy between Pim and c-Myc proteins in cell proliferation and lymphomagenesis.","4701":"OX40, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is expressed on activated T cells and implicated in stimulation of T cells and T-dependent humoral responses. We generated OX40-\/- mice and found that the formation of extrafollicular plasma cells, germinal centers, and antibody responses was independent of OX40. After infection with LCMV and influenza virus, OX40-\/- mice retain primary and memory cytotoxic T cell responses with normal expansion and decline of specific CTL. In contrast, CD4+ T cell proliferation and the number of IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells were reduced in OX40-\/- mice. Moreover, the number of CD4+ T cells infiltrating the lungs of influenza virus-infected OX40-\/- mice was reduced. These results define a unique role of OX40 in the generation of optimal CD4+ T cell responses in vivo.","4702":"Stat6 is critical for IL-4-mediated Th2 cell development, but its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we constructed Stat6:ER, a Stat6-estrogen receptor fusion protein that can be activated by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, independently of IL-4 and endogenous Stat6. Retrovirus-mediated introduction of Stat6:ER into developing Th1 cells induced Th2-specific cytokines and suppressed IFNgamma production in a 4-HT-dependent manner and in the absence of IL-4. It also induced GATA-3 and c-maf expression and downregulated IL-12Rbeta2 chain expression. Its decreased ability to induce the Th2 phenotype with progressing Th1 cell commitment correlated with a decreased induction of GATA-3 and c-maf. This study indicates that Stat6 functions upstream of GATA-3 and c-Maf to induce Th2 development.","4703":"Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation, but comprehensive studies of nucleosome positioning, remodeling, and transcription factor binding at inducible mammalian promoters have not been reported. We have analyzed the IL-12 p40 promoter, which is induced in macrophages by bacterial products. High-resolution micrococcal nuclease analyses revealed that a positioned nucleosome, nucleosome 1, spans the promoter, with three positioned nucleosomes further upstream. Upon activation, nucleosome 1 was rapidly and selectively remodeled in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. In primary macrophages, IFNgamma synergistically enhanced p40 expression, but little effect on remodeling or promoter occupancy was observed. These results suggest that remodeling complexes are selectively targeted to a single, promoter-encompassing nucleosome and that IFNgamma influences an event that is independent or downstream of remodeling.","4704":"","4705":"","4706":"","4707":"Interleukin-12 plays a major role in immunity to intracellular pathogens by governing the development of IFNgamma-dependent host resistance. Nevertheless, unregulated IL-12 synthesis can lead to immunopathology, an outcome prevented by the concurrent expression of interleukin-10. Dendritic cells (DC) are an important source of the initial IL-12 stimulated by microbial agents. Here, we show that, following systemic triggering, DC can no longer be restimulated to produce IL-12 in vivo while continuing to respond in vitro. When infected with Toxoplasma gondii during this refractory state, mice mount impaired acute IFNgamma responses and, in the case of IL-10-deficient animals, are protected from cytokine-induced mortality. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized form of immunologic paralysis involving DC that can protect from infection-induced immunopathology.","4708":"We examined dendritic cell (DC) status in SCID and RAG2 -\/- mice to assess the influence of T cells on DC development and function in vivo. These mice have reduced numbers of DC in the epidermis and lymph nodes draining hapten-sensitized skin. Epidermal DC in these mice were defective in presenting antigen in vivo to adoptively transferred, hapten-sensitized T cells from normal mice. Likewise, draining lymph node DC were deficient in their capacity to stimulate naive T cells in vitro and in vivo. DC numbers as well as the impaired ability to present antigen in vivo, were corrected by reconstituting these animals with normal T lymphocytes, suggesting that T cells are crucial for normal DC maturation and function in vivo.","4709":"Whereas ligation of the DNAM-1 adhesion molecule triggers cytotoxicity mediated by normal NK and T cells, this function was defective in NK cell clones from leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome. However, genetic reconstitution of cell surface expression of LFA-1 restored the ability of DNAM-1 to initiate anti-DNAM-1 mAb-induced cytotoxicity, indicating a functional relationship between DNAM-1 and LFA-1. Further studies demonstrated that LFA-1 physically associates with DNAM-1 in NK cells and anti-CD3 mAb stimulated T cells, for which serine phosphorylation of DNAM-1 plays a critical role. In addition, cross-linking of LFA-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of DNAM-1, for which the Fyn protein tyrosine kinase is responsible. These results indicate that DNAM-1 is involved in the LFA-1-mediated intracellular signals.","4710":"LIR-1 is a class I MHC receptor related to natural killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs). Binding of LIR-1 or KIRs to class I molecules results in inhibitory signals. Unlike individual KIRs, LIR-1 recognizes many class I alleles and also binds UL18, a human cytomegalovirus class I MHC homolog. Here, we show that LIR-1 interacts with the relatively nonpolymorphic alpha3 domain of class I proteins and the analogous region of UL18 using its N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain. The &gt;1000-fold higher affinity of LIR-1 for UL18 than for class I illustrates how a viral protein competes with host proteins to subvert the host immune response. LIR-1 recognition of class I molecules resembles the CD4-class II MHC interaction more than the KIR-class I interaction, implying a functional distinction between LIR-1 and KIRs.","4711":"Natural killer cell function is controlled by interaction of NK receptors with MHC I molecules expressed on target cells. We describe the binding of bacterially expressed Ly49A, the prototype murine NK inhibitory receptor, to similarly engineered H-2Dd. Despite its homology to C-type lectins, Ly49A binds independently of carbohydrate and Ca2+ and shows specificity for MHC I but not bound peptide. The affinity of the Ly49A\/H-2Dd interaction as determined by surface plasmon resonance is from 6 to 26 microM at 25 degrees C and is greater by ultracentrifugation at 4 degrees C. Biotinylated Ly49A stains H-2Dd-expressing cells. Competition experiments indicate that the Ly49A and T cell receptor (TCR) binding sites on MHC I are distinct, suggesting complex regulation of cells that bear both TCR and NK cell receptors.","4712":"Although purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are sufficient to engraft irradiated allogeneic recipients, bone marrow (BM) contains other cells that facilitate engraftment. Here, several candidate facilitators were tested by cotransplantation with HSC. Both TCR+ and TCR- CD8alpha+ BM subpopulations have facilitative potential. CD8+TCR+ cells are typical T lymphocytes. CD8+TCR- facilitators are CD3 , not CD3+, have a granular morphology, and are CD8beta- and CD11c+; they share phenotypic characteristics with CD8(alpha)alpha lymphoid dendritic cells and veto cells. We also demonstrate that lytic function is nqt necessary for facilitation and that the CD8alpha molecule is either important for facilitation or in the development of facilitators.","4713":"Recent studies with avian embryos and murine embryonic stem cells have suggested that hematopoietic cells are derived from hemangioblasts, the common precursors of hematopoietic and endothelial cells. We molecularly cloned podocalyxin-like protein 1 (PCLP1) as a novel surface marker for endothelial-like cells in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of mouse embryos, where long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LTR-HSCs) are known to arise. PCLP1+ CD45 cells in the AGM region incorporated acetylated low-density lipoprotein and produced both hematopoietic and endothelial cells when cocultured with OP9 stromal cells. Moreover, multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells were generated in vivo when PCLP1 +CD45-cells were injected into neonatal liver of busulfan-treated mice. Thus, PCLP1 can be used to separate hemangioblasts that give rise to LTR-HSCs.","4714":"We investigated roles of alpha4 integrins during hematopoiesis using mutant and chimeric mice. Yolk sac erythropoiesis and migration of hematopoietic progenitors to fetal liver, spleen, and bone marrow can occur without alpha4 integrins. Although terminal differentiation of these progenitors is possible without alpha4 integrins, these receptors are essential to maintain normal hematopoiesis in fetal liver, spleen, and bone marrow microenvironments. Moreover, alpha4-deficient erythroid progenitors and pre-B cells neither transmigrate beneath the stroma nor expand-properly in vitro. In contrast, alpha4-null cells migrate and differentiate efficiently into T lymphocytes within the thymus. In summary, alpha4 integrins are essential for normal development of all hematopoietic lineages in fetal liver, bone marrow, and spleen, likely by regulating the proliferation\/differentiation balance of hematopoietic progenitors.","4715":"During signal transduction through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), several signaling elements are brought together by the adaptor protein SLP-65. We have investigated the role of SLP-65 in B cell maturation and function in mice deficient for SLP-65. While the mice are viable, B cell development is affected at several stages. SLP-65-deficient mice show increased proportions of pre-B cells in the bone marrow and immature B cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. B1 B cells are lacking. The mice show lower IgM and IgG3 serum titers and poor IgM but normal IgG immune responses. Mutant B cells show reduced Ca2+ mobilization and reduced proliferative responses to B cell mitogens. We conclude that while playing an important role, SLP-65 is not always required for signaling from the BCR.","4716":"To study the function of Ig-alpha in the selection of autoreactive B cells, we have analyzed mb-1 cytoplasmic truncation mutant mice (mb-1delta(c)\/delta(c)), which coexpress transgenes encoding hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and HEL-specific immunoglobulin. We demonstrate that in the presence of soluble HEL (sHEL) and dependent on the mb-1delta(c) mutation, most immature B cells bearing the HEL-specific Ig transgene undergo rearrangements of endogenous kappa light chains, resulting in loss of HEL specificity. Moreover, immature B cells from Ig-alpha mutant mice respond to BCR cross-linking with an exaggerated and prolonged calcium response and induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data imply a negative signaling role for Ig-alpha in immature B cells.","4717":"The development of B cells requires the expression of an antigen receptor at distinct points during maturation. The Ig-alpha\/beta heterodimer signals for these receptors, and mice harboring a truncation of the Ig-alpha intracellular domain (mb-1(delta(c)\/delta(c)) have severely reduced peripheral B cell numbers. Here we report that immature mb-1(delta(c)\/delta(c) B cells are activated despite lacking a critical Ig-alpha-positive signaling motif. As a consequence of abnormal activation, transitional immature IgMhighIgDlow B cells are largely absent in mb-1delta(c)\/delta(c) mutants, accounting for the paucity of mature B cells. Thus, Ig-alpha cytoplasmic tail truncation yields an antigen receptor complex on immature B cells that signals constitutively. These data illustrate a role for Ig-alpha in negatively regulating antigen receptor signaling during B cell development.","4718":"Targeted disruption of either of the B cell-specific transcription factors Oct-2 or OCA-B\/BOB-1\/OBF-1 dramatically affects B cell terminal differentiation. The 3' enhancer of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus is important for transcription of the locus in terminal plasma cells. Allele-specific suppression of mutant Oct-2 binding sites in this enhancer by a variant Oct-2 protein revealed that in a mature B cell line this enhancer was specifically dependent upon Oct-2, as contrasted to the closely related Oct-1 transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the Oct-2 protein was important for this activation and was synergistic for coactivation by the OCA-B factor. These results indicate that Oct-2 and OCA-B interact with the 3' enhancer in regulation of the IgH locus during B cell activation.","4719":"","4720":"","4721":"CD72, a B cell surface protein of the C-type lectin superfamily, recruits the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 through its ITIM motif(s). Using CD72-deficient (CD72-\/-) mice, we demonstrate that CD72 is a nonredundant regulator of B cell development. In the bone marrow of CD72-\/- mice, there was a reduction in the number of mature recirculating B cells and an accumulation of pre-B cells. In the periphery of CD72-\/- mice, there were fewer mature B-2 cells and more B-1 cells. In addition, CD72 is a negative regulator of B cell activation, as CD72-\/- B cells were hyperproliferative in response to various stimuli and showed enhanced kinetics in their intracellular Ca2+ response following IgM cross-linking.","4722":"A tumor-specific CD8+ T cell response was studied using adoptive transfer of OT-I TCR transgenic cells. Upon i.p. challenge with E.G7 tumor, OT-I cells undergo CD4+ T cell-independent expansion at the tumor site and develop lytic function. Before tumor elimination, however, they leave the peritoneal cavity (PC) and appear in the LN and spleen where they exhibit \"split anergy\" and cannot further proliferate to antigen. Administering anti-CTLA-4 mAb early caused sustained OT-1 expansion in the PC, and late administration caused the OT-I cells to return to the PC and further expand; in both cases, tumor was controlled. These effects required CD4+ T cells and IL-2 and appear to result from reversal of the nonresponsive state of the CD8+ T cells.","4723":"The cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, secreted by Th2 cells, have distinct functions in the pathogenesis of asthma. We have previously shown that the transcription factor GATA-3 is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells. However, it was unclear whether GATA-3 controls the expression of all Th2 cytokines. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of GATA-3 in mice in a T cell-specific fashion led to a reduction in the levels of all the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Airway eosinophilia, mucus production, and IgE synthesis, all key features of asthma, were severely attenuated in the transgenic mice. Thus, targeting GATA-3 activity alone is sufficient to blunt Th2 responses in vivo, thereby establishing GATA-3 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of asthma and allergic diseases.","4724":"Targeted immune regulation can be achieved by use of tissue-specific T cells and offers the potential for organ-specific suppression of destructive autoimmune processes. Here, we report the generation and characterization of insulin B chain-specific \"autoreactive\" CD4+ regulatory T cells that locally suppress diabetogenic T cell responses against an unrelated self-antigen (viral transgene) in a virus-induced model for type 1 diabetes. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is essential for prevention of diabetes since regulatory T cells cannot be induced in the absence of IL-4 or stat6 (IL-4 signaling pathway). Our observations demonstrate that autoreactive regulatory T cells can suppress autoreactive destructive T cell activity of differential antigenic specificity locally in the pancreatic draining lymph node, probably via cytokine-mediated modulation of antigen-presenting cells.","4725":"Mice expressing hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) as a transgene are unresponsive to immunization with the HEL protein. Profound tolerance was found even in situations where the amounts of l-A(k)-peptide complexes was 100 or less per APC. Among the few T cells that escaped tolerance, we did not observe differential responses to the different HEL epitopes, perhaps because of the very high sensitivity of the negative selection process. The same HEL transgenic mice that did not respond to HEL responded to immunization with the 46-61 peptide of HEL. These peptide-specific T cells that escaped negative selection belonged to a set that reacted with a particular conformer of the HEL peptide-l-A(k) (type B). The presence of type B reactive T cells should be considered in autoimmunity.","4726":"Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 are implicated in the recognition of various bacterial cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To investigate in vivo roles of TLR2, we generated TLR2-deficient mice. In contrast to LPS unresponsiveness in TLR4-deficient mice, TLR2-deficient mice responded to LPS to the same extent as wild-type mice. TLR2-deficient macrophages were hyporesponsive to several Gram-positive bacterial cell walls as well as Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan. TLR4-deficient macrophages lacked the response to Gram-positive lipoteichoic acids. These results demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR4 recognize different bacterial cell wall components in vivo and TLR2 plays a major role in Gram-positive bacterial recognition.","4727":"Families of clonally expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-specific receptors provide specificity to and regulate the function of natural killer (NK) cells. One of these receptors, mouse Ly49A, is expressed by 20% of NK cells and inhibits the killing of H-2D(d) but not D(b)-expressing target cells. Here, we show that the trans-acting factor TCF-1 binds to two sites in the Ly49A promoter and regulates its activity. Moreover, we find that TCF-1 determines the size of the Ly49A NK cell subset in vivo in a dosage-dependent manner. We propose that clonal Ly49A acquisition during NK cell development is regulated by TCF-1.","4728":"In a screen to identify genes induced by NF-kappaB\/Rel transcription factors, we cloned a novel gene, b7h, that is a close homolog of B7 costimulatory ligands expressed on antigen-presenting cells. B7h can costimulate proliferation of purified T cells through a receptor on T cells distinct from CD28 or CTLA-4. Surprisingly, although B7h is expressed in unstimulated B cells, its expression is induced in both 3T3 cells and embryonic fibroblasts treated with TNFalpha, and it is upregulated in nonlymphoid tissues of mice treated with LPS, a potent activator of TNFalpha. These data define a novel costimulatory ligand for T cells and suggest that induction of B7h by TNFalpha may function as a mechanism to directly augment recognition of self during inflammation.","4729":"T cell activation requires engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) at the interface of conjugates formed with antigen-presenting cells. TCR engagement is accompanied by a redistribution of specific signaling molecules to the cytoplasmic region of the TCR complex. In this study, immunocytochemistry and live cell fluorescence imaging demonstrate that T cell MEK kinase 2 (MEKK2) is translocated to the T cell\/antigen-presenting cell interface in response to antigen activation. MEKK2 translocation occurs more rapidly as the antigen concentration is increased. Biochemical activation of MEKK2 follows TCR stimulation, and expression of a dominant-negative MEKK2 inhibits TCR-mediated conjugate stabilization and ERK and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Live cell fluorescence imaging thus enables characterization of signal transducers that are dynamically translocated following TCR engagement.","4730":"Naive Itk-deficient CD4+ T cells were unable to establish stable IL-4 production, even when primed in Th2-inducing conditions. In contrast, IFNgamma production was little affected. Failure to express IL-4 occurred even among cells that had gone through multiple cell divisions and was associated with a delay in the kinetics and magnitude of NFATc nuclear localization. IL-4 production was restored genetically by retroviral reconstitution of Itk or biochemically by augmenting the calcium flux with ionomycin. In vivo, Itk-deficient mice were unable to establish functional Th2 cells. Development of protective Th1 cells was unimpeded. These data define a nonredundant role for Itk in modulating signals from the TCR\/CD28 pathways that are specific for the establishment of stable IL-4 but not IFNgamma expression.","4731":"","4732":"Inhibition of T cell activation can be mediated by analogs of the original antigenic peptide (TCR antagonists). Here, a T cell clone expressing two distinct TCR was used to investigate whether such inhibition involves an active mechanism by examining whether an antagonist for one TCR could influence responses stimulated by the other TCR engaging its agonist. Our results demonstrate functional cross-inhibition under these conditions involving the ability of antagonist: TCR interactions to diminish Lck enzymatic activity associated with the agonist-recognizing second TCR, apparently through enhancement of SHP-1 association with these receptors. Our findings reveal that inhibition of cellular responses by antagonists arises at least in part from active negative regulation of proximal TCR signaling and identify elements of the biochemical process.","4733":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) can interact with various members of the TNF receptor family. Previously, we reported that TRAF2-deficient mice die prematurely and have elevated serum TNF levels. In this study, we demonstrate that TRAF2-deficient macrophages produce increased amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF in response to TNF stimulation. Furthermore, we could enhance the survival of TRAF2-deficient mice by eliminating either TNF or TNFR1. Using these double-knockout mice, we show that in the absence of TRAF2, the T helper-dependent antibody response, CD40-mediated proliferation, and NF-kappaB activation are defective. These data demonstrate two important roles of TRAF2, one as a negative regulator of certain TNFR1 signals and the other as a positive mediator of CD40 signaling.","4734":"Cellular interactions are critical for the regulation of hematopoiesis. The sialomucin PSGL-1\/CD162 mediates the attachment of mature leukocytes to P-selectin. We now show that PSGL-1 also functions as the sole receptor for P-selectin on primitive human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). More importantly, ligation of PSGL-1 by immobilized or soluble ligand or anti-PSGL-1 antibody results in a profound suppression of HPC proliferation stimulated by potent combinations of early acting hematopoietic growth factors. These data demonstrate an unanticipated but extremely marked growth-inhibitory effect of P-selectin on hematopoiesis and provide direct evidence that PSGL-1, in addition to its well-documented role as an adhesion molecule on mature leukocytes, is a potent negative regulator of human hematopoietic progenitors.","4735":"IL-18, produced as a biologically inactive precursor, is processed by caspase-1 in LPS-activated macrophages. Here, we investigated caspase-1-independent processing of IL-18 in Fas ligand (FasL)-stimulated macrophages and its involvement in liver injury. Administration of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) upregulated functional Fas expression on macrophages in an IFNgamma-dependent manner, and these macrophages became competent to secrete mature IL-18 upon stimulation with FasL. This was also the case for caspase-1-deficient mice. Administration of recombinant soluble FasL (rFasL) after P. acnes priming induced comparable elevation of serum IL-18 in parallel with elevated serum liver enzyme levels. However, liver injury was not induced in IL-18-deficient mice after rFasL administration. These results indicate a caspase-1-independent pathway of IL-18 secretion from FasL-stimulated macrophages and its critical involvement in FasL-induced liver injury.","4736":"Due to their ubiquitous distribution and high degree of structural similarity, heat shock proteins (hsp) are potential target antigens in autoimmune diseases. Here, we describe induction of intestinal inflammation following transfer of hsp60-reactive CD8 T cells into mice. Inflammatory reactions were MHC class I dependent and developed primarily in the small intestine. IFN gamma and TNF alpha, as well as gut-derived hsp60, were elevated at sites of T cell infiltration. Intestinal lesions were drastically reduced in mice lacking receptors for TNF alpha. Pathology also developed in germ-free mice, indicating recognition of host-derived hsp60 by CD8 T cells. This report demonstrates that CD8 T cells with defined antigen specificity cause intestinal inflammation, emphasizing a link between infection and autoimmune disease.","4737":"CD40 plays a critical role in survival, growth, differentiation, and class switching of B lymphocytes. Although Ku is required for immunoglobulin class switching, how CD40 signal transduction is coupled to Ku is still unknown. Here, we show that CD40 directly interacts with Ku through the membrane-proximal region of cytoplasmic CD40. Ku was confined to the cytoplasm in human primary B cells, and the engagement of CD40 on the B cells cultured in the presence of IL-4 resulted in the dissociation of Ku from CD40, translocation of Ku into the nucleus, and increase in the activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase. These findings indicate that Ku is involved in the CD40 signal transduction pathway and may play an important role in the CD40-mediated events.","4738":"We found that two distinct antibody maturation pathways exist in the immune response of C57BL\/6 mice to (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl and that the junctional amino acid introduced by a process far preceding somatic hypermutation determined the pathway of affinity maturation. Antibodies belonging to each pathway clearly separated into two separate branches of a phylogenic tree. We also constructed a three-dimensional fitness landscape for antibody evolution by introducing the association constants of the antibodies into the phylogenic tree as the third axis, allowing us to comprehend the significance of junctional diversity in the \"evolvability\" of antibodies. Thermodynamic analyses of the antigen-antibody interactions suggested that a high conformational versatility in the antigen-combining site allows for the enhanced evolvability of antibodies.","4739":"PCR analyses of the kappaL chain locus in single B-lineage cells of wild-type, Ckappa-, or JCkappa-deficient homozygous or heterozygous mice often detect multiple in- and out-of-frame rearrangements at the kappaL and lambdaL loci. They are most frequent in small pre-BII cells and equally so in wild-type and kappaL chain-deficient cells. Hence, kappaL chain production appears not to inhibit secondary rearrangements. Around 20% of all small preBII cells express IgL chains in their cytoplasm. Cells with a first productive rearrangement on one allele are favored to enter the immature B cell compartment. Thus, allelic exclusion might be secured by control of accessibility of IgL chain loci for rearrangement and by rapid selection of cells with a fitting over those with a nonfitting IgL chain.","4740":"Single cell PCR assays have been further developed that detect over 80% of all VkappaJkappa, VkappaRS, and VlambdaJlambda rearrangements at efficiencies between 70% and 90%. These IgL chain gene rearrangement assays were used with small pre-BII cells that develop in comparably high numbers in the bone marrow of wild-type, Ckappa-deficient, and JCkappa-deficient homozygous and heterozygous mice. In all of these mice, only 15%-25% of all small pre-BII cells carry VlambdaJlambda rearrangements. These results confirm that lambdaL chain gene rearrangements occur independently of kappaL chain gene rearrangement and expression. They also show that a large part of the small pre-BII cells that express the rearrangement machinery can develop without IgL chain gene rearrangements.","4741":"Notch receptors regulate fate decisions in many cells. One outcome of Notch signaling is differentiation of bipotential precursors into one cell type versus another. To investigate consequences of Notch1 expression in hematolymphoid progenitors, mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) transduced with retroviruses encoding a constitutively active form of Notch1. Although neither granulocyte or monocyte differentiation were appreciably affected, lymphopoiesis was dramatically altered. As early as 3 weeks following transplantation, mice receiving activated Notch1-transduced BM contained immature CD4+ CD8+ T cells in the BM and exhibited a simultaneous block in early B cell lymphopoiesis. These results suggest that Notch1 provides a key regulatory signal in determining T lymphoid versus B lymphoid lineage decisions, possibly by influencing lineage commitment from a common lymphoid progenitor cell.","4742":"IL-2 is an important growth and survival factor for T lymphocytes but also sensitizes these cells to Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD). The molecular basis of these different effects of IL-2 was studied by introducing wild-type and mutant forms of the IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2Rbeta) chain that lacked specific signaling capacities into receptor-deficient T cells by retroviral gene transfer. Activation of Stat5 by IL-2 was found to be involved in T cell proliferation and promoted Fas ligand (FasL) expression and AICD. T cell survival was dependent on a receptor region that activated Akt and the expression of Bcl-2. Thus, distinct IL-2Rbeta chain signaling modules regulate T cell fate by stimulating growth and survival or by promoting apoptosis.","4743":"Single cell studies have identified intraclonal heterogeneity of cytokine production by activated T cells. To investigate implications of cytokine heterogeneity for cell fate, an interleukin (IL)-2 promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter transgenic model was developed to track IL-2+ and IL-2- T cells during differentiation from naive precursors. Antigen-activated IL-2+ and IL-2- cells had comparable proliferative capacities in primary responses. However, T cells that expressed IL-2 in primary responses demonstrated enhanced antigenic sensitivity and increased expression of effector cytokines in secondary responses in vitro and in vivo. Thus, heterogeneity of activation during a primary response translates into heterogeneous secondary responses, in which enhanced memory\/effector function is linked to cells that previously exceeded an activation threshold associated with IL-2 gene transcription.","4744":"","4745":"TRAIL is a newly identified cytokine belonging to the large tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. TRAIL is a novel molecule inducing apoptosis in a wide variety of tumor cells but not in normal cells. To help in elucidating its biological roles and designing mutants with improved therapeutic potential, we have determined the crystal structure of human TRAIL. The structure reveals that a unique frame insertion of 12-16 amino acids adopts a salient loop structure penetrating into the receptor-binding site. The loop drastically alters the common receptor-binding surface of the TNF family most likely for the specific recognition of cognate partners. A structure-based mutagenesis study demonstrates a critical role of the insertion loop in the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL.","4746":"The antigen processing pathway generates the peptides displayed by MHC I molecules on the cell surface. Whether these peptides are generated in the cytosol or from longer intermediates transported into the ER is unclear, because peptides other than those bound to MHC I have been difficult to find. Using a novel assay, we show that N-terminally extended antigenic analogs were associated with high-molecular weight material in the cytosol and were transported by TAP. In the ER, a nonapeptide was predominant that was converted to the final octapeptide only in presence of the appropriate MHC I molecule. The existence of extended peptides and their MHC I-dependent trimming suggest a mechanism for efficiently satisfying the distinct sequence preferences of polymorphic MHC I molecules.","4747":"Lateral diffusion of GFP-tagged H2Ld molecules in the ER membrane reports on their interaction with the TAP complex during synthesis and peptide loading. Peptide-loaded H2Ld molecules diffuse rapidly, near the theoretical limit for proteins in a bilayer. However, these molecules are retained in the ER for some time after assembly. H2Ld molecules, associated with the TAP complex, diffuse slowly, as does GFP-tagged TAP1. This implies that the association of H2Ld molecules with the TAP complex is stable for at least several minutes. It also suggests that the TAP complex is very large, perhaps containing hundreds of proteins.","4748":"The activation and subsequent proliferation of peripheral T cells requires the engagement of the T cell and a cytokine receptor, typically the IL-2 or IL-4 receptors. Critical to understanding the regulation of peripheral T cells is the knowledge of the unique contributions of each receptor to full T cell activation and cell cycle progression. Mice deficient in Stat5a and Stat5b have demonstrated the essential role that these highly related proteins play in cell cycle progression following peripheral T cell activation. Here we demonstrate that activation of the Stat5 proteins by tyrosine phosphorylation is uniquely contributed by cytokine receptor signaling and specifically does not occur through the T cell receptor complex.","4749":"IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) plays critical roles in lymphocyte development by promoting survival and proliferation and by inducing V(D)J recombination in TCR and Ig loci. Here, we demonstrate that IL-7R-activated Stat5 binds to consensus motifs in the 5' regions of Jgamma segments and induces germline transcripts. We also show that a constitutively active form of Stat5 restores V-J recombination of TCRgamma genes and partially rescues T cell development from IL-7R(-\/-) T cell precursors, especially in favor of gammadelta T cells. Therefore, this study reveals a potential role of Stat5 in T cell development and also implies that IL-7R may control the accessibility of the TCRgamma locus through Stat5-induced germline transcription.","4750":"We generated mice in which a functional RAG2:GFP fusion gene is knocked in to the endogenous RAG2 locus. In bone marrow and thymus, RAG2:GFP expression occurs in appropriate stages of developing B and T cells as well as in immature bone marrow IgM+ B cells. RAG2:GFP also is expressed in IgD+ B cells following cross-linking of IgM on immature IgM+ IgD+ B cells generated in vitro. RAG2:GFP expression is undetectable in most immature splenic B cells; however, in young RAG2:GFP mice, there are substantial numbers of splenic RAG2:GFP+ cells that mostly resemble pre-B cells. The latter population decreases in size with age but reappears following immunization of older RAG2:GFP mice. We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of receptor assembly and diversification.","4751":"CD19 and CD22 are B lymphocyte cell-surface molecules that positively and negatively regulate antigen receptor signal transduction, respectively. Biochemical studies with B cells from CD19-deficient and CD22-deficient mice indicated that these two regulatory molecules influenced each other's functions: CD22 expression negatively regulated CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation, while optimal CD22 function was dependent on CD19 expression. Functional CD19 and CD22 interactions were also assessed in vivo by generating CD19\/CD22 double-deficient mice. Remarkably, the CD19 mutation was dominant to the CD22 mutation in most instances. B lymphocytes from CD19\/CD22-deficient and CD19-deficient mice were functionally equivalent despite the negative influence normally provided by CD22 expression. These data collectively suggest that CD19 activates the CD22\/SHP1 inhibitory pathway that then acts primarily on CD19.","4752":"In the absence of thymic emigration, the peripheral T cell pool is maintained by division of mature lymphocytes. We have examined the molecular interactions required for peripheral CD8+ T cell expansion in lymphopenic mice without conventional antigenic stimulation. Expansion of CD8+ T cells in lymphopenic hosts was found to be peptide specific. An antagonist peptide known to serve as a ligand for positive selection of these T cells promoted expansion; however, a control peptide that binds the same class I molecule did not. Surprisingly, the cells undergoing proliferation in lymphopenic hosts did not mature to cytotoxic effectors and displayed a partially activated surface phenotype. These data suggest that division of T cells in the periphery of lymphopenic hosts requires specific recognition of self-peptide\/MHC complexes, similar to the signal for thymocyte maturation.","4753":"Positive selection to self-MHC\/peptide complexes has long been viewed as a device for skewing the T cell repertoire toward recognition of foreign peptides presented by self-MHC molecules. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative possibility, namely, that the self-peptides controlling positive selection in the thymus serve to maintain the longevity of mature T cells in the periphery. Surprisingly, when total T cell numbers are reduced, these self-ligands become overtly stimulatory and cause naive T cells to proliferate and undergo homeostatic expansion.","4754":"The in vivo differentiation of CD4 T cells from naive to memory cells was followed after their adoptive transfer together with syngeneic dendritic cells into MHC mismatched adoptive hosts lacking lymphocytes and NK cells. Functional and molecular changes were measured as the antigenic stimulus, provided by the cotransferred dendritic cells, disappeared. Memory cells as opposed to effector cells show an inversion in the relative expression of Bcl-2 family members in favor of antiapoptotic molecules, and compared with naive cells they have an increased ratio of bcl-xL to bcl-2. They differ qualitatively from naive T cells, suggesting that accelerated CD4 memory responses can occur without the need for increased frequencies of specific T cells.","4755":"To investigate the specificity of cytokine signals in hematopoietic differentiation, we generated mice with a targeted mutation of their G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) such that the cytoplasmic (signaling) domain of the G-CSFR is replaced with the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor. In homozygous mutant mice, expression of this chimeric receptor had no apparent affect on lineage commitment and was able to support the production of morphologically mature neutrophils. However, mutant neutrophils displayed reduced chemotaxis, and G-CSF-stimulated mobilization of neutrophils and hematopoietic progenitors from the bone marrow to blood was markedly impaired. Thus, the G-CSFR is generating unique signals that are required for certain specialized hematopoietic cell functions but are not required for granulocytic differentiation or lineage commitment.","4756":"PD-1, a 55 kDa transmembrane protein containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, is induced in lymphocytes and monocytic cells following activation. Aged C57BL\/6(B6)-PD-1(-\/-) congenic mice spontaneously developed characteristic lupus-like proliferative arthritis and glomerulonephritis with predominant IgG3 deposition, which were markedly accelerated by introduction of a Fas mutation (lpr). Introduction of a PD-1 null mutation into the 2C-TCR (anti-H-2Ld) transgenic mice of the H-2(b\/d) background resulted in the chronic and systemic graft-versus-host-like disease. Furthermore, CD8+ 2C-TCR+ PD-1(-\/-) T cells exhibited markedly augmented proliferation in vitro in response to H-2d allogenic cells. Collectively, it is suggested that PD-1 is involved in the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance by serving as a negative regulator of immune responses.","4757":"Sle1 and Sle3 are NZW-derived loci that mediate lupus nephritis on a C57BL\/6 background. The absence of severe autoimmunity in NZW suggests that the NZW genome suppresses these genes. (B6.NZMc1[Sle1] x NZW)F1 hybrids develop severe humoral autoimmunity and fatal lupus nephritis, indicating that suppression of Sle1 from NZW is recessive. Linkage analysis identified four epistatic modifiers, Sles1-4, whose cumulative effect accounted for the benign autoimmunity in NZW. The specific suppression of Sle1 but not Sle2 or Sle3 by Sles1 was directly demonstrated via the production and analysis of bicongenic strains. Moreover, Sles1 was sufficient to completely suppress autoimmunity initiated by Sle1 in B6.NZMc1 x NZW hybrids. These results demonstrate the complex epistatic interactions of loci augmenting and suppressing systemic autoimmunity.","4758":"","4759":"MyD88 is a general adaptor protein that plays an important role in the Toll\/IL-1 receptor family signalings. Recently, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4) have been suggested to be the signaling receptors for lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we demonstrate that MyD88 knockout mice lack the ability to respond to LPS as measured by shock response, B cell proliferative response, and secretion of cytokines by macrophages and embryonic fibroblasts. However, activation of neither NF-kappaB nor the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family is abolished in MyD88 knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that signaling via MyD88 is essential for LPS response, but the inability of MyD88 knockout mice to induce LPS-dependent gene expression cannot simply be attributed to lack of the activation of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB.","4760":"Incubation of bone marrow macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon gamma (IFN gamma) blocks macrophage proliferation. LPS treatment or M-CSF withdrawal arrests the cell cycle at early G1 and induces apoptosis. Treatment of macrophages with IFN gamma stops the cell cycle later, at the G1\/S boundary, induces p21Waf1, and does not induce apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment of macrophages with IFN gamma protects from apoptosis induced by several stimuli. Inhibition of p21Waf1 with antisense oligonucleotides or using KO mice shows that the induction of p21Waf1 by IFN gamma mediates this protection. Thus, IFN gamma makes macrophages unresponsive to apoptotic stimuli by inducing p21Waf1 and arresting the cell cycle at the G1\/S boundary. Therefore, the cells of the innate immune system could only survive while they were functionally active.","4761":"Signaling through the pre-TCR is essential for early T cell development and is severely impaired in mice lacking the CD3 gamma chain of the pre-TCR. We here address the molecular mechanisms underlying this defect. Impaired pre-TCR signaling is shown to be associated with a profound increase in the number of apoptotic CD4- CD8- (DN) thymocytes. Introduction of p53 deficiency into CD3 gamma-deficient mice completely reverses the cell survival defect in CD3 gamma-deficient DN thymocytes and rescues the block in pre-T cell differentiation. In addition, the CD4+ CD8+ (DP) compartment is expanded to its normal size. These findings suggest that the pre-TCR regulates progression through the DNA-damage checkpoint of the DN to DP transition by inactivating p53.","4762":"L-selectin mediates lymphocyte homing by facilitating lymphocyte adhesion to unique carbohydrate ligands, sulfated sialyl Lewis(x), which are expressed on high endothelial venules (HEV) in secondary lymphoid organs. The nature of the sulfotransferase(s) that contribute to sulfation of such L-selectin counterreceptors has been uncertain. We herein describe a novel L-selectin ligand sulfotransferase, termed LSST, that directs the synthesis of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis(x) on L-selectin counterreceptors CD34, GlyCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1. LSST is predominantly expressed in HEV and exhibits striking catalytic preference for core 2-branched mucin-type O-glycans as found in natural L-selectin counterreceptors. LSST enhances L-selectin-mediated adhesion under shear compared to nonsulfated controls. LSST therefore corresponds to an HEV-specific sulfotransferase that contributes to the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands required for lymphocyte homing.","4763":"Mouse NK cells express at least seven inhibitory Ly49 receptors. Here we employ a semiquantitative cell-cell adhesion assay as well as class I\/peptide tetramers to provide a comprehensive analysis of specificities of Ly49 receptors for class I MHC molecules in eight MHC haplotypes. Different Ly49 receptors exhibited diverse binding properties. The degree of class I binding was related to the extent of functional inhibition. The tetramer studies demonstrated that neither glycosylation nor coreceptors were necessary for class I binding to Ly49 receptors and uncovered peptide-specific recognition by a Ly49 receptor. The results provide a foundation for interpreting and integrating many existing functional studies as well as for designing tests of NK cell development and self-tolerance.","4764":"Approximately 4% of peripheral blood T cells in humans express a T cell receptor with markedly restricted germline gene segment usage (V gamma 2 V delta 2). Remarkably, these T cells expand 2- to 10-fold (8%-60% of all circulating T cells) during many microbial infections. We show here that these T cells recognize a family of naturally occurring primary alkylamines in a TCR-dependent manner. These antigenic alkylamines are secreted to millimolar concentrations in bacterial supernatants and are found in certain edible plants. Given the large numbers of memory V gamma 2 V delta 2 T cells in adult humans, recognition of alkylamine antigens offers the immune system a response of the magnitude of major superantigens for alpha beta T cells and may bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity.","4765":"The interactions of three singly substituted peptide variants of the HTLV-1 Tax peptide bound to HLA-A2 with the A6 T cell receptor have been studied using T cell assays, kinetic and thermodynamic measurements, and X-ray crystallography. The three peptide\/MHC ligands include weak agonists and antagonists with different affinities for TCR. The three-dimensional structures of the three A6-TCR\/peptide\/HLA-A2 complexes are remarkably similar to each other and to the wild-type agonist complex, with minor adjustments at the interface to accommodate the peptide substitutions (P6A, V7R, and Y8A). The lack of correlation between structural changes and the type of T cell signals induced provides direct evidence that different signals are not generated by different ligand-induced conformational changes in the alphabeta TCR.","4766":"Thymocytes are positively selected for alphabeta T cell antigen receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen in conjunction with self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. MHC bound peptides participate in positive selection; however, their role has remained controversial. A TCR transgenic mouse was established using a TCR restricted to the MHC class Ib molecule, H2-M3. Having defined H2-M3 as the positively selecting MHC molecule, the severely limited number of H2-M3 binding peptides allowed us to characterize an NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1)-derived peptide as the physiological ligand of positive selection. This peptide bears no apparent sequence homology to the cognate peptide, is expressed ubiquitously, and yet does not interfere with peripheral T cells. Our studies also suggest that positive selection becomes promiscuous at high epitope densities.","4767":"The transcription factors EBF and E2A are required at a similar step in early B cell differentiation. EBF and E2A synergistically upregulate transcription of endogenous B cell-specific genes in a non-B cell line. Here, we examine a genetic collaboration between these factors in regulating B lymphopoiesis. We find that Ebf+\/- E2a+\/- mice display a marked defect in pro-B cell differentiation at a stage later than observed in the single homozygous mutant mice. Pro-B cells from Ebf+\/- E2a+\/- mice show reduced expression of lymphoid-specific transcripts, including Pax5, Rag1, Rag2, and mb-1. We also show that EBF directly binds and activates the Pax5 promoter. Together, these data show collaboration between EBF and E2A and provide insight into the hierarchy of transcription factors that regulate B lymphocyte differentiation.","4768":"Directed accessibility mediated by antigen-receptor gene enhancers ensures developmental stage-specific activation of V(D)J recombination. Here, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to explore the mechanisms that regulate immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene enhancer-dependent chromatin accessibility. Ets-1 or PU.1 bound to mu enhancer-containing plasmids assembled into chromatin in vitro and increased restriction enzyme access to a proximal site. In complementary analyses, expression of PU.1 in Ets-1-containing 2017 pro-T cells or NIH 3T3 cells induced sterile I mu transcripts at the IgH locus and increased accessibility of the endogenous mu enhancer to restriction endonucleases. These observations suggest that one role of PU.1 is to increase accessibility of the mu locus to initiate heavy chain gene expression.","4769":"","4770":"We studied the role of the invariant chain (Ii) protein's structure in its ability to form complexes with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments demonstrated that Ii contains two unstructured, flexible domains: a 39 residue sequence that contains a region (CLIP) critical for Ii\/class II complex formation and becomes rapidly ordered when Ii\/class II complexes are assembled, and a 30 residue sequence that contains the insertion point for a protease inhibitor domain included in an alternative splice form of Ii. Mobility of these domains guarantees accessibility to CLIP and the inhibitor insert, and ordering of the CLIP-containing domain may provide protection against proteolysis and contribute, along with Ii's compact 118-192 domain, to allotype-independent class II binding.","4771":"Fc gammaRIIB is an inhibitory receptor that terminates activation signals initiated by antigen cross-linking of the BCR through the recruitment of SHIP. Fc gammaRIIB can also signal independently of BCR coligation to directly mediate an apoptotic response, requiring only an intact transmembrane domain. Failure to recruit SHIP, either by deletion of SHIP or mutation of Fc gammaRIIB, results in enhanced Fc gammaRIIB-triggered apoptosis. Thus, in the germinal center, where ICs are retained by FDCs, Fc gammaRIIB may be an active determinant in the negative selection of B cells whose BCRs have reduced affinity for antigen as a result of somatic hypermutation. Selection of B cells may represent the sum of opposing signals generated by the interaction of ICs with the BCR and Fc gammaRIIB through pathways modulated by SHIP.","4772":"IL-4 promotes the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into IL-4-producing T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Previous work provided suggestive but not conclusive evidence that the transcription factor c-Maf directed the tissue-specific expression of IL-4. It was not known whether c-Maf controlled the transcription of other Th2 cytokine genes. To elucidate the role of c-Maf in vivo, we examined cytokine production in mice lacking c-Maf (c-maf(-\/-)). CD4+ T cells and NK T cells from c-maf(-\/-) mice were markedly deficient in IL-4 production. However, the mice produced normal levels of IL-13 and IgE, and, when differentiated in the presence of exogenous IL-4, c-maf(-\/-) T cells produced approximately normal levels of other Th2 cytokines. We conclude that c-Maf has a critical and selective function in IL-4 gene transcription in vivo.","4773":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate apoptosis in a number of cell types. We studied the role that ROS play in activated T cell apoptosis by activating T cells in vivo and then culturing them for a short time. Activated T cells died independently of Fas and TNF alpha. Their death was characterized by rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)), caspase-dependent DNA fragmentation, and superoxide generation. A superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn (III) tetrakis (5, 10, 15, 20-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), protected T cells from superoxide generation, caspase-dependent DNA loss, loss of delta psi(m), and cell death. These results indicate that ROS can regulate signals involved in caspase activation and apoptosis and may contribute to peripheral T cell deletion.","4774":"V(D)J recombination and transcription within the TCR alpha\/delta locus are regulated by three characterized cis-acting elements: the TCR delta enhancer (Edelta), TCR alpha enhancer (Ealpha), and T early alpha (TEA) promoter. Analysis of enhancer and promoter occupancy and function in developing thymocytes in vivo indicates Edelta and Ealpha to be developmental-stage-specific enhancers, with Edelta \"on\" and Ealpha \"off\" in double-negative III thymocytes and Edelta \"off\" and Ealpha \"on\" in double-positive thymocytes. Edelta downregulation reflects a loss of occupancy. Surprisingly, Ealpha and TEA are extensively occupied even prior to activation. TCR delta downregulation in double-positive thymocytes depends on two events, Edelta inactivation and removal of TCR delta from the influence of Ealpha by chromosomal excision.","4775":"Successful in-frame rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes or T cell antigen receptor (TCR) beta chain genes in lymphocyte progenitors results in formation of pre-BCR and pre-TCR complexes. These complexes signal progenitor cells to mature, expand in cell number, and suppress further rearrangements at the immunoglobulin heavy chain or TCRbeta chain loci, thereby ensuring allelic exclusion. We used transgenic expression of a constitutively active form of c-Raf-1 (Raf-CAAX) to demonstrate that activation of the Map kinase pathway can stimulate both maturation and expansion of B and T lymphocytes, even in the absence of pre-TCR or pre-BCR formation. However, the same Raf signal did not mediate allelic exclusion. We conclude that maturation of lymphocyte progenitors and allelic exclusion require distinct signals.","4776":"CD45 is the predominant transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase in lymphocytes and is required for the efficient induction of T cell receptor signaling and activation. However, the regulation of CD45 activity and substrate specificity are poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate a basal biochemical association of CD45 with the T cell receptor complex that is regulated in part by CD45 isoform expression. Further, maintenance of CD45\/TCR association is differentially regulated following TCR ligation with peptide: a partial agonist peptide induces CD45\/TCR dissociation while an agonist peptide promotes sustained association in a CD4-dependent manner. These data suggest that T cell receptor signaling pathways may be modulated by altering access of CD45 to TCR-associated substrates involved in T cell activation.","4777":"We have identified and characterized the stem cell antigen AA4. This molecule is a type I transmembrane protein whose overall structure suggests a role in cell adhesion. During fetal ontogeny (days 9-14 of development), AA4 is expressed in three major cell types: vascular endothelial cells, aorta-associated hematopoietic clusters, and primitive fetal liver hematopoietic progenitors. In the adult, AA4 is abundant in lung, heart, and whole bone marrow. In the adult hematopoietic compartment, aa4 transcripts are present in bone marrow CD34(-\/lo) Lin- Sca-1+ c-Kit+ and CD34hi Lin- Sca-1+ c-Kit+ stem and progenitor cell subsets. Our observations suggest that AA4 plays a role in cell-cell interactions during hematopoietic and vascular development.","4778":"Immune surveillance by CD8 T cells requires that peptides derived from intracellular proteins be presented by MHC class I molecules on the target cell surface. Interestingly, MHC molecules can also present peptides encoded in alternate translational reading frames, some even without conventional AUG initiation codons. Using T cells to measure expression of MHC bound peptides, we identified the non-AUG translation initiation codons and established that their activity was at the level of translational rather than DNA replication or transcription mechanisms. This translation mechanism decoded the CUG initiation codon not as the canonical methionine but as the leucine residue, and its activity was independent of upstream translation initiation events. Naturally processed peptide\/MHC complexes can thus arise from \"noncoding\" mRNAs via a novel translation initiation mechanism.","4779":"The discovery of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in certain human malignancies has prompted renewed efforts to develop antigen-specific immunotherapy of cancer. However, most TAA described thus far are expressed in one or a few tumor types, and, among patients with these types of tumors, TAA expression is not universal. Here, we characterize the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) as a widely expressed TAA capable of triggering antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. More than 85% of human cancers exhibit strong telomerase activity, but normal adult tissues, with few exceptions, do not. In a human system, CD8+ CTL specific for an hTERT peptide and restricted to MHC HLA-A2 lysed hTERT+ tumors from multiple histologies. These findings identify hTERT as a potentially important and widely applicable target for anticancer immunotherapeutic strategies.","4780":"To avoid detection by CTL, HIV encodes mechanisms for removal of class I MHC proteins from the surface of infected cells. However, class I downregulation potentially exposes the virus-infected cell to attack by NK cells. Human lymphoid cells are protected from NK cell cytotoxicity primarily by HLA-C and HLA-E. We present evidence that HIV-1 selectively downregulates HLA-A and HLA-B but does not significantly affect HLA-C or HLA-E. We then identify the residues in HLA-C and HLA-E that protect them from HIV down-regulation. This selective downregulation allows HIV-infected cells to avoid NK cell-mediated lysis and may represent for HIV a balance between escape from CTL and maintenance of protection from NK cells. These results suggest that subpopulations of CTL and NK cells may be uniquely suited for combating HIV.","4781":"The immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope region, Th2R, of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum is highly polymorphic. Such variation might be utilized by the parasite to escape from or interfere with CD4 T cell effector functions. Here, we show that costimulation with naturally occurring altered peptide ligands (APL) can induce a rapid change from IFNgamma production to the immunosuppressive mediator interleukin 10 (IL-10). This mechanism may contribute to the low levels of T cell responses observed to this pathogen in malaria-endemic areas.","4782":"M. tuberculosis accesses the terminal lung and is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. Utilizing a mouse intratracheal challenge model, we demonstrate that M. tuberculosis rapidly enters through M cells as well. From there, bacilli are deposited within associated intraepithelial leukocytes and subsequently conveyed to the draining lymph nodes early after infection. Osteopetrotic (Csfm(op)\/Csfm(op)) mice, null mutants for macrophage colony-stimulating factor, possess diminished numbers of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages. Csfm(op)\/Csfm(op) mice were highly susceptible to challenge with M. tuberculosis. In contrast to controls, tubercle bacilli were not conveyed to draining lymph nodes early after infection but were instead retained within the mucosa. These results indicate that M cells represent an alternate portal of entry for M. tuberculosis, which may contribute to the rapid development of protective lung immune responses.","4783":"","4784":"The mature B cell compartment of MHC class II-deficient B6 I-Aalpha(-\/-) and the btk-defective CBA\/N mouse strain is 4- to 5-fold smaller than in wild-type B6 mice. The defect in B6 I-Aalpha(-\/-) mice is intrinsic to B cells and due to a 4- to 5-fold reduced lifespan, which however can be normalized by an I-Ealpha(d) transgene, but only when expressed early during B cell development. The reduced number of mature B cells in the btk-defective CBA\/N mouse is due to a 4- to 5-fold lower number of immature splenic B cells entering the mature compartment. The combined defects of reduced lifespan and impaired generation in double mutant mice result in a severe deficiency in the mature B cell pool.","4785":"Peripheral T cell maintenance requires a survival signal delivered upon T cell receptor (TCR)-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule interaction. Since self-peptides play a critical role in the intrathymic positive selection of the mature TCR repertoire, we hypothesized an equally important role in T cell persistence. We used mice with a normal expression of MHC class II molecules but a restricted self-peptide complexity (H-2M alpha-\/-) to show that an MHC class II-restricted T cell specificity that displays a deficient positive selection in the H-2M alpha-\/- thymus shows an impaired persistence after adoptive transfer in H-2M alpha-\/- recipients. Finally, a wild-type CD4+ TCR repertoire is incompletely maintained in H-2M alpha-\/- recipients. These observations suggest that, similar to intrathymic positive selection, the maintenance of the mature TCR repertoire relies on the recognition of self-peptide:self-MHC complexes.","4786":"Fetal Igs are less diverse than adult Igs, largely because of the lack of N addition in the absence of Tdt. To test whether the absence of Tdt is essential, we generated Tg mice that express Tdt and add N regions in fetal B cells. When challenged as adults with PC-containing Streptococcus pneumoniae, these mice fail to make the hallmark T15 anti-PC Ab encoded by canonical rearrangements of Ig H and L chain genes. The anti-PC Abs from these mice are altered by premature N addition and do not protect against death from virulent pneumococcal infection. These results show that maintenance of lower Ig diversity in early life is essential for the acquisition of a complete functional adult repertoire.","4787":"Granzyme (gzm) B-deficient cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) have a severe defect in the rapid induction of target cell apoptosis that is almost completely corrected by prolonged incubation of the CTL effectors and their targets. We show in this report that perforin-dependent, gzmB-independent cytotoxicity is caused by gzmA (or tightly linked genes). CTL deficient for gzmA and gzmB retain normal perforin function, but these CTL have a cytotoxic defect in vivo that is as severe as perforin-deficient CTL. Collectively, these results suggest that perforin provides target cell access and\/or trafficking signals for the gzms, and that the gzms themselves deliver the lethal hits. The gzmA pathway appears to function independently from gzmB and may therefore provide a critical \"back-up\" system when gzmB is inhibited in the target cell.","4788":"Cytotoxic lymphocytes trigger apoptosis by releasing perforin and granzymes (Grn). GrnB activates the caspase apoptotic pathway, but little is known about GrnA-induced cell death. Perforin was used to load recombinant GrnA and GrnB and enzymatically inactive variants into target cells. GrnA induces single-strand DNA breaks that can be labeled with Klenow polymerase and visualized on alkaline gels. GrnA-induced DNA damage but not cytolysis requires GrnA proteolysis. GrnA-induced membrane perturbation, nuclear condensation, and DNA damage are unimpaired by caspase blockade. GrnA fails to induce cleavage of caspase-3, lamin B, rho-GTPase, or PARP. GrnA-induced cytotoxicity and cleavage of PHAP II, a previously identified GrnA substrate, are unimpaired in Jurkat cells that overexpress bcl-2. Therefore, GrnA activates a novel apoptotic pathway.","4789":"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I homolog MIC-A functions as a stress-inducible antigen that is recognized by a subset of gammadelta T cells independent of beta2-microglobulin and bound peptides. Its crystal structure reveals a dramatically altered MHC class I fold, both in detail and overall domain organization. The only remnant of a peptide-binding groove is a small cavity formed as the result of disordering a large section of one of the groove-defining helices. Loss of beta2-microglobulin binding is due to a restructuring of the interaction interfaces. Structural mapping of sequence variation suggests potential receptor binding sites on the underside of the platform on the side opposite of the surface recognized by alphabeta T cell receptors on MHC class I-peptide complexes.","4790":"Reconstituting the immune response will be critical for the survival of HIV-infected individuals once viral load is brought under control. While the adult thymus was previously thought to be relatively inactive, new data suggest it may play a role in T cell reconstitution. We examined thymopoiesis in adults up to 56 years of age and found active T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement, generating a diverse TCR Vbeta repertoire. The resulting thymocytes are functional and are capable of responding to costimulatory signals. These data demonstrate that the adult thymus remains active late in life and contributes functional T cells to the peripheral lymphoid pool.","4791":"Notch proteins are cell surface receptors that mediate developmental cell specification events. To explore the function of murine Notch1, an essential portion of the gene was flanked with loxP sites and inactivation induced via interferon-regulated Cre recombinase. Mice with a neonatally induced loss of Notch1 function were transiently growth retarded and had a severe deficiency in thymocyte development. Competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated wild-type hosts with wild-type- and Notch1-deficient bone marrow revealed a cell autonomous blockage in T cell development at an early stage, before expression of T cell lineage markers. Notch1-deficient bone marrow did, however, contribute normally to all other hematopoietic lineages. These findings suggest that Notch1 plays an obligatory and selective role in T cell lineage induction.","4792":"T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain allelic exclusion occurs at the thymocyte CD4- 8- (double-negative, or DN) to CD4+ 8+ (double-positive, or DP) transition, concurrently with differentiation and cellular expansion, and is imposed by a negative feedback loop in which a product of the first rearranged TCRbeta allele arrests further recombination in the TCRbeta locus. All of the major events associated with the development of DP cells can be induced by the introduction of TCRbeta or activated Lck transgenes. Here, we present evidence that the signaling pathways that promote thymocyte differentiation and expansion of RAG-deficient DN cells but not those that suppress rearrangements of endogenous TCRbeta genes in normal DN cells are engaged by activated Ras. We propose that TCRbeta allelic exclusion is mediated by effector pathways downstream of Lck but independent of Ras.","4793":"Here, we define the IL-7R-activated signal that promotes survival and proliferation of T cell progenitors and demonstrate that it is distinct from the signals that induce differentiation. We show that IL-7 activates PKB and STAT5 in human thymocytes. Into T cell precursors we introduced chimeric receptors with a cytoplasmic domain of the IL-7R that is no longer able to activate PI-3K\/PKB and STAT5 and tested the transduced cells in a fetal thymic organ culture. We also examined the T cell precursor activity of progenitors expressing dominant-negative forms of PI-3K or STAT5B. These experiments revealed that PI-3K\/PKB activation is essential for the survival and proliferation of T cell precursors and suggest that STAT5 activated by IL-7 mediates T cell differentiation.","4794":"NF-ATc, an inducibly expressed transcription factor, controls gene expression in T lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes. We show here that the transcriptional co-activators CBP\/p300 bind to and control the activity of the inducible N-terminal transactivation domain of NF-ATc, TAD-A. Similar to the N terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun, TAD-A is inducibly phosphorylated, but this phosphorylation is dispensable for the interaction with CBP\/p300. Constitutive active versions of c-Raf and Rac synergistically enhance the CBP\/p300-mediated increase of TAD-A activity, indicating the important role CBP\/p300 plays in the integration of T cell activation signals. Since a mutation of CBP abolishing HAT activity is almost as active as wild-type CBP in T cells, functions of CBP\/p300 other than histone acetylation appear to control the NF-AT-dependent transcription in T cells.","4795":"We have used gene-targeted mutation to assess the role of the T cell receptor delta (TCR delta) enhancer (E delta) in alphabeta and gammadelta T cell development. Mice lacking E delta exhibited no defects in alphabeta T cell development but had a severe reduction in thymic and peripheral gammadelta T cells and decreased VDJ delta rearrangements. Simultaneous deletion of both E delta and the TCR alpha enhancer (E alpha) demonstrated that residual TCR delta rearrangements were not driven by E alpha, implicating additional elements in TCR delta locus accessibility. Surprisingly, while deletion of E delta severely impaired germline TCR delta expression in double-negative thymocytes, absence of E delta did not affect expression of mature delta transcripts in gammadelta T cells. We conclude that E delta has an important role in TCR delta locus regulation at early, but not late, stages of gammadelta T cell development.","4796":"","4797":"The basis for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire selection upon repeated antigenic challenge is unclear. We evaluated the avidity and dissociation kinetics of peptide\/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer binding to antigen-specific T lymphocytes isolated following primary or secondary immunization. The data reveal a narrowing of the secondary repertoire relative to the primary repertoire, largely resulting from the loss of cells expressing TCRs with the fastest dissociation rates for peptide\/MHC binding. In addition, T cells in the secondary response express TCRs of higher average affinity for peptide\/MHC than cells in the primary response. These results provide a link between the kinetics and affinity of TCR-peptide\/MHC interactions and TCR sequence selection during the course of an immune response.","4798":"Superantigens (SAGs) activate T cells by simultaneously binding the Vbeta domain of the TCR and MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The preferential expression of certain Valpha regions among SAG-reactive T cells has suggested that the TCR alpha chain may modulate the level of activation through an interaction with MHC. We demonstrate that the TCR alpha chain is required for maximum stabilization of the TCR-SAG-MHC complex and that the alpha chain increases the half-life of the complex to match those of TCR-peptide\/MHC complexes. The site on the TCR alpha chain responsible for these effects is CDR2. Thus, the overall stability of the TCR-SAG-MHC complex is determined by the combination of three distinct interactions: TCR-SAG, SAG-MHC, and MHC-TCR.","4799":"We report that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is required for the retention of B lineage and granulocytic precursors within fetal liver and bone marrow microenvironment. In CXCR4-deficient embryos, pro-B cells are present in blood but hardly detectable in liver; myeloid cells are elevated in blood and reduced in liver compared to wild-type embryos. Mice reconstituted with CXCR4-deficient fetal liver cells have reduced donor-derived mature B lymphocytes in blood and lymphoid organs. The numbers of pro-B and pre-B cells are reduced in bone marrow and abnormally high in blood. Granulocytic cells are reduced in bone marrow but elevated and less mature in the blood. B lineage and granulocytic precursors are released into the periphery in absence of CXCR4.","4800":"Rheumatoid arthritis is a common and debilitating autoimmune disease whose cause and mechanism remain a mystery. We recently described a T cell receptor transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops a disease with most of the clinical, histological, and immunological features of rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Disease development in K\/BxN mice is initiated by systemic T cell self-reactivity; it requires T cells, as expected, but B cells are also needed, more surprisingly. Here, we have identified the role of B cells as the secretion of arthritogenic immunoglobulins. We suggest that a similar scenario may unfold in some other arthritis models and in human patients, beginning with pervasive T cell autoreactivity and ending in immunoglobulin-provoked joint destruction.","4801":"To investigate the type of immunity responsible for resolution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we monitored antibody and intrahepatic cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses during acute (&lt;20 weeks) infection in chimpanzees. Two animals who terminated infection made strong CTL but poor antibody responses. In both resolvers, CTL targeted at least six viral regions. In contrast, animals developing chronic hepatitis generated weaker acute CTL responses. Extensive analysis of the fine specificity of the CTL in one resolver revealed nine peptide epitopes and restriction by all six MHC class I allotypes. Every specificity shown during acute hepatitis persisted in normal liver tissue more than 1 yr after resolution. These results suggest that CD8+CTL are better correlated with protection against HCV infection than antibodies.","4802":"Neutralizing antibodies can protect against challenge with HIV-1 in vivo if present at appropriate concentrations at the time of viral challenge, but any role in the control of established infection is unclear. Here, we show that high serum concentrations of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, either singly or as a cocktail, have little sustained effect on viral load in established HIV-1 infection in hu-PBL-SCID mice. In some instances, virus replication of neutralization-sensitive virus continues even in the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibody. In most instances, neutralization escape occurs in a few days, even from a cocktail of three antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes. The results imply that humoral immunity is unlikely to play a significant role in the control of established HIV-1 infection in humans.","4803":"IkappaB kinase-alpha and -beta (IKK-alpha and IKK-beta), the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex, phosphorylate IkappaB proteins on specific serine residues, thus targeting IkappaB for degradation and activating the transcription factor NF-kappaB. To elucidate the in vivo function of IKK-beta, we generated IKK-beta-deficient mice. The homozygous mouse embryo dies at approximately 14.5 days of gestation due to liver degeneration and apoptosis. IKK-beta-deficient embryonic fibroblasts have both reduced basal NF-kappaB activity and impaired cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activation. Similarly, basal and cytokine-inducible kinase activities of the IKK complex are greatly reduced in IKK-beta-deficient cells. These results indicate that IKK-beta is crucial for liver development and regulation of NF-kappaB activity and that IKK-alpha can only partially compensate for the loss of IKK-beta.","4804":"We evaluated the importance of CD3-zeta ITAMs in T cell responses by breeding the P14 transgenic TCR into mice in which CD3-zeta chains lacking all or part of their ITAMs were genetically substituted for wild-type CD3-zeta chains. In contrast to the H-Y TCR, the P14 TCR permitted the development of peripheral CD8+ T cells harboring signaling-defective CD3-zeta subunits. The absence of functional CD3-zeta ITAMs did not reduce the spectrum of activation events and effector functions that constitute the normal attributes of mature CD8+ T cells. The only detectable differences were quantitative and noted only when T cells were challenged with suboptimal peptide concentrations. Therefore, the ITAMs present in the CD3-gammadeltaepsilon module are sufficient for qualitatively normal TCR signaling and those present in CD3-zeta have no exclusive role during T cell activation.","4805":"PU.1 and Spi-B have previously been implicated in the regulation of genes encoding B cell receptor (BCR) signaling components. Spi-B-\/- B lymphocytes respond poorly to BCR stimulation; PU.1-\/- mice, however, lack B cells, precluding an analysis of BCR responses. We now show that PU.1+\/- Spi-B-\/- B cells exhibit more extensive defects than Spi-B-\/- B cells, indicating that both PU.1 and Spi-B are required for normal BCR signaling. Strikingly, BCR cross-linking results in substantially reduced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in mutant B cells. Further analysis shows that Igalpha is phosphorylated and syk is recruited and becomes phosphorylated but that BLNK and PLCgamma phosphorylation are defective in mutant cells. Our data support the existence of a novel component coupling syk to downstream targets.","4806":"We addressed the impact of deleting TNF AU-rich elements (ARE) from the mouse genome on the regulation of TNF biosynthesis and the physiology of the host. Absence of the ARE affected mechanisms responsible for TNF mRNA destabilization and translational repression in hemopoietic and stromal cells. In stimulated conditions, TNF ARE were required both for the alleviation and reinforcement of message destabilization and translational silencing. Moreover, the mutant mRNA was no longer responsive to translational modulation by the p38 and JNK kinases, demonstrating that TNF ARE are targets for these signals. Development of two specific pathologies in mutant mice, i.e., chronic inflammatory arthritis and Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease, suggests that defective function of ARE may be etiopathogenic for the development of analogous human pathologies.","4807":"Class II transactivator (CIITA) is known as a coactivator for MHC class II gene expression in antigen-presenting cells. Surprisingly, when CIITA-\/- CD4 T cells were stimulated in the presence of IL-12, they produced not only IFNgamma but also high levels of IL-4. The IL-4 production is due to the accumulation of IL-4 gene transcripts in Th1 cells. This transcriptional control is observed in T cells differentiating to the Th1 but not Th2 lineage, consistent with induction of expression of the CIITA gene in T cells by IFNgamma. Thus, in addition to its role in transactivation of genes involved in antigen presentation, CIITA plays a critical role during the T cell differentiation by negatively regulating the IL-4 gene transcription.","4808":"CD4+ CD8+ thymocyte differentiation requires TCR signaling induced by self-peptide\/MHC ligands. Nevertheless, the resulting mature T cells are not activated by these self-complexes, whereas foreign ligands can be potent stimuli. Here, we show that the signaling properties of TCR change during thymocyte maturation, differentially affecting responses to related peptide\/MHC molecule complexes and contributing to this discrimination. Weak agonists for CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes lose potency during development, accompanied by a change in TCR-associated phosphorylation from an agonist to a partial agonist\/antagonist pattern. In contrast, sensitivity to strong agonists is maintained, along with full signaling. This yields a mature T cell pool highly responsive to foreign antigen while possessing a wide margin of safety against activation by self-ligands.","4809":"The binding of TCRs to their peptide-MHC ligands is characterized by a low affinity, slow kinetics, and a high degree of cross-reactivity. Here, we report the results of a kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of two TCRs binding to their peptide-MHC ligands, which reveal two striking features. First, significant activation energy barriers must be overcome during both association and dissociation, suggesting that conformational adjustments are required. Second, the low affinity of binding is a consequence of highly unfavorable entropic effects, indicative of a substantial reduction in disorder upon binding. This is evidence that the TCR and\/or peptide-MHC have flexible binding surfaces that are stabilized upon binding. Such conformational flexibility, which may also be a feature of primary antibodies, is likely to contribute to cross-reactivity in antigen recognition.","4810":"The Ikaros gene family encodes zinc finger DNA-binding proteins essential for lineage determination and control of proliferation in the lymphoid system. Here, we report that, in the nucleus of a T cell, a major fraction of Ikaros and Aiolos proteins associate with the DNA-dependent ATPase Mi-2 and histone deacetylases, in a 2 MD complex. This Ikaros-NURD complex is active in chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation. Upon T cell activation, Ikaros recruits Mi-2\/HDAC to regions of heterochromatin. These studies reveal that Ikaros proteins are capable of targeting chromatin remodeling and deacetylation complexes in vivo. We propose that the restructuring of chromatin is a key aspect of Ikaros function in lymphocyte differentiation.","4811":"T cell activation involves the sustained accumulation of T cell receptor (TCR) and IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) mediated signaling events that promote cell cycle entry and progression. The Ikaros family of nuclear factors regulate this process by providing thresholds overcome by receptor signaling. T cells with reduced levels of Ikaros activity require fewer TCR engagement events for activation, exhibit a greater proliferative response to IL-2, and are less sensitive to inhibitors of TCR and IL-2R signaling. Upon T cell activation, Ikaros proteins localize in a higher-order chromatin structure where they colocalize with components of the DNA replication machinery. Proliferating T cells with reduced Ikaros activity display chromosome abnormalities. We propose that participation of Ikaros in higher-order chromatin structures controls cell cycle transitions and restricts DNA replication.","4812":"The linker molecule LAT is a substrate of the tyrosine kinases activated following TCR engagement. Phosphorylated LAT binds many critical signaling molecules. The central role of this molecule in TCR-mediated signaling has been demonstrated by experiments in a LAT-deficient cell line. To probe the role of LAT in T cell development, the LAT gene was disrupted by targeting. LAT-deficient mice appeared healthy. Flow cytometric analysis revealed normal B cell populations but the absence of any mature peripheral T cells. Intrathymic development was blocked within the CD4- CD8- stage. No gross abnormality of NK or platelet function was observed. LAT is thus critical to both T cell activation and development.","4813":"The germline promoter region upstream of the D beta 1 gene segment in the murine TCR beta locus was deleted to assess its role in controlling V(D)J recombination. Associated with diminished D beta 1 region germline transcription, rearrangement of the D beta 1 but not the D beta 2 gene segment was reduced 10- to 20-fold. A corresponding reduction in RAG-mediated cleavage at the D beta 1 and J beta 1 signal sequences was apparent only when purified CD4- CD8- thymocytes were analyzed because, as we demonstrate, cleavage at these gene segments also occurred in CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes. These findings suggest that germline promoters regulate localized accessibility of gene segments for recombination and that in CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes TCR beta allelic exclusion does not result from inaccessibility of D beta gene segments.","4814":"During positive selection, immature thymocytes commit to either the CD4+ or CD8+ T cell lineage (\"commitment\") and convert from short-lived thymocytes into long-lived T cells (\"rescue\"). By formal precursor-progeny analysis, we now identify what is likely to be the initial positive selection step signaled by alpha beta TCR, which we have termed \"induction\". During induction, RAG mRNA expression is downregulated, but lineage commitment does not occur. Rather, lineage commitment (which depends upon the MHC class specificity of the alpha beta TCR) only occurs after downregulation of RAG expression and the consequent fixation of alpha beta TCR specificity. We propose that positive selection can be viewed as a sequence of increasingly selective developmental steps (induction--&gt;commitment--&gt;rescue) that are signaled by alpha beta TCR engagements of intrathymic ligands.","4815":"Immature B cells that encounter self-antigen are eliminated from the immune repertoire by negative selection. Negative selection has been proposed to take place by two distinct mechanisms: deletion by apoptosis or alteration of the antigen receptor specificity by receptor editing. While convincing evidence exists for each, the two models are inherently contradictory. In this paper, we propose a resolution to this contradiction by demonstrating that the site of first antigen encounter dictates which mechanism of negative selection is utilized. We demonstrate that the bone marrow microenvironment provides signals that block antigen-induced deletion and promote RAG reinduction. In the periphery, the absence of these signals allows the immature B cell to default to apoptosis as a result of BCR engagement.","4816":"","4817":"The proto-oncogene Cot\/Tpl-2 encodes a MAP3K-related serine-threonine kinase. Expression of wild type Cot activates the IkappaB kinases (IKK) leading to induction of NF-kappaB. Conversely, expression of kinase-deficient Cot inhibits CD3\/CD28 but not TNF alpha induction of NF-kappaB. These findings suggest the selective involvement of Cot\/Tpl-2 or a closely related kinase in the CD3\/CD28 costimulatory pathway leading to induced nuclear expression of NF-kappaB. In contrast, a kinase-deficient mutant of the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) inhibits both CD3\/CD28 and TNF alpha signaling, indicating that these pathways converge at or prior to the action of NIK. Consistent with such a sequential function of these two kinases, Cot physically assembles with and phosphorylates NIK in vivo.","4818":"The transcription factor NF-ATc is synthesized in three prominent isoforms. These differ in the length of their C terminal peptides and mode of synthesis. Due to a switch from the use of a 3' polyA site to a more proximal polyA site, NF-ATc expression switches from the synthesis of the two longer isoforms in naive T cells to that of short isoform A in T effector cells. The relative low binding affinity of cleavage stimulation factor CstF-64 to the proximal polyA site seems to contribute to its neglect in naive T cells. These alternative polyadenylation events ensure the rapid accumulation of high concentrations of NF-ATc necessary to exceed critical threshold levels of NF-ATc for gene induction in effector T cells.","4819":"Many cytokines activate two highly homologous Stat proteins, 5a and 5b. Mice deficient in both genes lack all growth hormone and prolactin functions but retain functions associated with cytokines such as erythropoietin. Here, we demonstrate that, while lymphoid development is normal, Stat5a\/b mutant peripheral T cells are profoundly deficient in proliferation and fail to undergo cell cycle progression or to express genes controlling cell cycle progression. In addition, the mice lack NK cells, develop splenomegaly, and have T cells with an activated phenotype, phenotypes seen in IL-2 receptor beta chain-deficient mice. These phenotypes are not seen in mice lacking Stat5a or Stat5b alone. The results demonstrate that the Stat5 proteins, redundantly, are essential mediators of IL-2 signaling in T cells.","4820":"B cell antigen receptor (BCR) ligation leads to receptor desensitization wherein BCR remain competent to bind antigen and yet fail to transduce signals. Desensitized BCR exhibit a defect at the most proximal level of signal transduction, consistent with failed transmission of signals through the receptor complex. We report that antigen stimulation leads to dissociation or destabilization of the BCR reflected by inability to coimmunoprecipitate Ig-alpha\/Ig-beta with mIg. This destabilization is temporally correlated with desensitization and occurs in BCR containing mIgM and mIgD. Induction of BCR destabilization requires tyrosine kinase activation but is not induced by phosphatase inhibitors. BCR destabilization occurs at the cell surface and \"dissociated\" Ig-alpha\/Ig-beta complexes remain responsive to anti-Ig-beta stimulation, suggesting that mIg-transducer uncoupling may mediate receptor desensitization.","4821":"The kinetics of interaction between TCR and MHC-peptide show a general relationship between affinity and the biological response, but the reported kinetic differences between antigenic and antagonistic peptides are very small. Here, we show a remarkable difference in the kinetics of TCR interactions with strong agonist ligands at 37 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C. This difference is not seen with antagonist\/positive selecting ligands. The interaction at 37 degrees C shows biphasic binding kinetics best described by a model of TCR dimerization. The altered kinetics greatly increase the stability of complexes with agonist ligands, accounting for the large differences in biological response compared to other ligands. Thus, there may be an allosteric, as well as a kinetic, component to the discrimination between agonists and antagonists.","4822":"The T cell surface glycoprotein CD8 enhances T cell antigen recognition by binding to MHC class I molecules. We show that human CD8 alphaalpha binds to the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2 with an extremely low affinity (Kd approximately 0.2 mM at 37 degrees C) and with kinetics that are between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude faster than reported for T cell receptor\/peptide-MHC interactions. Furthermore, CD8 alphaalpha had no detectable effect on a T cell receptor (TCR) binding to the same peptide-MHC class I complex. These binding properties provide an explanation as to why the CD8\/MHC class I interaction is unable to initiate cell-cell adhesion and how it can enhance TCR recognition without interfering with its specificity.","4823":"Cathepsins have been implicated in the degradation of proteins destined for the MHC class II processing pathway and in the proteolytic removal of invariant chain (Ii), a critical regulator of MHC class II function. Mice lacking the lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin S (catS) demonstrated a profound inhibition of Ii degradation in professional APC in vivo. A marked variation in the generation of MHC class II-bound Ii fragments and presentation of exogenous proteins was observed between B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages lacking catS. CatS-deficient mice showed diminished susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for regulation of immune responsiveness.","4824":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules acquire antigenic peptides after degradation of the invariant chain (Ii), an MHC class II-associated protein that otherwise blocks peptide binding. Antigen-presenting cells of mice that lack the protease cathepsin S fail to process Ii beyond a 10 kDa fragment, resulting in delayed peptide loading and accumulation of cell surface MHC class II\/10 kDa Ii complexes. Although cathepsin S-deficient mice have normal numbers of B and T cells and normal IgE responses, they show markedly impaired antibody class switching to IgG2a and IgG3. These results indicate cathepsin S is a major Ii-processing enzyme in splenocytes and dendritic cells. Its role in humoral immunity critically depends on how antigens access the immune system.","4825":"In mammals, the Rho family GTPase Rac2 is restricted in expression to hematopoietic cells, where it is coexpressed with Rac1. Rac2-deficient mice were created to define the physiological requirement for two near-identical Rac proteins in hematopoietic cells. rac2-\/- neutrophils displayed significant defects in chemotaxis, in shear-dependent L-selectin-mediated capture on the endothelial substrate Glycam-1, and in both F-actin generation and p38 and, unexpectedly, p42\/p44 MAP kinase activation induced by chemoattractants. Superoxide production by rac2-\/- bone marrow neutrophils was significantly reduced compared to wild type, but it was normal in activated peritoneal exudate neutrophils. These defects were reflected in vivo by baseline neutrophilia, reduced inflammatory peritoneal exudate formation, and increased mortality when challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus. Rac2 is an essential regulator of multiple specialized neutrophil functions.","4826":"While the majority of purified pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells (PHSC) express c-Kit, the receptor for steel factor, we have phenotypically and functionally separated a distinct class of PHSC that does not express c-Kit. In contrast to c-Kit-positive (c-Kit(pos)) PHSC, the c-Kit-negative (c-Kit(neg)) PHSC do not proliferate in response to multiple hematopoietic growth factors in vitro and do not radioprotect or form macroscopic spleen colonies (CFU-s) when transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. However, the c-Kit(neg) PHSC show delayed or slow reconstitution kinetics when cotransplanted with radioprotective bone marrow cells. c-Kit(neg) PHSCs cells can give rise to c-Kit(pos) cells with CFU-s activity, radioprotective activity, and PHSC activity. Thus, constitutive hematopoiesis is maintained by c-Kit(pos) PHSCS cells that are recruited from a more primitive quiescent c-Kit(neg) PHSC population, which represents a critical developmental stage in definitive hematopoiesis.","4827":"The severe immunodeficiency type II bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) lacks class II MHC gene transcription. One defect from a complementation group A type II BLS patient is a 24 aa deletion in the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA). We show here that the molecular defect present in this protein is a failure of CIITA to undergo nuclear translocation. This defect was mapped to a position-dependent, novel nuclear localization sequence that cannot be functionally replaced by a classical NLS. Fusion of this 5 aa motif to an unrelated protein leads to nuclear translocation. Furthermore, this motif is not critical for transactivation function. This is a description of a genetic disease resulting from a novel defect in the subcellular localization of a transcriptional coactivator.","4828":"The bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is characterized by the absence of MHC class II transcription and humoral- and cellular-mediated immune responses to foreign antigens. Three of the four BLS genetic complementation groups have defects in the activity of the MHC class II transcription factor RFX. We have purified the RFX complex and sequenced its three subunits. The sequence of the smallest subunit describes a novel gene, termed RFX-B. RFX-B complements the predominant BLS complementation group (group B) and was found to be mutant in cell lines from this BLS group. The protein has no known DNA-binding domain but does contain three ankyrin repeats that are likely to be important in protein-protein interactions.","4829":"The X2 box of MHC class II promoters is homologous to TRE\/CRE elements and is required for expression of MHC class II genes. The X2 box-specific DNA binding activity, X2BP, was purified to homogeneity, sequenced, and identified as CREB. Transient transactivation experiments showed that CREB can cooperate with CIITA to enhance activation of transcription from MHC class II promoters in a dose-dependent manner. Binding of CREB to the class II promoter in vivo was demonstrated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Additionally, ICER, a dominant inhibitor of CREB function, was found to repress class II expression. These results demonstrate that CREB binds to the X2 box in vivo and cooperates with CIITA to direct MHC class II expression.","4830":"","4831":"An interleukin-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) was purified from urine by chromatography on IL-18 beads, sequenced, cloned, and expressed in COS7 cells. IL-18BP abolished IL-18 induction of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), IL-8, and activation of NF-kappaB in vitro. Administration of IL-18BP to mice abrogated circulating IFNgamma following LPS. Thus, IL-18BP functions as an inhibitor of the early Th1 cytokine response. IL-18BP is constitutively expressed in the spleen, belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, and has limited homology to the IL-1 type II receptor. Its gene was localized on human chromosome 11q13, and no exon coding for a transmembrane domain was found in an 8.3 kb genomic sequence. Several Poxviruses encode putative proteins highly homologous to IL-18BP, suggesting that viral products may attenuate IL-18 and interfere with the cytotoxic T cell response.","4832":"Signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) is essential for B cell function and development. Despite the key role of Syk in BCR signaling, little is known about the mechanism by which Syk transmits downstream effectors. BLNK (B cell LiNKer protein), a substrate for Syk, is now shown to be essential in activating phospholipase C (PLC)gamma 2 and JNK. The BCR-induced PLC gamma 2 activation, but not the JNK activation, was restored by introduction of PLC gamma 2 membrane-associated form into BLNK-deficient B cells. As JNK activation requires both Rac1 and PLC gamma 2, our results suggest that BLNK regulates the Rac1-JNK pathway, in addition to modulating PLC gamma 2 localization.","4833":"Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is the major survival factor for myeloma tumor cells and induces signaling through the STAT proteins. We report that one STAT family member, Stat3, is constitutively activated in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with multiple myeloma and in the IL-6-dependent human myeloma cell line U266. Moreover, U266 cells are inherently resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis and express high levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Blocking IL-6 receptor signaling from Janus kinases to the Stat3 protein inhibits Bcl-xL expression and induces apoptosis, demonstrating that Stat3 signaling is essential for the survival of myeloma tumor cells. These findings provide evidence that constitutively activated Stat3 signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma by preventing apoptosis.","4834":"RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted) is a chemoattractant cytokine (chemokine) important in the generation of inflammatory infiltrate and human immunodeficiency virus entry into immune cells. RANTES is expressed late (3-5 days) after activation in T lymphocytes. Using expression cloning, we identified the first \"late\" T lymphocyte associated transcription factor and named it \"RANTES Factor of Late Activated T Lymphocytes-1\" (RFLAT-1). RFLAT-1 is a novel, phosphorylated, zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in T cells 3 days after activation, coincident with RANTES expression. While Rel proteins play the dominant role in RANTES gene expression in fibroblasts, RFLAT-1 is a strong transactivator for RANTES in T cells.","4835":"In H2-M- mice, the presence of a single peptide, CLIP, bound to MHC class II molecules generates a diverse repertoire of CD4+ cells. In these mice, typical self-peptides are not bound to class II molecules, with the result that a very high proportion of H2-M- CD4+ cells are responsive to the various peptides displayed on normal MHC-compatible APC. We show here, however, that such \"self\" reactivity is controlled by low-affinity CD4+ cells. These cells give spectacularly high proliferative responses but are virtually unreactive in certain other assays, e.g., skin graft rejection; responses to MHC alloantigens, by contrast, are intense in all assays. Possible explanations for why thymic selection directed to a single peptide curtails self specificity without affecting alloreactivity are discussed.","4836":"The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of CD94, a component of the CD94\/NKG2 NK cell receptor, has been determined to 2.6 A resolution, revealing a unique variation of the C-type lectin fold. In this variation, the second alpha helix, corresponding to residues 102-112, is replaced by a loop, the putative carbohydrate-binding site is significantly altered, and the Ca2+-binding site appears nonfunctional. This structure may serve as a prototype for other NK cell receptors such as Ly-49, NKR-P1, and CD69. The CD94 dimer observed in the crystal has an extensive hydrophobic interface that stabilizes the loop conformation of residues 102-112. The formation of this dimer reveals a putative ligand-binding region for HLA-E and suggests how NKG2 interacts with CD94.","4837":"Two synthetic O-GlcNAc-bearing peptides that elicit H-2Db-restricted glycopeptide-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) have been shown to display nonreciprocal patterns of cross-reactivity. Here, we present the crystal structures of the H-2Db glycopeptide complexes to 2.85 A resolution or better. In both cases, the glycan is solvent exposed and available for direct recognition by the T cell receptor (TCR). We have modeled the complex formed between the MHC-glycopeptide complexes and their respective TCRs, showing that a single saccharide residue can be accommodated in the standard TCR-MHC geometry. The models also reveal a possible molecular basis for the observed cross-reactivity patterns of the CTL clones, which appear to be influenced by the length of the CDR3 loop and the nature of the immunizing ligand.","4838":"T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of nonpeptidic and modified peptide antigens has been recently uncovered but is still poorly understood. Immunization with an H-2Kb-restricted glycopeptide RGY8-6H-Gal2 generates a population of cytotoxic T cells that express both alpha\/beta TCR, specific for glycopeptide, and gamma\/delta TCR, specific for the disaccharide, even on glycolipids. The crystal structure of Kb\/RGY8-6H-Gal2 now demonstrates that the peptide and H-2Kb structures are unaffected by the peptide glycosylation, but the central region of the putative TCR binding site is dominated by the extensive exposure of the tethered carbohydrate. These features of the Kb\/RGY8-6H-Gal2 structure are consistent with the individual ligand binding preferences identified for the alpha\/beta and gamma\/delta TCRs and thus explain the generation of a carbohydrate-specific T cell response.","4839":"We have generated mice with a cell type-specific disruption of the Stat3 gene in macrophages and neutrophils. The mutant mice are highly susceptible to endotoxin shock with increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF alpha, IL-1, IFN gamma, and IL-6. Endotoxin-induced production of inflammatory cytokines is augmented because the suppressive effects of IL-10 on inflammatory cytokine production from macrophages and neutrophils are completely abolished. The mice show a polarized immune response toward the Th1 type and develop chronic enterocolitis with age. Taken together, Stat3 plays a critical role in deactivation of macrophages and neutrophils mainly exerted by IL-10.","4840":"The two genetically established antimicrobial mechanisms of macrophages are production of reactive oxygen intermediates by phagocyte oxidase (phox) and reactive nitrogen intermediates by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). Mice doubly deficient in both enzymes (gp91(phox-\/-)\/NOS2(-\/-)) formed massive abscesses containing commensal organisms, mostly enteric bacteria, even when reared under specific pathogen-free conditions with antibiotics. Neither parental strain showed such infections. Thus, phox and NOS2 appear to compensate for each other's deficiency in providing resistance to indigenous bacteria, and no other pathway does so fully. Macrophages from gp91(phox-\/-)\/NOS2(-\/-) mice could not kill virulent Listeria. Their killing of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and attenuated Listeria was markedly diminished but demonstrable, establishing the existence of a mechanism of macrophage antibacterial activity independent of phox and NOS2.","4841":"Although nitric oxide (NO) kills or inhibits the replication of a variety of intracellular pathogens, the antimicrobial mechanisms of NO are unknown. Here, we identify a viral protease as a target of NO. The life cycle of many viruses depends upon viral proteases that cleave viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides. NO inactivates the Coxsackievirus protease 3C, an enzyme necessary for the replication of Coxsackievirus. NO S-nitrosylates the cysteine residue in the active site of protease 3C, inhibiting protease activity and interrupting the viral life cycle. Substituting a serine residue for the active site cysteine renders protease 3C resistant to NO inhibition. Since cysteine proteases are critical for virulence or replication of many viruses, bacteria, and parasites, S-nitrosylation of pathogen cysteine proteases may be a general mechanism of antimicrobial host defenses.","4842":"ICAM-2-deficient mice exhibit prolonged accumulation of eosinophils in lung interstitium concomitant with a delayed increase in eosinophil numbers in the airway lumen during the development of allergic lung inflammation. The ICAM-2-dependent increased and prolonged accumulation of eosinophils in lung interstitium results in prolonged, heightened airway hyperresponsiveness. These findings reveal an essential role for ICAM-2 in the development of the inflammatory and respiratory components of allergic lung disease. This phenotype is caused by the lack of ICAM-2 expression on non-hematopoietic cells. ICAM-2 deficiency on endothelial cells causes reduced eosinophil transmigration in vitro. ICAM-2 is not essential for lymphocyte homing or the development of leukocytes, with the exception of megakaryocyte progenitors, which are significantly reduced.","4843":"","4844":"Mammalian serine\/threonine-linked oligosaccharides (O-glycans) are commonly synthesized with the Golgi enzyme core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2 GlcNAcT). Core 2 O-glycans have been hypothesized to be essential for mucin production and selectin ligand biosynthesis. We report that mice lacking C2 GlcNAcT exhibit a restricted phenotype with neutrophilia and a partial deficiency of selectin ligands. Loss of core 2 oligosaccharides reduces neutrophil rolling on substrata bearing E-, L-, and P-selectins and neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation. However, the diminished presence of L-selectin ligands on lymph node high endothelial venules does not affect lymphocyte homing. These studies indicate that core 2 oligosaccharide biosynthesis segregates the physiologic roles of selectins and reveal a function for the C2 GlcNAcT in myeloid homeostasis and inflammation.","4845":"The action of adenoviral E1A oncoprotein on host immune-response genes has been attributed to interaction with p300\/CBP-type transcriptional coactivators in competition with endogenous transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. However, we show that mutant forms of E1A that no longer bind p300\/CBP can still interact directly with Stat1 (via E1A N-terminal and Stat1 C-terminal residues) and block IFNgamma-driven, Stat1-dependent gene activation and consequent function during early-phase infection in the natural host cell. The results provide a distinct and more specific mechanism for E1A-mediated immune suppression and an alternative model of IFNgamma-driven enhanceosome formation that may allow for other adaptors (in addition to p300\/CBP) to link Stat1 to the basal transcription complex.","4846":"Searching for an in vitro model for somatic hypermutation, we have identified an IgM-expressing Burkitt lymphoma line that constitutively diversifies its immunoglobulin V domain at high rate during culture. As in in vivo, the mutations are largely nucleotide substitutions with the pattern of substitutions revealing a component of the human hypermutation program that is preferentially targeted to G\/C residues. The substitutions frequently create stop codons with IgM-loss variants also being generated by V domain-specific deletions and duplications. However, in transfectants expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, many IgM-loss variants additionally arise through short nontemplated nucleotide insertions into the V (but not C) domain. Thus, antibody hypermutation is likely accompanied by DNA strand breaks scattered within the mutation domain.","4847":"We describe a model system for class switch recombination (CSR) using CH12F3-2 cells transfected with a DNA construct containing two S sequences transcribed by different promoters and separated by a viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Recombination observed using this system shares key properties with physiological CSR: deletion of DNA between two S regions, requirement for cytokine stimulation, and nonhomologous and no consensus breakpoint sequences. Studies on transfectants with variants of this construct led us to the following conclusions: (1) two S sequences are required for CSR; (2) isotype specificity of recombination is not determined by nucleotide sequences of S regions; (3) S sequences are not strand-specific; and (4) induction of recombination activity requires cytokine stimulation.","4848":"The transcription factor RelB had been shown to be important for dendritic cell (DC) development, but the type of DC involved was not clear. Here, we report that RelB mRNA is expressed strongly in CD8alpha- DEC-205- DC but only weakly in CD8alpha+ DEC-205+ DC. In addition, CD8alpha+ DEC-205+ DC are present and functional in RelB null mice, the DC deficiency being mainly in the CD8alpha- DEC-205- population. By constructing bone-marrow chimeric mice, we demonstrate that the partial deficiency in RelB null thymic DC is a secondary effect of disrupted thymic architecture. However, the deficiency in splenic CD8alpha- DEC-205- DC is a direct, stem cell intrinsic effect of the RelB mutation. Thus, RelB selectively regulates a myeloid-related DC lineage.","4849":"Despite years of investigation, precursor-progeny relationships within the developing lymphoid lineages of the hematopoietic system remain poorly defined. We have characterized the potential of precursors found within a subpopulation of fetal liver defined by AA4.1 and Fc gammaRII\/III expression and predominantly restricted to lymphoid and macrophage development. When cultured in methylcellulose with appropriate cytokines, AA4.1+\/Fc gammaR+ precursors generate colonies consisting of various lineages, including the combination of B cell, T cell, and macrophage. Retroviral marking studies showed that the lymphoid cells and macrophages within these colonies arise from a common precursor. These results demonstrate the presence of a common precursor with B cell-, T cell-, and macrophage-restricted potential and as such define an early restriction point within the fetal lymphoid system.","4850":"We have examined binding characteristics for a single TCR interacting with five of its different peptide\/MHC ligands using surface plasmon resonance. We find that very small structural changes produce ligands with similar equilibrium binding affinities (K(D)) for the TCR, but vastly different potencies for T cell activation. Ligands with similar K(D)s induce similar amounts of total phospho-zeta but distinct patterns of zeta phosphorylation. Lower potency ligands induce only incomplete phosphorylation of TCR zeta and generally have faster off-rates. Therefore, the potency of TCR ligands is primarily determined by the half-life of the TCR-ligand complex and the consequent ability to induce complete phosphorylation of zeta.","4851":"Superantigens (SAGs) are a class of immunostimulatory proteins of bacterial or viral origin that activate T cells by binding to the V beta domain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The three-dimensional structure of the complex between a TCR beta chain (mouse V beta8.2) and the SAG staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) at 2.4 A resolution reveals why SEB recognizes only certain V beta families, as well as why only certain SAGs bind mouse V beta8.2. Models of the TCR-SEB-peptide\/MHC class II complex indicate that V alpha interacts with the MHC beta chain in the TCR-SAG-MHC complex. The extent of the interaction is variable and is largely determined by the geometry of V alpha\/V beta domain association. This variability can account for the preferential expression of certain V alpha regions among T cells reactive with SEB.","4852":"We have identified RORgamma t, a novel, thymus-specific isoform of the orphan nuclear receptor RORgamma that is expressed predominantly in CD4+ CD8+ double-positive thymocytes. Ectopic expression of RORgamma t protects T cell hybridomas from activation-induced cell death by inhibiting the upregulation of Fas ligand. Following hybridoma stimulation, RORgamma t also inhibits IL-2 production but does not affect the induction of Nur-77 and Egr-3 nor the upregulation of CD69. Both the ligand-binding and DNA-binding domains of RORgamma t are required for this effect. We propose that the role of RORgamma t expression in immature thymocytes is to inhibit Fas ligand expression and cytokine secretion following engagement of their TCR during positive or negative selection.","4853":"GPI-linked proteins coassociate with intracellular tyrosine kinases in \"lipid rafts\" proposed to function as platforms for signal transduction and cytoskeletal reorganization. TCR activation requires both tyrosine kinase signals and cytoskeletal reorganization. How receptor engagement initiates cytoskeletal changes remains poorly understood. We investigated the consequences of recruiting GPI-linked CD48 and associated rafts to the site of T cell:APC contact by stimulating T cells with APCs that express the CD48 ligand CD2. We demonstrate that CD2:CD48 interactions enhance TCR-mediated functions. CD48\/TCR coengagement qualitatively and quantitatively enhances lipid raft-dependent zeta association with the actin cytoskeleton and zeta tyrosine phosphorylation. This implicates lipid rafts as sites where receptor-induced signals and cytoskeletal reorganization are integrated and reveals a novel component of accessory molecule function.","4854":"The Notch receptor and its ligands are involved in many developmental processes. They are highly expressed in the thymus and have been implicated in the CD4 versus CD8 lineage decision. We identified the constitutively active intracellular fragment of murine Notch-1 as capable of rendering thymomas resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. This effect was confirmed in other T cell lines and in CD4+ CD8+ DP thymocytes. Activation of the Notch signaling pathway also upregulated a number of other markers that, like steroid resistance, correlate with DP maturation into both the CD4 and CD8 lineages. These results suggest that Notch signaling is critically involved in the maturation of DP thymocytes into both CD4+ and CD8+ SP thymocytes.","4855":"Differentiating cells undergo programmed alterations in their patterns of gene expression, which are often regulated by structural changes in chromatin. Here we demonstrate that T cell differentiation results in long-range changes in the chromatin structure of effector cytokine genes, which persist in resting Th1 and Th2 cells in the absence of further stimulation. Differentiation of naive T helper cells into mature Th2 cells is associated with chromatin remodeling of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes, whereas differentiation into Th1 cells evokes remodeling of the IFNgamma but not IL-4 or IL-13 genes. IL-4 locus remodeling is accompanied by demethylation and requires both antigen stimulation and STAT6 activation. We propose that chromatin remodeling of cytokine gene loci is functionally associated with productive T cell differentiation and may explain the coordinate regulation of Th2 cytokine genes.","4856":"","4857":"Recently, the transcription factor GATA-3 was shown to be selectively expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells and to augment Th2-specific cytokines. Here, we show that loss of GATA-3 expression by developing Th1 cells requires IL-12 signaling through Stat4 and does not simply result from an absence of IL-4. Moreover, we demonstrate a novel role for GATA-3 in directly repressing Th1 development distinct from its positive actions on Th2-specific cytokines. GATA-3 inhibits Th1 cytokines by a cell-intrinsic mechanism that is not dependent on IL-4 and that may involve repression of IL-12 signaling. Thus, GATA-3 expression and IL-12 signaling are mutually antagonistic, which facilitates rapid dominance of one pathway during early Th development, producing a stable divergence in cytokine profiles.","4858":"The relationship of inflammation to autoimmunity has been long observed, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that islet-specific expression of TNFalpha in neonatal nonobese diabetic mice accelerated diabetes. In neonatal transgenic mice, disease was preceded by apoptosis of some beta cells, upregulation of MHC class I molecules on residual islet cells, and influx and activation of both antigen-presenting cells bearing MHC-islet peptide complexes and T cells. Infiltrating dendritic cells\/macrophages, but not B cells, from neonatal islets activated islet-specific T cells in vitro. Thus, inflammation can trigger autoimmunity by recruiting and activating dendritic cells\/macrophages to present self-antigens to autoreactive T cells.","4859":"The role of complement in the maintenance of self-tolerance has been examined in two models: an immunoglobulin transgenic model of peripheral tolerance and a lupus-like murine model of CD95 (Fas) deficiency. We find that self-reactive B lymphocytes deficient in complement receptors CD21\/CD35 or transferred into mice deficient in the complement protein C4 are not anergized by soluble self-antigen. In the second model, deficiency in CD21\/CD35 or C4 combined with CD95 deficiency results in high titers of anti-nuclear antibodies leading to severe lupus-like disease. These findings suggest a novel role for the complement system in B cell tolerance and provide insight into the genetic association of complement deficiency with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus.","4860":"Fas (CD95) and Fas ligand (FasL) play major roles in staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced peripheral deletion of Vbeta8+ T cells. We found that peripheral deletion was defective in radiation chimeras with non-functional tissue FasL, regardless of the FasL status of the bone marrow-derived cells. SEB induced a dramatic upregulation of FasL expression and function in nonlymphoid cells of liver and small intestine. This effect was resistant to inhibition by cyclosporin A, which also failed to inhibit peripheral deletion. In SCID animals nonlymphoid tissues did not express FasL in response to SEB unless transplanted lymphocytes were present. Thus, some immune responses induce FasL in nonlymphoid tissues, which in turn kills activated lymphocytes, leading to peripheral T cell deletion.","4861":"Peptide binding to class II MHC proteins occurs in acidic endosomal compartments following dissociation of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP). Based on peptide binding both to empty class II MHC and to molecules preloaded with peptides including CLIP, we find evidence for two isomeric forms of empty MHC. One (inactive) does not bind peptide. The other (active) binds peptide rapidly, with k(on) 1000-fold faster than previous estimates. The active isomer can be formed either by slow isomerization of the inactive molecule or by dissociation of a preformed peptide\/MHC complex. In the absence of peptide, the active isomer is unstable, rapidly converting to the inactive isomer. These results demonstrate that fast peptide binding is an inherent property of one isomer of empty class II MHC. Dissociation of peptides such as CLIP yields this transient, peptide-receptive isomer.","4862":"Immune responses to minor histocompatibility antigens are poorly understood and present substantial barriers to successful solid tissue and bone marrow transplantation among MHC-matched individuals. We exploited a unique positional cloning approach relying on the potent negative selection capability of cytotoxic T cells to identify the H3a gene responsible for immunodominant H2-Db-restricted determinants of the classically defined mouse autosomal H3 complex. The allelic basis for reciprocal H3a antigens is two amino acid changes within a single nonamer H2-Db-binding peptide. The H3a gene, now called Zfp106, encodes a 1888-amino acid protein with three zinc fingers and a beta-transducin domain consistent with DNA\/protein binding. A region of ZFP106 is identical to a 600-amino acid sequence implicated in the insulin receptor signaling pathway.","4863":"We have investigated the function of TIE2\/TEK receptor tyrosine kinase in the development of definitive hematopoiesis. In the vitelline artery at 9.5 days postcoitum (d.p.c.), TIE2+ hematopoietic cells aggregated and adhered to TIE2+ endothelial cells. Soluble TIE2-Fc chimeric protein inhibited the development of hematopoiesis and angiogenesis in the para-aortic splanchnopleural mesoderm (P-Sp) explant culture, and TIE2-deficient mice showed severely impaired definitive hematopoiesis. An in vitro study revealed that Angiopoietin-1 but not Angiopoietin-2 promoted the adhesion to fibronectin (FN) through integrins in TIE2-transfected cells and primary TIE2+ cells sorted from 9.5 d.p.c. P-Sp. Adhesion of TIE2+ cells induced by Angiopoietin-1 enhanced the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","4864":"The IL-15 receptor alpha subunit (IL-15Ralpha) mediates high-affinity binding of IL-15, a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in the development of innate immune cells. We have generated IL-15Ralpha null (IL-15Ralpha-\/-) mice to understand the role of IL-15Ralpha in immune development and function. IL-15Ralpha-\/- mice are markedly lymphopenic despite grossly normal T and B lymphocyte development. This lymphopenia is due to decreased proliferation and decreased homing of IL-15Ralpha-\/- lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes. These mice are also deficient in natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and TCRgammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes. In addition, memory phenotype CD8+ T cells are selectively reduced in number. Thus, IL-15Ralpha has pleiotropic roles in immune development and function, including the positive maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis.","4865":"The Schlafen (Slfn) family of genes are differentially regulated during thymocyte maturation and are preferentially expressed in the lymphoid tissues. Ectopic expression of the prototype member Slfn1 early in the T lineage profoundly alters cell growth and development. In these mice, the DP thymocytes fail to complete maturation, and, depending on the transgene dosage, the number of thymocytes is reduced to 1%-30% of normal. Furthermore, expression of the Schlafen family members in fibroblasts and thymoma cells either retards or ablates cell growth. The conceptual protein sequences deduced for each of the family members have no similarity to characterized proteins and must therefore participate in a heretofore unknown regulatory mechanism guiding both cell growth and T cell development.","4866":"The role of the pre-T cell receptor (TCR) in lineage commitment to the gammadelta versus alphabeta lineage of T cells was addressed by analyzing TCRbeta chain rearrangements in gammadelta T cells from wild-type and pre-TCR-deficient mice by single cell polymerase chain reaction. Results show that the pre-TCR selects against gammadelta T cells containing rearranged Vbeta genes and that gammadelta T cell precursors but not gammadelta T cells express the pre-TCRalpha protein. Furthermore, pre-TCR-induced proliferation could not be detected in gammadelta T cells. We propose that the pre-TCR commits developing T cells to the alphabeta lineage by an instructive mechanism that has largely replaced an evolutionary more ancient stochastic mechanism of lineage commitment.","4867":"Under most circumstances, allelic exclusion at the T cell receptor (TCR)beta locus is tightly regulated. Here, we describe a system in which TCRbeta allelic exclusion is overcome as a result of V(D)J recombination in peripheral CD4+ T cells. In TCRbeta chain transgenic mice, tolerogen-mediated chronic peripheral selection against cells expressing the transgene leads to surface expression of endogenous TCRbeta chains. Peripheral CD4+ T cells reexpress the recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2, and contain signal end intermediates indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination. The rescue from deletion of mature T cells expressing newly generated TCRbeta chains suggests that receptor revision plays a role in the maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance.","4868":"Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a critical regulator of early gene transcription in response to TCR-mediated signals. Here, we show that mice lacking both NFATp and NFAT4 develop a profound lymphoproliferative disorder likely due to a lowered threshold for TCR signaling coupled with increased resistance to apoptosis secondary to defective FasL expression. NFAT mutant mice also have allergic blepharitis, interstitial pneumonitis, and a 10(3) to 10(4) fold increase in serum IgG1 and IgE levels, secondary to a dramatic and selective increase in Th2 cytokines. This phenotype may be ascribed to unopposed occupancy of the IL-4 promoter by NFATc. Our data demonstrate that lymphoid homeostasis and Th2 activation require a critical balance among NFAT family members.","4869":"In this study, we present the further characterization of a mutant Jurkat T cell line, J.CaM2, that is defective in TCR-mediated signal transduction. Although initial TCR-mediated signaling events such as the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR-zeta chain and ZAP-70 are intact in J.CaM2, subsequent events, including increases in intracellular calcium, Ras activation, and IL-2 gene expression are defective. Subsequent analysis of J.CaM2 demonstrated a severe deficiency in pp36\/LAT expression, a recently cloned adaptor protein implicated in TCR signaling. Importantly, reexpression of LAT in J.CaM2 restored all aspects of TCR signaling. These results demonstrate a necessary and exclusive role for LAT in T cell activation.","4870":"Tyrosine phosphorylation of linker proteins enables the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-associated protein tyrosine kinases to phosphorylate and regulate effector molecules that generate second messengers. We demonstrate here that the SLP-76 linker protein interacts with both nck, an adaptor protein, and Vav, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho-family GTPases. The assembly of this tri-molecular complex permits the activated Rho-family GTPases to regulate target effectors that interact through nck. In turn, assembly of this complex mediates the enzymatic activation of the p21-activated protein kinase 1 and facilitates actin polymerization. Hence, phosphorylation of linker proteins not only bridges the TCR-associated PTK, ZAP-70, with downstream effector proteins, but also provides a scaffold to integrate distinct signaling complexes to regulate T cell function.","4871":"Syk-family tyrosine kinases are essential for lymphocyte development and activation. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify Syk kinases-interacting proteins (SKIPs), we isolated 3BP2, an Abl SH3-interacting protein of unknown function. 3BP2 was selectively expressed in hematopoietic\/lymphoid tissues and bound via its SH2 domain activated Syk-family kinases in mammalian cells, including in antigen receptor-stimulated T cells. In addition to Zap-70, the 3BP2 SH2 domain associated in vitro with LAT, Grb2, PLCgamma1, and Cbl from activated T cell lysates. Transient 3BP2 overexpression induced transcriptional activation of the IL-2 promoter and its NFAT or AP-1 elements. This activity was dependent on the SH2 and pleckstrin-homology domains of 3BP2, and required functional Syk kinases, Ras, and calcineurin. Thus, 3BP2 is an important adaptor that may couple activated Zap-70\/Syk to a LAT-containing signaling complex involved in TCR-mediated gene transcription.","4872":"","4873":"Precursor CD4+ T cells develop into effector Th1 and Th2 cells that play a central role in the immune response. We show that the JNK MAP kinase pathway is induced in Th1 but not in Th2 effector cells upon antigen stimulation. Further, the differentiation of precursor CD4+ T cells into effector Th1 but not Th2 cells is impaired in JNK2-deficient mice. The inability of IL-12 to differentiate JNK2-deficient CD4+ T cells fully into effector Th1 cells is caused by a defect in IFNgamma production during the early stages of differentiation. The addition of exogenous IFNgamma during differentiation restores IL-12-mediated Th1 polarization in the JNK2-deficient mice. The JNK MAP kinase signaling pathway, therefore, plays an important role in the balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses.","4874":"Clonal selection of T lymphocytes is essential for establishing self\/non-self discrimination of immune recognition. It is known that cell surface signals such as avidity and valency of TCR-ligand interactions influence the fate of individual thymocytes, founding a primary repertoire of T cells. However, intracellular signals that govern positive and negative selection in the thymus have been unclear. The present study using the retroviral gene transfer technique shows that MKK1 activation in developing T cells is sufficient for providing positive selection signals. We also show that the MKK6-p38 signaling pathway is critically involved in inducing negative selection of thymocytes. These results suggest that intracellular signals through different MAP kinase cascades selectively guide positive and negative selection of T lymphocytes.","4875":"In this report we have investigated the role of the Ets-1 transcription factor in the differentiation of the NK cell lineage in mice. Splenic NK cells express high levels of Ets-1. Ets-1-deficient mice produced by gene targeting developed mature erythrocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and T and B lymphocytes. However, spleens from the Ets-1-deficient mice contained significantly reduced numbers of natural killer (NK) cells, and splenocytes from these mice lacked detectable cytolytic activity against NK cell targets in vitro. Moreover, unlike wild-type animals, Ets-1-deficient mice developed tumors following subcutaneous injection of NK-susceptible RMA-S cells. These NK cell defects could not be correlated with defects in the expression of IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 or the IL-2 or IL-15 receptors. Thus, Ets-1 defines a novel transcriptional pathway that is required for the development of the NK cell lineage in mice.","4876":"Aiolos encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in mature B cells and is homologous to Ikaros. In the periphery of mice homozygous for an Aiolos-null mutation, B cells exhibit an activated cell surface phenotype and undergo augmented antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated in vitro proliferative responses, even at limiting amounts of stimulant. In vivo, T cell-dependent B cell responses, including the formation of germinal centers and elevated serum IgG and IgE, are detected in Aiolos-deficient mice in the absence of immunization. Auto-antibodies and development of B cell lymphomas are frequently seen among aging Aiolos mutants. In sharp contrast to conventional B cells, B cells of the peritoneum, of the marginal zone, and the recirculating bone marrow population are greatly reduced.","4877":"In type III bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) patients, defects in the RFX protein complex result in a lack of MHC class II and reduced MHC class I cell surface expression. Using type III BLS cell lines, we demonstrate that the RFX subunits RFX5 and RFXAP are crucial for constitutive and CIITA-induced MHC class I and beta2m transactivation. Similar to MHC class II, the promoters of MHC class I and beta2m contain an S-X-Y region of which the X1 box is crucial for constitutive and CIITA-induced MHC class I and beta2m transactivation. Thus, the RFX complex is part of a regulatory pathway linking the transactivation of MHC class I and II and their accessory genes.","4878":"The crystal structure of the two immunoglobulin variable-like domains of the murine CD8alphaalpha homodimer complexed to the class I MHC H-2Kb molecule at 2.8 A resolution shows that CD8alphaalpha binds to the protruding MHC alpha3 domain loop in an antibody-like manner. Comparison of mouse CD8alphaalpha\/H-2Kb and human CD8alphaalpha\/HLA-A2 complexes reveals shared as well as species-specific recognition features. In both species, coreceptor function apparently involves the participation of CD8 dimer in a bidentate attachment to an MHC class I molecule in conjunction with a T cell receptor without discernable conformational alteration of the peptide or MHC antigen-presenting platform.","4879":"A novel 75 kDa membrane protein, TIRC7, is described that exhibits a central role in T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Modulation of TIRC7-mediated signals with specific anti-TIRC7 antibodies in vitro efficiently prevents human T cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Moreover, anti-TIRC7 antibodies specifically inhibit type 1 subset specific IFN-gamma expression but spare the type 2 cytokine IL-4. Diminished proliferation but not IFN-gamma secretion is reversible by exogenous rIL-2. An anti-TIRC7 antibody that cross-reacts with the 75 kDa rat homolog exhibits inhibition of rat alloimmune response in vitro and significantly prolongs kidney allograft survival in vivo. Targeting of TIRC7 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for modulation of the immune response.","4880":"CD4 and CD8 are crucial for the development and function of T cells. An intergenic deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitive site region (cluster CIII) directs expression in mature CD8 T cells only. Here, we show that two further independent regions from the CD8 gene locus in conjunction with cluster CIII restore transgene expression in appropriate immature thymocytes. Deletion of two of the intergenic cluster CIII DNaseI-HSS in homozygous mutant mice affects expression of CD8alphaalpha homodimers on intraepithelial T cells (IEL), particularly on the gammadeltaTCR+ subset. Surprisingly, none of the thymocyte or peripheral alphabetaTCR T cell subsets are affected by this mutation, indicating hierarchical activation of these elements within the different T cell subsets.","4881":"We and others have recently identified a CD8 locus enhancer (E8) that directs expression in mature CD8 single-positive thymocytes and peripheral CD8+ T cells and in extrathymically derived intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). In this study, we show that deletion of E8, by homologous recombination results in reduced CD8alphaalpha homodimer expression on IEL. Since CD8 expression on thymus-derived T cells was normal, other enhancers regulate CD8 expression in these cells. By exploiting a transgenic reporter expression assay, we identified three additional enhancers that directed expression in diverse thymocyte subsets and mature T cells but not in CD8alphaalpha+ IEL. The results suggest that CD8alpha expression is primarily regulated by E8, in IEL and by the novel enhancers in the thymus-dependent lineages.","4882":"We describe antagonist peptides that specifically inhibit cytolytic activity of T cell clones and lines that express the antigen-specific receptor of CD8+ T lymphocyte clone 2C, which recognizes peptides in association with syngeneic (Kb) and allogeneic (Ld) MHC proteins. Addition of an antagonist peptide that can bind to Kb on 2C cells decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3 zeta chains elicited by prior exposure of the cells to an agonist peptide-Kb complex. Contrary to previous agonist-antagonist comparisons, the 2C T cell receptor had higher affinity for an antagonist peptide-Kb complex than for a weak agonist peptide-Kb complex. This difference is considered in light of evidence that antigen-specific receptor affinity values can be substantially higher when determined with the receptor on live cells than with the receptor in cell-free systems.","4883":"Physiologically, TCR signaling is unlikely to result from the cross-linking of TCR-CD3 complexes, given the low density of specific peptide-MHC complexes on antigen-presenting cells. We therefore have tested directly an alternative model for antigen recognition. We show that monomers of soluble peptide-MHC trigger Ca2+ responses in CD8alphabeta+ T cells. This response is not observed in CD8- T cells and when either the CD8:MHC or CD8:Lck interactions are prevented. This demonstrates that an intact CD8 coreceptor is necessary for effective TCR signaling in response to monomeric peptide-MHC molecules. We propose that this heterodimerization of TCR and CD8 by peptide-MHC corresponds to the physiological event normally involved during antigen-specific signal transduction.","4884":"While much is known about intracellular signaling events in T cells when T cell receptors (TCRs) are engaged, the mechanism by which signaling is initiated is unclear. We have constructed defined oligomers of soluble antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the natural ligands for the TCR. Using these to stimulate specific T cells in vitro, we find that agonist peptide\/MHC ligands are nonstimulatory as monomers and minimally stimulatory as dimers. Similarly, a partial-agonist ligand is very weakly active as a tetramer. In contrast, trimeric or tetrameric agonist ligands that engage multiple TCRs for a sustained duration are potent stimuli. Ligand-driven formation of TCR clusters seems required for effective activation and helps to explain the specificity and sensitivity of T cells.","4885":"The functional status of CD4+ T cells during establishment of persistent infection with the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus was assessed and compared to that of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Functionality of virus-specific CD4+ T cells was measured by proliferative responses, cytokine secretion, cognate help, and IFNgamma-mediated protection against challenge infection with recombinant vaccinia virus. Functional CD4+ T cells were induced early after infection and remained measurable up to 6 weeks but then were rendered unresponsive. In contrast, CD8+ T cells were functionally inactivated within 10-15 days. Importantly, functional inactivation of virus-specific CD4+ T cells during persistent viral infection seemed to be critical for the survival of the host.","4886":"mel-18 is a mammalian Polycomb group gene encoding a transcriptional repressor with tumor suppressive activity. Overexpression of mel-18 in mice results in cell cycle arrest of B cells upon B cell receptor stimulation with downregulation of c-myc. This phenotype is rescued in mel-18\/c-myc double-transgenic mice, suggesting that c-myc locates downstream of mel-18. In mel-18 transgenic mice, the downregulation of cyclins D2 and E; CDK4, -6, and -7; and CDC25A causes the impairment in the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases, resulting in hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. In contrast, the upregulation of c-Myc, CDC25, and CDC2\/CDK2 kinase activities results in the augmentation of B cell proliferation in mel-18-deficient mice. We therefore propose that mel-18 negatively regulates the cell cycle through a c-myc\/cdc25 cascade.","4887":"","4888":"We report that Th2 cell cultures generated using T cells or splenocytes from IL-13-deficient mice produce significantly reduced levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 compared with wild-type. In contrast, IL-4 and IL-5 production by mast cells stimulated in vitro with PMA, ionomycin, or IgE cross-linking are unaffected. In vitro Th2 cell differentiation cannot be rescued by the addition of exogenous factors, but in vivo antigen challenge and administration of IL-13 can increase Th2-like cytokine responses as can infection with the parasitic nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. IL-13-deficient mice also have lower basal levels of serum IgE and biased antigen-specific immunoglobulin responses. Thus, IL-13 is an important regulator of Th2 commitment and may therefore play a central role in atopy and infectious diseases.","4889":"Qa-1b and its human homolog, HLA-E, predominantly bind leader peptides derived from other class I molecules. Their presentation is TAP-dependent and proteasome-independent. We demonstrate that Dd targeted to the cytosol does not generate the Qa-1b peptide epitope even in the presence of lactacystin. Cells expressing herpes virus ICP-47 block the generation of this epitope, demonstrating that TAP functions in the transport of the peptide from cytosol to ER. This reveals a pathway for antigen presentation of leader peptides that involves translocation of a protein to the ER where its leader is cleaved followed by its release into the cytosol and transport back into the ER. Further, it ensures that Qa-1b expression mirrors the normal expression of class Ia molecules.","4890":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a persistent latent infection in peripheral B lymphocytes in humans and is associated with a variety of malignancies and proliferative disorders. Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is one of only two viral proteins expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes in vivo. LMP2A blocks B cell receptor (BCR) signal transduction in vitro by binding the Syk and Lyn protein tyrosine kinases. To analyze the significance of LMP2A expression in vivo, transgenic mice with B cell lineage expression of LMP2A were generated. LMP2A expression results in the bypass of normal B lymphocyte developmental checkpoints allowing immunoglobulin-negative cells to colonize peripheral lymphoid organs, indicating that LMP2A possesses a constitutive signaling activity in nontransformed cells.","4891":"Epstein-Barr virus establishes latency in vitro by activating human B cells to become proliferating blasts, but in vivo it is benign. In the peripheral blood, the virus resides latently in resting B cells that we now show are restricted to the sIgD memory subset. However, in tonsils the virus shows no such restriction. We propose that EBV indiscriminately infects B cells in mucosal lymphoid tissue and that these cells differentiate to become resting memory B cells that then enter the circulation. Activation to the blastoid stage of latency is an essential intermediate step in this process. Thus, EBV may persist by exploiting the mechanisms that produce and maintain long-term B cell memory.","4892":"H2-M (HLA-DM in humans) resides in an acidic endosomal compartment, where it facilitates the loading of antigenic peptides into the peptide-binding groove of class II MHC. The crystal structure of a soluble form of H2-M has been solved to 3.1 A resolution, revealing a heterodimer with structural similarities to the MHC family of proteins. In contrast to its antigen-presenting cousins, the membrane distal alpha helices of H2-M pack closely together, occluding most of the binding groove except for a single large pocket near the center. The structure of H2-M has several unique features that may play a role in its function as a molecular chaperone and peptide exchange factor.","4893":"The three-dimensional structure of the soluble ecto-domain of HLA-DM has been determined to 2.5 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. HLA-DM has both peptide exchange activity and acts as a chaperone to peptide-free class II MHC molecules. As predicted, the structure is similar to that of classical class II MHC molecules except that the peptide-binding site is altered to an almost fully closed groove. An unusual cavity is found at the center of the region that binds peptides in class II MHC molecules, and a tryptophanrich lateral surface is identified that is a candidate both for binding to HLA-DR, to effect catalysis, and to HLA-DO, an inhibitor.","4894":"The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) consists of Ku70, Ku80, and a large catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. Targeted inactivation of the Ku70 or Ku80 genes results in elevated ionizing radiation (IR) sensitivity and inability to perform both V(D)J coding-end and signal (RS)-end joining in cells, with severe growth retardation plus immunodeficiency in mice. In contrast, we now demonstrate that DNA-PKcs-null mice generated by gene-targeted mutation, while also severely immunodeficient, exhibit no growth retardation. Furthermore, DNA-PKcs-null cells are blocked for V(D)J coding-end joining, but retain normal RS-end joining. Finally, while DNA-PK-null fibroblasts exhibited increased IR sensitivity, DNA-PKcs-deficient ES cells did not. We conclude that Ku70 and Ku80 may have functions in V(D)J recombination and DNA repair that are independent of DNA-PKcs.","4895":"The DNA-dependent protein kinase is a mammalian protein complex composed of Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs subunits that has been implicated in DNA double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. Here, by gene targeting, we have constructed a mouse with a disruption in the kinase domain of DNA-PKcs, generating an animal model completely devoid of DNA-PK activity. Our results demonstrate that DNA-PK activity is required for coding but not for signal join formation in mice. Although our DNA-PKcs defective mice closely resemble Scid mice, they differ by having elevated numbers of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. This suggests that the Scid mice may not represent a null phenotype and may retain some residual DNA-PKcs function.","4896":"Natural killer T (NKT) cells express a T cell receptor (TCR) and markers common to NK cells, including NK1.1. In vivo, NKT cells are triggered by anti-CD3epsilon MAb to rapidly produce large amounts of IL-4 and by IL-12 to reject tumors. We show here that anti-CD3epsilon MAb treatment rapidly depletes the liver (and partially the spleen) of NKT cells and that homeostasis is achieved 1 to 2 days later via NKT cell proliferation that occurs mainly in bone marrow. Similar results were obtained in mice treated with IL-12. Collectively, our data demonstrate that peripheral NKT cells are highly sensitive to activation-induced cell death and that bone marrow plays a major role in restoring NKT cell homeostasis.","4897":"The recognition of HLA-C molecules by specific inhibitory receptors is a crucial step in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell function. Using soluble, recombinant HLA-C molecules and NK inhibitory receptors (NKIR, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily), we show that HLA-C binds to NKIR molecules with extremely fast association and dissociation rates, among the fastest of the immune system interactions so far studied. These kinetics may be essential for the biological function of NK cells, i.e., to facilitate the rapid immunosurveillance of cells for absent or diminished expression of class I MHC proteins.","4898":"We have identified a novel lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein localized on chromosome 3q26.3-q27, DC-LAMP, which is homologous to CD68. DC-LAMP mRNA is present only in lymphoid organs and DC. A specific MAb detects the protein exclusively in interdigitating dendritic cells. Expression of DC-LAMP increases progressively during in vitro DC differentiation, but sharply upon activation with LPS, TNFalpha, or CD40L. Confocal microscopy confirmed the lysosomal distribution of the protein. Furthermore, DC-LAMP was found in the MHC class II compartment immediately before the translocation of MHC class II molecules to the cell surface, after which it concentrates into perinuclear lysosomes. This suggests that DC-LAMP might change the lysosome function after the transfer of peptide-MHC class II molecules to the surface of DC.","4899":"We analyzed the expression of an IL-12 receptor by fresh dendritic cells (DC) and a DC line. Using RT-PCR, RNAse protection, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis, we found that DC possess an IL-12 receptor with beta1 subunit (downstream box 1)-related differences from that on T cells. IL-12 signaling through this receptor involved members of the NF-KB but not STAT family. The unique properties of the IL-12 receptor on DC, characterized by a single class of binding sites with a Kd of about 325 pM, may underlie rather unique effects, such as IFNgamma-independent augmentation of class II antigen expression and priming for LPS-induced production of IL-12.","4900":"Clonal selection theories postulate that lymphocyte fate is regulated by antigen receptor specificity. However, lymphocyte apoptosis is induced through nonantigen-specific receptors such as Fas (CD95\/APO-1) or TNFR. We define a selective TCR that controls apoptosis by Fas or TNFR stimulation. Variant ligands can deliver this \"competence to die\" signal without the full TCR signals necessary for cytokine synthesis. These partial agonists regulate T cell deletion in vivo even when Fas or TNF is provided by T cells of unrelated specificity, but they do not cause the liver necrosis that is associated with T cell elimination by the full agonist. Thus, selective signaling ligands regulate T cell deletion and immune damage in vivo and may be important for peripheral T cell tolerance.","4901":"Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a family of four related transcription factors implicated in cytokine and early response gene expression in activated lymphocytes. Here we report that NFAT4, in contrast to NFATp and NFATc, is preferentially expressed in DP thymocytes. Mice lacking NFAT4 have impaired development of CD4 and CD8 SP thymocytes and peripheral T cells as well as hyperactivation of peripheral T cells. The thymic defect is characterized by increased apoptosis of DP thymocytes. The increased apoptosis and hyperactivation may reflect heightened sensitivity to TcR-mediated signaling. Further, mice lacking NFAT4 have impaired production of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein. NFAT4 thus plays an important role in the successful generation and survival of T cells.","4902":"","4903":"Using a sensitive molecular marker for positive selection, the appearance of a particular functional TCR alpha chain sequence in cells from mice bearing a transgenic beta chain, we address several aspects of intrathymic T cell development. First, by examining specific TCR prior to and after maturation, we demonstrate how a restricted TCR repertoire is positively selected from a highly diverse immature TCR repertoire. Second, since this molecular marker is enriched in cells progressing toward the CD4 lineage and depleted in cells progressing toward the CD8 lineage, a map of the developmental pathway of alphabeta thymocytes can be inferred. Third, the first cells that show clear signs of positive intrathymic selection are identified.","4904":"Human immunodeficiency virus, generated during contact between HIV-infected cells and the apical surface of an epithelial cell, can cross a tight epithelial barrier by transcytosis. We show that transcytosis of primary HIV isolates is blocked by dimeric IgA or IgM against HIV envelope proteins. Neutralization occurs intracellularly within the apical recycling endosome, and immune complexes are specifically recycled to the mucosal surface. One epitope involved in neutralization is a conserved sequence of the gp41 HIV envelope protein subunit. Finally, transcytosis also occurs across functional human mucosal tissue in a process inhibited by a serosal internalization of IgM against the HIV envelope protein. These results suggest that induction of mucosal immunity to HIV envelope proteins may impair the transcytotic route of HIV mucosal transmission.","4905":"Homozygous targeted disruption of the mouse Caspase 8 (Casp8) gene was found to be lethal in utero. The Caspase 8 null embryos exhibited impaired heart muscle development and congested accumulation of erythrocytes. Recovery of hematopoietic colony-forming cells from the embryos was very low. In fibroblast strains derived from these embryos, the TNF receptors, Fas\/Apo1, and DR3 were able to activate the Jun N-terminal kinase and to trigger IkappaB alpha phosphorylation and degradation. They failed, however, to induce cell death, while doing so effectively in wild-type fibroblasts. These findings indicate that Caspase 8 plays a necessary and nonredundant role in death induction by several receptors of the TNF\/NGF family and serves a vital role in embryonal development.","4906":"As the rate of Ig gene hypermutation approximates the level of nucleotide discrimination of DNA polymerases (10(-3) to 10(-4)), a local inhibition of proofreading and mismatch repair during semiconservative replication could generate the mutations introduced by the process. To address this question, we have constructed transgenic mice that carry a hypermutation substrate containing a \"polymerase slippage trap\": an Ig gene with a mono or dinucleotide tract inserted in its V region. The low amount of slippage events as compared to the number of mutations, the absence of transient misalignment mutations at the border of the repeats, and the dissociation between the amount of frameshifts and mutations when the transgene is put on mismatch repair-deficient genetic backgrounds, suggest that Ig gene hypermutation occurs by an error-prone short patch DNA synthesis taking place outside global DNA replication.","4907":"We used our monoclonal model of germinal center maturation, CL-01 B cells, to investigate the role of CD30 in human B cell differentiation. CL-01 cells are IgM+ IgD+ CD30+ and switch to IgG, IgA, and IgE when exposed to CD40L and IL-4. Switching is hampered by CD30 coengagement, possibly through interference with the CD40-mediated NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation of downstream C(H) genes. The physiological relevance of this phenomenon is emphasized by similar CD30-mediated effects in naive B cells. Expression of CD30 by these cells is induced by CD40L but is inhibited by B cell receptor coengagement and\/or exposure to IL-6 and IL-12. Our data suggest that CD30 critically regulates the CD40-mediated differentiation of non-antigen-selected human B cells.","4908":"The linker molecule LAT is a critical substrate of the tyrosine kinases activated upon TCR engagement. Phosphorylated LAT binds Grb2, PLC-gamma1, and other signaling molecules. We demonstrate that human LAT is palmitoylated and that palmitoylated LAT predominantly localizes into glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs). Although the LAT transmembrane domain is sufficient for membrane localization, palmitoylation at C26 and C29 is essential for efficient partitioning into GEMs. LAT palmitoylation is necessary for its tyrosine phosphorylation. After T cell activation, most tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT molecules and a fraction of PLC-gamma1 and other signaling molecules are present in GEMs. LAT is central to T cell activation and is a novel linker molecule shown to require targeting to membrane microdomains for signaling.","4909":"Helper T (Th) cell differentiation is highly regulated by cytokines but initiated by mitogens. By examining gene expression in discrete generations of dividing cells, we have delineated the relationship between proliferation and differentiation. Initial expression of IL-2 is cell cycle-independent, whereas effector cytokine expression is cell cycle-dependent. IFNgamma expression increases in frequency with successive cell cycles, while IL-4 expression requires three cell divisions. Cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to relieve epigenetic repression and can be supplanted by agents that hyperacetylate histones and demethylate DNA. Terminally differentiated cells exhibit stable epigenetic modification and cell cycle-independent gene expression. These data reveal a novel mechanism governing Th cell fate that initially integrates proliferative and differentiative signals and subsequently maintains stability of the differentiated state.","4910":"To study the in vivo role of IL-4-expressing cells, we developed a strategy to tag these cells, by generating mice in which one IL-4 allele was replaced with a cDNA encoding the human CD2 (huCD2) cell-surface molecule. Expression of the huCD2 reporter was, like IL-4, restricted to the appropriately polarized T helper 2 cells. However, most of the cells expressed only the IL-4 or the targeted allele. Analysis of the frequency of monoallelic versus biallelic expression suggests that the activation of each individual allele is regulated by a stochastic process whose probability can be augmented by increasing the strength of signal delivered through the TCR. Allele-specific activation may be a general feature of cytokine regulation that contributes to the functional diversity within T helper cell subpopulations.","4911":"Production of interleukin (IL)-2 by T lymphocytes is one of the earliest events during immune response. A mutant mouse strain was generated by replacing the IL-2 gene with a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). In this model, GFP fluorescence is readily detectable upon T cell activation and is mostly coexpressed with IL-2 at the single cell level. Thus, individual activated T cells can express the IL-2 gene biallelically. Upon stimulation through the T cell antigen receptor, CD4+ cells separate into distinct GFP+ and GFP- populations, both of which are capable of differentiating into either Th1 or Th2 effectors. These mice allow noninvasive detection of IL-2 production by single cells and analysis of the subsequent differentiative fate of these cells as an immune response develops.","4912":"The structure of H-2Dd complexed with the HIV-derived peptide P18-I10 (RGPGRAFVTI) has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.4 A resolution. This MHC class I molecule has an unusual binding motif with four anchor residues in the peptide (G2, P3, R\/K\/H5, and I\/L\/F9 or 10). The cleft architecture of H-2Dd includes a deep narrow passage accomodating the N-terminal part of the peptide, explaining the obligatory G2P3 anchor motif. Toward the C-terminal half of the peptide, p5R to p8V form a type I' reverse turn; residues p6A to p9T, and in particular p7F, are readily exposed. The structure is discussed in relation to functional data available for T cell and natural killer cell recognition of the H-2Dd molecule.","4913":"We recently identified a fetal thymic developmental stage (NK1.1+\/CD117(lo)) that characterizes committed T\/NK progenitors. We now report the existence of phenotypically and functionally identical T\/NK progenitors in mouse fetal blood and spleen but not in fetal liver. These precursors are indistinguishable from previously characterized fetal blood \"prothymocytes\" (CD90+\/CD117(lo)), with the exception that they express NK1.1, lack markers associated with T lineage commitment, maintain a germline TCRbeta locus, and can give rise to both T and NK cells. Moreover, NK1.1+\/CD90+\/CD117(lo) fetal blood precursors are present in athymic nude mice. These results suggest that the T\/NK lineage commitment pathway is thymus-independent. In contrast, full commitment to the alphabeta T lineage does not precede thymus colonization.","4914":"Previous studies have analyzed the diversity of T cell responses upon immunization. Little is known, however, about the individual variability of naive repertoires and its influence on immune responses. In the present study, T cells specific for a Kd-restricted epitope derived from HLA-A2 were purified from individual immunized mice using tetramers of MHC-peptide. Their TCRbeta chains were sequenced revealing strong biases but large variations in BJ usage and clonal composition. Most importantly, sequence analysis from nonimmunized mice demonstrated the preexistence of a small set of splenic precursors, distinct in each mouse and comprising less than 200 cells. Therefore, differences in precursor pools appear to be the major source of individual variability in antigen-selected repertoires.","4915":"Distinct subsets of gammadelta T cells expressing different Vgamma and Vdelta chains arise in ordered waves during thymic development. In the murine Jgamma1-Cgamma1 cluster, the Vgamma3 gene segment is utilized earliest in fetal thymic development, in progenitors of dendritic epidermal T cells (DECs). The Vgamma2 gene segment predominates in the late fetal stages and beyond, in cells destined for the secondary lymphoid organs. Using transgenic TCRgamma recombination substrates, we demonstrate that this restricted Vgamma gene usage is determined by developmentally targeted gene rearrangement. We show that sequences immediately upstream of the Vgamma2 and Vgamma3 genes direct the rearrangement pattern in adult thymocytes. Thus, the choice of Vgamma gene for recombination is coordinated with distinct differentiation programs in gammadelta subsets.","4916":"","4917":"MyD88, originally isolated as a myeloid differentiation primary response gene, is shown to act as an adaptor in interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling by interacting with both the IL-1 receptor complex and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK). Mice generated by gene targeting to lack MyD88 have defects in T cell proliferation as well as induction of acute phase proteins and cytokines in response to IL-1. Increases in interferon-gamma production and natural killer cell activity in response to IL-18 are abrogated. In vivo Th1 response is also impaired. Furthermore, IL-18-induced activation of NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is blocked in MyD88-\/- Th1-developing cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MyD88 is a critical component in the signaling cascade that is mediated by IL-1 receptor as well as IL-18 receptor.","4918":"Likely creation of mismatches during somatic hypermutation has stimulated interest in the effect of mismatch repair deficiency on the process. Analysis of unselected mutations in the 3' flank of VH rearrangements in germinal center B cells revealed that MSH2 deficiency caused a 5-fold reduced mutation accumulation. This might reflect ectopic effects of the Msh2 disruption; indeed, the mice exhibit other perturbations within the B cell compartment. However, that MSH2 (or factors dependent upon it) plays a role in the mechanism of mutation fixation is indicated by a strikingly increased focusing of the mutations on intrinsic hot spots. We propose two phases to hypermutation targeting. The first is hot spot focused and MSH2 independent; the second, MSH2-dependent phase yields a more even spread of mutation fixation.","4919":"Primary responses to the hapten phenyloxazolone and chronic responses to environmental antigens occurring in Peyer's patches were analyzed in two different mismatch repair-deficient backgrounds. Paradoxically, whereas primary responses were found normal in MSH2- and only slightly diminished in PMS2-deficient mice, mutations in Peyer's patch B cells from both k.o. animals were reduced three times, the subset of Peyer's patch B cells with highly mutated sequences being specifically missing in the mismatch repair-deficient context. Strikingly, germinal center B cells from Peyer's patches of k.o. animals showed microsatellite instability at an unprecedented level. We thus propose that the amount of DNA damages generated prevents these cells from recycling in germinal centers and that mismatch repair deficiency is only the indirect cause of the lower mutation incidence observed.","4920":"Protein interactions with V(D)J recombination signal sequences (RSSs) were mapped in complexes containing RAG1 with (M1\/2) or without (M1) RAG2. In both complexes, RAG interactions with the DNA backbone are biased toward one side of the helix; nonamer contacts resemble those of Hin with hixL. In the M1 complex, DNA contacts are centered on the nonamer. In the M1\/2 complex, protein-RSS interactions extend through the spacer and into the nonamer-proximal portion of the heptamer. Chemical modifications near the heptamer-coding junction are overrepresented in the M1\/2 complex, providing evidence for perturbation of DNA structure in this region. Thus, while RAG1 alone can bind the nonamer, RAG2 is required for heptamer occupancy.","4921":"Three mutant immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) insertion mice were generated in which a targeted nonfunctional IgH passenger transgene was either devoid of promoter (pdelta) or was placed under the transcriptional control of either its own RNA polymerase II-dependent IgH promoter (pII) or a RNA polymerase I-dependent promoter (pI). While the transgene mutation-frequency (0.85%) in memory B cells of pI mice was reduced compared to that in pII mice (1.4%), the distribution and the base exchange pattern of point mutations were comparable. In pdelta mice, the mutation frequency was drastically reduced (0.09%). The mutation frequencies correlated with the levels of transgene-specific pre-mRNA expressed in germinal center B cells isolated from the mutant mice.","4922":"Linker or adapter proteins provide mechanisms by which receptors can amplify and regulate downstream effector proteins. We describe here the identification of a novel B cell linker protein, termed BLNK, that interfaces the B cell receptor-associated Syk tyrosine kinase with PLCgamma, the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the Grb2 and Nck adapter proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk provides docking sites for these SH2-containing effector molecules that, in turn, permits the phosphorylation and\/or activation of their respective signaling pathways. Hence, BLNK represents a central linker protein that bridges the B cell receptor-associated kinases with a multitude of signaling pathways and may regulate the biologic outcomes of B cell function and development.","4923":"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a human X-linked immunodeficiency resulting from mutations in a gene (WASP) encoding a cytoplasmic protein implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. To elucidate WASP function, we disrupted the WASP gene in mice by gene-targeted mutation. WASP-deficient mice showed apparently normal lymphocyte development, normal serum immunoglobulin levels, and the capacity to respond to both T-dependent and T-independent type II antigens. However, these mice did have decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte and platelet numbers and developed chronic colitis. Moreover, purified WASP-deficient T cells showed markedly impaired proliferation and antigen receptor cap formation in response to anti-CD3epsilon stimulation. Yet, purified WASP-deficient B cells showed normal responses to anti-Ig stimulation. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding WASP function in receptor signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization in T and B cells and compare the effects of WASP deficiency in mice and humans.","4924":"We investigated lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF function in lymph node genesis and cellular organization by manipulating LTbeta-R and TNF-R signaling. Lymph nodes developed in LTalpha-\/- mice treated in utero with agonist anti-LTbeta-R monoclonal antibody. Thus, LTbeta-R signaling mediates lymph node genesis. Surprisingly, mucosal lymph nodes that can develop independently of LTalphabeta\/LTbeta-R interaction were generated. Normal mice treated in utero with LTbeta-R-Ig and TNF-R55-Ig or anti-TNF lacked all lymph nodes, indicating that TNF signaling contributes to lymph node genesis. Lymph nodes generated in LTalpha-\/- mice had disrupted cellular organization. Therefore, LTbeta-R signaling during gestation is not sufficient to establish normal cellular microarchitecture. We conclude that LT and TNF play critical roles in the genesis and cellular organization of lymph nodes.","4925":"Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbetaR)-\/- mice were created by gene targeting. LTbetaR-\/- mice lacked Peyer's patches, colon-associated lymphoid tissues, and all lymph nodes. Mucosa patrolling alphaEbeta7high integrin+ T cells were virtually absent. Spleens lost marginal zones; T\/B cell segregation and follicular dendritic cell networks were absent. Peanut agglutinin+ cells were aberrantly detectable around central arterioles. In contrast to TNF receptor p55-\/- mice, antibody affinity maturation was impaired. Since LTbetaR-\/- mice exhibit distinct defects when compared to LTalpha-\/- and LTbeta-\/- mice, it is suggested that the LTbetaR integrates signals from other TNF family members. Thus, the LTbetaR proves pivotal for the ontogeny of the secondary lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, affinity maturation is dependent on LTalpha1beta2 rather than on LTalpha3.","4926":"Fas-deficient (Fas(lpr\/lpr)) mice constitutively expressing Bcl-2 in myeloid cells by the hMRP8 promoter often develop a fatal disease analogous to human acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-M2). Hematopoietic cells from leukemic Fas(lpr\/lpr)hMRP8bcl-2 animals form clonogenic blast colonies in vitro and can transfer disease to wild-type mice. In vitro ligation of Fas on Fas+\/+ hMRP8bcl-2 marrow cells depletes approximately 50% of myeloid progenitor activity, demonstrating that Bcl-2 can only partially block Fas-mediated death signals in myelomonocytic progenitors. In addition, Fas(lpr\/lpr) marrow contains greatly increased numbers of myeloid colony-forming cells as compared to Fas+\/+ controls. Taken together, these data suggest that Fas has a novel role in the regulation of myelopoiesis and that Fas may act as a tumor suppressor to control leukemogenic transformation in myeloid progenitor cells.","4927":"Self-reactive B cells Tg for both a bcl-xL death inhibitory gene and an Ig receptor recognizing hen egg lysozyme (HEL-Ig) efficiently escaped developmental arrest and deletion in mice expressing membrane-bound self-antigen (mHEL). In response to the same antigen, Tg HEL-Ig B cells not expressing bcl-xL were deleted, while cells expressing bcl-2 were arrested at the immature B stage. Bcl-xL Tg B cells escaping negative selection were anergic in both in vitro and in vivo assays and showed some evidence for receptor editing. These studies suggest that Bcl-x may have a distinct role in controlling survival at the immature stage of B cell development and demonstrate that tolerance is preserved when self-reactive B cells escape central deletion.","4928":"Expression of a dominant negative mutant IFNgammaR1 in murine SCK and K1735 tumor cells rendered them relatively unresponsive to IFNgamma in vitro and more tumorigenic and less responsive to IL-12 therapy in vivo. IL-12 induced histologic evidence of ischemic damage only in IFNgamma-responsive tumors, and in vivo Matrigel vascularization assays revealed that while IFNgamma-responsive and -unresponsive tumor cells induced angiogenesis equally well, IL-12 and its downstream mediator IFNgamma only inhibited angiogenesis induced by the responsive cells. IL-12 induced angiogenesis inhibitory activity in the responsive cells, which may be attributable to production of the chemokine IP-10. Thus, IL-12 and IFNgamma inhibit tumor growth by inducing tumor cells to generate antiangiogenic activity.","4929":"The human IL-4 receptor contains a sequence (the 14R motif) centered on Y497 that, when phosphorylated, interacts with phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain proteins. Here, we describe a PTB domain protein, FRIP, that is phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. FRIP is related to the rasGAP-associated protein p62dok and is bound by the N-terminal SH2 domain of rasGAP. The frip gene maps to the hairless (hr) locus on mouse chromosome 14. hr\/hr mice exhibit lymphadenopathy, and their lymph node T cells proliferate more vigorously to anti-CD3 with IL-4 or IL-2 stimulation than +\/hr T cells. FRIP expression is significantly reduced in T cells from hr\/hr mice. FRIP may negatively regulate proliferation by acting as an adapter molecule between rasGAP and receptor complexes.","4930":"","4931":"Lipopolysaccharide ([LPS], an endotoxin) from most bacterial species provokes a strong inflammatory response in naive animals. LPS from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsLPS) has a relatively small hydrophobic region and does not stimulate cells or animals but instead acts as antagonist of LPS action. Here, we show that the activity of RsLPS is transformed from antagonist to full agonist by the addition of chlorpromazine (CPZ) and other cationic membrane-active agents. In addition, while LPS is rapidly transported from the plasma membrane to an intracellular site, we find that RsLPS is not transported but instead remains in the cell periphery. Addition of CPZ also reverses this behavior, causing RsLPS to be transported to a perinuclear site. The data suggest that the interaction of LPS with membrane lipids is influenced by membrane-modifying agents such as CPZ, and these interactions dictate both its intracellular transport and its ability to stimulate cellular responses.","4932":"We have investigated the lymphohematopoietic potentials of endothelial cells (EC) and hematopoietic cells (HPC) sorted from embryos. Expression of VE-cadherin, CD45, and Ter119 was used to distinguish EC (VE-cadherin+CD45-Ter119-) from HPC (VE-cadherin-CD45+). Thus defined, EC population takes up acetylated LDL and coexpresses CD31, Flk1, and CD34. In E9.5 embryos, EC from yolk sac (YS) and the embryo proper generate blood cells, including lymphocytes. Thus, lymphohematopoietic EC do exist in the embryo, and they are generated both in YS and the embryo proper. On the other hand, HPC with lymphopoietic potency appear first in the embryo proper. These findings implicate involvement of multiple environmental cues for acquiring lymphopoietic competency during differentiation of HPC.","4933":"Initiation and affinity maturation of the humoral immune response is driven by antigen interaction with BCR. To study how signaling and antigen presentation through BCR depend on antigen\/BCR affinity, lysozyme-specific B cell transfectants were challenged with mutated lysozymes differing in their binding kinetics. For detectable triggering, the antigen\/BCR complex needed a Ka &gt; 10(6) M(-1) (dissociation half-life &gt; approximately 1 s). Mutated lysozymes whose binding was below this threshold could nevertheless be presented if complexed with soluble antibody. Above the threshold, the concentration of antigen required to trigger a response decreased as the affinity (particularly dissociation half-life) increased. However, a plateau was reached at Kas &gt; approximately 10(10) M(-1) (dissociation half-life &gt; 0.5 hr), supporting the idea of a ceiling to affinity maturation.","4934":"Transgenic studies have led to the conclusion that the 3'Ekappa enhancer functions to suppress kappa variable region gene assembly in T lineage cells and in progenitor B cells and have also implicated 3'Ekappa as a critical element in promoting somatic hypermutation of kappa variable region genes. To assess the role of the endogenous 3'Ekappa, we assayed these processes in mice homozygous for mutations in which the 3'Ekappa sequences were deleted by the loxP\/Cre method (3'Ekappa delta\/delta mice). In contrast to transgenic findings, we found that deletion of the endogenous 3'Ekappa did not deregulate kappa gene rearrangement in T lineage cells or in pro-B cells. Furthermore, immunization of the 3'Ekappa delta\/delta mice led to the generation of specific antibodies with mutation patterns typical of affinity maturation, showing that there is no absolute requirement for the 3'Ekappa with respect to somatic mutation of endogenous kappa genes.","4935":"Despite extensive research, the role of CD40 signaling in B cell terminal differentiation remains controversial. Here we show that CD40 engagement arrests B cell differentiation prior to plasma cell formation. This arrest is manifested at a molecular level as a reduction in mRNA levels of secretory immunoglobulin gene products such as mu(s) and J chain as well as the loss of the transcriptional regulator BLIMP-1. Furthermore, the inhibition of B cell differentiation by CD40 engagement could not be overcome by either mitogens or cytokines, but could be reversed by antibodies that interfere with the CD40\/gp39 interaction. These data suggest that secretory immunoglobulin is not produced by B cells that are actively engaged by gp39-expressing T cells.","4936":"The plasma membrane of mammalian cells contains detergent-resistant membrane rafts enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. Although several important signaling molecules have been found in such rafts, evidence documenting a functional role for their localization has been scarce. Using a fractionation scheme that preserves tyrosine phosphorylation, we show that T cell activation leads to a striking compartmentation in the rafts of activated T cell receptor and associated signal-transducing molecules. Conditions that reversibly disrupt raft structure either by dispersing their contents or by forcing their internalization reversibly disrupt the earliest steps of T cell activation. Thus, raft integrity is a prerequisite for efficient T cell receptor signal transduction.","4937":"Expression of a TCRgamma transgene in RAG-1-\/- mice resulted in the development of a limited number of CD4+CD8+ (DP) thymocytes. In vivo treatments with anti-TCRgamma antibody enhanced the number of DP thymocytes, demonstrating that TCRgamma chains were expressed on the cell surface in the absence of delta, alpha, or beta chains. Mutations in pTalpha or CD3epsilon genes abolished transgene-induced DP cell development, indicating that TCRgamma can associate with pTalpha and CD3 to form a novel pre-TCR. With a transgene containing additional regulatory sequences, TCRgamma expression was down-regulated in DP cells, and little DP cell development occurred. Thus, the function of the endogenous TCRgamma\/pTalpha is limited by the transcriptional down-regulation of TCRgamma genes that normally accompanies DP cell development.","4938":"Calcineurin plays a pivotal role in the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signal transduction pathway and serves as a common target for the immunosuppressants FK506 and cyclosporin A. We report the identification of a novel endogenous calcineurin binding protein named Cabin 1 that inhibits calcineurin-mediated signal transduction. The interaction between Cabin 1 and calcineurin is dependent on PKC activation. Overexpression of Cabin 1 or its N-terminal truncation mutants inhibits the transcriptional activation of calcineurin-responsive elements in the interleukin-2 promoter and blocks dephosphorylation of NF-AT upon T cell activation. These results suggest a negative regulatory role for Cabin 1 in calcineurin signaling and provide a possible mechanism of feedback inhibition of TCR signaling through cross-talk between protein kinases and calcineurin.","4939":"While the inhibitory NK cell receptors for MHC class I express immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs that recruit intracellular tyrosine phosphatases and prevent NK cell effector function, the activating NK cell receptors lack intrinsic sequences required for cellular stimulation. CD94\/NKG2C, an activating NK cell receptor of the C-type lectin superfamily that binds to HLA-E, noncovalently associates with DAP12, a membrane receptor containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif. Efficient expression of CD94\/NKG2C on the cell surface requires the presence of DAP12, and charged residues in the transmembrane domains of DAP12 and NKG2C are necessary for this interaction. These results provide a molecular basis for the assembly of NK cell receptors for MHC class I involved in cellular activation and inhibition.","4940":"Virus-specific CD8+ effector T cells (eCTL) are enriched in the lungs of mice with primary influenza pneumonia, though later detection of memory T cells (mCTL) in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) or spleen by peptide-based staining protocols is at the limits of flow cytometric analysis. Respiratory challenge with an H3N2 virus months after H1N1 priming induces a massive recall response, which reduces virus titers 2-3 days earlier than in nave controls. Influenza-specific mCTL produce interferon-gamma within 6 hr, but still take 4-5 days to localize to the infected respiratory tract. The delay reflects that the recall response develops first in the MLN, which contains relatively few mCTL. The response to a subdominant epitope is less obvious after secondary challenge.","4941":"Multimeric soluble MHC class II molecules stably occupied with covalently attached peptides bind with appropriate specificity to T cell hybridomas and T cells from T cell receptor transgenic mice. There is a direct correlation between soluble T cell receptor affinity for monomeric MHC\/peptide and level of binding of multimeric MHC\/peptide to T cells. While binding of the multimeric MHC\/peptide complex is proportional to T cell receptor affinity and expression level, there is little influence of T cell CD4.","4942":"To understand how orally introduced antigen regulates peripheral immune responses, we fed cytochrome c protein to mice transgenic for the beta chain of a cytochrome c-specific TCR and followed the antigen-specific T cell responses with a cyt c\/I-Ek tetramer staining reagent. We find that within 6 hr of cytochrome c administration, antigen-specific systemic T cell activation is induced, and spleen cells gain the ability to stimulate cytochrome c-specific T cell responses. Feeding multiple low doses of cytochrome c down-regulates the systemic immune response, which can be correlated with a reduction of antigen-specific T cells and not with immune deviation. These results suggest that systemic distribution of antigen contributes significantly to oral tolerance induction.","4943":"","4944":"CD4 is the primary receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nef is an accessory protein of HIV that decreases the expression of CD4 on the surface of infected cells. In this study, we identified the Nef binding protein 1 (NBP1), which interacts specifically with Nef in vitro and in vivo. Since it shares sequence similarity with the catalytic subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and complements the loss of this VMA13 gene in yeast, NBP1 is the human homolog of Vma13p. Direct interactions between Nef and NBP1 were correlated with the ability of Nef to internalize CD4. The expression of the antisense NBP1 abrogated these effects. We conclude that NBP1 helps to connect Nef with the endocytic pathway.","4945":"CD19 is a coreceptor that amplifies signaling by membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) to promote responses of the B lymphocyte to T-dependent antigens. Vav is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho, Rac, Cdc42 family of small GTPases. We found that coligating mIg and CD19 causes a synergistic increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19. Phosphorylated tyrosine-391 of CD19 binds Vav to mediate a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This response correlates with activation by the CD19-Vav complex of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Interaction of CD19 with Vav also mediates the synergistic activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK. Therefore, CD19 is a membrane adaptor protein that recruits Vav for the activation of lipid and protein kinases.","4946":"SAPK is a member of the group of evolutionary conserved stress-activated kinases that mediate control of cellular death and proliferation. In lymphocytes, the SAPK pathway has been implicated in signaling from antigen, costimulatory, and death receptors; SEK1, which directly activates SAPK, is required for early embryonic development and has also been reported to be essential for normal lymphocyte development. In contrast to the latter findings, we have used RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation to show that SEK1-deficient embryonic stem cells support unimpaired T and B lymphocyte development. Moreover, mature SEK1-deficient lymphocytes are capable of SAPK activation. Surprisingly, however, aging SEK1-deficient chimeric mice frequently develop lymphadenopathy and polyclonal B and T cell expansions. Thus, SEK1 is not required for lymphocyte development, but is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis.","4947":"Activation-induced cell death (AICD) of lymphocytes is an important mechanism of self-tolerance. In CD4+ T cells, AICD is mediated by the Fas pathway and is enhanced by IL-2. To define the mechanisms of this pro-apoptotic action of IL-2, we analyzed CD4+ T cells from wild-type and IL-2-\/- mice expressing a transgenic T cell receptor. T cells become sensitive to AICD after activation by antigen and IL-2. IL-2 increases transcription and surface expression of Fas ligand (FasL) and suppresses transcription and expression of FLIP, the inhibitor of apoptosis. The ability of IL-2 to enhance expression of a pro-apoptotic molecule, FasL, and to suppress an inhibitor of Fas signaling, FLIP, likely accounts for the role of this cytokine in potentiating T cell apoptosis.","4948":"TGF-beta1, expressed in the pancreatic islets, protects the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The islet antigen-specific T cell response of ins-TGF-beta1 mice relied on different antigen-presenting cells (APC) from those used by NOD T cells. T cells from NOD mice utilized B cells to present islet antigen, whereas T cells from ins-TGF-beta1 mice utilized macrophages. In addition, the islet antigen-specific T cell repertoire of ins-TGF-beta1 mice was distinct and deviated toward an IL-4-producing Th2 phenotype. When ins-TGF-beta1 mice were treated with anti-iL-4 antibody, islet antigen-specific IFNGamma-producing Th1 cells were unleashed, and the incidence of diabetes increased to the level of NOD mice. This suggests active suppression of a diabetogenic T cell response. This study describes a novel mechanism in which expression of TGF-beta1 in the context of self-antigen shifts APC preference, deviating T cell responses to a Th2 phenotype, preventing IDDM.","4949":"Proliferation of memory-phenotype (CD44hi) CD8+ cells induced by infectious agents can be mimicked by injection of type I interferon (IFN I) and by IFN I-inducing agents such as lipopolysaccharide and Poly I:C; such proliferation does not affect naive T cells and appears to be TCR independent. Since IFN I inhibits proliferation in vitro, IFN I-induced proliferation of CD8+ cells in vivo presumably occurs indirectly through production of secondary cytokines, e.g., interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15. We show here that, unlike IL-2, IL-15 closely mimics the effects of IFN I in causing strong and selective stimulation of memory-phenotype CD44hi CD8+ (but not CD4+) cells in vivo; similar specificity applies to purified T cells in vitro and correlates with much higher expression of IL-2Rbeta on CD8+ cells than on CD4+ cells.","4950":"Naive monoclonal T cells specific for the male antigen can be stimulated in vivo to eliminate male cells and become memory cells or to permit survival of male cells and become tolerant. Memory cells responded to TCR ligation by cyclic oscillations of calcium levels and immediate secretion of very high levels of IL-2 and interferon-gamma. Tolerant cells did not proliferate in response to ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate, failing to mobilize calcium to produce IL-2 or express IL-2R, but survived for long time periods in vivo and secreted IL-10. These results emphasize that tolerance is not an absence of all functional activity and may be associated with modifications of behavior conferring important regulatory functions on tolerant T cells.","4951":"Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) is induced by T cell-mediated immunity to central nervous system antigens. In H-2u mice, EAE is mediated primarily by T cells specific for residues 1-11 of myelin basic protein (MBP). We demonstrate that differential tolerance to MBP1-11 versus epitopes in MBP121-150 is induced by expression of endogenous MBP, reflecting extreme differences in stability of peptide\/MHC complexes. The diverse MBP121-150-specific TCR repertoire can be divided into three fine specificity groups. Two groups were identified in wild-type mice despite extensive tolerance, but the third group was not detected. Activated MBP121-150-specific T cells induce EAE in wild-type mice. Thus, encephalitogenic T cells that escape tolerance either recognize short-lived peptide\/MHC complexes or express TCRs with unique specificities for stable complexes.","4952":"Organ-specific autoimmune disease can be caused by alphabeta T cells that have escaped self-tolerance induction. Here we show that one of the causes of escape from self-tolerance is the coexpression of two different T cell receptors by the same cell, which can occur in up to 30% of all T cells in normal mice and can lead to low-level surface expression of an autospecific TCR. We found that double receptor-expressing T cells can escape tolerance even to ubiquitously expressed antigens but can nevertheless induce autoimmune diabetes when the relevant protein is expressed in pancreatic tissue. Such diabetogenic T cells are absent, however, among T cells expressing the autospecific TCR as the sole receptor.","4953":"MHC class I H-2Ld complexed with peptide QL9 (or p2Ca) is a high-affinity alloantigen for the 2C TCR. We used the crystal structure of H-2Ld with a mixture of bound peptides at 3.1 A to construct a model of the allogeneic 2C-Ld\/QL9 complex for comparison with the syngeneic 2C-Kb\/dEV8 structure. A prominent ridge on the floor of the Ld peptide-binding groove, not present in Kb, creates a C-terminal bulge in Ld peptides that greatly increases interactions with the 2C beta-chain. Furthermore, weak electrostatic complementarity between Asp77 on the alpha1 helix of Kb and 2C is enhanced in the allogeneic complex by closer proximity of QL9 peptide residue AspP8 to the 2C HV4 loop.","4954":"The high frequency of alloreactive T cells is a major hindrance for transplantation; however, the molecular basis for alloreactivity remains elusive. We examined the I-Ep alloreactivity of a well-characterized Hb(64-76)\/I-Ek-specific murine T cell. Using a combinatorial peptide library approach, we identified a highly stimulatory alloepitope mimic and observed that the recognition of the central TCR contact residues (P3 and P5) was much more flexible than that seen with Hb(64-76)\/I-Ek, but still specific. Therefore, alloreactive T cells can recognize a self-peptide\/MHC surface; however, the allogeneic MHC molecule changes the recognition requirements for the central region of the peptide, allowing a more diverse repertoire of ligands to be recognized.","4955":"Tapasin is a resident ER protein believed to be critical for antigen presentation by HLA class I molecules. We demonstrate that allelic variation in MHC class I molecules influences their dependence on tapasin for peptide loading and antigen presentation. HLA-B*2705 molecules achieve high levels of surface expression and present specific viral peptides in the absence of tapasin. In contrast, HLA-B*4402 molecules are highly dependent upon human tapasin for these functions, while HLA-B8 molecules are intermediate in this regard. Significantly, HLA-B*2705 like HLA-B*4402, requires tapasin to associate efficiently with TAP (transporters associated with antigen processing). The unusual ability of HLA-B*2705 to form peptide complexes without associating with TAP or tapasin confers flexibility in the repertoire of peptides presented by this molecule. We speculate that these properties might contribute to the role of HLA-B27 in conferring susceptibility to inflammatory spondyloarthropathies.","4956":"","4957":"A role for the Fc receptor beta chain (FcRbeta) in the pathogenesis of allergy has been suggested by genetic studies. FcRbeta is a subunit common to the high-affinity IgE (FcepsilonRI) and low-affinity IgG (FcgammaRIII) receptors, both of which contribute to the initiation of allergic reactions. Current in vitro data suggest that FcRbeta can function as either a positive or negative regulator, leaving a mechanistic explanation for its association with the development of atopy unclear. To address this controversy, we have generated novel mouse models relevant to human Fc receptor function. Analysis of FcepsilonRI- and FcgammaRIII-dependent responses in these mice provides unequivocal genetic evidence that FcRbeta functions as an amplifier of early and late mast cell responses and, remarkably, in vivo anaphylactic responses.","4958":"Membrane recruitment of SHIP is responsible for the inhibitory signal generated by FcgammaRIIB coligation to the BCR. By reducing the level of PIP3, SHIP regulates the association of the tyrosine kinase Btk with the membrane through PH domain-phosphoinositol lipid interactions. Inhibition of BCR signaling by either FcgammaRIIB coligation, membrane expression of SHIP, or inhibition of P13K, conditions which result in decreased levels of PIP3, is suppressed by the expression of Btk as a membrane-associated chimera. Conversely, increasing PIP3 levels by deletion of SHIP results in increased Btk association with the membrane and hyperresponsive BCR signaling. These results suggest a central role for PIP3 in regulating the B cell stimulatory state by modulating Btk localization and thereby calcium fluxes.","4959":"A B lymphocyte hyperactivity syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosus characterizes mice lacking the src-family kinase Lyn. Lyn is not required to initiate B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling but is an essential inhibitory component. lyn-\/- B cells have a delayed but increased calcium flux and exaggerated negative selection responses in the presence of antigen and spontaneous hyperactivity in the absence of antigen. As in invertebrates, genetic effects of loci with only one functional allele can be used to analyze signaling networks in mice, demonstrating that negative regulation of the BCR is a complex quantitative trait in which Lyn, the coreceptor CD22, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 are each limiting elements. The biochemical basis of this complex trait involves a pathway requiring Lyn to phosphorylate CD22 and recruit SHP-1 to the CD22\/BCR complex.","4960":"The surface expression of MHC I is reduced in HIV-infected cells. We show that the Nef protein affects the intracellular sorting of HLA-A and -B molecules. In the presence of Nef, these proteins accumulate in the Golgi and colocalize with clathrin-coated vesicles. MHC I modulation relies on a tyrosine-based sorting signal located in the cytoplasmic domain of HLA-A and -B heavy chains. This cryptic sorting signal becomes operative only in the presence of Nef. Nef interacts with the medium (mu) subunit of AP adaptor complexes involved in the recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals, likely facilitating the connection between MHC I and the clathrin-dependent sorting machinery.","4961":"The vaccinia virus A39R protein is a member of the semaphorin family. A39R.Fc protein was used to affinity purify an A39R receptor from a human B cell line. Tandem mass spectrometry of receptor peptides yielded partial amino acid sequences that allowed the identification of corresponding cDNA clones. Sequence analysis of this receptor indicated that it is a novel member of the plexin family and identified a semaphorin-like domain within this family, thus suggesting an evolutionary relationship between receptor and ligand. A39R up-regulated ICAM-1 on, and induced cytokine production from, human monocytes. These data, then, describe a receptor for an immunologically active semaphorin and suggest that it may serve as a prototype for other plexin-semaphorin binding pairs.","4962":"Fas is a surface receptor that can transmit signals for apoptosis. Using retroviral cDNA library-based functional cloning we identified a gene, toso, that blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis. Toso expression was confined to lymphoid cells and was enhanced after cell-specific activation processes in T cells. Toso appeared limited to inhibition of apoptosis mediated by members of the TNF receptor family and was capable of inhibiting T cell self-killing induced by TCR activation processes that up-regulate Fas ligand. We mapped the effect of Toso to inhibition of caspase-8 processing, the most upstream caspase activity in Fas-mediated signaling, potentially through activation of cFLIP. Toso therefore serves as a novel regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and may act as a regulator of cell fate in T cells and other hematopoietic lineages.","4963":"Caspase-mediated proteolysis of downstream substrates is a critical element of the execution pathway common to all forms of apoptosis studied to date. While this caspase-dependent pathway is activated during cytotoxic lymphocyte granule-induced cell death, recent studies have also provided evidence for caspase-independent pathways. However, the mechanisms mediating these additional pathways have not been defined. The current study demonstrates that DNA-PKcs and NuMA are directly and efficiently cleaved by granzyme B in vitro and in vivo, generating unique substrate fragments not observed during other forms of apoptosis. This direct, caspase-independent ability of granzyme B to cleave downstream death substrates constitutes an apoptotic effector mechanism that is insensitive to inhibitors of the signaling or execution components of the endogenous apoptotic cascade.","4964":"FADD is a cytoplasmic adapter molecule that links the family of death receptors to the activation of caspases during apoptosis. We have produced transgenic mice expressing a dominantly interfering mutant of FADD, lacking the caspase-dimerizing death effector domain, as well as mice overexpressing the poxvirus serpin, CrmA, an inhibitor of caspases downstream of FADD. While thymocytes from either line of mice were completely protected from CD95-dependent cytotoxicity, neither transgene afforded protection from apoptosis induced during thymocyte selection and neither led to the lymphoproliferative disorders associated with deficiencies in CD95. However, in FADD dominant negative (FADDdd) mice, early thymocyte development was retarded and peripheral lymphocyte pools were devoid of normal populations of T cells. We show that thymocytes and peripheral T cells from FADDdd display signaling anomalies, implying that FADD plays a previously uncharacterized role in T cell development and activation.","4965":"Differentiation of gammadelta and alphabeta T cells from a common precursor cell depends on productive rearrangement and expression of TCRgammadelta or TCRbeta genes, but whether it is an instructive or a stochastic mechanism that is responsible for this process is unclear. We report that expression of the productively rearranged TCRgamma transgene competitively inhibits alphabeta thymocyte development under conditions where TCRbeta gene rearrangement is limiting. The status of TCRdelta gene rearrangements in the remaining alphabeta-lineage cells indicates that the effect is mediated by the intact gammadelta receptor. Paradoxically, in TCRbeta-\/- mice, gammadelta receptor expression can also drive differentiation of some alphabeta-lineage cells. To resolve this paradox, we provide evidence for a minor population of gammadelta-dependent alphabeta-lineage cells in normal mice. The results indicate that the T cell lineage commitment process is either error-prone or stochastic.","4966":"The T cell receptor (TCR) from the alloreactive T lymphocyte 2C recognizes a nonamer peptide QL9 complexed with the MHC class I molecule H2-Ld. Forty-two single-site alanine substitutions of the 2C TCR were analyzed for binding to QL9\/Ld and anti-TCR antibodies. The results provided a detailed energy map of T cell antigen recognition and indicated that the pMHC and clonotypic antibody epitopes on the TCR were similar. Although residues in each Valpha and Vbeta CDR are important in binding pMHC, the most significant energy for the TCR\/QL9\/Ld interaction was contributed by CDRs 1 and 2 of both alpha and beta chains. The extent to which the individual energy contributions are directed at class I helices or peptide was also assessed.","4967":"The three-dimensional structure of a human alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR), B7, bound to the HLA-A2 molecule\/HTLV-1 Tax peptide complex was determined by x-ray crystallography. Although different from the A6 TCR, previously studied, in 16 of the 17 residues that contact HLA-A2\/Tax, the B7 TCR binds in a similar diagonal manner, only slightly tipped and rotated, relative to the A6 TCR. The structure explains data from functional assays on the specificity differences between the B7 and A6 TCRs for agonist, partial agonist, and null peptides. The existence of a structurally similar diagonal binding mode for TCRs favors mechanisms based on the formation of geometrically defined supramolecular assemblies for initiating signaling.","4968":"","4969":"IL-18 is a cytokine that is secreted from activated macrophages and induces IFNgamma production. To investigate the in vivo role of IL-18, we generated IL-18-deficient mice. In Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes)-primed IL-18-deficient mice, LPS-induced IFNgamma production was markedly reduced, despite normal IL-12 induction. Natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired. Th1 cell response after injection of P. acnes or Mycobacterium bovis (bacillus Calmette-Guerin [BCG]) was significantly reduced. Similar results were observed in IL-12-deficient mice. Interestingly, Th1 response was induced after BCG infection in IL-12-deficient mice. We therefore generated mice lacking both IL-18 and IL-12. In these mice, NK activity and Th1 response were further impaired. This demonstrates the important role of both IL-18 and IL-12 in NK activity, as well as in in vivo Th1 response.","4970":"We report that the cell surface mucin CD43 acts as an anti-adhesin on T lymphocytes. CD43-deficient murine lymphocytes homed significantly more frequently to secondary lymphoid organs than wild-type cells. Intravital microscopy of peripheral lymph node venules revealed that CD43-deficient lymphocytes were twice as likely to tether, roll, and stick than wild-type cells. This effect was due to CD43 interference with the homing receptor, L-selectin, and was most pronounced in venules with low L-selectin ligand density. In vitro, CD43-deficient cells tethered to L-selectin ligands more efficiently and rolled more slowly than wild-type lymphocytes. Thus, CD43 exerts a negative regulatory effect on T cell trafficking by counterbalancing L-selectin-mediated adhesion.","4971":"Conventional models suggest that long-term antibody responses are maintained by the continuous differentiation of memory B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. This is based on the notion that plasma cells are short-lived and need to be continually replenished by memory B cells. We examined the issue of plasma cell longevity by following the persistence of LCMV-specific antibody and plasma cell numbers after in vivo depletion of memory B cells and by adoptive transfer of virus-specific plasma cells into naive mice. The results show that a substantial fraction of plasma cells can survive and continue to secrete antibody for extended periods of time (&gt;1 year) in the absence of any detectable memory B cells. This study documents the existence of long-lived plasma cells and demonstrates a new mechanism by which humoral immunity is maintained.","4972":"Bacterial infections activate complex T cell populations that differ in size and antigen specificity. We used tetramerized MHC class I molecules complexed with Listeria monocytogenes-derived epitopes to characterize four distinct CD8+ T lymphocyte populations during bacterial infection. Surprisingly, T cell populations differing in antigen specificity expand, contract, and enter the T cell memory compartment synchronously. Because the four L. monocytogenes epitopes are presented with different efficiencies and have distinct stabilities in infected cells, our findings suggest that these factors do not determine in vivo T cell dynamics. While T cell activation requires antigen presentation, the timing and extent of T cell expansion appear to be regulated in a coordinated fashion independent of antigen quantity and stability.","4973":"CD1b is an antigen-presenting molecule that mediates recognition of bacterial lipid and glycolipid antigens by specific T cells. We demonstrate that the nine-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of CD1b contains all of the signals required for its normal endosomal targeting, and that the single cytoplasmic tyrosine is a critical component of the targeting motif. Mutant forms of CD1b lacking the endosomal targeting motif are expressed at high levels on the cell surface but are unable to efficiently present lipid antigens acquired either exogenously or from live intracellular organisms. These results define the functional role of the CD1b targeting motif in a physiologic setting and demonstrate its importance in delivery of this antigen-presenting molecule to appropriate intracellular compartments.","4974":"The ability of human CD1b molecules to present nonpeptide antigens is suggested by the T cell recognition of microbial lipids and lipoglycans in the presence of CD1b-expressing antigen-presenting cells. We demonstrate the high-affinity interaction of CD1b molecules with the acyl side chains of known T cell antigens, lipoarabinomannan, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, and glucose monomycolate. Furthermore, CD1b-antigen binding was optimal at acidic pH, consistent with the known requirement for endosomal acidification in CD1b-restricted antigen presentation. The mechanism for CD1b-ligand interaction involves the partial unfolding of the alpha helices of CD1b at acidic pH, revealing a hydrophobic binding site that could accommodate lipid. These data provide direct evidence that the CD1b molecule has evolved unique biochemical properties that enable the binding of lipid-containing antigens from intracellular pathogens.","4975":"We have determined the structures of I-Ad covalently linked to an ovalbumin peptide (OVA323-339) and to an influenza virus hemagglutinin peptide (HA126-138). The floor of the peptide-binding groove contains an unusual beta bulge, not seen in I-E and DR structures, that affects numerous interactions between the alpha and beta chains and bound peptide. Unlike other MHC-peptide complexes, the peptides do not insert any large anchor residues into the binding pockets of the shallow I-Ad binding groove. The previously identified six-residue \"core\" binding motif of I-Ad occupies only the P4 to P9 pockets, implying that specificity of T cell receptor recognition of I-Ad-peptide complexes can be accomplished by peptides that only partially fill the MHC groove.","4976":"We have determined the structure of murine MHC class II I-Ak in complex with a naturally processed peptide from hen egg lysozyme (HEL residues 50-62) at 1.9 A resolution. These results provide a structural basis for the I-Ak peptide-binding motif. Binding is established by the deep burial of five anchor side chains into specific pockets of the I-Ak binding groove, with a zen-like fit of an aspartic acid in the P1 pocket. We also show that in the I-Ak alpha chain, a bulge occurs in the first strand of the peptide-binding platform, an insertion probably common to all I-A and HLA-DQ alleles. The I-Ak beta chain has a deletion in the helical region adjacent to the P7 pocket and an insertion in the helical region neighboring the P1 pocket. As a result of these structural features, the extended HEL peptide dips low into the center of the I-Ak groove and reaches toward solvent at its C-terminal end.","4977":"The death domain serine\/threonine kinase RIP interacts with the death receptors Fas and tumor necrosis receptor 1 (TNFR1). In vitro, RIP stimulates apoptosis, SAPK\/JNK, and NF-kappaB activation. To define the physiologic role(s) that RIP plays in regulating apoptosis in vivo, we introduced a rip null mutation in mice through homologous recombination. RIP-deficient mice appear normal at birth but fail to thrive, displaying extensive apoptosis in both the lymphoid and adipose tissue and dying at 1-3 days of age. In contrast to a normal thymic anti-Fas response, rip-\/- cells are highly sensitive to TNFalpha-induced cell death. Sensitivity to TNFalpha-mediated cell death in rip-\/- cells is accompanied by a failure to activate the transcription factor NF-kappaB.","4978":"Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced transcription of the J chain gene was used as a model for analyzing cytokine regulation during B cell development. To determine whether IL-2 signals are targeted to a J chain gene enhancer as well as to its promoter, the sequences flanking the J chain gene were first examined for DNase I hypersensitivity. Of six sites identified, two strong ones, 7.5 kb upstream of the J chain gene, were found to be associated with an enhancer that is active only during the antigen-driven stages of B cell development. Further analyses of the enhancer in the IL-2-responsive presecretor BCL1 cells showed that the enhancer is activated at this stage by an IL-2 signal that functions by opening the enhancer chromatin and stimulating STAT5 to bind to a STAT5 element critical for the enhancer induction. Moreover, after this early induction stage, the enhancer was shown to be constitutively open and active in terminally differentiated plasma cells.","4979":"","4980":"Although IL-4 induces expulsion of the gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, from immunodeficient mice, this parasite is expelled normally by IL-4-deficient mice. This apparent paradox is explained by observations that IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Ralpha)-deficient mice and Stat6-deficient mice fail to expel N. brasiliensis, and a specific antagonist for IL-13, another activator of Stat6 through IL-4Ralpha, prevents worm expulsion. Thus, N. brasiliensis expulsion requires signaling via IL-4Ralpha and Stat6, and IL-13 may be more important than IL-4 as an inducer of the Stat6 signaling that leads to worm expulsion. Additional observations made in the course of these experiments demonstrate that Stat6 signaling is not required for IL-4 enhancement of IgG1 production and actually inhibits IL-4-induction of mucosal mastocytosis.","4981":"We have examined the role of Fas and Bcl-2 in T cell survival and responses to antigen in vivo using T cells that express a transgenic antigen receptor specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and that either lack functional Fas or Fas ligand (FasL) or overexpress Bcl-2 as a transgene. HEL-specific, Bcl-2-transgenic T cells showed prolonged responses to immunization with cognate peptide but were eliminated rapidly when exposed to HEL expressed systemically as a self antigen. In contrast, Fas- and FasL-defective T cells did not display exaggerated responses to immunization with HEL peptide, but did show increased expansion and survival in response to systemic self antigen and were able to activate anti-HEL (self) antibody-forming cells. Thus, Bcl-2 and Fas play different roles in the regulation of T cell responses to antigen in vivo and in self tolerance.","4982":"The mouse NK inhibitory Ly-49A receptor specifically interacts with a peptide-induced conformational determinant on its MHC class I ligand, H-2Dd. In addition, it binds the polysaccharide fucoidan, consistent with its C-type lectin homology and the hypothesis that Ly-49A interacts with carbohydrates on Dd. Herein, however, we demonstrate that Ly-49A recognizes Dd mutants lacking N-glycosylation. Fucoidan competes for binding with anti-Ly-49A antibodies that inhibit Ly-49A-Dd interaction, and blocks apparent Ly-49A binding to unglycosylated Dd. We confirm that Ly-49A recognizes the alpha1 and amino-terminal alpha2 domains of Dd by analysis of recombinant H-2Kd-H-2Dd molecules. These studies indicate that Ly-49A recognizes carbohydrate-independent epitope(s) on Dd and suggest that Ly-49A has two distinct ligands, carbohydrate and MHC class I.","4983":"HLA-DM catalyzes the release of MHC class II-associated invariant chain-derived peptides (CLIP) from class II molecules. Recent evidence has suggested that HLA-DO is a negative regulator of HLA-DM in B cells, but the physiological function of HLA-DO remains unclear. Analysis of antigen presentation by B cells from mice lacking H2-O (the mouse equivalent of HLA-DO), together with biochemical analysis using purified HLA-DO and HLA-DM molecules, suggests that HLA-DO\/H2-O influences the peptide loading of class II molecules by limiting the pH range in which HLA-DM is active. This effect may serve to decrease the presentation of antigens internalized by fluid-phase endocytosis, thus concentrating the B cell-mediated antigen presentation to antigens internalized by membrane immunoglobulin.","4984":"Tapasin forms a bridge between TAP (transporters associated with antigen processing) and MHC class I molecules and plays a critical role in class I assembly. In its absence, TAP and class I do not associate, and class I cell surface expression is reduced. We now identify two independent functions for tapasin. Tapasin increases TAP levels and allows more peptide to be translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, when expressed in the tapasin-negative .220 cell line, recombinant soluble tapasin retains its association with class I and restores class I cell surface expression and function, even though it no longer binds TAP or increases TAP levels. This finding suggests that the association of tapasin with class I is sufficient to facilitate loading and assembly of class I molecules.","4985":"Anti-Sm and anti-ssDNA transgenic (Tg) mice were generated using the VH-D-JH rearrangement of an anti-Sm hybridoma of MRL\/Mp-lpr\/lpr origin. B cells of each specificity account for 15%-35% of the splenic repertoire, but no circulating anti-Sm or anti-ssDNA antibodies are detected. Most autoreactive cells exhibit an immature B cell phenotype and have short half-lives equivalent to those of non-Tg immature B cells. However, at least some anti-Sm B cells are functional, because immunization with murine snRNPs induces anti-Sm secretion. We propose that anti-Sm and anti-ssDNA are eliminated during the transition to mature B cells and that this late stage of tolerance induction is consequential to their spontaneous activation in murine lupus.","4986":"Within the pools of muH chain-producing precursor and mature B cells from normal and lambda5-defective mice, the frequency of cells in which both H chain alleles were productively VHDJH rearranged was determined. An equally high percentage (2%-4%) of cells carrying two productively VHDJH-rearranged H chain loci was found in precursor and mature B cell pools of both mouse strains. In all of these cells, one allele encodes a muH chain incapable of forming a surface-expressed pre-B cell receptor. Hence, allelic exclusion is maintained at the level of pre-B cell receptor expression. The surprising conservation of H chain allelic exclusion in lambda5-defective B cells suggests that an alternative form of pre-B cell receptor might function to ensure this allelic exclusion.","4987":"We analyzed the participation of a predominant B cell clonotype in the anti-arsonate immune response of mice in which Bcl-2 expression was enforced in B cells. Many of the antibodies expressed by the arsonate-induced memory compartment of these mice were \"dual-reactive,\" displaying increased affinity acquired via V region somatic hypermutation for both arsonate and the autoantigen DNA. The hypermutated antibodies expressed by the anti-arsonate memory B cell compartment of normal mice have increased affinity for arsonate but lack measurable affinity for DNA. Thus, interference with apoptotic pathways allows developing memory B cells that have acquired autoreactivity to bypass a peripheral tolerance checkpoint. These data demonstrate that both positive and negative selection, working in concert with V gene somatic hypermutation, result in the \"specificity maturation\" of the antibody response.","4988":"Viral infections induce extensive T cell proliferation in vivo, but the specificity of the majority of the responding T cells has not been defined. To address this issue we used tetramers of MHC class I molecules containing viral peptides to directly visualize antigen-specific CD8 T cells during acute LCMV infection of mice. Based on tetramer binding and two sensitive assays measuring interferon-gamma production at the single-cell level, we found that 50%-70% of the activated CD8 T cells were LCMV specific [2 x 10(7) virus-specific cells\/spleen]. Following viral clearance, antigen-specific CD8 T cell numbers dropped to 10(6) per spleen and were maintained at this level for the life of the mouse. Upon rechallenge with LCMV, there was rapid expansion of memory T cells, but after infection with the heterologous vaccinia virus there was no detectable change in the numbers of LCMV-specific memory CTL. Therefore, much of the CD8 T cell expansion seen during viral infection represents antigen-specific cells and warrants a revision of our current thinking on the size of the antiviral response.","4989":"During LCMV infection, CD8+ T cells expand greatly. Bystander activation has been thought to play a role because few cells score as LCMV specific in limiting dilution analysis. In contrast, we find that at least a quarter of the CD8+ cells secrete IFNgamma specifically in response to LCMV peptides at the peak of the response. Moreover, by analyzing the expansion of adoptively transferred LCMV-specific, TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells in congenic hosts, we have determined that most of the CD8+ cell expansion is virus specific. Analysis of the effect of the monospecific TCR-transgenic T cells on the host response to three LCMV epitopes suggests that CTL precursors compete for sites on the APC in an epitope-specific fashion and that this competition determines the specificity of the response.","4990":"CIITA is the mediator of MHC class II gene induction by interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). The CIITA gene is itself selectively activated via one of its four promoters (PIV). We show here that three cis-acting elements, the GAS, the E box, and the IRF-1-binding site, as well as the transacting factors Stat1 and IRF-1, are essential for activation of CIITA promoter IV by IFNgamma. Stat1 binds to the GAS site only in the presence of the ubiquitous factor USF-1, which binds to the adjacent E box. Indeed, Stat1 and USF-1 bind to the GAS\/E box motif in a cooperative manner. The specificity for CIITA activation by IFNgamma is thus dictated by the GAS\/E box motif and by the selective interaction of IFNgamma-activated Stat1 and USF-1. This clarifies the missing link in the overall pathway of IFNgamma activation of MHC-II expression.","4991":"Patients with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) deficiency are known to carry mutations in either the RFX complex or the trans-activator CIITA. While the pivotal role of CIITA for MHC-II gene transcription is supported by the essential absence of MHC-II molecules in CIITA-deficient mice, we demonstrate here that RFX5-\/- mice retain expression of MHC-II in thymic medulla, mature dendritic cells, and activated B cells. Nevertheless, RFX5-\/- mice develop a severe immunodeficiency due to the lack of MHC-II in thymic cortex, failure of positive selection of CD4+ T cells, and absence of MHC-II on resting B cells and resident or IFNgamma-activated macrophages. This differential requirement for CIITA and RFX5 in subsets of antigen-presenting cells may be specific for the mouse; it may, however, also exist in humans without having been noticed so far.","4992":"","4993":"The NF-AT family of transcription factors activates early immune response genes such as cytokines. In the adult, NF-ATc is expressed exclusively in the lymphoid system and is induced upon lymphocyte activation. NF-ATc null mutant mice die in utero of cardiac failure, precluding analysis of the role of NF-ATc in lymphocyte activation. By using RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation, we now demonstrate that young, highly chimeric mice lacking NF-ATc have impaired repopulation of both thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs. Furthermore, NF-ATc deficiency impaired T lymphocyte activation and secretion of IL-4. B lymphocytes displayed reduced proliferation and a selective loss of IL-4-driven immunoglobulin isotypes both in vivo and in vitro. Our data demonstrate that NF-ATc is essential for the optimal generation and function of mature T and B lineage cells, with an especially profound effect on IL-4-driven responses.","4994":"NF-ATc1 is a member of a family of genes that encodes the cytoplasmic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). In activated T cells, nuclear NF-AT binds to the promoter regions of multiple cytokine genes and induces their transcription. The role of NF-ATc1 was investigated in recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1)-deficient blastocyst complementation assays using homozygous NF-ATc1-\/- mutant ES cell lines. NF-ATc1-\/-\/RAG-1-\/- chimeric mice showed reduced numbers of thymocytes and impaired proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes, but normal production of IL-2. Induction in vitro of Th2 responses, as demonstrated by a decrease in IL-4 and IL-6 production, was impaired in mutant T cells. These data indicate that NF-ATc1 plays roles in the development of T lymphocytes and in the differentiation of the Th2 response.","4995":"The origin of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their growth factor requirement are poorly understood. Here we describe a new in vitro culture system of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, where long-term repopulating HSCs first arise. We demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM) is expressed in the AGM and is absolutely required for the expansion of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. In addition, OSM enhances the formation of endothelial cell clusters. Thus, OSM appears to be a key cytokine for the development of multipotential hematopoietic progenitors in the AGM, possibly acting on common precursor cells between HSCs and endothelial cells. By using the AGM culture derived from macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-deficient op\/op mutant embryos, we also show a pivotal role for M-CSF in fetal myelopoiesis.","4996":"Expression of the avian chT1 thymocyte antigen persists on a subpopulation of peripheral T cells enriched in the DNA deletion circles created by alphabeta and gammadelta TCR gene rearrangements. The chT1+ cells are evenly distributed among all of the peripheral T lymphocyte compartments. The levels of chT1+ T cells in the periphery gradually decline in parallel with age-related thymic involution, and these cells disappear following early thymectomy. Experiments in which variable numbers of the 14 thymic lobes are removed in young chicks indicate a direct correlation between the levels of circulating chT1+ cells and residual thymic mass. Measurement of recent thymic emigrants in the periphery thus provides an accurate indication of thymic function.","4997":"It is known that T cells engage antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a stable interaction that results in sustained TCR signaling. We show here that the duration of this process is critical in determining whether T cells will be activated or deleted. Whereas naive T cells require approximately 20 hr of sustained signaling to be committed to proliferation, effector T cells become committed after only 1 hr but die following activation if antigenic stimulation is prolonged. Costimulation by anti-CD28 facilitates T cell activation by decreasing the time of commitment and by protecting T cells from death. These findings explain in quantitative terms the essential requirement for professional APCs in T cell priming and show that the duration of antigenic stimulation is the major factor determining the fate of naive and effector T cells.","4998":"Type 2 nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is required for the Th1-dependent healing of infections with intracellular microbes, including Leishmania major. Here, we demonstrate the expression and define the function of NOS2 during the innate response to L. major. At day 1 of infection, genetic deletion or functional inactivation of NOS2 abolished the IFNgamma and natural killer cell response, increased the expression of TGFbeta, and caused parasite spreading from the skin and lymph node to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and lung. Induction of NOS2 was dependent on IFNalpha\/beta. Neutralization of IFNalpha\/beta mimicked the phenotype of NOS2-\/- mice. Thus, IFNalpha\/beta and NOS2 are critical regulators of the innate response to L. major.","4999":"Thymus-derived glucocorticoids antagonize T cell receptor (TCR)-induced thymocyte apoptosis, allowing the survival (positive selection) of cells bearing TCRs that recognize self antigens with low-to-moderate avidity. Here we demonstrate that expression of an antisense glucocorticoid receptor transgene in thymocytes of spontaneously autoimmune MRL-lpr\/lpr mice causes the loss of specific TCR Vbeta-bearing T cells that are normally positively selected in this strain. These transgenic mice had lower autoantibody production and milder symptoms of autoimmune disease than MRL-lpr\/lpr controls and had markedly reduced accumulation of the TCR+Thy-1+CD4-CD8-B220+ T cells that are the hallmark of the lpr mutation. Thus, decreased glucocorticoid signaling in thymocytes alters the T cell repertoire and greatly diminishes autoimmunity in MRL-lpr\/lpr autoimmune mice.","5000":"Deletion of antigen-activated T cells after an immune response and during peripheral negative selection after strong T cell receptor (TCR) engagement of cycling T cells occurs by an apoptotic process termed TCR antigen-induced cell death (AID). By analyzing the timing of death, cell cycle markers, BrdU-labeled S phase cells, and phase-specific centrifugally elutriated cultures from stimulated Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes, we found that AID occurs from a late G1 check point prior to activation of cyclin E:Cdk2 complexes. T cells stimulated to undergo AID can be rescued by effecting an early G1 block by direct transduction of p16INK4a tumor suppressor protein or by inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) by transduced HPV E7 protein. These results suggest that AID occurs from a late G1 death check point in a pRb-dependent fashion.","5001":"A cDNA clone encoding the human homolog of rat Jagged1 was isolated from normal human marrow. Analyses of human stromal cell lines indicate that this gene, designated hJagged1, is expressed by marrow stromal cells typified by the cell line HS-27a, which supports the long-term maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells. G-CSF-induced differentiation of 32D cells expressing Notch1 was inhibited by coculturing with HS-27a. A peptide corresponding to the Delta\/Serrate\/LAG-2 domain of hJagged1 and supernatants from COS cells expressing a soluble form of the extracellular portion of hJagged1 were able to mimic this effect. These observations suggest that hJagged1 may function as a ligand for Notch1 and play a role in mediating cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis.","5002":"The MAP kinase (MAPK) JNK but not ERK is synergistically activated during costimulation of T cells. We examined how protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and GTPases differentially regulate JNK and ERK in T cells. While PTKs are not selective, small GTPases display distinct MAPK-activating functions. Whereas Ras activates ERK, Rac activates JNK. Rac cooperates with a Syk-generated signal to enhance JNK activation and appears to be at a nodal point for pathways emanating from CD28, calcineurin, and protein kinase C. AP-1- and NF-AT-dependent reporters are stimulated by Rac and Syk and are dependent on JNK. Unlike Syk, the PTK Lck activates JNK but does not cooperate with Rac, resulting in weak AP-1 and NF-AT activation. Therefore, signals generated by PTKs are functionally distinct and need to be integrated to induce transcriptional responses.","5003":"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 infect activated T lymphocytes by attachment of the HSV envelope glycoprotein D (gD) to the cellular herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), an orphan member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Here, we demonstrate that HVEM binds two cellular ligands, secreted lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha) and LIGHT, a new member of the TNF superfamily. LIGHT is a 29 kDa type II transmembrane protein produced by activated T cells that also engages the receptor for the LTalphabeta heterotrimer but does not form complexes with either LTalpha or LTbeta. HSV1 gD inhibits the interaction of HVEM with LIGHT, and LIGHT and gD interfere with HVEM-dependent cell entry by HSV1. This characterizes herpesvirus gD as a membrane-bound viokine and establishes LIGHT-HVEM as integral components of the lymphotoxin cytokine-receptor system.","5004":"Lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1) and T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) are closely related transcription factors that are both expressed during murine T cell differentiation and that regulate the T cell receptor alpha (TCRalpha) enhancer in transfection assays. Targeted gene disruption of either the Tcf1 or Lef1 gene in mice did not affect TCRalpha gene expression and resulted in an incomplete defect or no defect in thymocyte differentiation. Here, we examine a potential redundancy of these transcription factors by analyzing double-mutant mice. In fetal thymic organ cultures from Lef1-\/- Tcf1-\/- mice, alpha\/beta T cell differentiation is completely arrested at the immature CD8+ single-positive (CD8+ ISP) stage and is markedly impaired at an earlier stage. In addition, we find that sorted CD8+ ISP cells from Lef1-\/- Tcf1-\/- mice express TCRbeta but show a severely reduced level of TCRalpha gene transcription. Together, these data show that LEF-1 and TCF-1 are redundant in the regulation of T cell differentiation and gene expression.","5005":"","5006":"CTLA-4-deficient animals develop a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder. The cellular mechanism(s) responsible for this phenotype have not been determined. Here, we show that there is a preferential expansion of CD4+ T cells in CTLA-4(-\/-) mice, which results in a skewing of the CD4\/CD8 T cell ratio. In vivo antibody depletion of CD8+ T cells from birth does not alter the onset or the severity of the CD28-dependent lymphoproliferative disorder. In contrast, CD4+ T cell depletion completely prevents all features characteristic of the lymphoproliferation observed in CTLA-4-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that CD4+ T cells initiate the phenotype in the CTLA-4(-\/-) mice. Further, these results suggest that the role of CTLA-4 in peripheral CD4+ versus CD8+ T cell homeostasis is distinct.","5007":"Autoimmune diabetes in both the human and the nonobese diabetic mouse has elaborate genetics; in the latter case, the disease is influenced by at least 15-20 loci. We anticipated that the genetics would be simpler in the BDC2.5 T cell receptor transgenic mouse model of diabetes, wherein many T cells express a particular diabetogenic specificity. Initiation of insulitis in this model was the same on the two genetic backgrounds analyzed, but the kinetics and penetrance of diabetes were strikingly different, permitting us to focus on genetic influences during a defined window of disease progression. The differences correlated with variations in five genomic intervals, certain ones of which have been previously implicated in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. This reductionist approach indeed simplified the analysis of diabetes susceptibility loci.","5008":"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits antigen-specific T cell responses when human monocytes are used as antigen-presenting cells. This is correlated with a down-regulation of MHC class II molecules on the surface of the monocyte. Here we show that IL-10 does not affect MHC class II transcription, polypeptide synthesis, subunit assembly, or antigenic peptide loading. Instead, newly synthesized mature MHC class II molecules are localized to the MHC class II loading compartment but are prevented from reaching the plasma membrane. In addition, treatment of monocytes with IL-10 leads to an accumulation of internalized MHC class II complexes in intracellular vesicles. These results indicate that IL-10 affects antigen presentation by regulating MHC exocytosis and recycling.","5009":"Transcription factors of the NFAT family play a critical role in the immune response by activating the expression of cytokines and other inducible genes in antigen-stimulated cells. Here we show that a member of this family, NFAT1, is involved in down-regulating the late phase of IL-4 gene transcription, thus inhibiting T helper 2 responses. Whereas stimulated T cells from wild-type mice show a transient increase and then a rapid decline in the steady-state levels of IL-4 mRNA in vitro, the levels of IL-4 gene transcripts in NFAT1-deficient T cells are maintained at high levels under the same conditions. Consistent with this observation, NFAT1-\/- mice are more susceptible to infection with Leishmania major. This report provides evidence that NFAT proteins regulate not only the initiation but also the termination of gene transcription.","5010":"IL-1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that signals through a receptor complex of two different transmembrane chains to generate multiple cellular responses, including activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Here we show that MyD88, a previously described protein of unknown function, is recruited to the IL-1 receptor complex following IL-1 stimulation. MyD88 binds to both IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and the heterocomplex (the signaling complex) of the two receptor chains and thereby mediates the association of IRAK with the receptor. Ectopic expression of MyD88 or its death domain-containing N-terminus activates NF-kappaB. The C-terminus of MyD88 interacts with the IL-1 receptor and blocks NF-kappaB activation induced by IL-1, but not by TNF. Thus, MyD88 plays the same role in IL-1 signaling as TRADD and Tube do in TNF and Toll pathways, respectively: it couples a serine\/threonine protein kinase to the receptor complex.","5011":"TRAIL induces apoptosis through two closely related receptors, TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5). Here we show that TRAIL-R1 can associate with TRAIL-R2, suggesting that TRAIL may signal through heteroreceptor signaling complexes. Both TRAIL receptors bind the adaptor molecules FADD and TRADD, and both death signals are interrupted by a dominant negative form of FADD and by the FLICE-inhibitory protein FLIP. The recruitment of TRADD may explain the potent activation of NF-kappaB observed by TRAIL receptors. Thus, TRAIL receptors can signal both death and gene transcription, functions reminiscent of those of TNFR1 and TRAMP, two other members of the death receptor family.","5012":"Death receptor 4 (DR4) is a recently described receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL that reportedly uses a FADD-independent pathway to induce apoptosis and does not activate the NF-kappaB pathway. We have isolated a new member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, designated DR5, which bears a high degree of sequence homology to DR4. However, contrary to the previous reports, both DR4- and DR5-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative FADD, and both receptors can activate NF-kappaB using a TRADD-dependent pathway. Finally, both receptors can interact with FADD, TRADD, and RIP. Thus, both DR5 and DR4 use FADD, TRADD, and RIP in their signal transduction pathways, and FADD is the common mediator of apoptosis by all known death domain-containing receptors.","5013":"A fourth member of the emerging TRAIL receptor family, TRAIL-R4, has been cloned and characterized. TRAIL-R4 encodes a 386-amino acid protein with an extracellular domain showing 58%-70% identity to those of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R3. The signaling capacity of TRAIL-R4 is similar to that of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 with respect to NF-kappaB activation, but differs in its inability to induce apoptosis. Yet TRAIL-R4 retains a C-terminal element containing one third of a consensus death domain motif. Transient overexpression of TRAIL-R4 in cells normally sensitive to TRAIL-mediated killing confers complete protection, suggesting that one function of TRAIL-R4 may be inhibition of TRAIL cytotoxicity. Like TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, this receptor shows widespread tissue expression. The human TRAIL-R4 gene has been mapped to chromosome 8p22-21, clustered with three other TRAIL receptors.","5014":"By comparing mRNA species expressed in dexamethasone (DEX)-treated and untreated murine thymocytes, we have identified a gene, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), encoding a new member of the leucine zipper family. GILZ was found expressed in normal lymphocytes from thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, whereas low or no expression was detected in other nonlymphoid tissues, including brain, kidney, and liver. In thymocytes and peripheral T cells, GILZ gene expression is induced by DEX. Furthermore, GILZ expression selectively protects T cells from apoptosis induced by treatment with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody but not by treatment with other apoptotic stimuli. This antiapoptotic effect correlates with inhibition of Fas and Fas ligand expression. Thus, GILZ is a candidate transcription factor involved in the regulation of apoptosis of T cells.","5015":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been detected against many EBV antigens but not the nuclear antigen EBNA1; this has been attributed to the presence of a glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain in the protein. Here we describe the isolation of human CD8+ CTL clones recognizing EBNA1-specific peptides in the context of HLA-B35.01 and HLA-A2.03. Using these clones, we show that full-length EBNA1 is not presented when expressed endogenously in target cells, whereas the GAr-deleted form is presented efficiently. However, when supplied as an exogenous antigen, the full-length protein can be presented on HLA class I molecules by a TAP-independent pathway; this may explain how EBNA1-specific CTLs are primed in vivo.","5016":"We report the isolation and extensive analysis of highly polymorphic MHC class I genes from sharks (Triakis scyllia), which belong to the most primitive vertebrate group with jaws, the cartilaginous fish. Predicted complete peptide-binding domains showed retention of the critical amino acid residues that would interact with antigenic peptide termini and revealed extensive allelic polymorphisms comparable to those of classic human MHC class I molecules. Mosaic structures were apparent in these domains, suggesting recombinational mechanisms to create allelic diversity. The present study demonstrates the establishment of the basic strategy for antigen-presentation employed by MHC class I molecules and documents complete divergence of two polymorphic MHC classes at a phylogenetically primitive stage of vertebrate evolution.","5017":"Mice carrying transgenic rearranged V region genes in their IgH and Igkappa loci to encode an autoreactive specificity direct the emerging autoreactive progenitors into a pre-B cell compartment, in which their receptors are edited by secondary Vkappa-Jkappa rearrangements and RS recombination. Editing is an efficient process, because the mutant mice generate normal numbers of B cells. In a similar nonautoreactive transgenic strain, neither a pre-B cell compartment nor receptor editing was seen. Thus, the pre-B cell compartment may have evolved to edit the receptors of autoreactive cells and later been generally exploited for efficient antibody diversification through the invention of the pre-B cell receptor, mimicking an autoreactive antibody to direct the bulk of the progenitors into that compartment.","5018":"The presence and expression of killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) and CD94:NKG2 genes from 68 donors were analyzed using molecular typing techniques. The genes encoding CD94:NKG2 receptors were present in each person, but KIR gene possession varied. Most individuals expressed inhibitory KIR for the three well-defined HLA-B and -C ligands, but noninhibitory KIR genes were more variable. Twenty different KIR phenotypes were defined. Two groups of KIR haplotypes were distinguished and occurred at relatively even frequency. Group A KIR haplotypes consist of six genes: the main inhibitory KIR, one noninhibitory KIR, and a structurally divergent KIR. Allelic polymorphism within five KIR genes was detected. Group B comprises more noninhibitory KIR genes and contains at least one additional gene not represented in group A. The KIR locus therefore appears to be polygenic and polymorphic within the human population.","5019":"The expression of KIR and CD94:NKG2 receptors was determined for more than 100 natural killer (NK) cell clones obtained from two blood donors who differ in their HLA class I and KIR genes. More than 98% of the clones were inhibited by individual autologous class I allotypes, and every clone was inhibited by the combination of autologous allotypes. The patterns of inhibition correlate with expression of inhibitory receptors of defined specificity. One donor possesses three class I ligands for KIR, and a majority of NK cells use KIR as their inhibitory receptor; the second donor possesses only a single ligand for KIR, and a majority of NK cells use the more broadly reactive CD94:NKG2a as their inhibitory receptor. Because of these differences, the first donor has subpopulations of NK cells that kill cells of the second donor, whereas the NK cells of the second donor are universally tolerant of cells from the first donor.","5020":"","5021":"TRAF2 is an intracellular signal-transducing protein recruited to the TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors following TNF stimulation. To investigate the physiological role of TRAF2, we generated TRAF2-deficient mice. traf2-\/- mice appeared normal at birth but became progressively runted and died prematurely. Atrophy of the thymus and spleen and depletion of B cell precursors also were observed. Thymocytes and other hematopoietic progenitors were highly sensitive to TNF-induced cell death and serum TNF levels were elevated in these TRAF2-deficient animals. Examination of traf2-\/- cells revealed a severe reduction in TNF-mediated JNK\/SAPK activation but a mild effect on NF-kappaB activation. These results suggest that TRAF2-independent pathways of NF-kappaB activation exist and that TRAF2 is required for an NF-kappaB-independent signal that protects against TNF-induced apoptosis.","5022":"TRAF2 is believed to mediate the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK induced by the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, which elicits pleiotropic responses in lymphocytes. We have investigated the physiological roles of TRAF2 in these processes by expressing a lymphocyte-specific dominant negative form of TRAF2, thereby blocking this protein's effector function. We find that the TNFR superfamily signals require TRAF2 for activation of JNK but not NF-kappaB. In addition, we show that TRAF2 induces NF-kappaB-independent antiapoptotic pathways during TNF-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of TRAF2 leads to splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and an increased number of B cells. These findings indicate that TRAF2 is involved in the regulation of lymphocyte function and growth in vivo.","5023":"Stat5a was identified as a prolactin-induced transcription factor but also is activated by other cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-7. We have now analyzed the immune system of Stat5a-deficient mice. Stat5a-\/- splenocytes exhibited defective IL-2-induced expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha), a protein that together with IL-2R beta and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) mediates high-affinity IL-2 binding. Correspondingly, Stat5a-\/- splenocytes exhibited markedly decreased proliferation to IL-2, although maximal proliferation was still achieved at IL-2 concentrations high enough to titrate intermediate-affinity IL-2R beta\/gamma(c) receptors. Thus, defective Stat5a expression results in diminished proliferation by an indirect mechanism, resulting from defective receptor expression. Correspondingly, we show that Stat5a is essential for maximal responsiveness to antigenic stimuli in vivo, underscoring the physiological importance of IL-2-induced IL-2R alpha expression.","5024":"Cell cycle progression initiated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) in T cells is critical for lymphoproliferation and an immune response. Phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated by IL-2. However, nuclear targets for PI3K are not known. Here we identify the cell cycle regulator E2F as an IL-2 target in T lymphocytes and PI3K as the critical signaling pathway. We eliminate both Stat5 and Raf\/MEK pathways from E2F regulation. Protein kinase B (PKB) is activated by IL-2 via PI3K. The expression of an active PKB is sufficient to induce E2F activity. Inhibition of PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of Rb, induction of cyclin D3, and degradation of p27kip1. These results establish a crucial PI3K\/PKB-mediated link between the IL-2 teceptor and the cell cycle machinery.","5025":"Cell death in B cell terminal differentiation rapidly follows cell cycle arrest in IL-6 differentiation of EBV-immortalized, IgG-bearing human lymphoblastoid cells in vitro. G1 arrest is now found to coincide with repression of EBNA2 and LMP1, two EBV genes essential for B cell transformation, without activation of the viral lytic cycle. IL-6-differentiated B cells die by apoptosis, as evidenced by increases in Annexin V binding activity, PARP cleavage, and chromatin disorganization. Expression of Mcl-1, a Bcl-2 family member, was specifically induced during IL-6 differentiation and down-regulated during apoptosis. Thus, IL-6 reverses EBV immortalization and activates the terminal differentiation program in IgG-bearing human B lymphoblastoid cells, including regulation of an anti-apoptotic gene to coordinate differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and cell death.","5026":"Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs are subunits of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), an enzyme implicated in DNA double-stranded break repair and V(D)J recombination. Our Ku70-deficient mice were about 50% the size of control littermates, and their fibroblasts were ionizing radiation sensitive and displayed premature senescence associated with the accumulation of nondividing cells. Ku70-deficient mice lacked mature B cells or serum immunoglobulin but, unexpectedly, reproducibly developed small populations of thymic and peripheral alpha\/beta T lineage cells and had a significant incidence of thymic lymphomas. In association with B and T cell developmental defects, Ku70-deficient cells were severely impaired for joining of V(D)J coding and recombination signal sequences. These unanticipated features of the Ku70-deficient phenotype with respect to lymphocyte development and V(D)J recombination may reflect differential functions of the three DNA-PK components.","5027":"We have investigated the HLA-B27-restricted CTL response to HY minor histocompatibility antigens in rats and mice transgenic for HLA-B27 and human beta2-microglobulin. A polymorphism was found at a locus within the H2 complex, producing two distinct but overlapping sets of B27-presented HY peptides. The locus, named Cim2, mapped between the K and Pb loci, and its product is therefore distinct from TAP, LMP, and tapasin. Identical findings in rats and mice, including identical HY peptide sequences and the failure of a rat Tap2A transgene to alter CTL recognition, suggest that a homologous locus with similar polymorphism exists in the rat. Cim2, or a closely linked locus, was found to exert a broad effect on peptide loading of both HLA-B27 and mouse class I alleles. The data thus establish a strong, previously unrecognized MHC-encoded influence on the class I antigen pathway.","5028":"We define a novel Bcl-x isoform, Bcl-x gamma, that is generated by alternative splicing and characterized by a unique 47 amino acid C-terminus. Bcl-x gamma is expressed primarily in thymocytes, where it may depend on an interaction between the TCR and host MHC products, and in mature T cells, where its expression is associated with ligation of the T cell receptor. Overexpression of Bcl-x gamma in T cells inhibits activation-induced apoptosis; inhibition of Bcl-x gamma, after stable expression of Bcl-x gamma antisense cDNA, enhances activation-induced apoptosis. In contrast to other Bcl-x isoforms, cells that fail to express Bcl-x gamma after CD3 ligation undergo programmed cell death, while activated T cells that express Bcl-x gamma are spared. Identification of Bcl-x gamma helps provide a molecular explanation of T cell activation and death after antigen engagement.","5029":"The mechanism by which TCR expression is regulated was explored by expressing a constitutively active form of the tyrosine kinase Lck (Lck505F) in T cells. Expression of Lck505F down-regulated TCR levels, an effect that was even more pronounced in CD45- T cells, in which the activity of this tyrosine kinase is further enhanced. Cells expressing Lck505F synthesized all TCR subunits, but lysosomal degradation of assembled receptors was enhanced. TCRs were rapidly internalized and degraded after removal of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that had permitted cell surface expression. Finally, TCR levels on thymocytes were increased by an Lck inhibitor, and activation- but not phorbol ester-induced internalization of TCRs on Jurkat cells was prevented by inhibition or loss of Lck. These studies identify a regulated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway for targeting cell surface receptors for lysosomal degradation.","5030":"During development, progenitor thymocytes differentiate into either CD4 or CD8 T cells, and this fate decision depends on the specificity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) for MHC class II or class I molecules. Based on the mechanisms of fate specification known for simple metazoan organisms, we sought to determine whether the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) play a role in T cell differentiation and lineage commitment. Using a dominant gain-of-function mutant of the erk2 gene, we show that differentiation into the CD4 lineage is favored. We also show that, conversely, the addition of a pharmacological inhibitor of the ERK pathway favors differentiation into the CD8 lineage. We present a quantitative selection model that incorporates these results as well as those of recent reports on the role of Notch in T cell lineage specification.","5031":"Following the recent realization that TCR beta transgenes can severely inhibit the rearrangement of endogenous Vbeta gene segments in the absence of pre-TCR alpha (pT alpha) chains, we tested whether the pre-TCR has an essential role in TCR beta allelic exclusion under more physiological conditions by analyzing TCR rearrangement in immature thymocytes by single-cell PCR. Our results in pT alpha+ mice are consistent with an ordered model of TCR beta rearrangement beginning on one allele and continuing on the other only when the first attempt is unsuccessful. By contrast, a higher proportion of thymocytes from pT alpha-\/- mice exhibited two productive TCR beta alleles. Thus, the pre-TCR-independent suppression of rearrangement by TCR beta transgenes represents a transgene artifact, whereas under physiological conditions the pre-TCR is essential for allelic exclusion.","5032":"A major issue is whether surface expression of the pre-TCR is necessary for signaling the development of immature thymocytes. To address this question, we generated transgenic mice expressing a TCRbeta chain that had a strong endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal (TCRbetaER) and that was expressed intracellularly but failed to reach the cell surface. In TCRbetaER transgenic mice, there was a failure of allelic exclusion. Also, the transgene failed to rescue the developmental defects observed in TCRbeta-null mice. In contrast, TCRbeta transgenes with a mutant ER retrieval sequence or lacking this sequence signaled efficient allelic exclusion and suppressed the TCRbeta-\/- defect. These data show that exit of the pre-TCR from the ER\/cis-Golgi is required for progression through the double-negative thymocyte checkpoint.","5033":"","5034":"In these studies, IFN gamma-inducing factor (IGIF), unlike IL-12, did not drive Th1 development in BALB\/c or C57BL\/6 mice, but like IL-1alpha, potentiated IL-12-driven Th1 development in BALB\/c mice. IGIF and IL-12 synergized for IFN gamma production from Th1 cells. Unlike IL-1alpha, IGIF had no effect on Th2 cells. IGIF signaled through IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, to induce nuclear translocation of p65\/p50 NFkappaB in Th1 cells. IL-1alpha had no effect on proliferation, cytokine production, or NFkappaB activation in Th1 cells but activated NFkappaB and proliferation in Th2 cells. Thus, Th1 and Th2 cells may differ in responsiveness and receptor expression for IL-1 family molecules. IGIF and IL-1alpha may differentially amplify Th1 and Th2 effector responses, respectively.","5035":"The immunoglobulin alpha (Ig alpha)\/Ig beta heterodimer was detected on the surface of mu-negative proB cell lines in association with calnexin. The cross-linking of Ig beta on proB cells freshly isolated from bone marrow of recombination activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient mice induced a rapid and transient tyrosine-phosphorylation of Ig alpha as well as an array of intracellular proteins including Syk, PI3-kinase, Vav, and SLP-76. It also elicited the phosphorylation and activation of a MAP kinase ERK but not JNK\/SAPK or p38. When RAG-2-deficient mice were treated with anti-Ig beta monoclonal antibody, developmentally arrested proB cells were induced to differentiate to the small preB cell stage as observed when the mu transgene was expressed in RAG-2-deficient mice. Thus, the cross-linking of Ig beta on proB cells appears to elicit differentiation signals analogous to those delivered by the preB cell receptor in normal B cell development.","5036":"Efficient T cell activation requires the engagement of a variety of ligand\/receptor molecules in addition to T cell receptor (TCR)-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)\/peptide interactions. The leukocyte function antigen 1 (LFA-1) and the CD28 glycoprotein have both been implicated in T cell activation. The present study dissects the roles of LFA-1 and CD28 in the activation of naive virus-specific CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that LFA-1 facilitates T cell activation by lowering the amounts of antigen necessary for T cell activation. In the absence of LFA-1, 100-fold more antigen was required for T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugation and all subsequent events of T cell activation, including TCR down-regulation, Ca2+-flux, T cell proliferation, and lytic effector cell induction. Thus, LFA-1 facilitates the functional triggering of TCRs by promoting adhesion of T cells to APCs but does not affect T cell activation otherwise. In contrast, CD28 played an entirely different role during T cell activation. CD28 reduced the number of TCRs that had to be triggered for T cell activation and allowed activation of T cells by low affinity ligands. CD28 but not LFA-1 prevented induction of T cell unresponsiveness after stimulation of TCRs. These results demonstrate that LFA-1 and CD28 exhibit distinct, nonoverlapping ways to influence T cell activation and suggest that the terms costimulation and signal 2 should be revisited.","5037":"Positive selection of CD4+CD8+ T cells to the CD4+CD8- helper and CD4- CD8+ cytotoxic lineages is a multistep process that involves complex regulation of coreceptor gene expression. By analyzing expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice, we have identified a DNA segment, located between the murine CD8beta and CD8alpha genes, that has enhancer activity restricted to CD8 lineage cells. Remarkably, this enhancer functions in thymocytes undergoing positive selection to the CD4-CD8+ phenotype but not in immature double-positive thymocytes. The enhancer also functions in gut intraepithelial lymphocytes that express CD8alpha but not CD8beta, suggesting that it is specific for CD8alpha expression. The tight correlation between activation of this enhancer and the final step in positive selection has important implications for understanding the mechanism of lineage commitment in thymocytes.","5038":"The coreceptors CD4 and CD8 play a crucial role during thymocyte development and T cell effector function, and their expression is developmentally regulated. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of CD8 gene regulation we cloned the murine CD8 gene locus from genomic libraries and analyzed this region for deoxyribonuclease (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (HSS). Here we report, using transgenic mice, deletion analysis of one of the identified clusters of DNase I hypersensitivity, consisting of three DNase I-HSS and located in the intergenic region between the CD8alpha and CD8beta genes. Our data show that at least two of the DNase I-HSS constituting this cluster are individually sufficient to direct CD8alpha or heterologous transgene expression to the mature CD8 single-positive T cell subset and that this expression coincides temporally with the appearance of positively selected T cells.","5039":"The analysis of T cell receptor alpha (TCR alpha) chains in mice transgenic for a TCR beta chain has allowed us to demonstrate a central role for self-peptides in the positive intrathymic selection of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted T cells. Analysis of specific V alpha-J alpha joins in mature CD4+ TCRhigh thymocytes and in peripheral CD4+ T cells revealed a limitation in amino-acid sequences. By analysis of immature thymocytes, we could show that this limited repertoire was selected from a more diverse repertoire. By analysis of the same beta chain-transgenic mice bred to H-2Ma-deficient mice that express one or a very limited number of peptides, we could demonstrate that the V alpha-J alpha join repertoire was now altered and much more limited. Together, these data provide molecular and genetic evidence that the intrathymic positive selection of the TCR repertoire is critically affected by self-peptides presented by MHC class II molecules, most likely on thymic cortical epithelial cells.","5040":"We have used gene targeted mutational approaches to assess the role of the T cell receptor alpha (TCR alpha) enhancer (E alpha) in the control of TCR alpha and TCR delta gene rearrangement and expression. We show that E alpha functions in cis to promote V alpha to J alpha rearrangement across the entire J alpha locus, a distance of greater than 70 kb. We also show that E alpha is required for normal alphabeta T cell development; in this lineage, E alpha is required for germline J alpha expression, for normal expression levels of rearranged V alpha J alpha genes, and for expression of a diverse V alpha repertoire. In gamma delta T cells, E alpha is not required for VdeltaDJdelta rearrangement, but, surprisingly, is required for normal expression levels of mature VdeltaDJdelta transcripts and for expression of germline J alpha transcripts. Our findings imply that E alpha function is not limited to the TCR alpha components of the TCRalpha\/delta locus or to the alpha beta lineage; rather, E alpha function is important in both alphabeta and gammadelta lineage T cells.","5041":"For a brief period during fetal lymph node organogenesis in mice, lymph node postcapillary high endothelial venules surprisingly express the Peyer's patch addressin MAdCAM-1. This expression allows initial seeding of this incipient structure by two unusual lymphocyte populations selectively expressing the Peyer's patch homing receptor integrin alpha4beta7: CD4+CD3- oligolineage progenitors and TCR gammadelta+ T cells. We show here that CD4+CD3- cells are lineage-restricted progenitors that express surface lymphotoxin-beta (LTbeta) and the chemokine receptor BLR1 and that can become natural killer cells, dendritic antigen-presenting cells, and follicular cells of unknown outcome, but these cells do not become T or B lymphocytes. Since the necessity of lymphotoxin in lymphoid organ development has been shown, we propose that the novel subset of CD4+CD3-LTbeta+ fetal cells is instrumental in the development of lymphoid tissue architecture.","5042":"The transcription factor Ikaros is a major determinant of lymphocyte differentiation. Mice homozygous for an Ikaros dominant-negative (DN-\/-) mutation lack all cells of lymphoid origin, including T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. Mice homozygous for an Ikaros null allele lack B and NK cells but display specific defects in T lymphocytes. Nonetheless, both Ikaros mutant lines make an excess of monocytes and macrophages. Here we report that the production of subsets of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) is also defective. By constructing bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that the Ikaros-mediated defect in lymphocytes and DCs is intrinsic to their precursors and is not environment dependent. The selective defects in DCs manifested with the Ikaros null mutation suggest a tight linkage between development of T cells and CD8alpha+ DCs. The complete lack of DCs in the lymphoid organs of Ikaros DN-\/- micke points to an essential role for the Ikaros gene family in the development of all DCs.","5043":"Genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is linked to the MHC class II allele HLA-DR4. The charge of the amino acid at DRbeta71 in the peptide-binding site appears to be critical in discriminating DR molecules linked to increased disease susceptibility. We have determined the 2.5 A x-ray structure of the DR4 molecule with the strongest linkage to RA (DRB1*0401) complexed with a human collagen II peptide. Details of a predicted salt bridge between lysine DRbeta71 and aspartic acid at the P4 peptide position suggest how it may participate in both antigen binding and TCR activation. A model is proposed for the DR4 recognition of collagen II (261-273), an antigen immunodominant in human-transgenic mouse models of RA.","5044":"The products of minor histocompatibility (H) loci are serious barriers to tissue transplantation even among major histocompatibility complex (MHC) identical individuals, frequently causing chronic graft rejection and graft versus host disease. Over 50 minor H loci map to mouse autosomal chromosomes but none are known at the molecular level. By expression cloning, we identified the H13 locus, a classical minor H locus first detected 30 years ago by the trait of graft rejection. The H13a allele is located on chromosome 2 and encodes a novel protein that yields the rare naturally processed nonapeptide SSVVGVWYL (SVL9) for presentation by the Db MHC class I molecule. The SVL9 peptide binds Db MHC despite the absence of the consensus binding motif, and a conservative methyl group substitution (Valine 4 &lt;--&gt; Isoleucine) explains why reciprocal T cell responses are elicited in H13a and H13b congenic strains.","5045":"The T cell repertoire is shaped by positive and negative selection of thymocytes that express low levels of T cell receptor (TCR) and both CD4 and CD8. TCR-mediated signals that determine these selection processes are only partly understood. Vav, a GDP-GTP exchange factor for Rho-family proteins, is tyrosine phosphorylated following TCR stimulation, suggesting that it may transduce TCR signals. We now demonstrate that mice lacking Vav are viable and display a profound defect in the positive selection of both class I- and class II-restricted T cells. In contrast, Vav is not essential for negative selection, though in its absence negative selection is much less effective. Vav may influence the efficiency of TCR-induced selection events by regulating the intracellular calcium flux of thymocytes.","5046":"","5047":"The death of BCG-infected human macrophages induced in vitro by ligation of surface CD95 (Fas), CD69, or complement-mediated lysis was shown not to result in the death of intracellular mycobacteria, whereas exposure to extracellular ATP initiated both macrophage death and killed the intracellular bacteria. ATP acted via P2Z receptors because these effects were mimicked by benzoylbenzoic ATP (a known agonist of P2Z receptors) and blocked by oxidized ATP, DIDS, suramin, amiloride, and KN62 (known inhibitors of P2Z-mediated responses). ATP-mediated bacterial killing was independent of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates and of actinomycin D or cycloheximide inhibition. ATP-induced macrophage cell death, BCG killing, and lucifer yellow dye incorporation were minimal in 2 out of 19 healthy donors. The results suggest possible genetic heterogeneity of this mechanism of mycobacterial killing associated with P2Z-mediated pore formation.","5048":"The significance of host defense mechanisms in primary listeriosis in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor receptor p55-\/- (TRp55-\/-) mice are susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes infection in the presence of leukocyte recruitment, inflammatory cytokine production (including IFNgamma), nitric oxide synthesis, and oxidative burst formation. Mice deficient for oxidative burst (p47[phox-\/-] mice) are relatively resistant to listeriosis. Despite activation of these antibacterial effector systems, TRp55-\/- phagocytes in vivo are incapable of confining and eradicating L. monocytogenes inside phagolysosomes. Bone marrow chimeras reveal that for eradication of L. monocytogenes, TRp55 is crucially required only on cells from hematopoietic origin. Unexpectedly, prior to death, exocrine pancreatic cells undergo apoptosis in TRp55-\/- mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate that in vivo, TRp55 initiates a protective, listericidal mechanism in phagocytes that differs from nitric oxide production and oxidative burst formation and that uncontrolled listeriosis results in necrotizing pancreatitis in TRp55-\/- mice.","5049":"Diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas. We have previously reported that transgenic expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) counterregulates the disease process, completely protecting NOD mice from insulitis and diabetes. Here we demonstrate the presence of autoreactivity but lack of pathogenicity of the IL-4-regulated lymphocytes. The importance of T cell diversity for the protective effect of IL-4 is demonstrated through breeding with transgenic BDC2.5 mice, which have an almost exclusively monoclonal T cell repertoire. Limitation of T cell diversity abrogated the protection by IL-4. We suggest that \"immune deviation\" in NOD-IL-4 mice is mediated by the pancreatic tissue itself, which causes activation of distinct, nonpathogenic T cell specificities.","5050":"Recent experiments have suggested that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) can down-regulate islet-specific T cells and prevent the development of autoimmune diabetes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing both TNFalpha and the Leishmania major LACK antigen in the pancreas (RIP-TNFalpha\/RIP-LACK) exhibit an impaired ability to mount a CD4+ T cell response against LACK. In addition, peripheral CD4+ T cells from TCR transgenic mice (TCR-LACK\/RIP-TNFalpha\/RIP-LACK) produced reduced interleukin-2 but elevated levels of T helper 2 cytokines in response to LACK peptide in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that TNFalpha may act in vivo to modulate a potentially damaging self-reactive T cell response by inducing tolerance to pancreatic antigens.","5051":"Naturally processed MHC class II-bound peptides possess ragged NH2 and COOH termini. It is not known whether these peptide flanking residues (PFRs), which lie outside the MHC anchor residues, are recognized by the TCR or influence immunogenicity. Here we analyzed T cell responses to the COOH-terminal PFR of the H-2A(k) immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) 52-61. Surprisingly, the majority of T cells were completely dependent on, and specific for, the COOH-terminal PFR of the immunogen. In addition, there were striking correlations between TCR V beta usage and PFR dependence. We hypothesize that the V alpha CDR1 region recognizes NH2-terminal PFRs, while the V beta CDR1 region recognizes COOH-terminal PFRs. Last, peptides containing PFRs were considerably more immunogenic and mediated a greater recall response to the HEL protein. These results demonstrate that PFRs, which are a unique characteristic of peptides bound to MHC class II molecules, can have a profound effect on TCR recognition and T cell function. These data may have important implications for peptide-based immunotherapy and vaccine development.","5052":"The recognition of peptide variants by the T cell receptor (TCR) has revealed a wide range of possible responses. Here, using a series of CD4+ and CD4- variants of the same T cell hybridoma, we find that while the expression of CD4 converts weak agonists into full agonists, none of the antagonist peptides are efficiently recognized as agonists. Furthermore, in antagonist assays, little difference can be seen in the response of CD4+ and CD4- T cells. Together with previous work showing a marked difference in stability between TCR binding to agonist versus antagonist ligands, these data suggest that CD4 engagement occurs after a TCR-peptide\/MHC complex has formed and that it requires a certain minimal half-life of the ternary complex to be fully engaged in signaling.","5053":"The Syk family of protein tyrosine kinases, consisting of ZAP-70 and Syk, associate with the pre- and alphabeta T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) and undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and activation following receptor engagement. Thymocyte development in zap-70-\/- mice is blocked at the CD4+CD8+ TCR(lo) stage. The presence of Syk in the thymus has raised the possibility that Syk may be able to mediate TCR function. To determine if Syk can play a role in thymocyte development, we generated zap-70-\/- mice expressing a human syk cDNA. Syk expression restored both thymocyte development and function. In addition, Syk function required the CD45 transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase. Hence, ZAP-70 and Syk can play overlapping functions and exhibit similar regulatory mechanisms in mediating alphabeta T cell development.","5054":"The V(H) repertoire on both H chain alleles of normal and lambda5-deficient B lineage cells were analyzed by single-cell PCR. The mu H chains were tested for their capacity to form a pre-B cell receptor. In bone marrow, D-proximal V(H) genes were found preferentially expressed in lambda5-deficient pre-B cells and in a newly identified early c-kit+ cytoplasmic mu H chain+ pre-B cell population of normal mice. Only half of the mu H chains expressed in these cells have the capacity to form a pre-B cell receptor. Representation of the D-proximal V(H) genes was found suppressed on the productive but not on the nonproductive V(H)DJ(H) rearranged alleles of c-kit preB-II cells and splenic lambda5-deficient B cells. More than 95% of the mu H chains expressed in preB-II cells can form a pre-B cell receptor. These results demonstrate that the pre-B cell receptor in normal mice and the B cell receptor in lambda5-deficient mice mediate a shift in the V(H) repertoire.","5055":"Molecular definition of the cellular receptor for the collagen domain of C1q has been elusive. We now report that C1q binds specifically to human CR1 (CD35), the leukocyte C3b\/C4b receptor, and the receptor on erythrocytes for opsonized immune complexes. Biotinylated or radioiodinated C1q (*C1q) bound specifically to transfected K562 cells expressing cell surface CR1 and to immobilized recombinant soluble CR1 (rsCR1). *C1q binding to rsCR1 was completely inhibited by unlabeled C1q and the collagen domain of C1q and was partially inhibited by C3b dimers. Kinetic analysis in physiologic saline of the interaction of unlabeled C1q with immobilized rsCR1 using surface plasmon resonance yielded an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K[eq2]) of 3.9 nM. Thus, CR1 is a cellular C1q receptor that recognizes all three complement opsonins, namely, C1q, C3b, and C4b.","5056":"The site of origin of lymphohematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that initiate definitive blood cell production in the murine fetal liver is controversial. Contrary to reports that the preliver yolk sac does not contain definitive HSC, we observed that CD34+ day 9 yolk sac cells repopulated multiple blood cell lineages in newborn hosts for at least 1 year. Furthermore, 100 CD34+c-Kit+ day 9 yolk sac or para-aortic splanchnopleura (P-Sp) cells, known to give rise to embryonic HSC, similarly repopulated hematopoiesis in recipient hosts. Surprisingly, 37-fold more CD34+c-Kit+ cells reside in the day 9 yolk sac than in the P-Sp. In sum, definitive HSC are coexistent, but not equal in number, in the murine yolk sac and P-Sp prior to fetal liver colonization.","5057":"Two regions of the vertebrate embryo, the blood islands and the dorsal lateral plate (DLP), participate in early hematopoietic development. In Xenopus, primitive erythrocytes are derived solely from the ventral blood islands (VBI), while definitive hematopoietic cells such as lymphocytes are derived from both VBI and DLP. We have utilized a transplantation technique to demonstrate in vivo that all hematopoietic cells (embryonic, fetal, or adult) originate from ventral mesoderm. Reciprocal grafts between VBI and DLP demonstrated that both regions are bipotential with respect to primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Commitment of the VBI to primitive erythropoiesis and restriction of the DLP to definitive hematopoiesis occurs during neurula stages. Thus, hematopoietic development involves the induction of the blood program on the ventral axis of the embryo followed by environmentally regulated specification to the primitive or definitive lineages.","5058":"","5059":"V(D)J recombination assembles the variable portion of antigen receptor genes in developing lymphocytes and is the only site-specific recombination reaction known in vertebrates. A cell-free system has been established that performs DNA cleavage, end processing, and joining to yield V(D)J coding joints that exhibit structural features similar to those formed in vivo. The reaction has the expected substrate, metal ion, and RAG protein requirements. The efficiency of coding joint formation is reduced dramatically by uncoupling the cleavage and joining portions of the reaction, indicating that a postcleavage coding end complex facilitates joining. By varying the reaction conditions, nucleotide loss from coding ends and heterogeneity of coding joints can be regulated. This cell-free system provides a novel tool for detailed mechanistic analyses of the end processing and joining steps of V(D)J recombination.","5060":"A novel CC chemokine was identified in the thymus of mouse and human and was designated TECK (thymus-expressed chemokine). TECK has weak homology to other CC chemokines and maps to mouse chromosome 8. Besides the thymus, mRNA encoding TECK was detected at substantial levels in the small intestine and at low levels in the liver. The source of TECK in the thymus was determined to be thymic dendritic cells; in contrast, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells do not express TECK. The murine TECK recombinant protein showed chemotactic activity for activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and thymocytes. We conclude that TECK represents a novel thymic dendritic cell-specific CC chemokine that is possibly involved in T cell development.","5061":"In the present study, we describe a novel inhibitory receptor, leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1), that is constitutively expressed on the majority of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. LAIR-1 is a 32 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with a single immunoglobulin-like domain and a cytoplasmic tail containing two immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. LAIR-1 recruits SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases upon activation, and cross-linking of the LAIR-1 antigen on natural killer (NK) cells results in strong inhibition of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Although it is structurally related to human killer cell inhibitory receptors, LAIR-1 does not appear to recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules and thus represents a novel HLA class I-independent mechanism of NK cell regulation.","5062":"The human cytomegalovirus UL18 gene product is a homolog of cellular major histocompatibility (MHC) class I antigens. UL18 has been proposed to protect virus-infected cells against natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity by engaging NK cell killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) for MHC class I. UL18 binds to a novel immunoglobulin superfamily glycoprotein, designated Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (LIR-1). This protein is distinct from, but related to, known KIRs and binds cellular MHC class I antigens. The cytoplasmic domain of LIR-1 contains four putative immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Upon tyrosine phosphorylation, LIR-1 associates with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. In contrast to KIRs, LIR-1 is expressed predominantly on monocytic and B lymphoid cell types, suggesting a distinct biological function.","5063":"T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for hen egg lysozyme (HEL) were crossed with mice expressing HEL on the thyroid epithelium, on pancreatic islet beta cells, or systemically. Depending on the pattern of HEL expression, deletion of double-positive thymocytes ranged from minimal to complete, and peripheral CD4 cells exhibited graded reduction in TCR expression, in vitro responsiveness, and in vivo helper ability. CD4 cells were least tolerant in TCR\/thyroid-HEL and TCR\/islet-HEL mice, which developed an extensive lymphocytic thyroiditis or insulitis that nevertheless did not eliminate HEL-expressing endocrine cells. Autoreactive CD4 clones thus escape the thymus under a range of circumstances, retain sufficient function to initiate subclinical autoimmune inflammation when self-antigens are concentrated in the thyroid or pancreas, and may regulate progression of subclinical inflammation to destructive autoimmune disease.","5064":"Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional regulation that govern T cell selection processes and the differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Mice lacking the interferon regulatory transcription factor-1 (IRF-1) have reduced numbers of mature CD8+ cells within the thymus and peripheral lymphatic organs. Here we show that positive and negative T cell selection of two MHC class I-restricted TCR alphabeta transgenes, H-Y and P14, are impaired in IRF-1-\/- mice. The absence of IRF-1 resulted in decreased expression of LMP2, TAP1, and MHC class I on thymic stromal cells. Despite decreased MHC class I expression on IRF-1-\/- thymic stromal cells, the defect in CD8+ T cells development did not reside in the thymic environment, and IRF-1-\/- stromal cells can fully support development of CD8+ thymocytes in in vivo bone marrow chimeras and in vitro reaggregation cultures. Moreover, IRF-1-\/- thymocytes displayed impaired TCR-mediated signal transduction, and the induction of negative selection in TCR Tg thymocytes from IRF-1-\/- mice required a 1000-fold increase in selecting peptide. We also provide evidence that IRF-1 is mainly expressed in mature, but not immature, thymocytes and that expression of IRF-1 in immature thymocytes is induced after peptide-specific TCR activation. These results indicate that IRF-1 regulates gene expression in developing thymocytes required for lineage commitment and selection of CD8+ thymocytes.","5065":"The 2C transgenic TCR is positively selected on Kb and is alloreactive for and negatively selected on Ld. To test an avidity model for positive selection, mice were bred to express different levels of surface Ld by varying the number of gene copies encoding beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) or Ld heavy chain. Whereas mice expressing 35% Ld (beta 2m+\/- Ld+\/-) negatively selected the 2C TCR, mice expressing 2% Ld (beta 2m-\/- Ld+\/-) positively selected the 2C TCR. Furthermore, 2C cytotoxic T lymphocytes selected on 2% Ld showed peptide-specific cytolytic activity against Ld\/p2Ca targets. These findings provide clear in vivo evidence that positive selection can occur on very low levels of the same class I antigen capable of negative selection when expressed at higher levels.","5066":"To understand how thymic selection gives rise to T cells that are capable of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted recognition of antigen but are tolerant of self, we directly examined how peptide\/MHC ligands expressed on thymic epithelial cells trigger the positive selection of immature thymocytes. We demonstrate that abundant self-peptides, purified from the H-2D(b) molecules of thymic epithelial cells, are specifically recognized during the positive selection of CD8+ T cells, implying that positive selection generates a repertoire of T cells that is weakly self-reactive. We also found that this recognition is somewhat cross-reactive, thereby providing an explanation for how the specific recognition of a limited repertoire of thymic self-peptides can select a diverse repertoire of T cells.","5067":"The influence of individual peptides in thymic selection was examined in H2-M- mice, in which positive selection is directed to a single peptide, class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) bound to H2-A(b). Two sensitive in vivo approaches showed that 70%-80% of CD4+ T cells undergoing positive selection to CLIP+H2-A(b) have self-reactivity to the various peptides expressed on wild-type H2-M+ antigen-presenting cells. When these self-reactive T cells were depleted, the residual CD4+ cells displayed a polyclonal repertoire in terms of alloreactivity, responses to foreign protein antigens, and Vbeta usage. Nevertheless, studies with two T cell receptor transgenic lines suggested that the repertoire of CD4+ cells induced by CLIP was less diverse than the repertoire of CD4+ cells in normal mice. Generation of a fully diverse T cell repertoire thus requires positive selection against multiple peptides.","5068":"The role of self-peptides in positive selection of CD4+ T cells has been controversial. We show that some self-peptides are presented by the MHC class II molecule I-A(b) in mice lacking Ii or H-2M but not in mice expressing a transgene-encoded peptide fused to I-A(b). In experiments using specific antibodies to block selection, these low-abundance self-peptides were implicated in the positive selection of some CD4+ T cells in H-2M-\/- mice. However, all three mutant backgrounds failed to positively select two class II-restricted transgenic T cell receptors. Our findings suggest that minor components of the self-peptide repertoire can contribute to positive selection of a significant number of CD4+ T cells. In addition, the data suggest that T cell receptor repertoires selected in wild-type mice and in mice displaying limited spectra of self-peptides are distinct.","5069":"According to past reports, H-2Ma0\/0 mice express a single major histocompatiblity complex class II molecule, A(b), heavily loaded with a single peptide derived from the invariant chain, CLIP. Despite the highly restricted diversity of the class II:peptide complexes expressed on thymic stromal cells in the mutant animals, a large and diverse population of CD4+ T cells is positively selected. However, two important issues remained unresolved and are addressed here: Just how preponderant is CLIP occupancy of the class II molecules from H-2M0\/0 mice? How extensive and functionally competent is the CD4+ population selected in the mutant animals? Our results argue that a single class II:peptide complex can select a very broad, though not complete, repertoire of CD4+ T cells.","5070":"We tested the ability of CD4+ T cells, selected in the thymus by reaction with class II protein bound to a single peptide, to react with the same class II protein bound to other peptides. The T cells reacted with all peptides tested, including one that was quite unlike the selecting peptide in T cell receptor binding residues. The receptors on class II\/peptide-reactive T cells from class II\/single peptide mice were similar but not identical to some of those from normal animals. Thus, class II bound to a single peptide selects a subset of T cells that is related to that selected by class II bound to many peptides.","5071":"","5072":"Mice lacking thymic function of the GTPase Rho show severe defects in fetal and adult thymopoiesis. Rho thymi are deficient in CD44+ CD25+ pro-T cells and CD44- CD25+ early pre-T cells because Rho function is required for survival but not G1\/S phase cell cycle progression in these populations. The selective apoptosis defect in Rho prothymocytes can be rescued by expression of a bcl-2 transgene. A second function for Rho is seen in CD44- CD25- late pre-T cells: Rho regulates cell cycle progression but not survival of this population. These studies show that the critical processes of proliferation and survival are independently regulated during thymopoiesis and establish two different functions for Rho in the development of early thymic progenitors.","5073":"The common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) is an indispensable subunit for the formation of lymphoid-related cytokine receptors, including IL-7 and IL-15 receptors, that mediate nonredundant or critical signals for the differentiation of T and B cells and natural killer (NK) cells, respectively. We introduced the bcl-2 transgene driven by E mu or H-2K promoters into gamma(c)-deficient mice that lack all three lymphoid subclasses. The forced expression of Bcl-2 restored all stages of T lymphopoiesis, but not B or NK cell development, indicating that a primary function of gamma(c)-mediated signals in the T lineage might be to maintain cell survival. Therefore, the development of T, B, and NK cells may be influenced by distinct intracytoplasmic signaling cascades that are activated by coupling of gamma(c)-related receptors.","5074":"Interleukin-7 (IL-7)-deficient mice exhibit an early defect in lymphopoiesis. We examined Bcl-2 expression and the cell cycle status of immature thymocyte subsets in these mice. In IL-7-deficient mice, developmental transition to a T cell-committed fate was accompanied by a striking loss of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increased relative proportion of cells in the G0\/G1 stage of the cell cycle. Short-term culture of immature thymocytes with rIL-7 caused up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and cell survival. These data specify a T cell lineage developmental transition point, prior to T cell antigen receptor rearrangement, where IL-7 signal transduction is linked to an anti-apoptosis mechanism and the cell cycle.","5075":"mel-18 is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila melanogaster Polycomb group genes. Mice lacking the mel-18 gene show a posterior transformation of the axial skeleton, severe combined immunodeficiency, and a food-passing disturbance in the lower intestine due to hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer. In this study, the severe combined immunodeficiency observed in mel-18 mutant mice is correlated with the impaired mitotic response of lymphocyte precursors upon interleukin-7 stimulation. Strikingly, the axial skeleton and lymphoid phenotypes are identical in both mel-18 and bmi-1 mutants, indicating that the Mel-18 and Bmi-1 gene products might act in the same genetic cascade. These results suggest that mammalian Polycomb group gene products are involved in cell cycle progression in the immune system.","5076":"De novo differentiation of CD4+ T cells was provoked in mice lacking major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules by intrathymic injection of adenovirus vectors carrying class II genes. This permits a new approach to questions concerning the dynamics of CD4+ T cell compartments in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs. Here two issues are explored. First, we show that mature CD4+ CD8- cells reside in the thymus for a protracted period before emigrating to the periphery, highlighting the potential importance of, and our ignorance of, the postselection maturation period. Second, we demonstrate that the survival of CD4+ cells in peripheral lymphoid organs is markedly curtailed when class II molecules are absent and is not further reduced in the absence of both class II and class I molecules, raising the possibility that MHC-mediated selection may continue in the periphery.","5077":"To reach the cell surface, the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR)-CD3 complex must assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where single subunits are retained and degraded. However, the exact location of breakdown and the mechanism and proteases involved in destruction of free subunits have remained elusive. We show that degradation of the TCR alpha chain is impaired in the presence of lactacystin and carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal, two inhibitors for proteasomal proteolysis. We identified breakdown intermediates that were either soluble, cytosolic, and devoid of N-linked glycans, or membrane-associated and partially deglycosylated by cytosolic N-glycanase. Protease protection experiments showed a cytosolic disposition of these membrane-associated intermediates. Combined, these results argue for a cytosolic degradation route of the TCR alpha chain involving dislocation from the ER, followed by cytosolic deglycosylation and proteolysis by the proteasome.","5078":"We recently described human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A2, A3 and B7 supertypes, characterized by largely overlapping peptide-binding specificities and represented in a high percentage of different populations. Here, we identified 17 Plasmodium falciparum peptides capable of binding these supertypes and assessed antigenicity in both vaccinated and naturally exposed populations. Positive cytotoxic T lymphocyte recall and cytokine (interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) responses were detected for all peptides; all were recognized in the context of more than one HLA class I molecule; and at least 12 of the 17 were recognized in the context of all HLA alleles studied. These data validate the concept of HLA supertypes at the biological level, show that highly degenerate peptides are almost always recognized as epitopes, and demonstrate the feasibility of developing a universally effective vaccine by focusing on a limited number of peptide specificities.","5079":"The major pathway of gammadelta cell development is shown to be regulated by in-frame rearrangements at the T cell receptor (TCR) delta locus. Such \"delta selection\" occurs at or around the same point in thymocyte development as selection for in-frame rearrangements at the TCRbeta locus. However, there are at least two major differences with beta selection: first, delta selection commonly involves selection on the cognate TCR chain, gamma, suggesting that there is no \"preTgamma\" chain of major biological significance; second, most gammadelta-selected thymocytes differentiate rather than proliferate. Nonetheless, some delta selection events seemingly facilitate thymocyte expansion, similar to alphabeta T cell development. In these cases, TCRgamma selection is less obvious. Furthermore, the capacity of individual gamma chains to facilitate gammadelta selection is shown to vary with developmental age. The results further clarify early T cell development at the beta selection\/delta selection stage and place clear constraints on models of cell fate determination.","5080":"Lyn-deficient mice were generated to analyze the role of Lyn in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling. These mice had a reduced number of peripheral B cells with a greater proportion of immature cells and a higher than normal turnover rate. Aged lyn-\/- mice developed splenomegaly, produced autoantibodies, and had an expanded population of B lymphoblasts of the B1 lineage. Splenic B cells from young lyn-\/- mice initiated early BCR signaling events, although in a delayed fashion. Unexpectedly, lyn-\/- B cells exhibited an enhanced MAP kinase activation and an increased proliferative response to BCR engagement. Stimulation of lyn-\/- B cells with intact and F(ab')2 anti-IgM revealed defects in at least two mechanisms that negatively regulate BCR signaling, one of which involves Fc gammaRIIb1.","5081":"The signaling pathways linked to membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) that are regulated by the coreceptors CD19 and CD22 are not known. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK2, JNK, and p38 couple extracellular signals to transcriptional responses. The capacity of mIg to activate these MAP kinases is synergistically amplified by coligating CD19, and this effect requires that CD19 be juxtaposed to mIg. CD22 suppresses MAP kinase activation when cross-linked to mIg alone or to the coligated complex of mIg and CD19. Separate ligation and sequestration of CD22 from mIg enhances MAP kinase activation, probably reflecting release of mIg from constitutive down-regulation. Thus, CD19 and CD22 have counterregulatory effects on MAP kinase activation by mIg, which are dependent on their proximity to the antigen receptor.","5082":"The B cell receptor for immunoglobulin G, Fc gammaRIIB1, is a potent transducer of signals that block antigen-induced B cell activation. Coligation of Fc gammaRIIB1 with B lymphocyte antigen receptors (BCR) causes premature termination of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization and inhibits proliferation. This inhibitory signal is mediated in part by phosphorylation of Fc gammaRIIB1 and recruitment of phosphatases; however, the molecular target(s) of effectors is unknown. Here we report that Fc gammaRIIB1 inhibition of BCR signaling is mediated in part by selective dephosphorylation of CD19, a BCR accessory molecule and coreceptor. CD19 dephosphorylation leads to failed CD19 association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and this in turn leads to termination of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production, intracellular Ca2+ release, and Ca2+ influx. The results define a molecular circuit by which Fc gammaRIIB signals block phosphoinositide hydrolysis.","5083":"Ku, a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa subunits, plays a critical but poorly understood role in V(D)J recombination. Although Ku86-deficient mice are defective in coding and signal joint formation, rare recombination products have been detected by PCR. Here, we report nucleotide sequences of 99 junctions from Ku86-deficient mice. Over 90% of the coding joints, but not signal or hybrid joints, exhibit short sequence homologies, indicating that homology is required to join coding ends in the absence of Ku86. Our results suggest that Ku86 may normally have distinct functions in the formation of these different types of junctions. Furthermore, Ku86(-\/-) joints are unexpectedly devoid of N-region diversity, suggesting a novel role for Ku in the addition of N nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.","5084":"Early B cell factor (EBF) and E47 participate in the transcriptional control of early B lymphocyte differentiation. With the aim of identifying genetic targets for these transcription factors, we stably transfected cDNAs encoding EBF or a covalent homodimer of E47, individually or together, into immature hematopoietic Ba\/F3 cells, which lack both factors. In combination, EBF and E47 induce efficient expression of the endogenous immunoglobulin surrogate light chain genes, lambda5 and VpreB, whereas other pre-B cell-specific genes remain silent. Multiple functionally important EBF and E47 binding sites were identified in the lambda5 promoter\/enhancer region, indicating that lambda5 is a direct genetic target for these transcription factors. Taken together, these data suggest that EBF and E47 synergize to activate expression of a subset of genes that define an early stage of the B cell lineage.","5085":"RAG-1 is an essential component of the site-specific V(D)J recombinase. A new assay system has revealed a significant contribution of the catalytically dispensible N-terminal region of RAG-1 to recombination activity. The foundation for this system is an Abelson virus-transformed cell line derived from RAG-1(-\/-) mice that is dependent on the introduction of exogenous RAG-1 for rearrangement of either plasmid substrates or the endogenous immunoglobulin loci. Use of this line demonstrates that conserved and novel cysteine-containing elements in the N-terminal region are required for full RAG-1 activity when recombination activity is in a RAG-1 dose-responsive range. Our data suggest that the RAG-1 N-terminus enhances the formation of an active recombination complex that facilitates the rearrangement process.","5086":"","5087":"RIN1 was originally identified by its ability to physically bind to and interfere with activated Ras in yeast. Paradoxically, RIN1 potentiates the oncogenic activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in hematopoietic cells and dramatically accelerates BCR-ABL-induced leukemias in mice. RIN1 rescues BCR-ABL mutants for transformation in a manner distinguishable from the cell cycle regulators c-Myc and cyclin D1 and the Ras connector Shc. These biological effects require tyrosine phosphorylation of RIN1 and binding of RIN1 to the Abl-SH2 and SH3 domains. RIN1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and is associated with BCR-ABL in human and murine leukemic cells. RIN1 exemplifies a new class of effector molecules dependent on the concerted action of the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase.","5088":"Mice deficient in the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB die during fetal development. Introduction of p50\/p65-deficient fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated hosts resulted in a severe deficit of fetal liver-derived lymphocytes and their immediate precursors but an overabundance of fetal liver-derived granulocytes. Surprisingly, simultaneous transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells rescued the production of p50\/p65-deficient lymphocytes. Expression of immunoglobulin K light chains on these rescued NF-kappaB-deficient B lymphocytes was normal. These results suggest that while p50 and p65 do not regulate the maturation of pre-B cells, NF-kappaB mediates the development or survival of an early lymphocyte precursor through regulation of an extracellular factor.","5089":"Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a central role in apoptosis. Caspase-8 may be the first enzyme of the proteolytic cascade activated by the Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Caspase-8 is recruited to Fas and TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1) through interaction of its prodomain with the death effector domain (DED) of the receptor-associating FADD. Here we describe a novel 55 kDa protein, Casper, that has sequence similarity to caspase-8 throughout its length. However, Casper is not a caspase since it lacks several conserved amino acids found in all caspases. Casper interacts with FADD, caspase-8, caspase-3, TRAF1, and TRAF2 through distinct domains. When overexpressed in mammalian cells, Casper potently induces apoptosis. A C-terminal deletion mutant of Casper inhibits TNF- and Fas-induced cell death, suggesting that Casper is involved in these apoptotic pathways.","5090":"Fas\/APO-1(CD95) ligation activates programmed cell death, a cellular process that plays an important role in the maturation of the host immune response. We show that activation of a specific MAP kinase kinase (MKK), MKK6b, is necessary and sufficient for Fas-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. MKK6b activation occurs downstream of an interleukin-1 converting enzyme-like (ICE-like) protease(s), while execution of the apoptotic pathway by MKK6b requires both ICE- and CPP32-like proteases. Surprisingly, the p38 MAP kinase protein, a known substrate of MKK6b, does not participate in Fas\/MKK6b-mediated apoptosis. These findings indicate a divergence of the MKK6b signaling pathways, one of which activates p38 and leads to regulation of gene expression, and one of which activates the ICE\/Ced-3 family of proteases and leads to cell death. These studies represent a demonstration of an apoptotic pathway that is comprised of both the ICE\/Ced-3 family of proteases and MAP kinase kinase 6.","5091":"Here we describe generation of Aw3.18, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes peptide residues 48-62 of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) bound to the MHC class II molecule I-Ak. Epitope mapping revealed that Aw3.18 detects a change in the solvent-exposed surface of this peptide-MHC complex upon substitution of the peptide side chain at position P1. Furthermore, Aw3.18 blocked recognition by some, but not all, of the HEL 48-62-reactive T cell hybridomas tested, suggesting a heterogeneity in the T cell response toward this complex. Finally, using Aw3.18, it was possible to determine the fraction of I-Ak molecules loaded with 48-62 peptide after culture of an antigen-presenting cell in medium containing HEL.","5092":"CD8+ T lymphocytes recognize antigens as short peptides bound to MHC class I molecules. Available methods cannot determine the number and distribution of these ligands on individual cells or detect antigen-presenting cells in tissues. Here we describe a method for eliciting and identifying monoclonal antibodies specific for a particular peptide-MHC class I combination. One such antibody can identify antigen complexes with a limit of detection approaching that of T cells. We used this antibody to determine the number of peptide-class I complexes generated upon viral infection, to identify antigen-presenting cells in cell mixtures, to determine the site of peptide-MHC class I interaction inside cells, and to visualize cells bearing specific peptide-MHC class I complexes after in vivo infection. Similar antibodies may prove useful for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders.","5093":"Mice deficient for the pre-TCR alpha (pT alpha) chain cannot form a pre-T cell receptor (TCR) and exhibit a severe defect in early T cell development, characterized by lack of \"beta selection\" and impaired generation of double-positive (DP) thymocytes. Here, we demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of CD3epsilon-specific antibodies into pT alpha-\/- x RAG-\/- mice or introduction of an activated p56(lck) transgene in pT alpha-\/- mice fully restores the number of DP thymocytes, and that expression of a transgenic pT alpha chain lacking its cytoplasmic portion can overcome all developmental defects associated with pT alpha deficiency. These results allow a better definition of the role of pT alpha in pre-TCR signal transduction and provide conclusive evidence that the cytoplasmic tail of pT alpha is not essential for pre-TCR signaling.","5094":"The interleukin-3 family of cytokines, which play an important role in the development of myeloid lineages, transduce signals through the JAK-STAT pathway. Previous studies demonstrate that this process entails the activation of four distinct isoforms of STAT5, where two shorter isoforms are activated in a distinct population of cells. We now demonstrate that the shorter isoforms represent carboxy-terminal truncations. Moreover, these truncations are not generated by RNA processing, but by a specific proteolytic activity. Consistent with the notion that truncated STAT5 isoforms transduce distinct signals, they fail to promote the activation of several known interleukin-3 target genes. These studies suggest that the activity of a specific protease may play a critical role in defining the biological responses transduced by STAT5.","5095":"The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) mediates the effects of IFN. No information exists on its role in lymphokine production. Protection against the intracellular pathogen Leishmania major depends on a Th1 response. Here, we show that CD4+ T cells from Leishmania-infected mice lacking one (+\/-) or both (-\/-) alleles of the IRF-1 gene developed a profound, gene dose-dependent decrease in IFNgamma production. IRF-1(-\/-) mice showed dramatically exacerbated Leishmaniasis. They produced increased Leishmania-specific IgG1 and IgE, and their CD4+ T cells produced increased IL-4, characteristics of the non-protective Th2 response. In cell transfer experiments, IRF-1(-\/-) CD4+ T cells mounted normal Th1 responses. However, the ability of IRF-1(-\/-) mice to produce IL-12 was severely compromised. Thus, IRF-1 is a determining factor for Th1 responses.","5096":"Eradication of a given pathogen is dependent on the selective differentiation of T helper (Th) cells into Th1 or Th2 types. We show here that T cells from mice lacking the transcription factor IRF-1 fail to mount Th1 responses and instead exclusively undergo Th2 differentiation in vitro. Compromised Th1 differentiation is found to be associated with defects in multiple cell types, namely impaired production of interleukin-12 by macrophages, hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells to interleukin-12, and defective development of natural killer cells. These results indicate the involvement of IRF-1 in multiple stages of the Th1 limb of the immune response.","5097":"Development of immature CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes into functionally mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is driven by selection events that require signals transduced through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). Transduction of TCR signals in the thymus involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 by p56(lck) and results in induction of ZAP-70 enzymatic activity. We have identified a novel, spontaneously arising point mutation within a highly conserved motif (DLAARN) in the kinase domain of murine ZAP-70 that uncouples tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 from induction of ZAP-70 kinase activity. Mice homozygous for this mutation are devoid of mature T cells because thymocyte development is arrested at the CD4+ CD8+ stage of differentiation. The developmental arrest is due to the inability of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes to propagate TCR signals in the absence of ZAP-70 kinase activity despite tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-associated ZAP-70 molecules.","5098":"","5099":"T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic thymocytes specific for the LCMV gp peptide are normally positively selected to the CD8 lineage. Transgenic thymocyte development was substantially reduced in the absence of these CD8 coreceptors. However, efficient positive selection was restored when TCR transgenic CD8-\/- fetal thymic lobes were cultured with a peptide variant of the wild-type ligand. These mature thymocytes were functional, as shown by their ability to respond against strong peptide agonists. Additional experiments demonstrated that transgenic positive selection was peptide-specific. These results prove that CD8 does not possess essential signaling properties that are necessary for T cell development. In addition, the unilateral commitment of transgenic thymocytes to mature CD4-TCR(hi) T cells expressing intracellular perforin suggests that there must be some instructive component to CD4 down-regulation and lineage commitment during thymocyte selection.","5100":"The absence of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and the failure of MHC class I-restricted T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic thymocytes to mature in CD8alpha-deficient mice suggest that CD8 may be essential for CD8 lineage commitment. We report that variants of the antigenic peptide that delete TCR transgenic thymocytes from CD8 wild-type but not CD8alpha-deficient mice can restore positive selection of CD8 lineage cells in the absence of CD8. The positively selected cells down-regulate CD4, up-regulate TCR, respond to the antigenic peptide, and express CD8beta mRNA. Interestingly, there was no enhanced selection of CD4+ T cells, implying that the TCR-MHC interaction, even in the absence of CD8, provided instructive signaling for commitment to the CD8 lineage. Our results are discussed in terms of recent models of T cell lineage commitment.","5101":"Human cytomegalovirus inhibits peptide import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the MHC-encoded TAP peptide transporter. We identified the open reading frame US6 to mediate this effect. Expression of the 21 kDa US6 glycoprotein in human cytomegalovirus-infected cells correlates with the inhibition of peptide transport during infection. The subcellular localization of US6 is ER restricted and is identical with TAP. US6 protein is found in complexes with TAP1\/2, MHC class I heavy chain, beta2-microglobulin, calnexin, calreticulin, and tapasin. TAP inhibition, however, is independent of the presence of class I heavy chain and tapasin. The results establish a new mechanism for viral immune escape and a novel role for ER-resident proteins to regulate TAP via its luminal face.","5102":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) inhibits MHC class I antigen presentation by a sequential multistep process involving a family of unique short (US) region-encoded glycoproteins. US3 retains class I molecules, whereas US2 and US11 mediate the cytosolic degradation of heavy chains by the proteosomes. In US6-transfected cells, however, intracellular transport of class I molecules is impaired because of defective peptide translocation by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP). Peptide transport is restored in HCMV mutants lacking US6. In contrast to the cytosolic herpes simplex virus protein ICP47, US6 interacts with TAP inside the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as shown by US6 derivatives lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and by the observation that US6 does not prevent peptides from binding to TAP. Thus, HCMV targets TAP for immune escape by a molecular mechanism different from that of herpes simplex virus.","5103":"The constitutive and cytokine-induced levels of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I expression are tightly controlled at the transcriptional level. In this study, it is shown that the cis-acting regulatory element site alpha of the MHC class I promoter is essential for the IFN gamma-induced transactivation of MHC class I gene expression through the ISRE. Moreover, it was discovered that the class II transactivator (CIITA), which is itself under the control of the IFN gamma induction pathway, strongly transactivates MHC class I gene expression and exerts its activity through site alpha. Therefore, site alpha is a crucial regulatory element, mediating the classic route of IFN gamma induction via the ISRE as well as a novel route of MHC class I transactivation involving CIITA.","5104":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient cell lines were used to demonstrate that the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) can induce surface expression of MHC class I molecules. CIITA induces the promoter of MHC class I heavy chain genes. The site alpha DNA element is the target for CIITA-induced transactivation of class I. In addition, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-induced MHC class I expression also requires an intact site alpha. The G3A cell line, which is defective in CIITA induction, does not induce MHC class I antigen and promoter in response to IFNgamma. Trans-dominant-negative forms of CIITA reduce class I MHC promoter function and surface antigen expression. Collectively, these data argue that CIITA has a role in class I MHC gene induction.","5105":"CTLA-4 is a costimulation receptor that binds to the same ligands, CD80 and CD86, as CD28 with high affinity and is transiently expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells. CTLA-4 delivers an inhibitory signal through association of a phosphotyrosine-containing motif in the cytoplasmic domain with Syp tyrosine phosphatase. We now demonstrate that CTLA-4 interacts with the mu2 subunit of the plasma membrane-associated adaptor complex, AP-2, through the same motif involved in the interaction with Syp, except that the interaction with mu2 requires unphosphorylated tyrosine. The interaction with mu2 likely induces rapid internalization of CTLA-4 from the cell surface. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation state of a single tyrosine residue determines whether CTLA-4 delivers a negative signal or is internalized.","5106":"Tip of herpesvirus saimiri associates with Lck and down-regulates Lck-mediated activation. We identified a novel cellular Tip-associated protein (Tap) by a yeast two-hybrid screen. Tap associated with Tip following transient expression in COS-1 cells and stable expression in human Jurkat-T cells. Expression of Tip and Tap in Jurkat-T cells induced dramatic cell aggregation. Aggregation was likely caused by the up-regulated surface expression of adhesion molecules including integrin alpha, L-selectin, ICAM-3, and H-CAM. Furthermore, NF-kappaB transcriptional factor of aggregated cells had approximately 40-fold higher activity than that of parental cells. Thus, Tap is likely to be an important cellular mediator of Tip function in T cell transformation by herpesvirus saimiri.","5107":"Prior studies in CD4-deficient mice established the capacity of T helper (Th) lineage cells to mature into Th1 cells. Unexpectedly, challenge of these mice with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a Th2-inducing stimulus, failed to result in the development of Th2 cells. Additional studies were performed using CD4+ or CD4-CD8- (double-negative) T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells reactive to LACK antigen of Leishmania major. Double-negative T cells were unable to develop into Th2 cells in vivo, and, unlike CD4+ T cells, could not be primed for interleukin-4 production in vitro. Similarly, CD4+ TCR transgenic T cells primed on antigen-presenting cells expressing mutant MHC class II molecules unable to bind CD4 did not differentiate into Th2 cells. These data suggest that interactions between the TCR, MHC II-peptide complex and CD4 may be involved in Th2 development.","5108":"Resistance or susceptibility of inbred mouse strains to the parasite Leishmania major correlates with CD4+ T cell responses of the Th1 or Th2 subsets, respectively. To evaluate the genetic basis for this difference, resistant B10.D2 mice were backcrossed onto susceptible BALB\/c mice for five generations with selection for resistance. Candidate resistance loci were identified by high frequency of heterozygosity in resistant N5 backcross mice. Loci on chromosomes 6, 7, 10, 11, 15, and 16 were associated with resistance, demonstrating the multigenic nature of this phenotype. The presence of all six loci was not necessary to confer resistance and no single locus was required. Rather, a variety of combinations of these loci may be capable of interacting to confer resistance.","5109":"BALB\/c mice develop aberrant T helper 2 (Th2) responses and suffer progressive disease after infection with Leishmania major. These outcomes depend on the production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) early after infection. Here we demonstrate that the burst of IL-4 mRNA, peaking in draining lymph nodes of BALB\/c mice 16 hr after infection, occurs within CD4+ T cells that express V beta 4 V alpha 8 T cell receptors. In contrast to control and V beta 6-deficient BALB\/c mice, V beta 4-deficient BALB\/c mice were resistant to infection, demonstrating the role of these cells in Th2 development. The early IL-4 response was absent in these mice, and T helper 1 responses occurred following infection. Recombinant LACK antigen from L. major induced comparable IL-4 production in V beta 4 V alpha 8 CD4+ cells. Thus, the IL-4 required for Th2 development and susceptibility to L. major is produced by a restricted population of V beta 4 V alpha 8 CD4+ T cells after cognate interaction with a single antigen from this complex organism.","5110":"p35 and p37 are Borrelia burgdorferi genes encoding 35 and 37 kDa proteins. The gene products were identified by differential screening of a B. burgdorferi expression library with sera from B. burgdorferi infected- and B. burgdorferi-hyperimmunized mice. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that these genes were selectively expressed in vivo. ELISA, using P35 and P37, showed that infected mice (5 of 5, 100%) and patients (31 of 43, 72%) with Lyme borreliosis developed P35 or P37 antibodies. Mice developed peak IgG titers to P35 and P37 within 30 days, followed by decline. Mice given both P35 and P37 antisera were protected from challenge with 10(2) B. burgdorferi, and P35 and P37 antisera also afforded protection when administered 24 hr after spirochete challenge. The use of in vivo-expressed antigens such as P35 and P37 represents a new approach for Lyme disease serodiagnosis and for understanding the role of B. burgdorferi-specific immune responses in host immunity.","5111":"Peptide-specific down-regulation of T cell responses may represent a powerful tool to intervene in autoimmune diseases or graft rejections. It is therefore important to know whether peptide treatment tolerizes both naive and antigen-experienced memory T lymphocytes. Here we show that a major histocompatibility complex class I binding peptide, derived from the glycoprotein (GP33 peptide) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), specifically tolerized naive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) when administered three times intraperitoneally in incomplete Freund's adjuvants. However, in the presence of GP33-specific memory CTL in LCMV-primed mice, the same treatment had a general immunosuppressive effect on unrelated third-party antigen-specific T cell responses and caused severe immunopathological damage to the spleen.","5112":"","5113":"","5114":"Lymphotoxin alpha (LT alpha)-deficient mice revealed critical roles for LT alpha in lymphoid organogenesis, but it is not clear whether LT alpha functions through an LT alpha homotrimer (LT alpha3) or LT alpha\/beta heterotrimers. We generated LTbeta-deficient mice and found them to lack Peyer's patches, peripheral lymph nodes, splenic germinal centers, and follicular dendritic cells. Unlike LT alpha-deficient mice, LT beta-deficient mice had cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes. Furthermore, the mesenteric lymph nodes had germinal center-like regions, although these structures appeared to lack follicular dendritic cells. The absence of cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes in LT alpha-deficient mice, and yet their presence in LT beta-deficient mice and in mice deficient in tumor necrosis factor receptor types I and II, suggest that LT alpha3 may signal via an as yet unidentified receptor.","5115":"Chromosomal translocations of bcl-3 are associated with chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemias. Previously, we have shown that Bcl-3, a distinct member of the I kappa B family, may function as a positive regulator of NF-kappa B activity, although its physiologic roles remained unknown. To uncover these roles, we generated Bcl-3-deficient mice. Mutant mice, but not their littermate controls, succumb to T. gondii owing to failure to mount a protective T helper 1 immune response. Bcl-3-deficient mice are also impaired in germinal center reactions and T-dependent antibody responses to influenza virus. The results reveal critical roles for Bcl-3 in antigen-specific priming of T and B cells. Altered microarchitecture of secondary lymphoid organs in mutant mice, including partial loss of B cells, may underlie the immunologic defects. The implied role of Bcl-3 in maintaining B cells in wild-type mice may related to its oncogenic potential.","5116":"Murine CD1 has been implicated in the development and function of an unusual subset of T cells, termed natural T (NT) cells, that coexpress the T cell receptor (TCR) and the natural killer cell receptor NK1.1. Activated NT cells promptly produce large amounts of IL-4, suggesting that these cells can influence the differentiation of CD4+ effector T cell subsets. We have generated mice that carry a mutant CD1d1 gene. NT cell numbers in the thymus, spleen, and liver of these mice were dramatically reduced. Activated splenocytes from mutant mice did not produce IL-4, whereas similarly treated wild-type splenocytes secreted large amounts of this cytokine. These results demonstrate a critical role for CD1 in the positive selection and function of NT cells.","5117":"The MHC class lb molecule, CD1, has been conserved throughout mammalian evolution. To assess the function of CD1 in lymphocyte development, we generated mice with targeted disruption of the CD1.1 and CD1.2 genes. CD1-deficient mice have normal numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but marked reduction in NK1.1-bearing T cells, particularly those with a canonical gene rearrangement of V alpha14-J alpha281. CD1-deficient mice are unable to generate a rapid IL-4 response following systemic T cell activation but can generate effective antigen-specific Th2 responses. Thus, CD1 is required for the development of a specialized subset of T lymphocytes with a monomorphic antigen receptor. The rapid effector cytokine secretion of these T cells suggests that CD1 educates adaptive immune cells to subserve functions of innate immunity.","5118":"We previously identified a putative signal transducing adaptor molecule, named STAM, that contains an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). In this report, we demonstrate the functional significance of STAM in cytokine-mediated signal transduction. STAM is associated with Jak3 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases via its ITAM region and phosphorylated by Jak3 and Jak2 upon stimulation with IL-2 and GM-CSF, respectively. An SH3 deletion mutant of STAM confers a dominant-negative effect on DNA synthesis mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. Furthermore, the wild-type STAM, but not STAM mutants deleted of SH3 and ITAM, significantly enhances c-myc induction mediated by IL-2 and GM-CSF. These results strongly implicate STAM in the signaling pathways for cell growth and c-myc induction immediately downstream of the Jaks associated with the cytokine receptors.","5119":"Transcription factor PU.1 is required for the development of lymphoid and myeloid progenitors during fetal hematopoiesis. By generating chimeric animals using PU.1-\/- ES cells or PU.1(-\/-) hematopoietic progenitors, we demonstrate that PU.1 functions in an exclusively cell-autonomous manner to regulate the development of the lymphoid-myeloid system. Multipotential lymphoid-myeloid progenitors (AA4.1+, Lin-) are significantly reduced in PU.1(-\/-) embryos and fail to differentiate into B lymphoid or myeloid cells in vitro. These results suggest that the lymphoid and myeloid lineages develop in the fetal liver from a common hematopoietic progenitor not shared with erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. Finally, the Ikaros gene is expressed in PU.1 mutant embryos, suggesting that PU.1 and Ikaros are independently required for specification of embryonic lymphoid cell fates.","5120":"The ability of BCR cross-linking to stimulate receptor editing was analyzed in vitro using bone marrow B cells from immunoglobulin (Ig) transgenic (Tg) and non-Tg mice. In cultured Ig-Tg cells, BCR ligation induced receptor editing as measured by up-regulation of RAG gene expression, light chain gene DNA rearrangements, and expression of lambda-light chain protein in cells that previously expressed kappa. In the culture conditions used, BCR ligation induced light chain rearrangements in most immature IgM+IgD- bone marrow B cells in the absence of significant cell death or cell growth. Receptor editing in non-Tg B cells was also documented in cultures treated with anti-immunoglobulin. These results provide direct evidence for the ability of BCR ligation to stimulate immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangements in immature B cells.","5121":"It is not known how immunogenic versus tolerogenic cellular responses are signaled by receptors such as the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Here we compare BCR signaling in naive cells that respond positively to foreign antigen and self-tolerant cells that respond negatively to self-antigen. In naive cells, foreign antigen triggered a large biphasic calcium response and activated nuclear signals through NF-AT, NF-kappa B, JNK, and ERK\/pp90rsk. In tolerant B cells, self-antigen stimulated low calcium oscillations and activated NF-AT and ERK\/pp90rsk but not NF-kappa B or JNK. Self-reactive B cells lacking the phosphatase CD45 did not exhibit calcium oscillations or ERK\/pp90rsk activation, nor did they repond negatively to self-antigen. These data reveal striking biochemical differences in BCR signaling to the nucleus during positive selection by foreign antigens and negative selection by self-antigens.","5122":"Studies of T cell anergy in vitro have led to the widely accepted view that anergy is induced by T cell antigen recognition without costimulation. We show that the induction of T cell anergy in vivo is due to an abortive T cell response that requires recognition of B7 molecules, since blocking B7 maintains T cells in an unactivated but functionally competent state. Furthermore, the induction of anergy is prevented by blocking CTLA-4, the inhibitory T cell receptor for B7 molecules. Thus, in vivo T cell anergy may be induced not because of a lack of costimulation, but as a result of specific recognition of B7 molecules by CTLA-4. In contrast, blocking CD28 on T cells prevents priming but not the induction of tolerance. Therefore, the outcome of antigen recognition by T cells is determined by the interaction of CD28 or CTLA-4 on the T cells with B7 molecules.","5123":"The central event in thymic selection of T cells bearing alpha beta TCRs is their interaction with self-peptides bound to self-MHC molecules. With the use of transgenic mouse lines expressing a single peptide\/MHC class II complex, we show that CD4+ T cells with the preferential usage of particular TCR V(alpha)s and V(beta)s were selected to mature on this complex in lines with the lower expression, whereas such CD4+ T cells were eliminated in the thymus in a line with the relatively high expression. When a low expressing line was crossed with a high expressing line, the frequency of CD4+ T cells selected by this complex markedly decreased. Thus, these results suggest that a single peptide\/MHC class II complex, being affected by its cell surface density in the thymus, can serve as both positively and negatively selecting ligand in vivo.","5124":"In the thymus, positive and negative selection shape the T cell repertoire. It has previously been shown that positive selection, like negative selection, is the result of the interaction of the TCR with self-peptides bound to MHC. However, little is known about the number or nature of the self-peptide ligands that mediate positive selection in vivo. We devised a novel assay with enhanced sensitivity for low affinity TCR ligands to identify self-peptides that may be biologically relevant. At least eight K(b)-bound self-peptides were detected by this assay using thymocytes bearing the OT-I TCR (specific for OVAp\/K(b)). The sequence of one of these peptides was determined using the recently developed technique of membrane preconcentration-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry. This peptide, CP alpha1, has limited sequence similarity to OVAp, yet was found to induce positive selection of OT-I thymocytes in fetal thymic organ culture.","5125":"CD40 is a receptor that is critical for the survival, growth, differentiation, and isotype switching of B lymphocytes. Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events. We show that engagement of CD40 induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jak3 as well as of STAT3. Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40. Deletion of this sequence abolishes the capacity of CD40 to induce expression of CD23, ICAM-1, and lymphotoxin-alpha genes in B cells. These results indicate that signaling through Jak3 is activated by CD40 and plays an important role in CD40-mediated functions.","5126":"","5127":"","5128":"The embryonic thymic microenvironment provides the necessary elements for T cell lineage commitment, but the precise role of individual stromal cell components remains to be determined. Here we address the question of which stromal cell types are required for initiation of V-DJ rearrangements of the TCR-beta and TCR-delta locus in CD117+CD45+ uncommitted fetal liver progenitors. We show that fetal thymic stroma alone is necessary and sufficient for induction of TCR-beta and TCR-delta rearrangements. Furthermore, the ability to induce this T cell commitment step is confined to a subset of MHC class II-positive epithelial cells. Thymic stroma derived from mice with a targeted deletion in the IL-7 gene, however, lacks this ability. These findings set the stage for a further definition of the nature of the thymic stromal cell support in the regulation of T cell commitment.","5129":"The protection of cells expressing class I HLA molecules from NK lysis is mediated by natural killer cell inhibitory receptors (NKIR). Using site-directed mutagenesis, residues on HLA-C that determine the locus specificity (alphaVal-76), allotype group specificity (a dimorphism alphaAsn-80\/Lys-80), and affinity of NKIR binding (a second pair of dimorphisms, alphaAla-73, Asp-90 or alphaThr-73, Ala-90) have been identified. Thus the \"footprint\" of the NKIR on the alpha1 helix of the class I MHC molecule HLA-C and its associated beta strands are similar in position to the site occupied by superantigens on and behind the alpha1 helix of the class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1, but further toward its C-terminus. The intermediate affinity binding of NKIR to HLA-C, determined by alpha73 and alpha90, has an essential role in preventing cross-reactivity and ensuring the availability of NK cells for immunosurveillance; low affinity and high affinity mutants are both physiologically impaired.","5130":"Transgenic mice were generated to explore the effects on lymphoid development and immune function of constitutive expression of murine B7.2 on B and T cells. The number of B lymphocytes in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues is normal in B7.2 transgenic lines expressing low levels of B7.2 on B cells, but markedly reduced in transgenic lines expressing moderate to high levels of the transgene on B cells. This reduction is not due to an intrinsic abnormality of the transgenic B cells, but is rather the consequence of an elimination by an immune mechanism requiring the engagement of CD28 on T cells. Interestingly, during cognate antigen-specific interaction with T cells in vivo, B7.2 transgenic B cells are not eliminated, but proliferate and differentiate normally. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of high affinity ligand for the TCR, the CD28-B7.2 system participates in the regulation of B cell homeostasis.","5131":"IL-6-\/- mice showed impaired leukocyte accumulation in subcutaneous air pouches. Defective leukocyte accumulation was not due to a reduced migratory capacity of IL-6-\/- leukocytes and was associated with a reduced in situ production of chemokines. These observations led to a reexamination of the interaction of IL-6 with endothelial cells (EC). EC express only the gp130 signal transducing chain and not the subunit-specific IL-6R and are therefore unresponsive to IL-6. However, EC are responsive to a combination of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R as measured by the activation of STAT3, chemokine expression, and augmentation of ICAM-1. Activation by IL-6-IL-6R complexes was inhibited by an IL-6 receptor antagonist and potentiated by a superagonist. Hence, in vivo and in vitro evidence supports the concept that the IL-6 system plays an unexpected positive role in local inflammatory reactions by amplifying leukocyte recruitment.","5132":"Humoral immune responses were characterized in mouse strains lacking either or both B7 molecules. Mice deficient in both B7-1 and B7-2 failed to generate antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2a responses and lacked germinal centers when immunized by a number of routes and even in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant. These results demonstrate that B7-mediated signaling plays a critical role in germinal center formation and immunoglobulin class switching in vivo. Mice lacking only B7-1 or B7-2 mounted high-titer antigen-specific IgG responses when immunized in complete Freund's adjuvant, indicating that B7-1 and B7-2 can have overlapping, compensatory functions for IgG responses. When immunized intravenously without adjuvant, B7-2-deficient mice failed to switch antibody isotypes or form germinal centers, whereas B7-1-deficient mice gave antibody responses comparable with wild-type mice. Thus, B7-2 has an important role in initiating antibody responses in the absence of adjuvant, but the induction of B7-1 by adjuvant in B7-2-deficient mice can compensate for the absence of B7-2.","5133":"HLA-DM (DM) is a nonclassical MHC class II molecule that interacts with classical MHC II molecules in acidic compartments. During this association DM is supposed to catalyze the release of invariant chain (Ii)-derived CLIP peptides, as well as other peptides bound with low kinetic stability. Here we provide evidence that in lysosomal compartments of B cells a considerable fraction of DM is stably associated with empty DR alphabeta dimers, thereby preventing their functional inactivation and aggregation. Upon encounter with cognate peptide, the DM-associated DR molecules can be rapidly loaded and no longer bind to DM. Thus, DM seems to act as a dedicated class II-specific chaperone. In view of the suggested shortage of DM-resistant self-peptides in the loading compartment, empty class II molecules that are chaperoned by DM may enable the antigen-processing system to respond promptly to the challenge by newly entering antigens.","5134":"The Nef protein of human and primate lentiviruses is a key factor in HIV\/SIV pathogenesis. Here we report that Nef associates with two different kinases, forming a multiprotein complex at the far N-terminus of the viral protein. One of the kinases was identified as Lck, whereas the second protein was found to be a serine kinase that phosphorylated Nef and Lck in vitro and could be discriminated from the serine kinase identified previously. The Nef-associated kinase complex (NAKC) was demonstrated in COS cells, in HIV-infected cells, and in vitro using recombinant Lck and Nef proteins. Deletion of a short amphipathic alpha-helix in the N-terminus, which was found to be conserved in all Nef proteins, inhibited association of the NAKC and significantly reduced virion infectivity.","5135":"A peptide recognized by two cytotoxic T cell clones specific for the human minor histocompatibility antigen H-Y and restricted by HLA-A*0201 was identified. This peptide originates from SMCY, as do two other H-Y epitopes, supporting the importance of this protein as a major source of H-Y determinants in mice and humans. In naturally processed peptides, T cells only recognize posttranslationally altered forms of this peptide that have undergone modification of a cysteine residue in the seventh position. One of these modifications involves attachment of a second cysteine residue via a disulfide bond. This modification has profound effects on T cell recognition and also occurs in other class I MHC-associated peptides, supporting its general importance as an immunological determinant.","5136":"Growth factors have been implicated in thymocyte development, but mutants lacking cytokines, or their receptors, have failed to reveal essential roles for growth\/differentiation factors in the thymus. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma c) reduce cellularity, but are permissive for thymocyte development. We now report that thymocyte development is completely abrogated in mice lacking both c-kit and gamma c (c-kit-gamma c-). Thymic hypocellularity is so severe that the T cell receptor repertoire fails to form except for monoclonal or oligoclonal beta chain DJ rearrangements. B lymphopoiesis is only mildly reduced in c-kit-gamma c- as compared with c-kit+gamma c- mice, and hematological values are identical comparing c-kit-deficient and c-kit-gamma c- mice. These experiments reveal essential, overlapping, and synergistic functions for two distinct signaling pathways, one utilizing c-kit and the other cytokine receptor gamma c complexes coupling to Janus kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription.","5137":"We examined the role of E-cadherin expressed by thymic epithelial cells and immature thymocytes in thymus organogenesis and thymocyte development. ECCD-1 MAb, which blocks homotypic E-cadherin interactions, inhibited epithelial organization and thymocyte development in reaggregate fetal thymic organ cultures. It also interfered with the differentiation of fetal liver cells or fetal thymocytes within deoxyguanosine-treated thymic lobes, but did not affect thymocyte development in intact cultured fetal thymic lobes. In contrast, antibodies that selectively inhibit interactions between E-cadherin and alpha(E)beta7 integrins did not perturb thymic epithelial organization or thymocyte development, suggesting that homotypic E-cadherin interactions play an important role in thymus development and function.","5138":"Differentiation of immature double positive (DP) CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes into single positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is referred to as positive selection and requires physical contact with thymic cortical epithelium. We now have identified \"coinducer\" molecules on DP thymocytes that, together with TCR, signal DP thymocytes to differentiate into SP T cells in vitro in the absence of thymic epithelium. A remarkable number of different molecules on DP thymocytes possessed \"coinducing\" activity, including CD2, CD5, CD24, CD28, CD49d, CD81, and TSA-1. Interestingly, in vitro differentiation occurred in the absence of lineage-specific signals, yet resulted in the selective generation of CD4+CD8- T cells. Thus, the present study has identified surface molecules that can signal DP thymocytes to differentiate into SP T cells in the absence of thymic epithelium and has characterized a default pathway for CD4+ T cell differentiation.","5139":"Clinical deterioration in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with increased levels of viral replication and burden in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs. T cell activation and ensuing cellular gene activation can be critical for HIV-1 replication. The hypothesis that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) may influence HIV-1 replication is therefore compelling given the tight correlation of HIV-1 transcriptional induction to T cell activation. We report that certain NF-AT(Rel) family members productively bind the kappaB regulatory elements, synergize with NF-kappaB and Tat in transcriptional activation of HIV-1, and enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. These results link regulatory factors critical to T cell commitment directly to HIV-1 replication.","5140":"Mice whose IgH alleles are engineered to encode two distinct antibody heavy (H) chains generate a normal-sized B cell compartment in which most cells stably express the two heavy chains. This demonstrates that \"toxicity\" of bi-allelic H chain expression and cell-autonomous mechanisms of silencing in-frame IgH gene rearrangements do not significantly contribute to allelic exclusion at the IgH locus. Notwithstanding, the stability of the various engineered IgH loci during B cell development in the bone marrow differed substantially from each other.","5141":"","5142":"Activation of ICE\/Ced-3 family proteases (caspases) has been proposed to mediate both the granule exocytosis and Fas-Fas ligand pathways of rapid target cell death by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In agreement with this model, two peptide fluoromethyl ketone caspase inhibitors and baculovirus p35 blocked apoptotic nuclear damage and target cell lysis by the CTL-mediated Fas-Fas ligand pathway. The peptide caspase inhibitors also blocked drug-induced apoptotic cell death in tumor cells. In contrast, the caspase inhibitors blocked CTL granule exocytosis-induced target apoptotic nuclear damage, but did not inhibit target lysis. These results are consistent with recent demonstrations that granzyme B can activate caspases leading to apoptotic nuclear damage, but show that target cell lysis by CTL granule exocytosis occurs by a caspase-independent pathway.","5143":"Melanoma lines MEL.A and MEL.B were derived from metastases removed from patient LB33 in 1988 and 1993, respectively. The MEL.A cells express several antigens recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) on HLA class I molecules. The MEL.B cells have lost expression of all class I molecules except for HLA-A24. By stimulating autologous lymphocytes with MEL.B, we obtained an HLA-A24-restricted CTL clone that lysed these cells. A novel gene, PRAME, encodes the antigen. It is expressed in a large proportion of tumors and also in some normal tissues, albeit at a lower level. Surprisingly, the CTL failed to lyse MEL.A, even though these cells expressed the gene PRAME. The CTL expresses an NK inhibitory receptor that inhibits its lytic activity upon interaction with HLA-Cw7 molecules, which are present on MEL.A cells and not on MEL.B. Such CTL, active against tumor cells showing partial HLA loss, may constitute an intermediate line of anti-tumor defense between the CTL, which recognize highly specific tumor antigens, and the NK cells, which recognize HLA loss variants.","5144":"We have characterized the CD1b-mediated presentation pathway for the mycobacterial lipoglycan lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in monocyte-derived antigen-presenting cells. The macrophage mannose receptor (MR) was responsible for uptake of LAM. Antagonism of MR function inhibited both the internalization of LAM and the presentation of this antigen to LAM-reactive T cells. Intracellular MRs were most abundant in early endosomes, but they also were located in the compartment for MHC class II antigen loading (MIIC). Internalized LAM was transported to late endosomes, lysosomes, and MIICs. MRs colocalized with CD1b molecules, suggesting that the MR could deliver LAM to late endosomes for loading onto CD1b. LAM and CD1b colocalized in organelles that may be sites of lipoglycan antigen loading. This pathway links recognition of microbial antigens by a receptor of the innate immune system to the induction of adaptive T cell responses.","5145":"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a cytokine that is expressed primarily in activated T cells. Here we identified an inducible T cell-specific enhancer 14 kb upstream of the IL-3 gene that responded to activation of T cell receptor signaling pathways. The IL-3 enhancer spanned an inducible cyclosporin A-sensitive DNase I-hypersensitive site found only in T cells. Four NFAT-like elements exist within the enhancer. The two most active NFAT-like elements were located at the center of the DNase I-hypersensitive site. One of these NFAT-like elements encompassed overlapping Oct- and NFATp\/c-binding sites, which functioned in a highly synergistic manner. We suggest that the T cell-specific expression of the IL-3 gene is partly controlled through the enhancer by cooperation between Oct and NFAT family proteins.","5146":"The possible clinical use of the methyl xanthine derivative, pentoxifylline (PF), for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases is being noted with increasing interest. In this paper, we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation. We found that in T cells, anti-CD3-induced c-Rel expression was blocked by PF, whereas the induction of other NF-kappaB family members was not significantly affected. However, induction of NF-AT, which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction, was not inhibited by PF. Among genes that respond to these transcription factors, IL-2 mRNA induction was suppressed by PF, whereas IL-2R(alpha) chain mRNA induction was not affected. These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL-2 promoter factor, for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments. In contrast with the observation in T cells, c-Rel induction was not blocked by PF in B cells. The greater selectivity of PF, compared with FK506, at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo.","5147":"T cell activation stimulates p56(lck), p59(fyn), ZAP-70, Vav-SLP-76 binding, and IL-2 transcription. Major questions concern the tyrosine-kinase and relevant site(s) needed for Vav-SLP-76 complex formation and its role in IL-2 production. Here, we show that of the three kinases, only ZAP-70 phosphorylates SLP-76 at specific sites that allow Vav SH2 domain binding. Therefore, while p56(lck) regulates proximal events, ZAP-70 acts downstream on targets such as SLP-76. We also show by in vitro and in vivo analysis that two SLP-76 pYESP motifs (Y113 and Y128) mediate binding, the first being more efficient. A third pYEPP motif (Y145) failed to bind. Finally, TCR zeta CD3 ligation of T cell hybridoma DC27.10 induces IL-2 production without detectable Vav-SLP-76 binding. Therefore, despite effects of Vav-SLP-76 on IL-2 expression, Vav-SLP-76 binding per se is not essential for IL-2 production in all T cells.","5148":"The E2A gene products, E12 and E47, are required for proper B cell development. Mice lacking the E2A gene products generate only a very small number of B220+ cells, which lack immunoglobulin DJ(H) rearrangements. We have now generated mice expressing either E12 or E47. B cell development in mice expressing E12 but lacking E47 is perturbed at the pro-B cell stage, and these mice lack IgM+B220+ B cells in both bone marrow and spleen. IgM+B220+ B cells can be detected, albeit at significantly reduced levels, in the bone marrow and spleen of mice lacking E12. Ectopic expression of both E12 and E47 in a null mutant background shows that E12 and E47 act in concert to promote B lineage development. Taken together, the data indicate that both E12 and E47 allow commitment to the B cell lineage and act synergistically to promote B lymphocyte maturation.","5149":"The immunoglobulin kappa light chain locus has two enhancer elements: the intronic enhancer, which lies between the Jkappa cluster and the Ckappa exon, and the 3'kappa enhancer, which is located downstream of Ckappa. To address the contribution of these elements to the developmentally regulated activation of germline kappa locus transcription and rearrangement, we purified primary pro- and pre-B cells and determined by in vivo footprinting the sites within each enhancer that were occupied. We found that the kappa intronic enhancer NF-kappaB site is occupied in both pro- and pre-B cells, while CRE, BSAP, and PU.1\/pip sites within the 3'kappa enhancer undergo changes in occupancy as cells progress from the pro-B to the pre-B cell stage. These findings suggest that regulation of the kappa locus in primary pre-B cells may be mediated by factors that bind the 3'kappa enhancer.","5150":"The complement protein C1q, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) are structurally similar molecules that enhance phagocytic function in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies R3 and R139, which inhibit the enhancement triggered by these three ligands, were used to purify a 126,000 M(r) cell surface protein designated C1qR(P). Amino acid sequence was obtained and the corresponding cDNA was cloned. C1qR(P) is a novel type I membrane protein with the following putative structural elements: a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain, five EGF-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. All peptides identified by amino acid sequencing are encoded by the cDNA. Additionally, an anti-peptide antiserum was generated, which is reactive with C1qR(P). The data indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes the receptor that plays a role in C1q\/MBL\/SPA-mediated removal or destruction of pathogens and immune complexes by phagocytosis.","5151":"","5152":"We have generated site-directed transgenic mice whose transgenes code for anti-DNA antibodies. These antibodies are representative of the lupus-associated anti-DNAs seen in mouse models of autoimmunity and human SLE, and have the usual characteristics of pathogenic autoantibodies. As conventional transgenics in nonautoimmune mice, anti-DNA B cells have been shown to be deleted or inactivated. Autoreactive B cells can also escape negative regulation by a process called receptor editing. Here we describe two combined immunoglobulin H and L chain site-directed transgenic mouse models and characterize their editing phenotypes. One model, 3H9R\/Vkappa4R, has a deletion-prone phenotype and undergoes editing, primarily by inactivation of the light chain by leap-frogging events. In the other model, 3H9R\/Vkappa8R, B cells are susceptible to anergy and maintain most of their HR and LR chains. These studies clarify the relationship between editing and other mechanisms of tolerance.","5153":"Neonatal female mice injected with the self ZP3 peptide are not tolerant to the peptide; they develop autoimmune ovarian disease (AOD) and autoantibody response 5 weeks later. ZP3 challenge leads to severe AOD and ZP3-specific T cell and antibody responses. In contrast, neonatal tolerance to foreign ZP3 peptide is established in male mice: ZP3 peptide-specific T cell proliferative response is reduced and AOD is absent in ovarian grafts. Tolerance is associated with a Th2-dominant T cell cytokine and antibody isotype profiles. As controls, neonatal tolerance to foreign peptides, with Th2 deviation, was induced in both male and female mice. Endogenous ZP3 is important for the gender difference. Ablation of ovaries in female mice on days 2 and 5, but not on day 7 or 14, switches the ZP3 autoimmune response to a tolerogenic response with a concomitant change in cytokine profile. Thus, neonatal self ZP3 peptide, supported by endogenous ovaries within a neonatal time window, evokes a pathogenic autoimmune response.","5154":"A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, designated TRAMP, has been identified. The structural organization of the 393 amino acid long human TRAMP is most homologous to TNF receptor 1. TRAMP is abundantly expressed on thymocytes and lymphocytes. Its extracellular domain is composed of four cysteine-rich domains, and the cytoplasmic region contains a death domain known to signal apoptosis. Overexpression of TRAMP leads to two major responses, NF-kappaB activation and apoptosis. TRAMP-induced cell death is inhibited by an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, but not by Bcl-2. In addition, TRAMP does not appear to interact with any of the known apoptosis-inducing ligands of the TNF family.","5155":"The HIV Nef protein down-regulates the cell surface expression of CD4 and of MHC I at least in part through accelerated endocytosis. To investigate further the mechanism of this effect, we created chimeric integral membrane proteins comprising the extracellular and transmembrane regions of CD4 or CD8 and Nef as the cytoplasmic domain. These fusion molecules could down-modulate CD4 in trans in a dileucine-dependent manner. Furthermore, in spite of lacking receptor-derived internalization signals, the Nef-containing chimeras underwent both Golgi retention and rapid endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits. Taken together, these data suggest that Nef down-regulates CD4 and probably MHC I by physically connecting these receptors with sorting pathways in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane.","5156":"The principle by which mouse cytomegalovirus blocks antigen presentation in the MHC class I pathway was investigated. The responsible gene m152, encoding a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of 40 kDa, is a member of a gene family located in the right-hand terminal region of the 230 kb virus genome. Expression of m152 in murine and human cells arrested the export of mouse class I complexes from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment\/cis-Golgi compartment and inhibited lysis by cytotoxic T cells. The plasma membrane transport of human MHC class I molecules was not affected. The deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of gp40 did not lift its effect on class I molecule export, indicating that this protein differs in its functions from known immunosubversive viral gene products and represents a novel principle by which a herpesvirus shuts off MHC class I function.","5157":"Cell cycle arrest and cell death are tightly coupled to terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in vivo. This process was recapitulated in vitro by stimulation of IgG-bearing human B lymphoblastoid cells with interleukin-6 (IL-6), which led to orderly cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. In terminally differentiated plasmacytoid cells, phosphorylation of pRb was suppressed, correlating with the activation of the D-type cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p18(INK4c) and p21(WAF1\/CIP1). The expression of CDK6, however, remained unchanged. Activation of p18 by IL-6 was rapid, concomitant with marked enhancement of its association with CDK6 and cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of p18 in IgM-bearing lymphoblastoid cells, which differentiated in response to IL-6 but did not exit the cell cycle, reconstituted coupled differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Thus, CDK inhibitors, in particular p18, are likely to play a pivotal role in controlling cell cycle arrest and cell death in terminal differentiation of late-stage B cells to plasma cells via inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by CDK6.","5158":"Both the B cell-surface trigger(s) and the intracellular molecular mechanism(s) of somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region genes remain unknown, partly because of the lack of a simple and reproducible in vitro model. Here, we show that upon surface immunoglobulin cross-linking followed by co-culture with activated cloned T cells, the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL2 is induced to mutate its IgV(H) gene. Repeated activation of BL2 cells increased the frequency of mutation. The in vitro-induced mutations, which do not affect the IgM constant region, are point mutations distributed over the entire V(H)DJ(H) gene segment and do not show evidence of antigen-driven selection.","5159":"To test for effects on B cell differentiation, we introduced immunoglobulin mu heavy chain (HC) and Bcl-2 transgenes, separately or together, into recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG-2)-deficient mice. Transgenic Bcl-2 expression led to increased numbers of RAG-deficient pro-B cells, but did not promote their further differentiation. Expression of the mu HC transgene promoted the differentiation of RAG-deficient pro-B cells into pre-B cells that also expressed certain differentiation markers characteristic of even more mature B cell stages. However, the extent of the mu HC-dependent differentiation effects was greatly enhanced by coexpression of the transgenic Bcl-2 gene, and a subset of pre-B cells from both HC and HC, Bcl-2-transgenic RAG-2-deficient animals expressed surface mu HCs that were functional as judged by cross-linking experiments. These experiments demonstrate that the pro-B to pre-B transition in vivo cannot be effected by the expression of Bcl-2 alone, and that nontransformed immature B-lineage cells are competent to receive signals through a surface mu complex.","5160":"HOXB3 mRNA levels are high in the earliest CD34+ lineage- bone marrow cells and low to undetectable in later CD34+\/CD34- cells. To gain some insight into the role this gene may play in hematopoiesis, HOXB3 was overexpressed in murine bone marrow cells using retroviral gene transfer. Thymi of HOXB3 marrow recipients were reduced in size compared with control transplant recipients, with a 24-fold decrease in the absolute number of CD4+ CD8+ cells and a 3-fold increase in the number of CD4- CD8- thymocytes that contained a high proportion of gammadelta TCR+ cells. B cell differentiation was also perturbed in these mice, as indicated by the virtual absence of transduced IL-7-responsive pre-B clonogenic progenitors. Recipients of HOXB3-transduced cells also had elevated numbers of mature granulocyte macrophage colony-forming cells in their bone marrow and spleen. Together these results suggest roles for HOXB3 in proliferation and differentiation processes of both early myeloid and lymphoid developmental pathways.","5161":"A series of products were amplified using a PCR strategy based on short minimally degenerate primers and R. eglanteria (clearnose skate) spleen cDNA as template. These products were used as probes to select corresponding cDNAs from a spleen cDNA library. The cDNA sequences exhibit significant identity with prototypic (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta T cell antigen receptor (TCR) genes. Characterization of cDNAs reveals extensive variable region diversity, putative diversity segments, and varying degrees of junctional diversification. This demonstrates expression of both alpha\/beta and gamma\/delta TCR genes at an early level of vertebrate phylogeny and indicates that the three major known classes of rearranging antigen receptors were present in the common ancestor of the present-day jawed vertebrates.","5162":"In mice selectively deficient in CD11b\/CD18, a beta 2 integrin, chemoattractant-induced leukocyte adhesion to microvascular endothelium in vivo was reduced. Paradoxically, thioglycollate-induced neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneal cavity was increased and was associated with a significant delay in apoptosis of extravasated cells. The extravasated cells had a near absence of neutrophil phagocytosis and a reduction in oxygen free radical generation, which may contribute to the observed defect in apoptosis. This is supported by our in vitro studies, in which phagocytosis of opsonized particles by human neutrophils rapidly induced apoptosis that could be blocked with CD11b\/ CD18 antibodies. Reactive oxygen species are the intracellular link in this process: phagocytosis-induced apoptosis was blocked both in neutrophils treated with the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenylene iodonium and in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which lack NADPH oxidase. Thus, CD11b\/CD18 plays a novel and unsuspected homeostatic role in inflammation by accelerating the programmed elimination of extravasated neutrophils.","5163":"During most clinically relevant infections with cytopathic viruses, neutralizing antibodies are generated early, i.e., within the first week of infection. As early as 4 days after immunization of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a cytopathic virus closely related to rabies virus, hybridomas could be isolated that secreted virus-neutralizing IgGs. Such antibodies were devoid of somatic mutations, showed high binding avidities (approximately 10(9) M-1), and used V gene fragments predominantly belonging to the VHQ52 and VK19-28 families. In contrast, most secondary and hyperimmune response IgGs isolated 12 and 150 days after infection used several additional V gene combinations. These, which used the VHQ52\/VK19-28 combination of early IgGs, were point mutated but showed only marginally enhanced binding avidities. Since all VHQ52\/ VK19-28-positive IgGs bound to one subsite within the major antigenic site of VSV-G irrespective of the presence or absence of somatic point mutations, fine specificity diversification of secondary and hyperimmune responses was achieved by newly appearing V gene combinations.","5164":"Recognition of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I complexes on target cells by killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR) blocks natural killer (NK) and T cell cytotoxic function. The inhibitory effect of KIR ligation requires the phosphotyrosine-dependent association of KIR with the cytoplasmic SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Using a somatic genetic model, we first define a requirement for the Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) Lck in mediating KIR tyrosine phosphorylation. We then investigate how KIR ligation interrupts PTK-dependent NK cell activation signals. Specifically, we show that KIR ligation inhibits the Fc receptor (FcR)-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR-associated zeta signaling chain, the PTK ZAP-70, and phospholipase C gamma. Overexpression of catalytically inactive SHP-1 (acting as a dominant negative) restores the tyrosine phosphorylation of these signaling events and reverses KIR-mediated inhibition of NK cell cytotoxic function. These results suggest sequential roles for Lck and SHP-1 in the inhibition of PTK following MHC recognition by NK cells.","5165":"A major mechanism maintaining immune tolerance is the deletion of potentially autoreactive thymocytes by apoptosis during development in the thymus. Previous reports suggest that apoptosis is induced by high avidity signals transduced via the T cell receptor; however, the role of signals transduced by other cell surface receptors during thymic selection remains poorly understood. Fas, a member of the TNF receptor family, has been shown to induce apoptosis in mature peripheral T cells; however, the effects of Fas on negative selection of thymocytes have not been previously detected. Using a sensitive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase method to detect apoptotic cells, we found that mutant Fas molecules in lpr mice decrease the sensitivity of thymocytes to T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis and that blockade of Fas-Fas ligand interactions in vivo can inhibit antigen-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in non-lpr mice. Thus, we have shown that Fas, in conjunction with antigen-specific signals, can modulate apoptosis during negative selection of thymocytes.","5166":"Both IL-2 and IL-4 bind to receptors containing the common gamma chain and JAK3. Although JAK3 is required for proper lymphoid development, the precise roles of this kinase in IL-2 and IL-4 signaling in lymphocytes have not been defined. Here, we have studied IL-2 and IL-4 signaling in B cell lines lacking JAK3. Although IL-2-induced phosphorylation of IL-2R beta, JAK1, and STAT5 all required the presence of JAK3, IL-4-mediated phosphorylation of JAK1, STAT6, and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 did not. However, IL-4-induced effects were clearly improved following JAK3 expression. These data indicate that IL-4 signaling occurs in the absence of of JAK3, but is comparatively inefficient. These findings may help in understanding the pathogenesis of the immunodeficiency that occurs with mutations of JAK3 and may suggest a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of IL-4.","5167":"Syk family kinases are essential for lymphocyte development and activation. Therefore the identification of their direct effectors is of critical importance. Here, we report that Syk interacts in the yeast two-hybrid system with Vav, a proto-oncogene product exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells. This interaction was direct, required the catalytic activity of Syk, the SH2 domain of Vav, and tyrosine residues in the linker domain of Syk. Vav also associated with Syk and Zap in antigen receptor-stimulated B or T cells, respectively. Functionally, Vav was phosphorylated by Syk family kinases both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Syk and Vav cooperated to activate NF-AT synergistically. These results indicate that the interaction between Syk family kinases and Vav plays an important role in coupling immune recognition receptors to signaling pathways involved in lymphokine production.","5168":"The proteins RAG-1 and RAG-2 are essential for initiation of V(D)J recombination. In dividing cells, RAG-2 accumulates during G1 and is undetectable during the S and G2\/M cell cycle phases. A conserved degradation signal, including an essential CDK phosphorylation site at Thr-490, regulates RAG-2 accumulation during cell division and links V(D)J recombination to the cell cycle. Mutations within this signal abolish periodic degradation of RAG-2 protein in dividing cells. In mice expressing endogenous or wild-type transgenic RAG-2, V(D)J recombination intermediates accumulate preferentially in G0\/G1 thymocytes; this restriction is relieved by mutation of Thr-490 to alanine (T490A). Thus, periodic destruction of RAG-2 protein couples V(D)J recombination to cell cycle phase. Using transgenic mice expressing the T490A RAG-2 mutant and a functional T cell receptor beta chain, we demonstrate that coupling of V(D)J recombination to the cell cycle is not essential for enforcement of allelic exclusion.","5169":"Multiple members of the NF-kappa B\/Rel protein family are induced during B cell differentiation and have been implicated in transcriptional activation of the immunoglobulin kappa (Ig kappa) locus. Despite these findings, normal numbers of Ig kappa + B lymphocytes are produced by mice bearing targeted mutations in individual NF-kappa B\/Rel genes. In the present study, precursor B lymphocytes were engineered to express a trans-dominant form of I kappa B alpha that simultaneously impairs the c-Rel and RelA transactivating subunits of NF-kappa B. This dual block in NF-kappa B\/Rel signaling led to potent inhibition of germline Ig kappa transcription and rearrangement, whereas recombinase activity was unaffected. These findings suggest that c-Rel and RelA serve compensatory functional roles in the developmental mechanisms that govern Ig kappa gene assembly.","5170":"B cell activation following antigen receptor cross-linking can be augmented in vitro by ligation of cell surface CD22, which associates with the SHP1 protein tyrosine phosphatase. The targeted deletion of CD22 in mice demonstrated that CD22 differentially regulates antigen receptor signaling in resting and antigen-stimulated B lymphocytes. B cells from CD22-deficient mice exhibited the cell surface phenotype and augmented intracellular calcium responses characteristic of chronically stimulated B cells, as occurs in SHP1-defective mice. Thus, CD22 negatively regulates antigen receptor signaling in the absence of antigen. However, activation of CD22-deficient B lymphocytes by prolonged IgM cross-linking resulted in modest B cell proliferation, demonstrating that CD22 positively regulates antigen receptor signaling in the presence of antigen.","5171":"Mice homozygous for an Ikaros null mutation display distinct defects in the development of fetal and adult lymphocytes. Fetal T lymphocytes, and fetal and adult B lymphocytes and their earliest progenitors are absent. Postnatally, hematopoietic stem cells give rise to thymocyte precursors that undergo aberrant differentiation into the CD4 lineage and clonal expansion. The lack of NK cells and some gamma delta T cell subsets and a large reduction in thymic dendritic APCs suggest that Ikaros is essential for establishing early branch points in the postnatal T cell pathway. The lymphoid defects detected in Ikaros null mice reveal critical molecular differences between fetal and postnatal hematopoietic progenitors that dictate their ability to give rise to T cells. These studies also establish Ikaros as a tumor suppressor gene acting during thymocyte differentiation. Phenotypic comparison of this null mutation with a severe dominant-negative Ikaros mutation identifies molecular redundancy in the postnatal hemolymphoid system.","5172":"We have identified a very early stage of B lineage cells in the CD45R (B220)+CD24 (HSA) pre-pro-B fraction of mouse bone marrow delineated by expression of AA4.1, a molecule found on stem cells and early B lineage cells. These cells are B lineage precursors based on their capacity to generate B lineage cells rapidly in stromal-dependent culture and their expression of high levels of germline IgH transcripts in the absence of Rag-1\/2. Half of these AA4.1+ precursors express low levels of CD4, characteristic of lymphoid progenitors, but few if any have up-regulated CD19, a molecule expressed very early in the B lineage. Furthermore, expression of genes encoding pre-B and B cell receptor components (mb-1, B29, and lambda 5) and transcription factors necessary for B lineage differentiation (BSAP, E12, E47, and Id) provide further support for designating these cells as the earliest B cell precursors.","5173":"At day 10 in mouse gestation, the intraembryonic aorta-gonads-mesonephros (AGM) region generates the first definitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the adult blood system. By 11 days postcoitum, the liver contains such HSCs. While HSCs of the adult bone marrow and late-stage fetal liver have been extensively characterized for cell surface markers, there has been no phenotypic description of the first HSCs during embryo development. We report here the temporal cell surface phenotype of HSCs from the AGM region and early fetal liver and show that all HSCs reside in the c-kit+ population. c-kit+ HSCs from AGM and liver are mainly CD34+ and in the AGM are in both Mac-1+ and Mac-1 fractions. These results demonstrate that during mouse ontogeny the first definitive HSCs are similar in cell surface phenotype to the HSCs of adult bone marrow but that spatial localization and developmental time are critical factors in the phenotypic assessment of this functional cell population.","5174":"","5175":"We have generated mice carrying a homozygous null mutation in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) gene. G-CSFR-deficient mice have decreased numbers of phenotypically normal circulating neutrophils. Hematopoietic progenitors are decreased in the bone marrow, and the expansion and terminal differentiation of these progenitors into granulocytes is impaired. Neutrophils isolated from G-CSFR-deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to apoptosis, suggesting that the G-CSFR may also regulate neutrophil survival. These data confirm a role for the G-CSFR as a major regulator of granulopoiesis in vivo and provide evidence that the G-CSFR may regulate granulopoiesis by several mechanisms. However, the data also suggest that G-CSFR-independent mechanisms of granulopoiesis must exist.","5176":"CD28 response elements (CD28REs) within cytokine promoters are variant NF-kappaB-binding sites and are essential for transcription in response to CD28 receptor activation in T cells. We show that the CK-1 element (CD28RE) within the GM-CSF promoter binds the RelA and c-Rel transcription factors in response to CD28 activation. We further show that the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y) can bind to the CD28REs of both GM-CSF and IL-2 and that this binding is critical for c-Rel, but not RelA, binding. A second NF-kappaB site in the GM-CSF promoter that binds p50 and RelA, but neither c-Rel nor HMG I(Y), failed to respond to CD28 activation. Expression of HMG I or c-Rel antisense RNA inhibited CD28 activation of the IL-2 and GM-CSF promoters, implying that HMG I(Y) enhancement of c-Rel binding plays an important role in the activity of the CD28REs.","5177":"CD4+ CD8+ TCRlo thymocytes are the precursors of CD4+ and CD8+ mature T cells, whose receptors show specific recognition of peptide-MHC class II and MHC class I complexes, respectively. How T cells emerge from the intrathymic differentiation process with selective expression of either CD8 molecule or CD4 molecule coordinated with the MHC class specificity of the TCR has been the subject of intense examination. Many previous studies of this question have been based on the assumption that extinction of CD4 or CD8 expression by the precursor thymocytes was a steady, uninterrupted process. Here we show that this is an incorrect assumption, with CD4 and CD8 expression undergoing an unexpectedly complex series of expression changes involving down-modulation, kinetically asymmetric up-regulation, and then selective loss. Based on these data, we propose a model for the differentiation pathway of alphabeta TCR thymocytes that explains previous, apparently contradictory findings and establishes useful parameters for future studies at the cellular and gene level.","5178":"gp130 is a common signal transducer for the interleukin-6-related cytokines. To delineate the gp130-mediated growth signal, we established a series of pro-B cell lines expressing chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130. The second tyrosine (from the membrane) of gp130, which was required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2, its association with GRB2, and activation of a MAP kinase, was essential for mitogenesis, but not for anti-apoptosis. On the other hand, the tyrosine in the YXXQ motifs essential for STAT3 activation was required for bcl-2 induction and anti-apoptosis. Furthermore, dominant-negative STAT3 inhibited anti-apoptosis. These data demonstrate that two distinct signals, mitogenesis and anti-apoptosis, are required for gp130-induced cell growth and that STAT3 is involved in anti-apoptosis.","5179":"Mutant alphabeta TCRs were generated by replacing domains of the alpha and beta chain constant regions with homologous domains from TCR delta and gamma chains, respectively. Chimeric TCRs in which the alpha chain contains TCR delta chain sequences within the connecting peptide domain are unresponsive to alloantigens and superantigens, and have defective interactions with the CD3\/zeta complex. Although these antigen-unresponsive TCRs undergo zeta chain phosphorylation upon stimulation with superantigen, they do not generate a full signal capable of producing IL-2. Mutant TCRs acquire signaling activity with a combination of superantigen and calcium ionophore, indicating a defect in calcium-mediated signaling. Finally, a conserved motif, FETDxNLN, present in the alpha chain connecting peptide domain, is disrupted in all signaling-defective TCRs. This conserved alpha chain connecting peptide motif might mediate the transfer of signals from the alphabeta heterodimer to the CD3\/zeta complex.","5180":"Two families of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), the Src and Syk\/ZAP-70 families, are required for T cell development. Lck is the major Src family member required for thymopoiesis, since there is a severe deficit of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and mature T cells in its absence. However, some peripheral T cells are evident in these mice, suggesting that additional PTKs may contribute to T cell development. Here we show that the combined disruption of Lck and Fyn (lck(-\/-)fyn(-\/-)) completely arrests alpha beta T cell development at the CD4-CD8- stage. The development of V gamma 3+ dendritic epidermal T cells is also severely impaired, but natural killer cell development and cytolytic activity is unaffected in lck(-\/-)fyn(-\/-) mice. These findings reveal the potential for redundant functions mediated by Src family PTKs while emphasizing crucial roles for Lck and Fyn in T cell development.","5181":"Lck, a Src family tyrosine kinase, transduces signals important for the development of alphabeta and gammadelta T cells. However, T cell development is only partially compromised in Lck-deficient mice, suggesting that other kinases may also transduce pre-TCR or TCR signals. One candidate is Fyn, a Src kinase coexpressed with Lck in immature and mature T cells. Here we show that T cell development is completely compromised in lck(-\/-)fyn(-\/-) mice. In addition, we demonstrate that expression of a gain-of-function mutant fyn(T) transgene completely restores production of immature CD4\/CD8 double positive thymocytes and gammadelta T cells and improves the representation of CD4 or CD8 single positive thymocytes. These observations reveal that Fyn can subserve some Lck-like functions in T cell development.","5182":"TRAF3 was found as a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 but is part of a family of proteins with common structure and activity. To clarify the physiological roles of TRAF3, we introduced a TRAF3 null mutation in mice through homologous recombination. TRAF3-deficient mice appear normal at birth but become progressively runted, correlating with progressive hypoglycemia and depletion of peripheral white cells. The mutant mice die by 10 days of age. Fetal liver cells from TRAF3-deficient embryos can reconstitute all hematopoietic lineages in lethally irradiated mice. However, these reconstituted mice are impaired in their immune responses to T-dependent antigen, and their T cells are functionally defective. These findings indicate that TRAF3 is required for postnatal development and for a competent immune system.","5183":"Migration of hematopoietic precursor cells to the thymus is shown to depend upon a novel molecule called Vanin-1 expressed by perivascular thymic stromal cells. An anti-Vanin-1 antibody blocks the binding of pro-T cells to thymic sections in vitro, the in vivo accumulation of bone marrow cells around cortical thymic vessels, and long-term thymic regeneration. Thus, it interferes with the entry, and not the differentiation, of hematopoietic precursor cells. The Vanin-1 gene codes for a GPI-anchored 70 kDa protein that shows homology only with human biotinidase. Transfection of thymic stromal cells with the Vanin-1 cDNA enhances thymocyte adhesion in vitro. These data suggest that Vanin-1 regulates late adhesion steps of thymus homing under physiological, noninflammatory conditions.","5184":"Antibody-antigen complexes are central to the inflammatory response and are implicated in the development of such diverse diseases as systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, immune glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. We recently demonstrated that experimental immune complex-mediated injury in mice, as modeled by the cutaneous Arthus reaction, requires receptors for the Fc portion of the antibody and is unaffected by deficiencies in complement components. However, the responsible cell type(s) and Fc receptor(s) were not known. We now demonstrate by differential reconstitution in vivo that Fc gamma RIII on mast cells is necessary for this inflammatory response. We propose a general model of antibody-mediated diseases as an immunopathologic spectrum whose specific manifestations are determined by the Fc receptor and cell type engaged.","5185":"Cytokine regulation of B cell development was analyzed using interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced transcription of the J chain gene as a model system. A nuclear target of the IL-2 signal was identified as the Pax5 transcription factor, BSAP, which recognizes a negative regulatory motif in the J chain promoter. Functional assays showed that BSAP mediates the silencing of the J chain gene during the early stages of B cell development, but repression is relieved during the antigen-driven stages in a concentration-dependent manner by an IL-2-induced down-regulation of BSAP RNA expression. At the low levels present in J chain-expressing plasma cells, BSAP repression could be overridden by positive-acting factors binding to down-stream J chain promoter elements. Overexpression of BSAP in these cells reversed the positive regulation and inhibited J chain gene transcription. Thus, IL-2 regulation of BSAP concentration may provide a mechanism for controlling both repressor and activator functions of BSAP during a B cell immune response.","5186":"The TAP1 and LMP2 genes are central for class I MHC function and share a common promoter. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of IFN gamma up-regulation of TAP1 and LMP2. In vivo footprinting indicates IFN gamma up-regulates protein-DNA contacts at an IRF-E that is essential for the up-regulation of TAP1 and LMP2 by IFN gamma. Gel shift analysis indicates that this site binds IRF-1. The expression of TAP1 and LMP2 are both greatly reduced in IRF-1-deficient mice. Surface class I MHC as well as CD8+ T cells are reduced in IRF-1-\/- mice. The role of IRF-1 in the regulation of TAP1 and LMP2 suggests a mechanism for the antiviral properties of IRF-1 and the unexpected deficiency of CD8+ T cells observed in IRF-1-\/- mice.","5187":"We have identified a Ser\/Thr kinase associated with the B cell receptor (BCR) complex as protein kinase C mu (PKC mu). PKC mu activity is up-regulated after cross-linking the BCR and CD19 on B cells, and PKC mu co-precipitates with Syk and phospholipase C-gamma 1\/2 (PLC gamma 1\/2). In vitro phosphorylation of fusion proteins showed that both Syk and PLC gamma 1 are potential substrates of PKC mu in vivo. Analysis of mutants of the chicken B cell line DT40 deficient in either Syk, Lyn, Btk, or PLC gamma 2 revealed that BCR-induced activation of PKC mu, like activation of PLC gamma 2, requires Syk and is partially regulated by Btk, but is Lyn independent. PKC mu can down-regulate the ability of Syk to phosphorylate PLC gamma 1 in vitro. Thus, PKC mu may function in a negative feedback loop regulating BCR-initiated signaling cascades.","5188":"In peripheral lymphoid tissues of TCR transgenic mice that express the nominal antigen (HY peptide plus H-2Db MHC) recognized by the transgenic TCR, there exist unusual CD4-CD8- and CD4-CD8low cells bearing the transgenic TCR. Here we show that, unlike TCR alpha beta T cells that are generated in the absence of nominal antigen, these unusual cells do not express endogenous TCR alpha genes, have maintained the TCR delta locus on both chromosomes, and can coexpress TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta chains on the cell surface. The latter is also true for CD4-CD8-, HSA+ TCR alpha beta + thymocytes in male and female TCR transgenic mice. The number of TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta coexpressing cells is increased in pre-TCR-deficient mice. The data indicate that the TCR alpha beta can replace the TCR gamma delta in the development of gamma delta lineage cells and that the pre-TCR interferes with the generation of gamma delta-expressing cells.","5189":"To address the role of the TEA germline transcription, which initiates upstream of the TCR-J alpha S, in the regulation of TCR-J alpha locus accessibility, we created a mouse in which this region has been removed by homologous recombination. Normal development of T alpha beta cells and the expression of other TCR alpha germline transcripts in TEA-\/- mice ruled out an exclusive role for TEA in the overall accessibility of the J alpha cluster. However, the rearrangement of the most 5' J alpha (J alpha 61 to J alpha 53) was severely impaired, indicating that TEA may control the DNA accessibility of a particular J alpha window. Moreover, the relative usage of every J alpha segment was affected. These results are consistent with TEA acting as a \"rearrangement-focusing\" element, targeting the primary waves of V alpha-J alpha recombination to the most 5' J alpha S in an ongoing TCR-J alpha rearrangement model.","5190":"We have investigated the capacity of precursor B cells from normal (BDF1) and V(D)J recombinase-deficient (RAG-27) or defective (SCID) mice to be induced by a CD40-specific monoclonal antibody and IL-4 to epsilon H chain gene transcription and to S mu-S epsilon switch recombination. In differentiating precursor B cells from all three strains of mice, the development of similar numbers of CD19+, CD23+, CD40+, and MHC class II+ expressing B lineage cells and similar levels of epsilon H chain gene transcription were induced. Efficient S mu-S epsilon switching occurred in normal and RAG-2-deficient, but not in SCID, precursor B cells. Thus, the transcription of the epsilon H chain is independent of the RAG-2 and the SCID gene product, while the S mu-S epsilon switch recombination requires the SCID gene-encoded DNA-dependent protein kinase, but not the RAG-2 protein.","5191":"NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is influenced by triggering as well as inhibitory signals. The identification of inhibitory signals provided by MHC class I molecules has recently attracted significant attention. Much less is known about putative triggering signals. Using purified populations of mouse NK cells, we demonstrate that the CD80 (B7-1) gene product functions as a triggering signal for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The strength of this response is such that it overrides the protection mediated by MHC class I molecules. Triggering of mouse NK cells by B7-1 occurred even in the absence of CD28 and could not be blocked by either anti-CD28 or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. NK cells may thus, at least in part, use receptors other than CD28 and CTLA-4 in their interaction with B7-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells are highly susceptible to lysis by autologous NK cells.","5192":"","5193":"","5194":"CD28 ligation delivers a costimulatory signal important in T cell activation. This study demonstrates that the disruption of the CD28\/B7 pathway early in the nonobese diabetic mouse strain, using CD28-\/- and CTLA41g transgenic mice, promoted the development and progression of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. Functional analyses of T cells isolated from CD28-deficient mice demonstrated that the GAD-specific T cells produced enhanced Th1-type cytokines (IL-2 and IFN gamma) and diminished Th2-type cytokine, IL-4. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in serum levels of anti-GAD antibodies of the IgG1 isotype consistent with a profound suppression of Th2-type responses in these animals. Thus, the early differentiation of naive diabetogenic T cells into the Th2 subset is dependent upon CD28 signaling and extends our understanding of the importance of Th1\/Th2 balance in the regulation of this spontaneous autoimmune disease.","5195":"In the immune system, apoptosis is involved in intrathymic elimination of self-reactive thymocytes and in peripheral T cell tolerance to exogenous antigens. Here, we describe the role in T cell apoptosis of P(2x1), a nonselective cation channel activated by ATP. P(2X1) molecules are up-regulated in thymocytes during dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, and antagonists to these receptors protect thymocytes from cell death. Moreover, P(2X1) mRNA and protein levels increase in thymocytes induced to die in vivo by the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. In contrast, T cells undergoing apoptosis in the periphery do not express P(2X1). The demonstration that P(2X1) ion channels play a role in the apoptosis of thymocytes but not peripheral T cells illustrates a novel mechanism contributing to thymocyte cell death and opens new possibilities for investigating clonal deletion in the thymus.","5196":"Development of the mucosal immune system was examined in mice with partial loss of expression of ICAM-1 or CD18. Profound effects on Peyer's patch (PP), lamina propria (LP), and intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) T cell populations were observed in mutant mice. Normal expression of CD18 integrins and ICAM-1 was essential for development of the CD8(alpha beta) TCR(alpha beta)LP and IEL compartment and for the generation of normal PP lymphocyte populations. The partial loss of CD8(alpha beta) IEL correlated with the loss of TCR(alpha beta) IEL-mediated lytic activity. The presence of a subset of Thy1+TCR(gamma delta)IEL was also dependent on CD18 integrins and ICAM-1. Both the lytic activity and the expression of CD11c by TCR(gamma delta)IEL were up-regulated in the presence of TCR(alpha beta) T cells. Analysis of bone marrow chimeras demonstrated that a bone marrow-derived ICAM-1+ accessory cell was involved in the generation of some TCR(alpha beta) IEL. These results demonstrated that ICAM-1 and beta2 integrins were required for establishment of a normal intestinal immune system.","5197":"C57BI\/6 mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) develop a chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Infectious virus can be isolated only from symptomatic mice. In C57BI\/6 mice, two CD8+ T cell epitopes within the MHV-JHM surface glycoprotein were previously identified. Here, we show that mutations in the RNA encoding the immunodominant of the epitopes are present in nearly all virus samples isolated from these mice. Mutations are not present in sequences flanking this epitope or in other CD8+ or CD4+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, analysis of five peptides corresponding to variant epitopes in direct ex vivo cytotoxicity assays showed that each mutation caused a loss of epitope recognition. These results suggest that escape from CD8+ T cell recognition is necessary for enhanced virus replication and development of clinical disease in these MHV-JHM-infected mice.","5198":"We generated mice harboring germline mutations in which the enhancer element located 9 kb 3' of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene (3'E kappa) was replaced either by a single loxP site (3'E kappa delta) or by a neomycin resistance gene (3'E kappa N). Mice homozygous for the 3'E(kappa delta) mutation had substantially reduced numbers of kappa-expressing B cells and increased numbers of lambda-expressing B cells accompanied by decreased kappa versus lambda gene rearrangement. In these mutant mice, kappa expression was reduced in resting B cells, but was normal in activated B cells. The homozygous 3'E(kappa)N mutation resulted in a similar but more pronounced phenotype. Both mutations acted in cis. These studies show that the 3'E(kappa) is critical for establishing the normal kappa\/lambda ratio, but is not absolutely essential for kappa gene rearrangement or, surprisingly, for normal kappa expression in activated B cells. These studies also imply the existence of additional regulatory elements that have overlapping function with the 3'E(kappa) element.","5199":"We generated surrogate light chain (SLC)-deficient mice carrying either a V(kappa)J(kappa)-C(kappa) transgene under the control of the kappa promoter and intron enhancer or a V(kappa)J(kappa) gene segment targeted into its physiological position. Efficient rescue of B cell development was seen in the former and partial rescue in the latter. This difference corresponded to a developmentally earlier onset of kappa chain expression from the conventional than from the targeted transgene. Thus, a kappa chain can substitute for SLC in development. However, mechanisms controlling gene expression in addition to gene rearrangements appear to restrict kappa chain expression largely to a cellular compartment into which mu chain-expressing B cell progenitors are selected with the help of the SLC.","5200":"We grafted fetal thymi from wild-type mice into immunodeficient RAG-2-\/- or class II-\/-RAG-2-\/- (class II MHC-) recipients and followed the fate of naive CD4+ T cells derived from the grafts. In both types of recipients, newly generated CD4+ T cells proliferated to the same extent in the periphery and rapidly filled the empty T cell compartment. However, CD4+ T cells in class II- recipients gradually decreased in number over 6 months. These results show that interactions between the TCR and class II molecules are not required for newly generated CD4+ T cells to survive and proliferate, but are necessary to maintain the size of the peripheral T cell pool for extended periods.","5201":"It has been proposed that the biological clock underlying the limited division potential of eukaryotic cells is telomere length. We assayed telomerase activity in single cells of the hematopoietic and immune systems. We examined hematopoietic stem cells at four stages of differentiation, lineage-committed progenitors, and mature myeloid and lymphoid cells. The frequency of telomerase-expressing cells within each population was proportional to the frequency of cells thought to have self-renewal potential. Among bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, 70% exhibited detectable telomerase activity. The telomerase-expressing somatic cells observed in this study are not thought to be immortal, and expression was not correlated with cell cycle distribution or differentiation state. This study demonstrates that the developmental characteristic most consistently associated with telomerase expression is self-renewal potential.","5202":"","5203":"","5204":"The family of receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) plays an essential role in antibody-mediated effector functions of the immune system. However, the specific contribution of each of the Fc gamma R classes to in vivo immune reactions is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that mice deficient for the ligand-binding alpha chain of Fc gamma RIII lack NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis of IgG1-coated particles by macrophages. Strikingly, these mice lack IgG-mediated mast cell degranulation, are resistant to IgG-dependent passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and exhibit an impaired Arthus reaction. These results indicate a prominent role for Fc gamma RIII in inflammatory and anaphylactic responses, making this receptor a potential target in immunotherapy.","5205":"We have measured the absolute numbers of EBV-infected B cells in the peripheral blood of healthy persistently infected individuals. Single measurements on a panel of 15 healthy individuals demonstrate that the frequency varies over a wide range from 1-50 per 10(6) B cells. Repeat measurements over 1-3.5 years on several individuals whose frequencies varied over a 10-fold range showed that the variation does not represent the fluctuation in the frequency that can occur within an individual; rather, the frequencies are specific to the individual. The frequency within an individual measured over time is stable and contributes less than 10% to the variance seen in the whole population. These measurements suggest that the level of EBV-infected B cells is tightly regulated and we propose that the same homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the levels of normal B cells also regulate B cells latently infected with EBV.","5206":"Whereas the human killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) for HLA class I are immunoglobulin-like monomeric type I glycoproteins, the murine Ly49 receptors for H-2 are type II homodimers of the C-type lectin superfamily. Here, we demonstrate that human NK cells also express C-type lectin receptors that influence recognition of polymorphic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C molecules. These receptors are heterodimers composed of CD94 chains covalently associated with novel tyrosine-phosphorylated glycoproteins (94AP). Some NK clones recognize a common HLA-C ligand using both KIRs and CD94-94AP receptors. These findings suggest the existence of human inhibitory MHC class I receptors of the immunoglobulin and C-type lectin superfamilies and indicate overlap in ligand specificity.","5207":"Positive selection of T cells begins with TCR alpha beta lo thymic progenitors. Here, we show that the most efficient TCRlo progenitors are c-kit+ with intermediate levels of CD4 and CD8 (DPint). Positive selection of DPint TCRlo c-kit+ cells results in TCRmed CD69+ c-kit+ transitional intermediates that show increased TCRV beta frequencies to selecting superantigen (SAg) that are committed to the CD4 or CD8 pathway. The cells on the c-kit+ maturation pathway maintain Bcl-2 expression. Most DPint c-kit+ progenitors fail positive selection, and become DPhi c-kit- cells that lose Bcl-2 expression. Some DPhi c-kit blast cells can be salvaged to produce mature single-positive (SP) cells. DPint c-kit+ maturation to SP cells can occur in &lt;12 hr in vitro on thymic stromal monolayers.","5208":"The number of T cell receptors on CTL clone 2C that are required for recognition of various peptide-MHC or superantigen-MHC ligands were measured as a function of both the ligand density on target cells and the binding affinity of the TCR. Quantitative inverse correlations were determined between the number of TCRs required for recognition and the number of ligands on target cells, and the number of TCR required and the Ka of the TCR for the ligand. We propose and test predictive uses of these relationships to determine the number of endogenous peptide-MHC complexes on a target cell (when TCR affinity is known) or to determine the affinity of the TCR (when the number of ligands is known).","5209":"TCR ligands are complexes of peptides and MHC proteins on the surfaces of APCs. Some of these ligands cause T cell proliferation (agonists), while others block it (antagonists). We compared the acid release, calcium flux, and proliferation response of helper T cells to a variety of ligands. We found that all agonist ligands but not most antagonist ligands trigger acid release, a general indicator of early cellular activation. Only a subset of ligands triggering acid release cause sustained calcium flux, and only a subset of these ligands cause T cell proliferation. Antagonist ligands and anti-CD4 antibodies both effectively block T cell proliferation. However, significantly greater antagonist ligand or antibody concentrations are required to block acid release and initial calcium influx. These data demonstrate a hierarchy of early T cell signaling steps and show that altered TCR ligands can initiate some steps while blocking the completion of others.","5210":"CTL epitope (KSPWFTTL) encoded by AKV\/MCF type of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) differs from the sequence in Friend\/Moloney\/Rauscher (FMR) type in one residue (RSPWFTTL). CTL experiments indicated defective processing of the FMR peptide in tumor cells. Proteasome-mediated digestion of AKV\/MCF-type 26-mer peptides resulted in the early generation and higher levels of epitope-containing fragments than digestion of FMR-type peptides, explained by prominent cleavage next to R in the FMR sequence. The fragments were identified as 10- and 11-mer peptides and were efficiently translocated by TAP. The naturally presented AKV\/MCF peptide is the 8-mer, indicating ER peptide trimming. In conclusion, a single residue exchange can cause CTL epitope destruction by specific proteasomal cleavage.","5211":"Assembly of MHC class I-beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2m) dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum involves two chaperones. Calnexin has previously been shown to interact with free class I heavy chains. Here, we show that the related chaperone, calreticulin, binds human class I-beta 2m dimers prior to peptide loading. Calreticulin remains associated with at least a subset of class I molecules when they, in turn, bind to TAP. Further evidence suggests that the interaction of class I-beta 2m dimers with TAP occurs via a novel uncharacterized 48 kDa glycoprotein, tapasin, which can bind independently to TAP and class I-beta 2m-calreticulin complexes. Tapasin is absent from the mutant cell line .220, in which class I-TAP association and peptide loading is defective.","5212":"Previous work has shown that C\/EBP sites and C\/EBP transcriptional activators are necessary for HIV-1 LTR activity in monocytes\/macrophages. We have investigated the role that C\/EBP proteins play in induction and replication of HIV-1. Ectopic expression of the dominant negative C\/EBP protein LIP inhibited HIV-1 mRNA and virus production in activated U1 cells, demonstrating that C\/EBP proteins are required for provirus induction. U1 lines overexpressing C\/EBP activator NF-IL-6 produced more viral mRNA and virus particles following cellular activation than control lines, demonstrating that C\/EBP proteins are limiting for virus transcription. HIV-1 harboring mutations within two C\/EBP sites were crippled in their ability to replicate in U937 promonocytic cells, indicating that these sites are required for replication. These data identify C\/EBP proteins as regulators of HIV-1 expression in monocytes\/macrophages.","5213":"The development of murine plasma cell tumors induced by raf\/myc containing retroviruses is facilitated by T cells and completely dependent on IL-6. To determine whether kinases with differing specificities reflect alternative biochemical pathways in B cell tumorigenesis, we have employed an abl\/myc containing retrovirus to assess neoplastic development. In contrast with raf\/myc, abl\/myc disease is T cell and IL-6 independent. An examination of the IL-6 signal transduction pathway reveals that this pathway, as defined by activation of Stat3, is inducible by IL-6 in raf\/myc tumors but constitutively activated in abl\/myc tumors. These findings provide a mechanism for the derivation of cytokine-independent plasma cell tumors and suggest that both IL-6-dependent and independent tumors may arise in vivo depending on the particular mutational events incurred during tumorigenesis.","5214":"Polymorphism of MHC class Ia molecules severely constrains vaccine development against intracellular pathogens. Antigen presentation by MHC class Ib molecules, which are generally conserved between different individuals, may circumvent this obstacle. Herein, we use tandem mass spectrometry to identify a Listeria monocytogenes pentapeptide antigen that is presented to T lymphocytes by the H2-M3 MHC class Ib molecule. The peptide contains N-formyl methionine at the N terminus and exclusively hydrophobic amino acids. Mice of the H-2 d, H-2 b,and H-2 k haplotypes respond to this peptide upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Identification of antigens presented by MHC class Ib molecules is feasible and may provide opportunities for relatively unrestricted vaccine development.","5215":"Using expression cloning, we have identified an H2-M3-restricted epitope of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Picomolar concentrations of an amino-terminal N-formylated hexapeptide, fMIGWII, targeted cells for lysis by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, while the nonformylated peptide was approximately 100-fold less active. The sequence of the 185 aa protein source of this epitope predicts a transmembrane protein that retains its N terminus and assumes an N(out)-C(in) topology. This membrane orientation offers an explanation for the protection of the epitope from deformylases present in the bacterial cell and suggests an explanation for the ability of phagocytes to present H2-M3-restricted bacterial epitopes via a vacuolar TAP-independent mechanism.","5216":"T lymphocyte activation is mediated by the interaction of specific TCR with antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules. Single amino acid substitutions are often capable of changing the effect of a peptide from stimulatory to antagonistic. Using surface plasmon resonance, we have analyzed the interaction between a complex consisting of variants of the MCC peptide bound to a mouse class II MHC (Ek) and a specific TCR. Using both an improved direct binding method as well as a novel inhibition assay, we show that the affinities of three different antagonist peptide-Ek complexes are approximately 10-50 times lower than that of the wildtype MCC-Ek complex for the TCR, largely due to an increased off-rate. These results suggest that the biological effects of peptide antagonists and partial agonists may be largely based on kinetic parameters.","5217":"Current models suggest that T cells that receive only signal-1 through antigenic stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) become anergic, but will mount an immune response when a costimulatory signal-2 is provided. Using mice deficient for an important costimulatory molecule, CD28, we show that a transient signal-1 alone, either through infection with an abortively replicating virus, or through injection of viral peptide, anergizes CD8+ T cells, demonstrating the biological relevance of T cell anergy in vivo. However, in the absence of CD28, continued presence of signal-1 alone, either through prolonged viral replication or repeated injection of peptide, prevents the induction of anergy and generates a functional T cell response in vivo.","5218":"TGF beta 1 treatment of B cell lymphomas decreases c-myc gene expression and induces apoptosis. Since we have demonstrated NF-kappa\/Rel factors play a key role in transcriptional control of c-myc, we explored the effects of TGF beta1 on WEHI 231 immature B cells. A reduction in NF-kappa B\/Rel activity followed TGF beta 1 treatment. In WEHI 231 and CH33 cells, we observed an increase in I kappa B alpha, a specific NF-kappa B\/Rel inhibitor, due to transcriptional induction. Engagement of surface CD40 or ectopic c-Rel led to maintenance of NF-kappa B\/Rel and c-Myc expression and protection of WEHI 231 cells from TGF beta 1-mediated apoptosis. Ectopic c-Myc expression overrode apoptosis induced by TGF beta 1. Thus, downmodulation of NF-kappa B\/Rel reduces c-Myc expression, which leads to apoptosis in these immature B cell models of clonal deletion. The inhibition of NF-kappa B\/Rel activity represents a novel TGF beta signaling mechanism.","5219":"The possible involvement of Fas\/APO-1 (CD95) and TNF in antigen-specific AICD of thymocytes and mature T cells has been investigated. Antigenic stimulation in vivo of influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific TCRtg mice was used to demonstrate that the kinetics of thymocyte and peripheral CD4+ T cell deletion are similar in mice with normal (+\/+) or defective Fas (lpr\/lpr) background, indicating that a Fas-independent pathway(s) is responsible for the deletion of activated T cells. TCRtg-+\/+ or TCRtg-lpr\/lpr mice injected with murine TNF-blocking MAb (TN3) showed rapid apoptosis of thymocytes after HA stimulation, indicating that death signaling through Fas and TNF receptors is not essential for HA-induced thymocyte deletion. CDC peripheral T cells in TCRtg-lpr\/lpr mice did not undergo apoptosis following injection with HA and TN3, indicating that TNF-mediated apoptosis is involved in the deletion of mature T cells after antigenic stimulation. However, apoptosis still occurred in TCRtg-+\/+ mice injected with TN3, indicating that both Fas- and TNF-mediated cell death can contribute to the deletion of activated peripheral T cells.","5220":"We examined the relationship between cell death and tolerance induction following antigen injection into the anterior chamber of the eye. Our data show that when inflammatory cells undergo apoptosis following infection with HSV-1, tolerance to the virus was observed. In contrast, when cell death was absent due to defects in Fas or FasL, immune tolerance was not observed. Further studies revealed that cell death and tolerance required that the lymphoid cells be Fas+ and the eye be FasL+. Additionally, we show that while Fas\/FasL-mediated apoptosis occurred in the eye, it was apoptotic cell death that was critical for tolerance induction. Our results further demonstrate immune privilege is not a passive process involving physical barriers, but is an active process that employs an important natural mechanism to induce cell death and immune tolerance.","5221":"","5222":"Somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin variable region genes occurs within germinal centers. Here, we describe a subset of germinal center dark zone centroblasts that express only sIgD and have accumulated up to 80 mutations per heavy chain variable region (IgVH delta gene). Over half of the hypermutated IgVH delta sequences were found to be clonally related. This level of mutation is not observed in either IgVH gamma transcripts from the same sample or IgVH delta transcripts from peripheral blood, suggesting that these cells neither undergo isotype switch nor mature into circulating memory B cells. Optimal growth of these cells in vitro depends on CD40 ligand, T cell cytokines, and a fibroblast stroma, a combination possibly mimicking the dark zone microenvironment. Our hypothesis is that these cells may be sequestered within germinal centers, where their somatic mutation machinery is triggered. The isolation of these hypermutated B cells may represent a critical step for studying both the biology and biochemistry of somatic hypermutation.","5223":"T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of many intracellular proteins, including the proto-oncogene Vav, which is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic and trophoblast cells. Vav is critical for lymphocyte development and activation. Overexpression of Vav in Jurkat T cells leads to potentiation of TCR-mediated IL-2 gene activation. However, the biochemical function of Vav is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the major induced tyrosine phosphoprotein associated with Vav is the hematopoietic cell-specific SLP-76. The Vav SH2 domain is required for this interaction and for TCR-mediated Vav tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar to Vav, overexpression of SLP-76 markedly potentiates TCR-mediated NF-AT and IL-2 gene activation. Furthermore, overexpression of both Vav and SLP-76 synergistically induces basal and TCR-stimulated NF-AT activation. These results suggest that a signaling complex containing Vav and SLP-76 plays an important role in lymphocyte activation.","5224":"Cross-linking the TCR in T cell hybridomas induces cell apoptosis following activation. This activation-induced apoptosis has been used as a model for clonal deletion of thymocytes or peripheral T cells. Anti-TCR-induced apoptosis of T cell hybridomas requires de novo macromolecular synthesis, including up-regulation of Fas and FasL. The Fas-FasL interaction then activates the apoptosis program. To study apoptosis-specific signaling processes, we generated a mutant T cell hybridoma line defective in induction of apoptosis, but competent to induce activation, upon TCR triggering. Subsequently, we cloned the gene TDAG51, which restored activation-induced apoptosis when transfected into the mutant cell line, and showed that TDAG51 expression was required for Fas expression. Thus, TDAG51 plays an essential role in induction of apoptosis by coupling TCR stimulation to Fas expression.","5225":"Intercellular adhesion molecules play an important role in the generation of T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses. Here, we describe a novel accessory molecule, DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1), that is constitutively expressed on the majority of peripheral blood T lymphocytes. DNAM-1 is a 65 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of 318 aa including two immunoglobulin-like domains. Anti-DNAM-1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) inhibits T and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a variety of tumor cell targets and blocks cytokine production by alloantigen-specific T cells. In addition, DNAM-1 is a tyrosine-phosphorylated signal-transducing molecule that participates in primary adhesion during cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated cytotoxicity.","5226":"Using a chemically homogeneous radiolabeled peptide of high specific activity (125I-QLSPYPFDL, 3.5 x 10(18) cpm per mole) we show that at a peptide concentration (5 pM) causing half-maximal lysis of target cells by a cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone that recognizes the peptide in association with Ld, a class I MHC protein, only 3 peptide molecules on average are bound by Ld per target cell. From the distribution of Ld on the target cells, we suggest that a single peptide-MHC complex per target cell can trigger activation of the T cell cytolytic response.","5227":"With unseparated mouse spleen cells as responders, Drosophila cells expressing MHC class I (L(d)) molecules alone lead to peptide-specific responses of CD8+ cells in the absence of exogenous cytokines. Under these conditions, DNA released from dying cells stimulates the B cells in spleen to up-regulate costimulatory molecules; these activated B cells then provide bystander costimulation for CD8+ cells responding to class I-peptide complexes on the Drosophila APCs. By stimulating B cells and presenting antigen to T cells, Drosophila cells thus serve two different functions in promoting primary responses of CD8+ cells in vitro. With this system, we show that Ld-transfected Drosophila cells are able to induce autologous spleen cells to respond to a tumor-specific peptide in vitro and, after transfer, cause tumor rejection in vivo.","5228":"Thymic epithelium is involved in negative selection, but its precise role in selecting the CD4 T cell repertoire remains elusive. By using two transgenic mice, we have investigated how medullary thymic epithelium (mTE) and bone marrow (BM)-derived cells contribute to tolerance of CD4 T cells to nuclear beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). CD4 T cells were not tolerant when beta-gal was expressed in thymic BM-derived cells. In contrast, CD4 T cells of mice expressing beta-gal in mTE were tolerized. Tolerance resulted from presentation of endogenous beta-gal by mTE cells but not from cross-priming. mTE cells presented nuclear beta-gal to a Th clone in vitro, while thymic dendritic cells did not. The data indicate that mTE but not thymic BM-derived cells can use a MHC class II endogenous presentation pathway to induce tolerance to nuclear proteins.","5229":"T lymphocyte receptor CTLA-4 binds costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) with high avidity and negatively regulates T cell activation. CTLA-4 functions at the cell surface, yet is primarily localized in intracellular vesicles. Here, we demonstrate cycling of CTLA-4 between intracellular stores and the cell surface. Intracellular vesicles containing CTLA-4 overlapped with endocytic compartment(s) and with perforin-containing secretory granules. Cell surface expression of CTLA-4 was rapidly increased by raising intracellular calcium levels. During T cell activation, intracellular and cell surface CTLA-4 became focused towards sites of TCR activation. Cycling and directional control of CTLA-4 expression may regulate its functional interaction with APCs bearing peptide-MHC complexes of appropriate specificity and avidity.","5230":"","5231":"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) plays a crucial role in B cell development. Overexpression of Btk with a Src family kinase increases tyrosine phosphorylation and catalytic activity of Btk. This occurs by transphosphorylation at Y551 in the Btk catalytic domain and the enhancement of Btk autophosphorylation at a second site. A gain-of-function mutant called Btk* containing E41 to K change within the pleckstrin homology domain induces fibroblast transformation. Btk* enhances the transphosphorylation of Y551 by endogenous Src family tyrosine kinases and autophosphorylation at the second site. We mapped the major Btk autophosphorylation site to Y223 within the SH3 domain. Mutation of Y223 to F blocks Btk autophosphorylation and dramatically potentiates the transforming activity of Btk* in fibroblasts. The location of Y223 in a potential ligand-binding pocket suggests that autophosphorylation regulates SH3-mediated signaling by Btk.","5232":"Mutating the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain from threonine to lysine at position 134 (T134K) results in a molecule that presents exogenous peptide, but cannot present endogenously derived antigen. This is reflected in diminished cell surface expression and altered intracellular trafficking of T134K. The failure of T134K to present endogenous antigen can be overcome by using an ER targeting sequence, suggesting that the antigen presentation defect is restricted to TAP-dependent peptide loading. The ability of T134K to load peptide in a TAP-dependent manner is dramatically reduced compared with HLA-A*0201. By coimmunoprecipitation there is no detectable association of the T134K molecule with the TAP complex. Thus, T134K selectively affects TAP association and peptide loading, suggesting a requirement for the direct interaction of MHC class I heavy chain and the TAP complex for efficient presentation of endogenous antigen.","5233":"The fate of developing CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is determined by signals transduced through surface TCR complexes. Here, we report that cross-linking of TCR on CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes fails to activate ZAP70 protein tyrosine kinase and fails to initiate downstream signaling events, unless the TCR are coaggregated with surface coreceptor molecules. TCR signaling in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is impaired because the number of available p56lck molecules is diminished by intrathymic CD4-Ia interactions that initially activate p56lck molecules, which are subsequently degraded. As a consequence of intrathymic CD4-Ia interactions, TCR zeta chains are initially phosphorylated to recruit ZAP70 molecules, but the recruited ZAP70 molecules are not subsequently phosphorylated, resulting in TCR complexes that are stably associated with inactive ZAP70 molecules. Thus, intrathymic interactions that diminish p56lck regulate TCR signaling thresholds and affect TCR structure in developing CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.","5234":"We generated interleukin-5 receptor alpha chain (IL-5R alpha)-deficient (IL-5R alpha-\/-) mice by gene targeting. The IL-5R alpha-\/- mice showed decreased numbers of B-1 cells concomitant with low serum concentrations of IgM and IgG3. They showed no IL-5-induced enhancement of B cell responses to T-independent antigens. The number of alpha beta T cell receptor-positive thymocytes tended to decrease in 3-week-old IL-5R alpha-\/- mice, returning to normal by 6 weeks of age. The IL-5R alpha-\/- mice produced basal levels of eosinophils, while their bone marrow cells failed to form eosinophilic colonies in response to IL-5. Impaired eosinophilopoiesis in IL-5R alpha-\/-mice enhanced the survival of Angiostrongylus cantonensis. These results indicate that IL-5-induced eosinophils serve as potent effector cells in the killing of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in mice.","5235":"IL-12 is a cytokine that can exert regulatory effects on T and NK cells and promote Th1 responses. To delineate further the physiologic role of IL-12 in immunity, mice deficient for this cytokine were generated. IL-12-deficient mice were impaired but not completely lacking in the ability to produce IFN gamma following endotoxin administration and to mount a Th1 response in vivo, as measured by antigen-induced IFN gamma secretion by immune lymph node cells in vitro. In contrast, secretion of IL-4 was enhanced, while proliferation and secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 were normal following antigen stimulation. DTH responses were significantly reduced in IL-12-deficient mice, but no defect in allogeneic CTL responses was observed. These results indicate that IL-12 plays an essential role in regulating IFN gamma production and in facilitating normal DTH responses. However, other phenomena associated with Th1 responses and cell-mediated immunity, i.e., IL-2 secretion and CTL generation, were not compromised in the absence of IL-12.","5236":"In vivo genomic footprinting (IVGF) was used to examine regulatory site occupancy during the activation of the murine inflammatory response gene MCP-1\/JE by TNF. In response to TNF, both promoter distal and proximal regulatory regions became occupied in vivo. EMSA analysis showed that while some of the factors involved in expression, including NF-kappa B, were translocated to the nucleus following TNF treatment, others were already present and able to bind DNA in vitro. Protein kinase inhibitor studies showed that protein phosphorylation was required for TNF activation but not factor assembly. These studies provide evidence for a multistep model of TNF-mediated gene regulation involving chromatin accessibility, transcription factor complex assembly, and protein phosphorylation.","5237":"Tristetraprolin (TTP) is a widely expressed potential transcription factor that contains two unusual CCCH zinc fingers and is encoded by the immediate-early response gene, Zfp-36. Mice made deficient in TTP by gene targeting appeared normal at birth, but soon manifested marked medullary and extramedullary myeloid hyperplasia associated with cachexia, erosive arthritis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, glomerular mesangial thickening, and high titers of anti-DNA and antinuclear antibodies. Myeloid progenitors from these mice showed no increase in sensitivity to growth factors. Treatment of young TTP-deficient mice with antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) prevented the development of essentially all aspects of the phenotype. These results indicate a role for TTP in regulating TNF alpha synthesis, secretion, turnover, or action. TTP-deficient mice may serve as useful models of the autoimmune inflammatory state resulting from chronic effective TNF alpha excess.","5238":"Programmed cell death is first observed at stage 11 of embryogenesis in Drosophila. The systematic removal of apoptotic cells is mediated by cells that are derived from the procephalic mesoderm and differentiate into macrophages. We describe a macrophage receptor for apoptotic cells. This receptor, croquemort (catcher of death), is a member of the CD36 superfamily. Croquemort-mediated phagocytosis represents the concept that phagocytosis evolved primarily as a cellular process for the removal of effete cells. Our findings support the idea that the primordial function of macrophages may have been in tissue modeling and that their adapted role is in host defense.","5239":"T cell activation requires contact with APCs. We used optical techniques to demonstrate T cell polarity on the basis of shape, motility, and localized sensitivity to antigen. An intracellular Ca2+ clamp showed that T cell shape and motility are extremely sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i (Kd = 200 nM), with immobilization and rounding occurring via a calcineurin-independent pathway. Ca2+ dependent immobilization prolonged T cell contact with the antigen-presenting B cell; buffering the [Ca2+]i signal prevented the formation of stable cell pairs. Optical tweezers revealed spatial T cell sensitivity to antigen by controlling placement on the T cell surface of either B cells or alpha-CD3 MAb-coated beads. T cells were 4-fold more sensitive to contact made at the leading edge of the T cell compared with the tail. We conclude that motile T cells are polarized antigen sensors that respond physically to [Ca2+]i signals to stabilize their interaction with APCs.","5240":"","5241":"Endotoxin shock is the result of activation of the immune system by endotoxin\/LPS, a component of Gram-negative bacteria. CD14, a GPI-anchored glycoprotein expressed strongly by monocyte\/macrophages, is one of several receptors for endotoxin\/LPS. The role of CD14 in bacterial-induced and LPS-induced shock was tested in CD14-deficient mice produced by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. CD14-deficient mice were found to be highly resistant to shock induced by either live Gram-negative bacteria or LPS; however, at very high concentrations of LPS or bacteria, responses through non-CD14 receptors could be detected. Surprisingly, CD14-deficient mice also showed dramatically reduced levels of bacteremia, suggesting an unexpected role for CD14 in the dissemination of Gram-negative bacteria.","5242":"NF-ATp is a member of a family of genes that encodes the cytoplasmic component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). In this study, we show that mice with a null mutation in the NF-ATp gene have splenomegaly with hyperproliferation of both B and T cells. They also display early defects in the transcription of multiple genes encoding cytokines and cell surface receptors, including CD40L and FasL. A striking defect in early IL-4 production was observed after ligation of the TCR complex by treatment with anti-CD3 in vivo. The transcription of other cytokines including IL-13, GM-CSF, and TNF alpha was also affected, though to a lesser degree. Interestingly, the cytokines IL-2 and IFN gamma were minimally affected. Despite this early defect in IL-4 transcription, Th2 development was actually enhanced at later timepoints as evidenced by increased IL-4 production and IgE levels in situations that favor the formation of Th2 cells both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that NF-ATp may be involved in cell growth, and that it is important for the balanced transcription of the IL-4 gene during the course of an immune response.","5243":"The death domain of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 (TNFR1) triggers distinct signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation through its interaction with the death domain protein TRADD. Here, we show that TRADD interacts strongly with RIP, another death domain protein that was shown previously to associate with Fas antigen. We also show that RIP is a serine-threonine kinase that is recruited by TRADD to TNFR1 in a TNF-dependent process. Overexpression of the intact RIP protein induces both NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. However, expression of the death domain of RIP Induces apoptosis, but potently inhibits NF-kappa B activation by TNF. These results suggest that distinct domains of RIP participate in the TNF signaling cascades leading to apoptosis and NF-kappa B activation.","5244":"Roles of the kappa intronic enhancer (iE kappa) and its associated matrix attachment region (MAR) during B cell development were examined using mutant embryonic stem (ES) cell lines in which the entire region on both chromosomes was replaced with either a recombined LoxP site (E kappa ND) or the PGK-neomycin resistance (PGK-neo(r)) gene (E kappa NI). B cells derived from E kappa ND ES cells had greatly impaired V kappa J kappa rearrangement, normal levels of kappa expression, and kappa:lambda ratios of 1:1 instead of the usual 10:1. Furthermore, lambda-producing hybridomas derived from E kappa ND cells displayed little kappa rearrangement. Thus, the MAR and iE kappa are quantitatively significant for kappa rearrangement but not necessary. In addition, little V kappa J kappa rearrangement could be detected in B cells derived from E kappa NI ES cells, demonstrating that an inserted PGK-neo(r) gene dominantly suppresses V kappa J kappa rearrangement.","5245":"A T cell-mediated immune response is mainly determined by the 3-5 aa residues that protrude upwards from a peptide bound to an MHC molecule. Alterations of these peptide residues can diminish, eliminate or radically alter the signal that the T cell receives through its T cell receptor (TCR). We have used peptide immunizations of normal mice and mice carrying alpha or beta chain TCR transgenes to identify three distinct peptide contact points. One, near the carboxyl terminus of the peptide, involves the beta chain CDR3 region; the second was centrally located and interacted with both the alpha and beta chain CDR3 loops; the third was near the amino terminus of the peptide, and affected V alpha gene usage, but not the structure of CDR3 of either TCR chain. Based on these results, we propose an orientation for the TCR of this cloned line and argue for its generality.","5246":"Destruction of li by proteolysis is required for MHC class II molecules to bind antigenic peptides, and for transport of the resulting complexes to the cell surface. The cysteine protease cathepsin S is highly expressed in spleen, lymphocytes, monocytes, and other class II-positive cells, and is inducible with interferon-gamma. Specific inhibition of cathepsin S in B lymphoblastoid cells prevented complete proteolysis of li, resulting in accumulation of a class II-associated 13 kDa li fragment in vivo. Consequently, the formation of SDS-stable complexes was markedly reduced. Purified cathepsin S, but not cathepsin B, H, or D, specifically digested li from alpha beta li trimers, generating alpha beta-CLIP complexes capable of binding exogenously added peptide in vitro. Thus, cathepsin S is essential in B cells for effective li proteolysis necessary to render class II molecules competent for binding peptides.","5247":"Recent in vitro evidence suggests two alternative mechanisms by which bone marrow-derived APCs may process exogenous antigens for presentation to CTL in vivo, a phenomenon termed cross-priming. Although in vitro studies have suggested that both TAP-dependent and TAP-independent pathways exist, we have now demonstrated an absolute requirement for a functional TAP for cross-priming to occur in vivo. Bone marrow chimeras reconstituted with marrow from TAP-defective donors develop functional CD8+ CTL, but have APCs with disrupted TAP function. In such chimeras, in vivo priming of naive CTL was observed when antigen was targeted to the ER in a TAP-independent fashion, but cross-priming could not be demonstrated. These results support the TAP-dependent mechanism of cross-priming.","5248":"The generation of mature CD4 T cells from CD4+CD8+ precursor thymocytes usually requires corecognition of class II MHC by a TCR and CD4, while the production of mature CD8 T cells requires corecognition of class I MHC by a TCR and CD8. To assess the role of the CD4 coreceptor in development and lineage commitment, we generated CD4-deficient mice expressing a transgenic class II-specific TCR. Surprisingly, in the absence of CD4 a large number of T cells mature, but these cells appear in the CD8 lineage. Thus, when CD4 is present, the majority of immature T cells with this class II-specific TCR choose the CD4 lineage but develop in the CD8 pathway when CD4 is absent. The results indicate that even for TCRs that are not dependent on coreceptor for MHC recognition, the coreceptor can influence the lineage choice. These findings are considered in terms of a quantitative signaling model for CD4\/CD8 lineage commitment.","5249":"","5250":"Using cells from TCR transgenic mice that do or do not express Fas, we show that there are two mechanistically distinct forms of apoptosis in CD4+ T cells. Naive T cells undergo apoptosis if cultured in the absence of antigen or costimulation. This form of programmed cell death (PCD) is not dependent on Fas, and is prevented by CD28-mediated signals, which lead to the secretion of growth factors and the expression of survival genes, such as bcl-xL. Recently activated T cells undergo apoptotic death upon repeated stimulation. This activation-induced cell death (AICD) is mediated by Fas, but is independent of costimulation and is not prevented by IL-2 or bcl-xL. Finally, we show that peripheral tolerance may be induced in vivo independent of Fas-mediated cell death.","5251":"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulation of cells leads to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, one of which involves Stat6. We have generated Stat6-deficient mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to determine the role of this transcription factor in mediating the biologic functions of IL-4. IL-4-induced increases in the cell surface expression of both MHC class II antigens and IL-4 receptor are completely abrogated, and lymphocytes from Stat6-deficient animals fail to proliferate in response to IL-4. Stat6-deficient B cells do not produce IgE following in vivo immunization with anti-IgD. In addition, Stat6-deficient T lymphocytes fail to differentiate into Th2 cells in response to either IL-4 or Il-13. These results demonstrate that, despite the existence of multiple signaling pathways activated by IL-4, Stat6 is essential for mediating responses to IL-4 lymphocytes.","5252":"We and others have defined a transcriptional silencer critical for the proper expression of the CD4 gene at all stages of T cell development. In this report, we use biochemical techniques to identify three different factor-binding sites within the CD4 silencer, denoted sites I, II, and III. Using transgenic analyses, we determine that although all three factor-binding sites are important for silencer activity, there is significant redundancy in that the presence of either site II alone, or the combination of sites I and III permits silencer function. Thus, our data indicate that the mechanism of function of the CD4 silencer is extremely complex. Further biochemical analyses indicate that the factor binding to site II has the same sequence specificity as a factor binding to an E box site in the CD4 enhancer; thus, a member of the bHLH factor family may be important in mediating silencer function.","5253":"During B lymphocyte development, pro-B cells that fail to rearrange an immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) chain allele productively are thought to undergo developmental arrest and death, but because these cells are short-lived in vivo they are not well characterized. Transgenic mice expressing the apoptosis regulatory gene bcl-xL in the B lineage developed large expansions of pro-B cells in bone marrow. V(D)J rearrangements in the expanded populations were nearly all nonproductive, and DJH rearrangements were enriched for joints in DH reading frame 2 and for aberrant joints with extensive DH or JH deletions. Thus, the death of pro-B cells with failed immunoglobulin rearrangements occurs by apoptosis, and bcl-xL can deliver a strong survival signal at the pro-B stage. This analysis also demonstrated that immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is less precise than previously appreciated.","5254":"The CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) signaling process is a pivotal component of multiple immunoregulatory pathways. Although the role that CD40L plays in humoral immune responses is fairly well defined, its function(s) in cell-mediated responses in vivo has not been established. We investigated this issue by assessing the course of Leishmania major infection in CD40L knockout (CD40LKO) mice that were generated on a resistant background. In response to parasite challenge, CD40LKO mice developed ulcerating cutaneous lesions and failed to mount a vigorous Th1-like response. The impaired Th1-like response appears to be related to a defect in the ability of CD40LKO T cells to induce the production of IL-12 from macrophages. Treatment with exogenous IL-12 prevented disease progression in CD40LKO mice, and administration of recombinant CD40L provided partial protection against infection. Thus, a protective cell-mediated immune response to L. major appears to be dependent upon CD40L-induced IL-12 secretion by antigen-presenting cells.","5255":"CD40-deficient mice are susceptible to Leishmania major infection while their wild-type littermates can resolve the infection. Upon stimulation with L. major antigens, draining lymph node T cells of the mutant mice and the susceptible mice, BALB\/c, secrete comparable amounts of IL-4. The mutant mice produce less IFN gamma than wild-type mice. The expression of IL-12 p40 mRNA was significantly lower in L. major antigen-stimulated cells of mutant mice than those of wild-type or BALB\/c mice. In normal mice, engagement of CD40 activates macrophages to a leishmanicidal state in vitro in the presence of IFN gamma. The results suggest that the CD40-CD40 ligand interaction plays an important role in two critical steps of cell-mediated immunity to L. major infection: the generation of a Th1 response and activation of macrophages to a leishmanicidal state.","5256":"To study the role of CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the host immune responses against intracellular pathogens, we infected CD40L knockout (CD40L-\/-) mice with Leishmania amazonensis. Although wild-type mice were susceptible to infection and developed progressive ulcerative lesions, tissue parasite burdens in CD40L-\/- mice were significantly higher. This heightened susceptibility to infection was associated with an impaired T cell and macrophage activation and altered inflammatory response, as reflected by low levels of IFN gamma, lymphotoxin-tumor necrosis factor (LT-TNF), and nitric oxide (NO) production. Furthermore, CD40L-\/- mice failed to generate a protective immune response after immunization. These results indicate an essential role of cognate CD40-CD40L interactions in the generation of cellular immune responses against an intracellular parasite.","5257":"Covalent attachment of activated products of the third component of complement to antigen enhances its immunogenicity, but the mechanism is not clear. This effect is mediated by specific receptors, mCR1 (CD35) and mCR2 (CD21), expressed primarily on B cells and follicular dendritic cells in mice. To dissect the role of mCR1 and mCR2 in the humoral response, we have disrupted the Cr2 locus to generate mice deficient in both receptors. The deficient mice (Cr2-\/-) were found to have a reduction in the CD5+ population of peritoneal B-1 cells, although their serum IgM levels were within the range of normal mice. Moreover, Cr2-\/- mice had a severe defect in their humoral response to T-dependent antigens that was characterized by a reduction in serum antibody titers and in the number and size of germinal centers within splenic follicles. Reconstitution of the deficient mice with bone marrow from MHC-matched Cr2+\/+ donors corrected the defect, demonstrating that the defect was due to B cells themselves. These results indicate an obligatory role of B cell complement receptors in responses of the B cells to protein antigens.","5258":"Human tonsillar B cells were separated into naive IgD+CD38-CD23- (Bm1) and IgD+CD38-CD23 (Bm2), germinal center IgD-CD38+CD23- centroblasts (Bm3) and IgD-CD38+CD77- centrocytes (Bm4) and memory IgD-CD38- (Bm5) subsets. Previous IgVH sequence analysis concluded that the triggering of somatic mutations occurs during the transition from Bm2 subset into the Bm3 subset. To determine the initiation of isotype switching, sterile transcript expression was analyzed by amplification, cloning, and sequencing. A selective sterile I gamma, I alpha, and I epsilon expression was observed at centrocyte (Bm4) stage, suggesting that isotype switch is triggered within germinal centers, after somatic mutation is initiated with centroblasts (Bm3). Finally, the high level of 5'S gamma-S mu 3' DNA switching circles observed in germinal center B cells indicates that within human tonsils, germinal center is a major location for isotype switching.","5259":"HLA-DM molecules remove invariant (Ii) chain peptides from newly synthesized MHC class II complexes. Their localization may thus delineate compartments, e.g., MIIC, specialized for loading peptides onto class II molecules. In murine A20 B cells, however, DM is not restricted to specialized endosomal class II-containing vesicles (CIIV). Although DM was found in CIIV, it was also found throughout the endocytic pathway, principally in lysosomes devoid of class II molecules. In human lymphoblasts, HLA-DM was found in structures indistinguishable from late endosomes or lysosomes, although in these cells the lysosomes contained MHC class II molecules. Thus, the distribution of HLA-DM does not necessarily identify specialized class II compartments. Many \"MIIC\" may represent conventional lysosomes that accumulate MHC class II and HLA-DM in a number of cell types.","5260":"The structure of the human MHC class I molecule HLA-B53 complexed to two nonameric peptide epitopes (from the malaria parasite P. falciparum and the HIV2 gag protein) has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The structures reveal the architecture of a Pro-specific B pocket common to many HLA-B alleles. Relative to other alleles, the B53 peptide-binding groove is widened by a significant (up to 1.25 angstrom) shift in the position of the alpha 1 helix. Within this groove, bound water molecules, acting in concert with the side chains of polymorphic residues, provide the functional malleability of the MHC, which enables the high affinity\/low specificity binding of multiple peptide epitopes.","5261":"The crystal structure of the human major histocompatibility complex class I B allele HLA B*3501 complexed with the 8-mer peptide epitope HIV1 Nef 75-82 (VPLRPMTY) has been determined at 2.0 angstrom resolution. Comparison with the crystal structure of the closely related allele HLA B*5301 reveals the structural basis for the tyrosine specificity of the B*3501 F pocket. The structure also reveals a novel conformation of the 8-mer peptide within the binding groove. The positions of the peptide N and C termini are nonstandard, but the classic pattern of hydrogen bonding to nonpolymorphic MHC class I residues is maintained, at the N terminus by addition of a water molecule, and at the C terminus by a substantial shift in the alpha 2 helix.","5262":"","5263":"To examine the hypothesis that a single initiating antigen was recognized by a monoclonal T cell population leading to subsequent inflammatory insulitis in non-obese (NOD) mouse islets, we examined the T cell receptor TCR V beta repertoire of islet-infiltrating T cells in very young (2-week-old) NOD mice. In independent experiments, we repeatedly identified one monoclonal TCR V-beta 8.2 gene product expressed by T lymphocytes infiltrating the islets of NOD mice at 2 weeks of age. The resultant inflammatory response quickly obscures the monoclonal nature of the initiating event. These data suggest that autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice may be initiated by recognition of a single autoantigen.","5264":"The ability of chemokines, particularly MCP-1, to induce integrin-dependent binding of T lymphocytes to endothelial adhesion molecules or extracellular matrix (ECM) components was examined. MCP-1 induced significant adhesion to fibronectin (FN) and to endothelial-secreted ECM but not to purified ICAM-1 or VCAM-1, or to activated endothelium. The MCP-1-induced binding of T lymphocytes to FN was rapid, dose dependent, and resulted from activation of both VLA-4 and VLA-5. Like MCP-1, the chemokines RANTES and MIP-1 beta induced T lymphocyte binding to FN, but not to ICAM-1. We suggest therefore, that these T lymphocyte chemokines may be most important, not in initiating integrin-dependent firm adhesion of T lymphocytes to the vascular wall, but rather, in subsequent adhesive interactions during migration into tissue.","5265":"CIITA activates the expression of multiple genes involved in antigen presentation and it is believed to be required for both constitutive and IFN gamma-inducible expression of these genes. To understand the role of CIITA in vivo, we have used gene targeting to generate mice that lack CIITA. CIITA-deficient (-\/-) mice do not express conventional MHC class II molecules on the surface of splenic B cells and dendritic cells. In addition, macrophages resident in the peritoneal cavity do not express MHC class II molecules upon IFN gamma stimulation nor do somatic tissues of mice injected with IFN gamma, in contrast with wild-type mice. The levels of Ii and H-2M gene transcripts are substantially decreased but absent in CIITA (-\/-) mice. The transcription of nonconventional MHC class II genes is, however not affected by CIITA deficiency. A subset of thymic epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules. Nonetheless, very few mature CD4 T cells are present in the periphery of CIITA (-\/-) mice despite MHC class II expression in the thymus. Consequently, CIITA(-\/-) mice are impaired in T-dependent antigen responses and MHC class II-mediated allogeneic responses.","5266":"Functional polymorphism in the rat peptide transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) changes the peptide pool available for binding and presentation by a class I MHC allele, RT1.Aa. The peptide binding motif for RT1.Aa, determined by stabilization with synthetic peptides, included a strong preference for arginine at the peptide C terminus. Analysis of natural peptides bound to RT1.Aa by both pool sequencing and anhydrotrypsin chromatography revealed that TAP polymorphism determined the presence or absence of arginine as the peptide C-terminal residue. This result highlights the in vivo impact of TAP-peptide selectivity, and provides evidence against a high rate of generation of new C termini by protease activity in the endoplasmic reticulum.","5267":"Rearrangements of the IgH locus with JH joined to reading frame 2 of DH are greatly underrepresented in B cells. These rearrangements encode the truncated heavy chain D mu. In pre-B cells, we found D mu protein expressed on the cell surface and assembled into a complex with surrogate light chains, Ig alpha, and Ig beta. Cross-linking of either mu m- or D mu m- containing pre-B cell receptors triggered signal transduction reactions. In contrast, when expressed in mature B cell lines, D mu was not detected on the cell surface and did not efficiently bind kappa immunoglobulin light chains, but did associate with Ig alpha and Ig beta. These results characterize the interactions of D mu chain with other components of the B cell antigen receptor complex and suggest possible mechanisms by which D mu expression may interfere with B cell development.","5268":"Allelic exclusion at the IgH locus was examined in B lineage cells of wild-type mice and mice unable to express the surrogate light chain molecule lambda 5 using a single-cell PCR approach. By analyzing B precursor cells containing two VHDHJH rearrangements, we found that in wild-type animals, cells are allelically excluded as soon as mu chains are expressed. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in cells expressing D mu proteins VH--&gt;DHJH rearrangement is inhibited. In contrast, in the absence of lambda 5 protein, B precursor cells were allelically \"included\", indicating that allelic exclusion at the IgH locus requires expression of the pre-B cell receptor either containing a mu chain or a D mu chain. However, although mu chain double-producing B precursor cells are generated in lambda 5-deficient mice, such cells were not detected among surface immunoglobulin positive B cells.","5269":"IL-4 causes hematopoietic cells to proliferate and express a series of genes, including CD23. We examined whether IL-4-mediated growth, as measured by 4PS phosphorylation, and gene induction were similarly controlled. Studies of M12.4.1 cells expressing human IL-4R truncation mutants indicated that the region between amino acids 557-657 is necessary for full gene expression, which correlated with Stat6 DNA binding activity. This region was not required for 4PS phosphorylation. Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in the interval between amino acids 557-657 revealed that as long as one tyrosine remained unmutated, CD23 was fully induced. When all three tyrosines were mutated, the receptor was unable to induce CD23. The results indicate that growth regulation and gene expression are principally controlled by distinct regions of IL-4R.","5270":"IL-4 binds to a cell surface receptor complex that consists of the IL-4 binding protein (IL-4R alpha) and the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor complex (gamma c). The receptors for IL-4 and IL-2 have several features in common; both use the gamma c as a receptor component, and both activate the Janus kinases JAK-1 and JAK-3. In spite of these similarities, IL-4 evokes specific responses, including the tyrosine phosphorylation of 4PS\/IRS-2 and the induction of CD23. To determine whether sequences within the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-4R alpha specify these IL-4-specific responses, we transplanted the insulin IL-4 receptor motif (I4R motif) of the huIL-4R alpha to the cytoplasmic domain of a truncated IL-2R beta. In addition, we transplanted a region that contains peptide sequences shown to block Stat6 binding to DNA. We analyzed the ability of cells expressing these IL-2R-IL-4R chimeric constructs to respond to IL-2. We found that IL-4 function could be transplanted to the IL-2 receptor by these regions and that proliferative and differentiative functions can be induced by different receptor sequences.","5271":"","5272":"We used a sensitive in vitro culture system to follow, in embryonic blood, the number and state of commitment of B cell precursors along ontogeny. We describe a wave of circulating multipotent progenitors, first detectable at day 10 of gestation, and reaching a maximum in absolute numbers at day 12. They are undetectable by day 14 of gestation, when committed B cell precursors can be detected in fetal liver. Embryonic marrow contains B cell progenitors by day 15. We propose that fetal liver, thymus, and bone marrow are colonized by the same wave of multipotent hematopoietic cells and define embryonic blood at day 11 of gestation as an important source of multipotent hematopoietic cells, virtually deprived of committed and mature contaminants.","5273":"The exchange of HLA class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP) for cognate peptide is catalyzed by HLA-DM under acidic conditions in vitro by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show an association between HLA-DM and HLA-DR in vivo by coprecipitation of the two heterodimers. The association is favored at low pH and in the nonionic detergent digitonin. Most DM-DR complexes are isolated from dense subcellular fractions. Recovery of HLA-DM by the conformation-dependent DR3 monoclonal antibody 16.23 suggests an association with HLA-DR heterodimers beyond the stage at which CLIP is released. The additional N-linked glycan on mutant DR3 molecules isolated from the 10.24.6 cell line, which interferes with DM-enhanced CLIP release from DR3 in vitro, also affects the DM-DR interaction.","5274":"Cytolysis of target cells by natural killer (NK) cells and by some cytotoxic T cells occurs unless prevented by inhibitory receptors that recognize MHC class I on target cells. Human NK cells express a p58 inhibitory receptor specific for HLA-C. We report association of the tyrosine phosphatase HCP with the p58 receptor in NK cells. HCP association was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of p58. Phosphotyrosyl peptides corresponding to the p58 tail bound and activated HCP in vitro. Furthermore, introduction of an inactive mutant HCP into an NK cell line prevented the p58-mediated inhibition of target cell lysis. These data imply that the inhibitory function of p58 is dependent on its tyrosine phosphorylation and on recruitment and activation of HCP.","5275":"We address the mechanism of hybrid resistance (HR) in vitro using NK effector cells and target lymphoblasts from H-2b, H-2d, and H-2b\/d mice. The 5E6 (Ly49C)+ subset of F1 NK cells lyse BALB\/c (H-2d) but not B6 (H-2b) targets unless either anti-5E6 or anti-H-2Kb MAbs are present. H-2Dd transgenic B6 (D8) targets are not susceptible to F1 Ly49A+ effectors. Furthermore, 5E6+ Ly49A+ F1 effectors lyse B6 and BALB\/c targets only in the presence of anti-5E6 and anti-Ly49A MAbs, respectively. Thus, recognition of H-2Kb by 5E6 and H-2Dd by Ly49A transduce independent inhibitory signals. Moreover, anti-5E6 MAbs enable 5E6+ BALB\/c NK cells to lyse (BALB\/c x B6)F1 targets. These data support the \"missing self\" and not the \"hemopoietic histocompatibility antigen\" hypothesis for HR. In addition, 5E6+ NK cells from BALB\/c and BALB.B, but not B6 or (BALB\/c x B6)F1, mice receive negative signals from both H-2d and Kb class I antigens. Thus, allelic differences in 5E6 (C57BL versus BALB) may regulate recognition events by NK cells.","5276":"To identify DNA sequences that target the somatic hypermutation process, the immunoglobulin gene promoter located upstream of the variable (V) region was duplicated upstream of the constant (C) region of a kappa transgene. Normally, kappa genes are somatically mutated only in the VJ region, but not in the C region. In B cell hybridomas from mice with this kappa transgene (P5'C), both the VJ region and the C region, but not the region between them, were mutated at similar frequencies, suggesting that the mutation mechanism is related to transcription. The downstream promoter was not occluded by transcripts from the upstream promoter. In fact, the levels of transcripts originating from the two promoters were similar, supporting a mutation model based on initiation of transcripts. Several \"hot-spots\" of somatic mutation were noted, further demonstrating that this transgene has the hallmarks of somatic mutation of endogenous immunoglobulin genes. A model linking somatic mutation to transcription-coupled DNA repair is proposed.","5277":"Taking advantage of a potent MHC class I-restricted response that allows the identification of antigen-selected CD8 T cells directly ex vivo, we characterized the antigen-specific T cell repertoires that develop in individual mice by single-cell PCR analysis. Each of the immune mice displayed distinct yet structurally similar TCR repertoires. The overall repertoire size was estimated to be in the range of 15-20 for most mice. No major differences were observed between primary and secondary responses. Moreover, for a hyperimmunized mouse the antigen-specific TCR repertoire expressed 8 months after the initial immunization was very similar to that found at the peak of the primary response. Our results demonstrate that a high magnitude immune response may be composed of very few clones, and that at least in the system analyzed, the memory response largely reflects the repertoire selected by the peak of the primary response.","5278":"Mature T cells comprise two mutually exclusive lineages expressing heterodimeric alpha beta or gamma delta antigen receptors. During development, beta, gamma, and delta genes rearrange before alpha, and mature gamma delta cells arise in the thymus prior to alpha beta cells. The mechanism underlying commitment of immature T cells to the alpha beta or gamma delta lineage is controversial. Since the delta locus is located within the alpha locus, rearrangement of alpha genes leads to deletion of delta. We have examined the rearrangement status of the delta locus immediately prior to alpha rearrangement. We find that many thymic precursors of alpha beta cells undergo VDJ delta rearrangements. Furthermore, the same cells frequently coexpress sterile T early alpha (TEA) transcripts originating 3' of C delta and 5' of the most upstream J alpha, thus implying that individual alpha beta lineage cells undergo sequential VDJ delta and VJ alpha rearrangements. Finally, VDJ delta rearrangements in immature alpha beta cells appear to be random, supporting models in which alpha beta lineage commitment is determined independently of the rearrangement status at the TCR delta locus.","5279":"It is widely believed that viral clearance is mediated principally by the destruction of infected cells by CTLs. In this report, we use a transgenic mouse model of HBV replication to demonstrate that this assumption may not be true for all viruses. We find that adoptively transferred virus-specific CTLs can abolish HBV gene expression and replication in the liver without killing the hepatocytes. This antiviral function is mediated by IFN gamma and TNF alpha secreted by the CTL or by the antigen-nonspecific macrophages and T cells that they activate following antigen recognition. These cytokines activate two independent virocidal pathways: the first pathway eliminates HBV nucleocapsid particles and their cargo of replicating viral genomes, while the second pathway destabilizes the viral RNA. Intracellular viral inactivation mechanisms such as these could greatly amplify the protective effects of the immune response, while failure of such mechanisms could lead to viral persistence or to the death of the host.","5280":"Mice deficient in interleukin-5 (IL-5-\/- mice) were generated by gene targeting in embryonal stem cells. Contrary to previous studies, no obligatory role for IL-5 was demonstrated in the regulation of conventional B (B-2) cells, in normal T cell-dependent antibody responses or in cytotoxic T cell development. However, CD5+ B cells (B-1 cells) in the peritoneal cavity were reduced by 50%-80% in 2-week-old IL-5-\/- mice, returning to normal by 6-8 weeks of age. The IL-5-\/- mice did not develop blood and tissue eosinophilia when infected with the helminth Mesocestoides corti, but basal levels of eosinophils with normal morphology were produced in the absence of IL-5. IL-5 deficiency did not affect the worm burden of infected mice, indicating that increased eosinophils do not play a significant role in the host defence in this parasite model.","5281":"A model of lung eosinophilia based on the repeated exposure of mice to aerosolized OVA has been used to identify C-C chemokine genes expressed at stages of massive eosinophil infiltration. We describe the identification and cloning of a cDNA that encodes a mouse C-C chemokine with 68% amino acid identity to guinea pig Eotaxin. The recombinant protein encoded by this gene displays potent and specific chemotactic activity for eosinophils, both in vivo and in vitro. Its mRNA levels parallel the kinetics of eosinophil accumulation in the lung during the experimentally induced eosinophilia and it is mainly produced by type I alveolar epithelial cells. The mRNA expression of mouse Eotaxin is not restricted to Th2 T cells in vitro and is independent of the development of a Th2-type response during N. brasiliensis infection, in vivo.","5282":"Herpesvirus Saimiri gene 13 (HVS13) exhibits 57% identity with the predicted sequence of a T cell-derived molecule termed CTLA8. Recombinant HVS13 and CTLA8 stimulate transcriptional factor NF-kappa B activity and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion in fibroblasts, and costimulate T cell proliferation. An HVS13.Fc fusion protein was used to isolate a cDNA encoding a novel receptor that also binds CTLA8. This receptor is unrelated to previously identified cytokine receptor families. A recombinant soluble receptor inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by PHA, concanavalin A (conA), and anti-TCR MAb. These results define CTLA8 and HVS13 as novel cytokines that bind to a novel cytokine receptor. We propose to call these molecules IL-17, vIL-17, and IL-17R, respectively.","5283":"","5284":"Making use of mice deficient for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression and a random peptide library, we have examined the diversity and peptide specificity of the neonatal T cell repertoire specific for a single H-2Db-restricted peptide. Consistent with the predicted decrease in repertoire diversity, polyclonal CTL lines and individual clones from different TdTo mice are more similar to each other than those from different wild-type mice in terms of their fingerprints of cross-reactivity to the library and their TCR sequences. We have also found that several TdTo CTL clones cross-react with many more library peptides than wild-type CTL clones. In a few instances, the degree of peptide promiscuity correlates with TCR sequence characteristics such as N region addition and homology-directed recombination, but not CDR3 loop length. Based on epitope titrations for each clone, TCR affinity for antigen is consistently high; thus, this reduced specificity for peptide may coincide with an accentuated affinity for the alpha helices of the MHC. Peptide promiscuity in the neonate may allow the relatively small numbers of T cells in the periphery to protect against a broader range of pathogens.","5285":"Extracellular proteins are not generally presented on class I MHC molecules in vitro, yet many studies show that a pathway exists in vivo for the presentation of extracellular material on class I molecules to prime CD8+ T cell responses. Here, we provide morphological evidence that proteins taken up by macropinocytosis can gain access to the cytosol and therefore into the conventional class I MHC pathway. Class I presentation of soluble ovalbumin by mouse bone marrow macrophages was dramatically enhanced by MCSF or phorbol ester and blocked by amiloride, which stimulate and inhibit membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis, respectively. Brefeldin A, gelonin, and a peptide aldehyde inhibitor of proteasomal processing each blocked presentation of macropinocytosed antigen, demonstrating that unusual access to the conventional class I MHC pathway was occurring. This novel cell type-specific endocytic pathway may facilitate presentation of exogenous material on class I MHC molecules, allowing induction of CD8+ T cell responses to soluble proteins, tumor cell fragments, and some pathogens.","5286":"Jak3 is a tyrosine kinase mediating cytokine receptor signaling through the association with the common gamma chain of the cytokine receptors such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Unlike other members of the Jak family, the expression of Jak3 is highly restricted in hematopoietic cells. To elucidate in vivo function of Jak3, Jak3-deficient mice were generated by homologous recombination. Mice homozygous for Jak3 null mutation showed severe defects, specifically in lymphoid cells. B cell precursors in bone marrow, thymocytes, and both T and B cells in the spleen drastically decreased, although these defects were significantly recovered as aging occurred. Peripheral lymph nodes, NK cells, dendritic epidermal T cells, and intestinal intraepithelial gamma delta T cells were absent. Normal number of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow from Jak3-deficient mice and the similar capability to generate myeloid and erythroid colonies as wild-type mice indicated specific defects in lymphoid stem cells. Furthermore, the abnormal architecture of lymphoid organs suggested the involvement of Jak3 in the function of epithelial cells. T cells developed in the mutant mice did not respond to either IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7. These findings establish the crucial role of Jak3 in the development of lymphoid cells.","5287":"Itk is a T cell protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that, along with Btk and Tec, belongs to a family of cytoplasmic PTKs with N-terminal pleckstrin homology domains. Btk plays a critical role in B lymphocyte development. To determine whether Itk has an analogous role in T lymphocytes, we used gene targeting to prepare mice lacking expression of Itk. Such animals had decreased numbers of mature thymocytes, an effect most clearly observed in mice expressing T cell receptor (TCR) transgenes. Mature T cells from Itk-deficient mice had reduced proliferative responses to allogeneic MHC stimulation and to anti-TCR cross-linking, but responded normally to stimulation with phorbol ester plus ionomycin or with IL-2. These results provide genetic evidence that Itk is involved in T cell development and also suggest that Itk has an important role in proximal events in TCR-mediated signaling pathways.","5288":"We have generated a site-directed transgenic (sd-tg) mouse model in which the JH locus has been replaced with a rearranged VDJ coding for the heavy chain of an anti-DNA antibody. In these mice, B cells expressing the anti-dsDNA specificity are negatively regulated. We observe a novel mechanism for B cell tolerance, receptor editing at the heavy chain locus. In most sd-tg B cells, the inserted anti-DNA VH gene has been replaced by the upstream endogenous VH, or DH, or both genes through recombination with the heptamer embedded at the 3' end of most VH genes. Three types of recombination events have been identified. VH-to-VDJ, DH-to-VDJ, and VH-to-DH-VDJ. Analysis of the junctional sequences revealed features of classical V(D)J rearrangement, namely N sequence addition and nucleotide deletion. A conserved nonamer was found 12 bp upstream of the embedded heptamer. This nonamer may represent a novel recombination signal sequence used for VH editing. The sd-tg model thus provides direct evidence for secondary rearrangement at VH-D-JH. This process may play a role in tolerance by editing autoreactive receptors and may also serve to diversify the VH repertoire.","5289":"Relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) induced with the immunodominant epitope from proteolipid protein, PLP139-151, is characterized by the development of recurrent relapses with recruitment of T cells reactive to additional myelin peptides, including PLP178-191 (epitope spreading). In this study, we have determined that the CD28\/B7 costimulatory pathway is involved in this process. We found preferential up-regulation of B7-1 during the course of R-EAE and a selective increase in its functional costimulatory activity, relative to B7-2. Anti B7-1 F(ab) fragment therapy, but not anti B7-2 MAb therapy, blocked clinical relapses, ameliorated CNS pathology, and blocked epitope spreading. These results suggest that the maintenance of autoimmune reactivity in EAE depends on CD28\/B7-1-dependent costimulation of newly recruited T cells responsible for epitope spreading. These studies have important implications for the role of epitope spreading in disease progression and the clinical application of costimulatory antagonists in autoimmune diseases.","5290":"We evaluated the role of the costimulatory molecule B7-1 in overcoming peripheral ignorance in transgenic mice, which expressed the glycoprotein (GP) or nucleoprotein (NP) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as the self-antigen in pancreatic beta cells. The viral transgenes or B7-1 alone did not induce autoimmune diabetes (IDDM). However, in bigenic mice expressing B7-1 and LCMV-GP, anti-self (viral) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were activated without viral infection and spontaneous IDDM occurred. In contrast, bigenic RIP-B7-1 x RIP-NP mice with thymic expression of the self (viral-NP) antigen deleted the majority of their autoreactive CTL and did not develop spontaneous IDDM. However, these mice developed fast-onset IDDM 14 days after LCMV infection, whereas single-transgenic RIP-NP littermates developed IDDM only within 4-5 months. Rapid IDDM was associated with increased numbers of anti-self CTL and a predominance of IFN gamma produced by islet-infiltrating lymphocytes, whereas single transgenic RIP-NP littermates with slow-onset IDDM displayed less anti-self CTL and more IL-4- and IL-10-producing T lymphocytes in pancreatic infiltrates.","5291":"The RAG1 and RAG2 gene products are indispensable for activating somatic rearrangement of antigen receptor gene segments. The two proteins form a stable complex in primary thymocytes as well as when expressed in adherent cells. In both cell types, most cells localize RAG proteins at the periphery of the nucleus. However, when overexpressed in fibroblast cells, RAG1 is found largely in the nucleolus. Nucleolar localization of RAG1 is mediated by several domains containing stretches of basic amino acids, indicating that RAG1 has affinity for RNA or ssDNA. The RAG1 interacting proteins SRP1 and Rch1 directly bind to the nuclear localization signals of RAG1, which mediate the nuclear and nucleolar translocation of the protein. RAG1 appears to have a binary structure, each half containing multiple regions that can act as NLSs, binding sites for the SRP1\/Rch1 family, and RNA binding domains.","5292":"We have previously shown using gene targeting that PU.1 is essential for the development of lymphoid and myeloid lineages during fetal liver hematopoiesis. We now show that PU.1 is required for the maturation of yolk sac-derived myeloid progenitors and for the differentiation of ES cells into macrophages. The role of PU.1 in regulating target genes, thought to be critical in the development of monocytes and granulocytes, has been analyzed. Early genes such as GM-CSFR, G-CSFR, and myeloperoxidase are expressed in PU.1-\/- embryos and differentiated PU.1-\/- ES cells. However, the expression of genes associated with terminal myeloid differentiation (CD11b, CD64, and M-CSFR) is eliminated in differentiated PU.1-\/- ES cells. Development of macrophages is restored with the introduction of a PU.1 cDNA regulated by its own promoter. The PU.1-\/- ES cells represent an important model for analyzing myeloid cell development.","5293":"Anergic self-reactive B cells competing within a polyclonal B cell repertoire fail to migrate into primary follicles and die after 1-3 days residence in T cell zones. Transfer of anergic HEL-specific B cells to recipients lacking HEL autoantigen and continuous bromodeoxyuridine labeling in mixed bone marrow chimeras confirms that follicular exclusion and cell death in 1-3 days is not an intrinsic characteristic of anergic cells but results from competition with B cells bearing other specificities together with continued binding of autoantigen. When naive (nontolerant) HEL-specific B cells were transferred into mice expressing HEL autoantigen, they were also excluded from follicles and their lifespan was dramatically shortened, although they became activated to express CD86 (B7-2\/B70). In the presence of helper T cells, activated B cells but not anergic B cells were rescued from death and formed large extrafollicular foci to autoantibody-secreting cells. Antigen-induced exclusion from follicles is therefore an independent process from anergy that prevents self-reactive B cells from recirculating in the long-lived repertoire and may foster interactions with T cells during immune responses. By contrast, anergy prevents self-reactive B cells from collaborating with helper T cells and secreting autoantibody while trapped in the T zone.","5294":"The leukocyte-restricted beta 2 (CD18) integrins mediate cell adhesion in a variety of events essential for normal immune function. Despite extensive research in this field, only three members of this integrin subfamily have been described: CD11a\/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b\/CD18 (Mac-1), and CD11c\/CD18 (p150,95). We have identified a cDNA encoding a fourth alpha chain, alpha d, that associates with CD18. The alpha d subunit is more closely related to CD11b and CD11c than to CD11a. This integrin is expressed at moderate levels on myelomonocytic cell lines and subsets of peripheral blood leukocytes, and more strongly on tissue-compartmentalized cells such as foam cells, specialized macrophages found in aortic fatty streaks that may develop into atherosclerotic lesions. The alpha d\/CD18 molecule exhibits preferential recognition of ICAM-3 over ICAM-1.","5295":"A novel tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member has been cloned and characterized. This protein, designated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), consists of 281 and 291 aa in the human and murine forms, respectively, which share 65% aa identity. TRAIL is a type II membrane protein, whose C-terminal extracellular domain shows clear homology to other TNF family members. TRAIL transcripts are detected in a variety of human tissues, most predominantly in spleen, lung, and prostate. The TRAIL gene is located on chromosome 3 at position 3q26, which is not close to any other known TNF ligand family members. Both full-length cell surface expressed TRAIL and picomolar concentrations of soluble TRAIL rapidly induce apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cell lines of diverse origin.","5296":"","5297":"The ubiquitous cellular distribution of certain cytokine receptors has hampered attempts to define the physiologically important cell-specific functions of cytokines in vivo. Herein, we report the generation of transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative IFN gamma receptor alpha chain mutant under the control of either the human lysozyme promoter or the murine lck proximal promoter, which display tissue-specific unresponsiveness in the macrophage or T cell compartments, respectively, to the pleiotropic cytokine, IFN gamma. We utilize these mice to identify previously undefined cellular targets of IFN gamma action in the development of a murine antimicrobial response and the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Moreover, we identify the macrophage as a critical responsive cell in manifesting the effects of IFN gamma in regulating CD4+ T helper subset development. These studies thus represent a novel approach to studying the cell-specific actions of an endogenously produced pleiotropic cytokine in vivo.","5298":"The exquisite sensitivity of thymocytes to steroid-induced apoptosis, the steroidogenic potential of thymic epithelial cells, and the ability of steroid synthesis inhibitors to enhance antigen-specific deletion of thymocytes in fetal thymic organ cultures suggest a role for glucocorticoids in thymocyte development. To address this further, transgenic mice that express antisense transcripts to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) specifically in immature thymocytes were generated. The consequent hyporesponsiveness of thymocytes to glucocorticoids was accompanied by a reduction in thymic size, primarily owing to a decrease in the number of CD4+CD8+ cells. While an enhanced susceptibility to T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated apoptosis appeared to be partially responsible for this reduction, thymocyte loss could also be detected before thymocytes progressed to the CD4+CD8+ TCR alpha beta-expressing stage. These results suggest that glucocorticoids are necessary for survival and maturation of thymocytes, and are consistent with a role for steroids in both the transition from CD4-CD8- to CD4+CD8+ cells and the survival of CD4+CD8+ cells stimulated via the TCR.","5299":"The cell-triggering properties of BCR, TCR and FcR depend on structurally related immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Fc gamma RIIB have no ITAM and do not trigger cell activation. When coaggregated to BCR, they inhibit B cell activation. We show here that, when coaggregated to these receptors, Fc gamma RIIB inhibit Fc epsilon RI-, Fc gamma RIIA-, and TCR-dependent cell activation. Inhibition also affected cell activation by single ITAMs, in isolated FcR or TCR subunits. The same tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is highly conserved in murine and human Fc gamma RIIB and that was previously shown to inhibit BCR-dependent B cell activation, was required to regulate TCR- and FcR-dependent cell activation. Our findings endow Fc gamma RIIB, and thus IgG antibodies, with general immunoregulatory properties susceptible to act on all ITAM-containing receptors.","5300":"The multichain T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is composed of an antigen binding (alpha\/beta) domain and associated signal-transducing complexes, the CD3 (gamma, delta, and epsilon) and the zeta chains. The zeta chain (TCR zeta) plays a key role in signal transduction. We show here that TCR ligation induces association of tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR zeta with the detergent-insoluble cell fraction. The microfilament poison, cytochalasin D, disrupts this association and enhances the coprecipitation of actin with TCR zeta after receptor ligation. This microfilament association is specific to TCR-associated polypeptides containing at least one intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Mapping studies using transfectants and chimeric TCR zeta chain constructs suggest that the third ITAM is necessary and sufficient for association, if the distal tyrosine is intact. This cytoskeletal association is directly correlated with IL-2 production, and ligation of TCR on immature thymocytes does not induce TCR zeta-cytoskeleton association. These data thus provide direct evidence of a developmentally regulated activation-dependent interaction between a lymphocyte antigen receptor and the actin cytoskeleton.","5301":"The T cell receptor (TCR) delta locus lies within the TCR alpha locus and is excised from the chromosome by V alpha-J alpha rearrangement. We show here that delta sequences persist in a large fraction of the DNA from mature CD4+CD8- alpha beta+ mouse thymocytes. Virtually all delta loci in these cells are rearranged and present in extrachromosomal DNA. In immature alpha beta lineage thymocytes (CD3-\/loCD4+CD8+) and in CD4+CD8- alpha beta+ thymocytes expressing a transgene-encoded alpha beta receptor, rearranged delta genes are present both in chromosomal and extrachromosomal DNA. Thus, contrary to earlier proposals, commitment to the alpha beta lineage does not require recombinational silencing of the delta locus or its deletion by a site-specific mechanism prior to V alpha-J alpha rearrangement.","5302":"Two waves of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, first of the heavy, then of the light chain chain gene loci form functional immunoglobulin genes during B cell development. In mouse bone marrow the differential surface expression of B220 (CD45R), c-kit, CD25, and surrogate light chain as well as the cell cycle status allows FACS separation of the cells in which these two waves of rearrangements occur. The gene products of two recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 are crucial for this rearrangement process. Here, we show that the expression of the RAG genes is twice up- and down-regulated, at the transcriptional level for RAG1 and RAG2, and at the postranscriptional level for RAG2 protein. Expression levels are high in D--&gt;JH and VH--&gt;DJH rearranging proB and preB-I cells, low in preB cells expressing the preB cell receptor on the cell surface, and high again in VL--&gt;JL rearranging small preB-II cells. In immature B cells expressing on the cell surface RAG1 and RAG2 mRNA is down-regulated, whereas RAG2 protein levels are maintained. Down-regulation of RAG1 and RAG2 gene expression after productive rearrangement at one heavy chain allele might be part of the mechanisms that prevent further rearrangements at the other allele.","5303":"The class Ib antigen HLA-G is expressed as a membrane-bound protein like classical class Ia molecules (M.HLA-G) but, unlike typical class I, is also expressed as a soluble protein (S.HLA-G) with a unique C terminus. Our results show that, similar to classical class I proteins, the membrane-bound form of HLA-G associated with TAP, as evidenced by the ability to immunoprecipitate HLA-G class I heavy chain with TAP antisera. In contrast, the soluble G protein did not appear to associate with TAP in the same manner, since similar immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect soluble G complex. A detailed analysis of peptides bound to the soluble and membrane HLA-G proteins expressed in the B lymphoblastoid cell line 721.221 showed that, like class Ia complexes, both HLA-G proteins consist of heavy and light chains complexed with nonameric peptides in a 1:1:1 ratio. The two proteins bind essentially the same set of peptides, which are derived from a variety of intracellular proteins and define a peptide motif for HLA-G. The peptides contain Leu at the C terminus and Pro or small hydrophobic amino acids in position 3 followed by Pro or Gly in position 4. The complexity of the bound peptides is lower than that found for some class Ia complexes, but is more similar to class Ia than to the limited repertoire of some murine class Ib molecules.","5304":"The ability of a human cytomegalovirus-encoded homolog of MHC class I molecules to serve as a peptide receptor was investigated. Sequencing of peptide material eluted from the purified viral protein revealed a mixture of endogenous peptides with characteristics similar to those eluted from conventional class I molecules, that is, anchor residues, and a predominance of short peptides derived from cytoplasmic proteins. The possible function(s) of this viral MHC homolog are discussed in light of the finding that it binds endogenous peptides.","5305":"Recognition of class I MHC antigens involves interaction between TCRs of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and the two alpha helices of MHC molecules. Using a combined panel of H-2Kb mutants selected by either a CTL clone or MAbs, we have shown evidence that the TCRs of 59 Kb-specific CTL clones shared a common binding pattern on the H-2Kb molecule. Mutations of amino acid residues at the C-terminal regions, but not the N-terminal regions, of the alpha helices abrogated the recognition by the majority of the clones. The data suggests that TCRs predominantly recognize the class I MHC molecule with an orientation that is parallel to the beta-pleated strands and diagonal to the alpha helices.","5306":"The nonpolymorphic human class II molecule HLA-DM (DM) has been found to play a key role in antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. HLA-DM and its murine equivalent H2-M are located intracellularly and are absent from the cell surface. In transfected HeLa cells, H2-M was transported to an endosomal compartment in the absence of invariant chain. A tyrosine-based targeting motif in the cytoplasmic tail of H2-M beta was responsible for the endosomal location and, if this tyrosine was mutated, H2-M accumulated at the cell surface. In the presence of invariant chain the mutated H2-M was redistributed to endosomes. The targeting motif of H2-M appeared not to be crucial for efficient peptide loading of class II, but if the invariant chain targeting motif also was removed, peptide loading decreased drastically. Thus, the targeting motif of H2-M appears to be supplementary, rather than essential for class II-peptide association.","5307":"The Src family protein-tyrosine kinase Lyn associates physically with the BCR and has been suggested to play an important role in BCR-mediated signaling. Studies with lyn-\/- mice showed that the number of B cells decreased by half in their peripheral tissues. In addition, these B cells do not respond normally to a number of stimuli, including BCR cross-linking and CD40 ligand. Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation on a variety of cellular proteins, such as Vav, Cbl, and HS1, upon BCR cross-linking was also abolished in these B cells. Despite the impaired BCR-mediated signaling, concentrations of IgM and IgA in sera were remarkably elevated, and production of autoantibodies was detected in lyn-\/- mice. Histological study showed splenomegaly and enlargement of lymph nodes that became evident with age in the mutant mice. The spleen contained significant number of plasma cells as well as unusual lymphoblast-like cells carrying Mac1 antigen and cytoplasmic IgM. These cells spontaneously secreted a large amount of IgM in vitro. Finally, significant number of lyn-\/- mice show glomerulonephritis, an indication of autoimmune disease. From these data, we conclude that Lyn plays a role in signal transduction for not only clonal expansion and terminal differentiation of peripheral B cells but also elimination of autoreactive B cells.","5308":"The B7-CD28\/CTLA-4 costimulatory pathway can provide a signal pivotal for T cell activation. Signaling through this pathway is complex due to the presence of two B7 family members, B7-1 and B7-2, and two counterreceptors, CD28 and CTLA-4. Studies with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have suggested both positive and negative roles for CTLA-4 in T cell activation. To elucidate the in vivo function of CTLA-4, we generated CTLA-4-deficient mice. These mice rapidly develop lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration and tissue destruction, with particularly severe myocarditis and pancreatitis, and die by 3-4 weeks of age. The phenotype of the CTLA-4-deficient mouse strain is supported by studies that have suggested a negative role for CTLA-4 in T cell activation. The severe phenotype of mice lacking CTLA-4 implies a critical role for CTLA-4 in down-regulating T cell activation and maintaining immunologic homeostasis. In the absence of CTLA-4, peripheral T cells are activated, can spontaneously proliferate, and may mediate lethal tissue injury.","5309":"","5310":"Interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) expression occurs at specific stages of early T and B lymphocyte development and is induced upon activation of mature lymphocytes. Young mice that lack IL-2R alpha have phenotypically normal development of T and B cells. However, as adults, these mice develop massive enlargement of peripheral lymphoid organs associated with polyclonal T and B cell expansion, which, for T cells, is correlated with impaired activation-induced cell death in vivo. Older IL-2R alpha-deficient mice also develop autoimmune disorders, including hemolytic anemia and inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, IL-2R alpha is essential for regulation of both the size and content of the peripheral lymphoid compartment, probably by influencing the balance between clonal expansion and cell death following lymphocyte activation.","5311":"The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo site of autoantibody production in normal and autoimmune-prone mice. B cells were identified in tissue sections with IgM- and IgG2a-specific riboprobes that readily distinguished resting cells from antibody-forming cells (AFC). In normal mice, the few identifiable IgG2a-secreting cells were found in the red pulp. By contrast, in Ipr mice exceedingly high numbers of IgG2a and autoantibody-producing cells were found deep within the T cell-rich periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS). This unusual anatomic location of autoantibody-secreting B cells is unique to Fas dysregulated strains, since IgG2-producing cells in MRL\/+ and (SWR x NZB)F1 mice were found predominantly in the red pulp or outer PALS, similar to normal mice. Furthermore, analysis of spleens from Ipr and non-Ipr anti-DNA immunoglobulin transgenic mice revealed dramatic accumulation of Tg+ cells in the inner PALS only in Ipr mice. These data suggest that in the absence of Fas, autoreactive B cells accumulate in T cell-rich zones, and this anatomic feature may contribute to autoantibody production.","5312":"Human V gamma 2V delta 2+ T cells recognize mycobacterial nonpeptide antigens, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and their synthetic analogs, such as monoethyl phosphate, through a TCR-dependent process. Here, we examine the presentation of these antigens. V gamma 2V delta 2+ T cells recognized secreted prenyl pyrophosphate antigens in the absence of other accessory cells but, under such conditions, required T cell-T cell contact. Recognition required neither the expression of classical MHC class I, MHC class II, or CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c molecules, nor MHC class I or class II peptide loading pathways. Fixed accessory cells also presented the prenyl pyrophosphate antigens to gamma delta T cells. Thus, in contrast with the presentation of conventional peptide antigens, protein antigens, and superantigens to alpha beta T cells, prenyl pyrophosphate antigens are presented to gamma delta T cells through a novel extracellular pathway that does not require antigen uptake, antigen processing, or MHC class I or class II expression. This pathway allows for the rapid recognition of bacteria by gamma delta T cells and suggests that gamma delta T cells play a role in the early response to bacterial infection.","5313":"Mannose-binding protein (MBP), C1q, the recognition component of the classical complement pathway, and pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) are members of a family of molecules containing a collagen-like sequence contiguous with a noncollagen-like sequence, and usually having the properties of a lectin. C1q and SP-A have been shown to enhance monocyte FcR- and CR1-mediated phagocytosis, suggesting that the common structural features of the collagen-like domains may provide a basis for this immunologically important function. Results presented here demonstrate that MBP also enhanced FcR-mediated phagocytosis by both monocytes and macrophages, and stimulated CR1-mediated phagocytosis in human culture-derived macrophages and in phorbol ester-activated monocytes. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a 126,000 M(r) cell surface protein and inhibits C1q-enhanced phagocytosis, inhibited the MBP-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis. Thus, the receptors that mediate the enhancement of phagocytosis by MBP and C1q share at least one critical functional component, the 126,000 M(r) ClqRP.","5314":"Type 1 interferons alpha and beta are found to be potent inhibitors of IL-7-induced growth of early B lineage cells, while having no effect on cell growth induced by IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, or autogenous factors. The combination of IL-7 and interferons alpha\/beta induces bcl-2 down-regulation and cell death by apoptosis. These conclusions were derived initially from experiments employing exogenous cytokines, but functional type 1 interferons are also shown to be produced by resident bone marrow macrophages. As physiological modulators of IL-7-driven proliferation and cell survival, interferons alpha\/beta may cooperate with other homeostatic factors to maintain the balanced production of normal B lineage cells.","5315":"The early stages of lymphoid cell formation were studied by testing the differentiative potential of phenotypically defined subsets of CD34+ bone marrow cells. A subpopulation of CD34+ Lin- CD45RA+ cells expressing CD10 was isolated by flow cytometry. Such cells are CD38+, HLA-DR+, do not express significant levels of Thy-1 and c-kit, lack erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic potential, and give rise only to lymphoid T, B, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells (DC) in kinetics and titration experiments. Limiting dilution analysis demonstrates the existence of multipotential B\/NK\/DC progenitor clones in the CD34hi Lin-CD10+ adult bone marrow cell population. Thus, nonprimitive progenitors for lymphoid cells and for DCs can be distinct from those of myeloid, megakaryocytic, and erythroid cells, implying that the DC lineage is developmentally more closely related to the lymphoid lineage than to the myeloid lineage. This study provides new insights into the organization and development of the human lympho-hematopoietic system.","5316":"We report a detailed analysis of TCR V alpha and V beta chain expression on immature versus mature thymocytes of normal, TCR beta-transgenic, and TCR alpha-hemizygous mice. Chain pairing between TCR V alpha and V beta chains is random on immature thymocytes, but individual chain pairs are selected in mature thymocytes. This indicates that V alpha-V beta chain pairing preferences are determined during thymic selection, and not as a result of structural constraints. Dual V alpha chain expression is found frequently on immature, but not mature thymocytes. It is not found in TCR alpha-hemizygous mice, showing that cell surface expression of dual alpha chains is caused by lack of allelic exclusion in immature thymocytes. Down-regulation of one of the alpha chains occurs concurrently with differentiation from TCRlo, CD69- to TCRhi, CD69+ phenotype, suggesting that it is associated with positive selection of the functional TCR.","5317":"Fetal thymic and adult epithelial V gamma 3+ and V gamma 4+ T cells express gamma delta antigen receptors (TCR) with invariant junctions lacking N nucleotides. Using transgenic recombination substrates, we show that di- or trinucleotide repeats, either in the coding region or in P elements, have strong effects on the site of recombination. In other mice bearing a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) transgene under the control of the CD2 promoter, we found that the frequency of canonical junctions was markedly reduced with a concomitant increase in in-frame noncanonical junctions with N nucleotides. Together, our results show that short homology repeats direct the site of rearrangement and thus play a critical role in the generation of gamma delta T cell receptor canonical junctions. Increased TdT activity in V gamma 3+ T cells has a inhibitory effect on junctional homogeneity in these cells.","5318":"The origin of autoreactive CD4-CD8- T cells is largely unknown. In TCR transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the cognate class I MHC antigen, CD4-CD8- T cells differed depending on characteristics of Tg-TCR\/antigen interaction. Tg-TCR\/CD3lo CD4-CD8- T cells expressing the NK1.1 marker were observed only for a Tg-TCR whose stimulation by antigen was independent of CD8. Unlike normal T cells, which have essentially TCR-associated zeta homodimers, these cells had a high proportion of TCR-associated zeta-Fc epsilon RI gamma heterodimers. They were also characterized by an unusually high content of Fc epsilon RI gamma mRNA and low content of mRNA encoding CD3 epsilon, CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, and zeta. Based on their phenotype and selection requirements, it is proposed that CD4-CD8- thymic precursor cells can be driven along the CD4-CD8-NK1.1+ pathway following coreceptor-independent TCR signaling at an intrathymic stage when Fc epsilon RI gamma and CD3 components are coexpressed.","5319":"CD28 costimulatory signals are required for lymphokine production and T cell proliferation. CD28 signaling recruits the intracellular proteins PI 3-kinase, ITK, and GRB-2\/SOS. PI 3-kinase and GRB-2\/SOS bind the CD28 cytoplasmic pYMNM motif via SH2 domains. We generated CD28 pYMNM mutants and found that Y191 mutation (Y191CD28F) disrupted both PI 3-kinase and GRB-2 binding, while M194 mutation (M194CD28C) disrupted only PI 3-kinase binding. Both mutants still bound ITK. We have assessed the ability of these selective mutants to support IL-2 production upon TCR zeta\/CD3 ligation in the presence of CHO-CD86 (B7-2) cells. Both Y191CD28F and M194CD28C mutants failed to generate IL-2. These data directly implicate PI 3-kinase in CD28-mediated costimulation leading to IL-2 secretion. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, induced cell apoptosis and as such was unsuitable for use in this study.","5320":"The immunodominant epitope of myelin basic protein, Ac1-9, is encephalitogenic in H-2u mice. We have previously demonstrated that this epitope displays low affinity for I-Au and have suggested that the avidity of T cell recognition in the thymus may be compromised, enabling autoreactive T cells to escape self-tolerance. We have addressed this hypothesis directly by constructing transgenic mice expressing an encephalitogenic T cell receptor (TCR). Parenteral administration of Ac1-9 had no discernable impact on developing thymocytes. In contrast, peptide analogs displaying far higher affinity for I-Au, provoked deletion of CD4+ CD8+ cells and transient down-regulation of the TCR by mature CD4+ CD8- thymocytes. The use of analogs of intermediate affinity permitted a margin of error to be defined for the induction of tolerance and confirmed that the affinity of Ac1-9 lies well below the critical threshold.","5321":"In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced with myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) peptide 139-151, we have previously shown that the disease is mediated by Th1 cells, which recognize tryptophan 144 as the primary TCR contact point. Here we describe an altered peptide ligand (APL), generated by a single amino acid substitution (tryptophan to glutamine) at position 144 (Q144), which inhibits the development of EAE induced with the native PLP 139-151 peptide (W144). We show that the APL induces T cells that are cross-reactive with the native peptide and that these cells produce Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) and Th0 (IFN gamma and IL-10) cytokines. Adoptive transfer of T cell lines generated with the APL confer protection from EAE. These data show that changing a single amino acid in an antigenic peptide can significantly influence T cell differentiation and suggest that immune deviation may be one of the mechanisms by which APLs can inhibit an autoimmune disease.","5322":"We used a \"hit and run\" gene targeting strategy to generate mice expressing only the p31 isoform of the conserved invariant (Ii) chain associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Spleen cells from these mice appear indistinguishable from wild type with respect to class II subunit assembly, transport, peptide acquisition, surface expression, and the ability to present intact protein antigens. Moreover, these mutant mice have normal numbers of thymic and peripheral CD4+ T cells, and intact CD4+ T-dependent proliferative responses towards a soluble antigen. In short, MHC class II expression and function are surprisingly unaffected in mice lacking p41 invariant chain, implying that the p31 and p41 isoforms may be functionally redundant in the intact animal.","5323":"MHC class II molecules associate with invariant chain (li) during biosynthesis. If facilitates folding of class II molecules, interferes with their association with peptides, and is involved in their transport. The murine Ii gene encodes two chains, p31 and p41. The role of these isoforms has been studied in vitro only in inappropriate antigen-presenting cells. To circumvent this problem, we have generated invariant chain-deficient mice (delta Ii), which express exclusively the p31 and p41 isoforms. Low level expression of p31 or p41 is not sufficient for rescuing high levels of cell surface class II expression. However, low levels of the typical compact dimer conformation indicative of tight peptide binding are observed. Thus, both isoforms participate in class II folding and assembly. Furthermore, p31 and p41 retrieve the CD4+ T cell population, which is reduced in the (delta Ii) mice. Moreover, the immune response to protein antigen is restored by both isoforms.","5324":"Invariant chain (Ii)-negative mice exhibit defects in MHC class II assembly and transport that results in reduced levels of surface class II, altered antigen presentation, and inefficient positive selection of CD4+ T cells. Many CD4+ T cells that do mature in Ii-negative mice express a cell surface phenotype consistent with aberrant positive selection or peripheral activation. Reconstitution of these mice with low levels of either the p31 or p41 form of Ii does not restore transport of the bulk of class II or class II surface expression, but surprisingly does restore positive selection as measured by numbers and surface phenotype of CD4+ T cells. Thus, an Ii-dependent process, independent of effects on class II surface density, appears to be required for normal positive selection of CD4+ T cells.","5325":"Class II-mediated signals play potential roles in B cell activation and antigen presentation. The regions of the class II molecule participating in B cell signaling are incompletely defined. Our prior analysis of structural requirements of the cytoplasmic domain of A beta revealed that only the eight membrane-proximal residues are required for signaling. Here, we report that the sequence and position of two of these are critical, and present direct evidence that the A beta transmembrane domain is also involved in signaling, via a pathway distinct from the cytoplasmic domain. These results demonstrate that specific regions in both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the class II molecule have distinct signaling functions.","5326":"The ability of the B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) to enhance MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation was ascribed to mig-associated Ig alpha\/Ig beta heterodimers. The relative role of Ig alpha and Ig beta subunits in antigen presentation was investigated by fusing their cytoplasmic tails to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Fc receptors. Ig alpha and Ig beta chimera mediate antigen internalization and increase the efficiency of antigen presentation, but they drive antigens to different endosomal compartments. Furthermore, antigens internalized by either chimera are degraded and presented with different kinetics. The cytoplasmic tail of Ig alpha targets antigen towards a major population of newly synthesized MHC class II located in class II-rich compartments. In contrast, Ig beta targets antigen towards a minor population of recycling MHC class II molecules, located in transferrin receptor-containing endosomes. Altogether, our data indicate that the composition of BCR could be therefore an important way to modulate the immune response.","5327":"We have established a model system for analyzing the induction of self-tolerance among mature peripheral T cells in V beta 5 TCR Tg mice. Both CD4+V beta 5+ and CD8+ V beta 5+ cells undergo a superantigen-driven chronic deletion in the periphery of I-E mice. Prior to their disappearance, CD4+ transgene-expressing cells are activated and then rendered anergic to further stimulation through their TCRs. This scenario differs strikingly in the CD8+ cellular compartment, which is characterized by a distinct population of CD8loV beta 5lo cells localized to the blood and spleen. CD8lo cells are small, express the surface phenotype of memory cells, and rapidly incorporate BrdU in vivo. The kinetics of their appearance and disappearance in adult thymectomized mice, the rapid chasing of BrdU from labeled cells, and their in vivo cortisone sensitivity all suggest CD8lo cells are slated for deletion. Furthermore, their functional incompetence can be documented in vitro in the absence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Thus, we have identified an intermediate population of T cells targeted for peripheral deletion that, although functionally compromised, has not yet undergone programmed cell death.","5328":"To investigate the role of the receptor-type tyrosine kinase, c-kit and its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) in T cell development, we analyzed c-kit (W\/W) and SCF (SI\/SI) deficient mice. We also engrafted wild-type or SCF-deficient fetal thymi onto wild-type recipient mice and analyzed the rate of proliferation by in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The results show that the most immature thymocyte compartment defined as CD3-CD4-CD8- is significantly reduced in SI\/SI grafts and W\/W thymi compared with wild-type counterparts. Also, the expansion rate of these immature thymocytes in SI\/SI graft is reduced by -50%. These experiments provide direct evidence for an important role for c-kit-SCF interactions in expansion of very early thymocytes.","5329":"Mutations in the gene encoding the protein tyrosine kinase Btk are associated with the human B cell immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). In the mouse, a point mutation in the Btk pleckstrin homology domain segregates with a milder X-linked immunodeficiency (xid). To assess the importance of Btk function in murine lymphopoiesis, we generated multiple embryonic stem cell clones bearing a targeted disruption of the btk gene and examined their potential to produce lymphocytes in both C57BL\/6 and RAG2-\/- host chimeric animals. These mice provide a complementary set of in vivo competition assays that formally establish the genetic basis for the xid phenotype. Although the null mutation yields a phenotype quite similar to that of xid, it also compromises expansion of B cell precursors. Our results suggest that the murine and human consequences of Btk deficiency differ only quantitatively, and represent the same disease process.","5330":"Mutations in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene have been linked to severe early B cell developmental blocks in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and to milder B cell activation deficiencies in murine X-linked immune deficiency (Xid). To elucidate unequivocally potential Btk functions in mice, we generated mutations in embryonic stem cells, which eliminated the ability to encode Btk pleckstrin homology or kinase domains, and assayed their effects by RAG2-deficient blastocyst complementation or introduction into the germline. Both mutations block expression of Btk protein and lead to reduced numbers of mature conventional B cells, severe B1 cell deficiency, serum IgM and IgG3 deficiency, and defective responses in vitro to various B cell activators and in vivo to immunization with thymus-independent type II antigens. These results prove that lack of Btk function results in an Xid phenotype and further suggest a differential requirement for Btk during the early stages of murine versus human B lymphocyte development.","5331":"The transcription factor Nur77, an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is highly expressed during T cell receptor-signaled apoptosis, suggesting a possible role for Nur77 in negative selection. We examined this by generating two sets of transgenic mice. In one set of mice, a dominant-negative Nur77 mutant is constitutively expressed and the other in which wild-type Nur77 protein is constitutively expressed in developing thymocytes. We report that inhibition of endogenous Nur77 by the dominant-negative mutant perturbed T cell development and inhibited antigen-induced negative selection in F5T cell receptor transgenic mice. Constitutive expression of wild-type Nur77 protein induced apoptosis in developing thymocytes, resulting in a decreased number of thymocytes and mature T cells. Together, these data support a role for Nur77 in the downstream signaling events in antigen-induced negative selection.","5332":"","5333":"","5334":"CD30 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, preferentially expressed by T cells producing type 2 helper (Th2) cytokines, whose ligand (CD30L) has been identified on B cells, activated macrophages, and a subset of activated T cells. We show here that cross-linking CD30 with an agonistic CD30-specific monoclonal antibody, as well as with CD30L+ CD8+ T cell clones or CD30L+ B cells, enhanced HIV replication in CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected individuals, and such a potentiating effect was inhibited by anti-CD30L antibody. The anti-CD30L antibody also exerted a suppressive effect on spontaneous HIV replication occurring in lymph node cells from an HIV-sero-positive patient, showing CD30L expression by both B and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Thus, CD30 triggering by CD30L-expressing cells may plan an important role in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4+ T cells.","5335":"Calcium and calcium-binding proteins play important roles in the signaling cascade leading from the initial engagement of TCRs on T cells to the fully activated state. To undertake a molecular dissection of this cascade, we first isolated a Jurkat T cell line derivative containing the NF-AT promoter element driving transcription of the diphtheria toxin A chain gene (dipA), resulting in rapid cell death. Selecting viable cells that fail to activate NF-AT-dependent transcription, we isolated two independent cell lines possessing defects in capacitative Ca2+ entry. NF-AT-dependent transcription can be restored in these cells by expression of a constitutively active calcineurin, but not overexpression of the Ca2+ regulatory protein CAML, which can normally replace the Ca2+ signal. The defect in these cell lines probably lies between CAML and calcineurin in the T cell activation cascade.","5336":"The Ets and AP-1 families of transcription factors bind distinct DNA elements and subserve diverse functions in multiple lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell types. Functionally important Ets and AP-1 binding sites have been identified in a large number of enhancer elements, suggesting important cooperative interactions between these two families of transcription factors. In this report, we have demonstrated a direct physical interaction between Ets and AP-1 proteins both in vitro and in activated human T cells. This interaction is mediated by the binding of the basic domain of Jun to the Ets domain of Ets proteins. Jun, in association with Ets, is capable of interacting with Fos family members to form a trimolecular protein complex. The physical association between Ets-1 and AP-1 proteins is required for the transcriptional activity of enhancer elements containing adjacent Ets and AP-1 binding sites. We conclude that direct physical interactions between Ets and AP-1 transcription factors play an important role in regulating mammalian gene expression.","5337":"We studied the extent of functional linkage between CD3 sigma and p56lck in pre-TCR-dependent thymocyte development. Differentiation of DN to DP cells was examined by treatment of RAG2\/CD3 sigma and RAG1\/p56lck double-deficient mice with anti-CD3 epsilon antibodies. The results suggest that CD3 sigma has no specific role in this maturation step, but may be important for amplification of signaling through the pre-TCR. In contrast, p56lck is the main protein tyrosine kinase associated with signaling through the pre-TCR-CD3 complex. In DP thymocytes, the Ca2+ response to anti-CD3 epsilon was totally abolished in CD3 sigma-I-but only reduced in p56lck-I-mice, and in vivo responses to anti-CD3 epsilon differed from one another. Thus, CD3 sigma and p56lck are functionally not tightly associated and their deficiencies cause distinct developmental defects.","5338":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules bind antigenic peptides rapidly after biosynthesis in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). By contrast, the rate of peptide binding to purified class II molecules is remarkably slow. We find that purified HLA-DR molecules bind peptides rapidly in the presence but not the absence of HLA-DM, a recently identified heterodimer required for efficient antigen processing. The same effect is seen with immunoprecipitated DM, suggesting that DM interacts directly with DR. Class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP) are selectively and rapidly released from DR during incubation with DM at pH 5. We conclude that DM is a cofactor that enhances peptide binding to DR molecules through a mechanism involving peptide exchange.","5339":"We used surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of a set of soluble mouse I-E class II major histocompatibility molecules, each occupied by a different single peptide, to the staphylococcal enterotoxin superantigens, SEA and SEB. The rates of association and dissociation to SEA varied greatly depending on the I-E-bound peptide. By contrast, binding to SEB yielded fast association and dissociation rates, which were relatively peptide independent. The results also indicated nonoverlapping binding sites for SEB and SEA on class II and raised the possibility of enhanced SAg presentation to T cells by cross-linking of cell surface class II.","5340":"An immature v-abl-transformed mast cell line (V3-MC) was derived from a mouse that developed systemic mastocytosis after transplantation of v-abl-infected bone marrow cells. V3-MCs injected intravenously into adult BALB\/c mice infiltrated the liver, spleen, and intestine by day 6 and underwent progressive differentiation and maturation, eventually resembling indigenous mast cells. In terms of their protease content, the V3-MCs that localized in the liver and spleen differed from those in the intestine, and both differed from the cultured V3-MCs. The acquired expression of certain proteases and the loss of expression of other proteases in these tissue V3-MCs defines particular phenotypes and indicates that the differentiation and maturation of mast cell-committed progenitor cells are primarily regulated by factors in the different tissue microenvironments.","5341":"","5342":"","5343":"Flavivirus infection of mammalian cells increases the cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, the recognition elements for cytotoxic T cells. Here, we show that the mechanism for flavivirus-induced up-regulation of class I MHC involves an increase in peptide supply to the endoplasmic reticulum. Flavivirus-mediated peptide supply for MHC class I assembly is independent of the peptide transporters for class I antigen presentation, since infection of class I MHC peptide transport-deficient cell lines with flaviviruses results in the cell surface expression of biologically functional class I MHC peptide complexes. The flavivirus-induced supply of antigenic peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum is not restricted to flavivirus-encoded peptides and independent of interferon. The data imply that peptide availability regulates surface expression of class I MHC restriction elements and suggests a mechanism for flavivirus-induced immunopathology.","5344":"We used gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to introduce an IL-1 beta null allele in mice. The IL-1 beta-deficient mice develop normally and are apparently healthy and fertile. The IL-1 beta null mice responded normally in models of contact and delayed-type hypersensitivity or following bacterial endotoxin LPS-induced inflammation. The IL-1 beta-deficient mice showed equivalent resistance to Listeria monocytogenes compared with wild-type controls. In contrast, when challenged with turpentine, which causes localized inflammation and tissue injury, the IL-1 beta mutant mice exhibited an impaired acute-phase inflammatory response and were completely resistant to fever development and anorexia. These results highlight a central role for IL-1 beta as a pyrogen and a mediator of the acute-phase response in a subset of inflammatory disease models, and support the notion that blocking the action of a single key cytokine can alter the course of specific immune and inflammatory responses.","5345":"T cell activation through the TCR can result in either cell proliferation or cell death. The role of costimulatory receptors in regulating T cell survival has not been defined. Here, we present data demonstrating that CD28 costimulation enhances the in vitro survival of activated T cells. One mechanism for this enhancement is the ability of CD28 costimulation to augment the production of IL-2, which acts as an extrinsic survival factor for T cells. In addition, CD28 costimulation augments the intrinsic ability of T cells to resist apoptosis. Although CD28 signal transduction had no effect on Bcl-2 expression, CD28 costimulation was found to augment the expression of Bcl-XL substantially. Transfection experiments demonstrated that this level of Bcl-XL could prevent T cell death in response to TCR cross-linking, Fas cross-linking, or IL-2 withdrawal. These data suggest that an important role of CD28 costimulation is to augment T cell survival during antigen activation.","5346":"Positive selection of functional CD8+ T cells expressing an MHC class I-restricted T cell receptor can be induced in fetal thymus organ culture by class I-binding peptides related to the antigenic peptide ligand. Peptides that act as antagonist or weak agonist\/antagonist ligands for mature T cells work efficiently in this regard. In the present study, we have investigated whether low concentrations of the original agonist peptide, or variants that still have a strong agonist activity can also mediate positive selection. The antigenic peptide did not induce positive selection at any concentration tested. A strong agonist variant was capable of stimulating the differentiation of TCRhi CD8+ cells, giving the appearance of phenotypic positive selection. However, these cells lacked biological function, since they could not proliferate in response to antigen. The most efficient positive selection resulted with ligands that did not activate mature T cells or stimulate negative selection.","5347":"To study the interaction of the TCR with its ligand, the complex of a MHC molecule and an antigenic peptide, we modified a TCR contact residue of a H-2Kd-restricted antigenic peptide with photoreactive 4-azidobenzoic acid. The photoreactive group was a critical component of the epitope recognized by CTL clones derived from mice immunized with such a peptide derivative. The majority of these clones expressed V beta 1-encoded beta chains that were paired with J alpha TA28-encoded alpha chains. For one of these TCR, the photoaffinity labeled sites were mapped on the alpha chain as a J alpha TA28-encoded tryptophan and on the beta chain as a residue of the C' strand of V beta 1. Molecular modeling of this TCR suggested the presence of a hydrophobic pocket that harbors this tryptophan as well as a tyrosine on the C' strand of V beta 1 between which the photoreactive side chain inserts. It is concluded that this avid binding principle may account for the preferential selection of V beta 1 and J alpha TA28-encoded TCR.","5348":"","5349":"Tg epsilon 26 mice display an arrest very early in T cell development that has a profound effect on the architecture of thymic stromal cells. We have recently demonstrated that transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells restores the thymic microenvironment of fetal but not adult Tg epsilon 26 mice. Here, we report that T cell-reconstituted adult Tg epsilon 26 mice develop a spontaneous wasting syndrome characterized by extensive inflammation of the colon, resembling human ulcerative colitis. Colitis in these animals was marked by substantial infiltration of the colon by activated thymus-derived CD4+ T cells. Importantly, bone marrow-transplanted Tg epsilon 26 mice previously engrafted with a fetal Tg epsilon 26 thymus did not develop colitis. These results suggest that T cells selected in an aberrant thymic microenvironment contain a population of cells able to induce severe colitis that can be prevented by T cells that have undergone normal thymic development.","5350":"Pathogenic self-reactive antibodies are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and contribute to both cytotoxic and immune complex-triggered inflammatory disorders, typified by rheumatic diseases, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Roles have been proposed for Fc receptors, complement, and complement receptors in the pathogenesis of these disorders, although the contribution of each to autoimmune injury is unclear. gamma chain-deficient mice lacking Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RIII are resistant to the development of experimental immune hemolytic anemia induced by polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse red blood cell IgG antibodies. This resistance is primarily a consequence of ineffective erythrophagocytosis, resulting from the lack of Fc gamma Rs on mononuclear phagocytes. Similarly, gamma chain-deficient mice are completely resistant to the development of experimental immune thrombocytopenia induced by mouse anti-platelet antibodies. These data suggest that Fc receptors play an integral role in the pathogenesis of type II hypersensitivity and suggest potential therapeutic benefits of Fc receptor blockade.","5351":"The flk2 receptor tyrosine kinase has been implicated in hematopoietic development. Mice deficient in flk2 were generated. Mutants developed into healthy adults with normal mature hematopoietic populations. However, they possessed specific deficiencies in primitive B lymphoid progenitors. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed a further deficiency in T cell and myeloid reconstitution by mutant stem cells. Mice deficient for both c-kit and flk2 exhibited a more severe phenotype characterized by large overall decreases in hematopoietic cell numbers, further reductions in the relative frequencies of lymphoid progenitors, and a postnatal lethality. Taken together, the data suggest that flk2 plays a role both in multipotent stem cells and in lymphoid differentiation.","5352":"MHC class I genes are potently repressed by HIV Tat, which transactivates the HIV LTR. Tat represses class I transcription by binding to complexes associated with a novel promoter element, consisting of Sp1-like DNA binding sites. Transcription by other Sp1-dependent promoters, such as MDR1 and the minimal SV40 promoters, is also repressed by Tat, whereas the human beta-actin promoter is neither activated by Sp1 nor repressed by Tat. Tat repression can be overcome by a strong enhancer element. Thus, the SV40 72 bp enhancer element confers protection from Tat-mediated repression on both the minimal SV40 promoter and the class I promoter. Surprisingly, Tat can activate the class I promoter in the presence of both the HIV TAR element and a strong upstream enhancer. These data demonstrate that Tat differentially affects Sp1-responsive promoters, depending on promoter architecture.","5353":"CD23 is expressed on a variety of haemopoietic cells and displays pleiotropic activities in vitro. We report that in addition to CD21 and IgE, CD23 interacts specifically with the CD11b and CD11c, the alpha chains of the beta 2 integrin adhesion molecule complexes CD11b-CD18 and CD11c-CD18, on monocytes. Full-length recombinant CD23 incorporated into fluorescent liposomes was shown to bind to COS cells transfected with cDNA encoding either CD11b-CD18 or CD11c-CD18 but not with CD11a-CD18. The interaction was specifically inhibited by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c, respectively, and by anti-CD23 MAbs. The functional significance of this ligand pairing was demonstrated by triggering CD11b and CD11c on monocytes with either recombinant CD23 or anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c MAbs to cause a marked increase in nitrite-oxidative products and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha). These CD23-mediated activities were decreased by Fab fragments of MAbs to CD11b, CD11c, and CD23. These results demonstrate that CD11b and CD11c are receptors for CD23 and that this novel ligand pairing regulates important activities of monocytes.","5354":"Cytokine and cytokine receptor gene knockout mice provide powerful experimental systems to characterize the functions of these molecules in resistance to infectious disease. Such mice may also provide unique models of immune deficiency to learn whether manipulation of the immune response can overcome the specific dysfunction. We demonstrate that resistance of IFN gamma gene knockout (GKO-\/-) mice to the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is severely impaired compared with wild-type mice. However, immunization of GKO-\/- mice with an attenuated L. monocytogenes strain generates antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses that can transfer immunity to naive hosts. Furthermore, vaccinated GKO-\/- mice themselves exhibit 20,000-fold increased resistance to challenge with virulent L. monocytogenes and this resistance appears to be CD8 T cell mediated. These studies demonstrate that vaccination-induced immunity can overcome the absence of a cytokine that is critical for resistance to acute infection.","5355":"","5356":"Circulating lymphocytes home to the mucosal lymphoid organs, Peyer's patches (PP), through high endothelial venules (HEV). In situ analyses revealed that transfused lymph node cells (LNCs) interact with PP-HEV in a series of overlapping adhesion events: L-selectin (CD62L) &gt; alpha 4 beta 7 initiates interaction, L-selectin and alpha 4 beta 7 both participate in rolling, and G alpha i-linked activation triggers arrest that requires both alpha 4 beta 7 and LFA-1. alpha 4 beta 7 dramatically reduces rolling velocity, and appears to be required for engagement of LFA-1. In contrast with resting LNC, preactivated LNC or alpha 4 beta 7hi lymphoma cells require only alpha 4 beta 7 for arrest in PP-HEV. The predominant PP-HEV ligand for alpha 4 beta 7 but also apparently for L-selectin is the mucosal addressin MAd-CAM-1. These results validate the concept of multimolecular adhesion\/decision cascades in physiologic lymphocyte-endothelial recognition, define a novel role for alpha 4 integrins as a \"bridge\" between selectin and beta 2 integrin-dependent events, and reemphasize the potential for direct adhesion through preactivated alpha 4 integrins alone.","5357":"We previously identified an HLA-B8+ donor, NW, whose lymphoblastoid cells failed to present a B8-restricted epitope from the influenza A nucleoprotein following viral infection, although added peptide could still be presented. The failure to present through HLA-B8 following viral infection appears to be specific for the NP epitope. Here, we report that donor NW makes an HLA-B2702-restricted influenza-specific CTL response to an epitope in the nucleoprotein that overlaps the B8-restricted epitope by 8 aa. Two mechanisms for the failure of this cell line to present the B8-restricted epitope following viral infection are investigated. One is that there is an antigen processing polymorphism specific to the NW cell line, so that there is either preferential generation or preferential transport of the B2702 epitope. The other is that B8 and B2702 compete for a common peptide fragment in the ER and this leads to suboptimal loading of HLA-B8.","5358":"CD19-deficient mice were generated to examine the role of CD19 in B cell growth regulation in vivo. Deletion of CD19 had no deleterious effects on the generation of B cells in the bone marrow, but there was a significant reduction in the number of B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues. B cells from CD19-deficient mice exhibited markedly decreased proliferative responses to mitogens, and serum immunoglobulin levels were also significantly decreased. In contrast, mice that overexpressed CD19 had significant defects in early B cell development in the bone marrow, augmented mitogenic responses, and increased serum immunoglobulin levels. These experiments indicate that CD19 functions to define signaling thresholds for cell surface receptors that regulate B lymphocyte selection, activation, and differentiation.","5359":"The propagation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been analyzed in mice defective for expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L). Mice with endogenous viral superantigen (SAG) delete T cells with cognate V beta independent of CD40L expression. Nevertheless, CD40L-mice do not show deletion of cognate T cells after being exposed to infectious MMTV and have greatly diminished viral replication. The response of CD40L- T cells to SAG in vitro is also impaired, but can be reconstituted by adding B cells activated by recombinant CD40L to express costimulatory molecules. Thus, direct CD40L-dependent B cell activation appears to be a critical step in the life cycle of MMTV. The initial step in SAG-dependent T cell activation, and hence the MMTV life cycle, may be mediated by non-B cells, because splenocytes from B cell-deficient SAG-transgenic mice are able to activate cognate T cells.","5360":"Latent and activated forms of Stat1 and Stat6 have been expressed and purified, enabling biochemical experiments relating to their functional activities. Stat1 bound to a phosphotyrosine peptide derived from the IFN gamma receptor with a KD of 50 nM, whereas Stat6 bound to an IL-4 receptor peptide with a KD of 300 nM. Stat-receptor peptide interactions were specific and dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Activated forms of Stat1 and Stat6 were used to select their optimal DNA binding sites. Stat1 selected a recognition site having dyad half-sites separated by 3 bp. Stat6 selected a recognition site composed of the same dyad half-sites, yet separated by 4 bp. Chimeric Stat1-Stat6 recombinants were expressed, purified, and assayed for receptor coupling and DNA binding specificity. Such studies led to the identification of polypeptide domains that specify these activities. These observations provide a framework for understanding how different cytokines elicit distinctive patterns of gene expression.","5361":"Herein, we demonstrate that purified Stat1 binds to its tyrosine-phosphorylated docking site on the IFN gamma receptor alpha chain in a direct, specific, and reversible manner. Using surface plasmon resonance, we determine the affinity (KD = 137 nM) and specificity of the interaction and define the minimum affinity needed for receptor-mediated Stat1 activation. In addition, we quantitate the relative ability of purified Stat1 to interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated binding sites on other Stat proteins. Finally, we describe experiments that imply that the unidirectional release of activated Stat1 from the IFN gamma receptor reflects the preference of free tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 monomers to form high avidity reciprocal homodimers rather than reassociating with the receptor binding site. Our results demonstrate that IFN gamma-induced Stat1 activation is an ordered and affinity-driven process and we propose that this process may serve as a paradigm for Stat activation by other cytokine receptors.","5362":"Developmental-commitment to Th1 or Th2 responses critically influences host susceptibility to particular pathogens. We describe a novel mechanism governing stable commitment to Th2 differentiation. Naive T cells develop strongly polarized Th1 and Th2 profiles by 7 days after activation. However, commitment of these developing cells differs substantially. Although IL-4 reverses early Th1 differentiation, IL-12 cannot reverse early Th2 differentiation. Th1 reversibility results from maintenance of IL-4 signal transduction, whereas Th2 commitment results from rapid loss of IL-12 signaling. The IL-12 signaling defect in Th2 cells results in failure to phosphorylate Jak2, Stat3, and Stat4. Since Th2 cells express the mRNA for the cloned murine IL-12 receptor beta subunit, the signaling defect may involve expression or function of unidentified receptor components. The rapid extinction of IL-12 signaling in Th2 cells provides a demonstration of a mechanism for the stable commitment to a T helper phenotype.","5363":"The function of CD3 zeta in the assembly and transport of the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex was analyzed in normal T cells. The zeta chain, but not other chains in the surface TCR complex, rapidly exchanged with newly synthesized zeta. Because zeta was expressed independently from the complex, the TCR complex may be transported to the surface along the zeta turnover pathway by association with zeta. These data suggest the dynamic nature of zeta metabolism and provide the evidence that a single component in a multisubunit receptor exhibits independent metabolism from the rest of the complex.","5364":"The first constant domain (CH1) of immunoglobulin heavy (H) chains is essential for BiP-mediated retention of unassembled H chains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we demonstrated that both wild-type and a mutant gamma chain lacking the CH1 domain bind BiP when they are reduced in vivo. However, only oxidized mutant H chain dimers are released from BiP interaction, whereas oxidized wild-type gamma chain dimers still bind BiP. In light (L) chain-producing cells, some of the mutant H chains accumulate with L chains in ER-derived vesicles and some are secreted as IgG. Furthermore, only half of the secreted antibodies bind antigen. We found the same with a mutant gamma chain, in which the CH1 domain was replaced by a CH3 domain. Therefore, we propose that BiP interaction with incompletely folded CH1 domains is required to mediate correct assembly of H and L chains.","5365":"Using a quantitative multiprobe Southern blot analysis, we demonstrate the surprising result that a significant proportion of alpha beta T cells and thymocytes retain T cell receptor delta locus sequences. A substantial portion of the retained delta locus is in a fully V-to-D-to-J rearranged configuration and 20% of these delta rearrangements are functional, significantly less than the 33% predicted for random gene rearrangements. Our observations are in conflict with the idea that alpha beta and gamma delta T cells derive from distinct precursors and suggest that commitment of a common precursor to the gamma delta lineage depends upon expression of a gamma delta T cell receptor. We propose that the intrathymic T cell lineage decision is determined by a competition between the production of functional gamma delta and beta-pre-T cell receptor complexes.","5366":"The inability of scid pro-B cells to progress to the pre-B and B cell stages is believed to be caused by a defective recombinase activity that fails to resolve chromosomal breaks resulting from attempted V(D)J recombination. In support of this model, we report that certain immunoglobulin transgenes, specifically those which strongly inhibit endogenous VH-to-DJH and V kappa-to-J kappa rearrangement in wild-type mice, allow scid pro-B cells to progress to the pre-B and B cell stages. This rescue of scid B cell differentiation is associated with a dramatic reduction in expression of the recombination activation genes, RAG1 and RAG2, and with reduced transcription of the kappa locus.","5367":"The contributions of germline-encoded T cell receptor segments and of HLA-DR polymorphisms in shaping the repertoire of human CD4+ CD45RO- T cells were investigated in healthy unrelated individuals and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, an HLA-DRB1 04-associated disease. By comparing frequencies of V beta-J beta combinations, healthy individuals segregated into independent clusters, which strongly correlated with the HLA-DRB1 allele expression. The repertoire fingerprint imposed by the HLA-DRB1 alleles involved only a selected group of J beta elements, whereas the distribution of the other J beta segments was HLA independent. The HLA-restricted J beta elements are characterized by a Gly-Pro-Gly sequence within the conserved Phe-Gly-X-Gly motif, which induces rigidity in an otherwise more flexible protein backbone. The T cell receptor repertoire distinguished patients with RA from healthy HLA-DR-matched individuals, suggesting that patients share a selection mechanism that significantly distorts the composition of the T cell receptor repertoire.","5368":"Mice transgenic for SV40 T antigen (Tag) under control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP) develop two alternative immunological phenotypes: tolerance or autoimmunity towards Tag. We utilized the T cell receptor (TCR) genes expressed in a Tag-specific CD4+ cell from an autoimmune RIP-Tag mouse to generate two lines of TCR transgenic mice in which either 10% or 90% of peripheral T cells express the transgenic TCR. When cross-bred to the tolerant RIP1-Tag2 line, mice from the low frequency TCR line showed partial deletion of peripheral Tag-specific T cells and nonresponsiveness of those that remained. In contrast, crossbred mice in which transgenic T cells comprised a majority of the T cell population were nontolerant both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, tolerization of CD4+ T cells specific for a rare self-antigen may fail if too many autoreactive T cells develop.","5369":"The T cell receptor (TCR) can interact with a spectrum of peptides as part of its ligand, including the immunogenic peptide, variants of this peptide,and apparently unrelated peptides. The basis of this broad specificity for ligand was investigated by substitution analysis of a peptide antigen and functional testing using a B cell apoptosis assay. A peptide containing as few as 1 aa in common with this peptide could stimulate a specific T cell response. Two endogenous ligands, an agonist and a partial agonist, were readily identified from a search of the SwissProt database, indicating that multiple endogenous ligands likely exist for a given T cell. These findings strongly support the concept that one TCR has the ability to interact productively with multiple different ligands, and provide evidence that such ligands exist in the endogenous peptide repertoire.","5370":"When B cells are deprived of signaling through CD40, they exhibit the ability to induce T cell tolerance. The in vivo administration of anti-gp39 and allogeneic B cells diminished the ability of mice to mount an allogeneic response. Tolerance induction was specific for the haplotype expressed on the allogeneic B cells. Selective allospecific unresponsiveness was induced in the CD8 and CD4 compartments by the administration of anti-gp39 and class II-deficient B cells or class I-deficient B cells, respectively. As predicted by studies with anti-gp39 treatment, diminished allospecific responsiveness was induced by the administration of B cells to mice genetically deficient in gp39. Taken together, these data are consistent with the premise that deprivation of CD40 signaling engenders B cells with enhanced tolerogenicity. These studies provide insights into the tolerogenic capacity of resting B cells and outlines a practical approach to exploit this function.","5371":"CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, is expressed constitutively on the surface of the human T cell line ACH-2, which is chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV)-1. We demonstrate that cross-linking CD30 with an anti-CD30-specific monoclonal antibody, which mimics the described biological activities of the CD30 ligand (CD30L), results in HIV expression. CD30 cross-linking does not alter proliferation of ACH-2 cells and the induction of HIV expression is not mediated by endogenous TNF alpha\/beta. Furthermore, cross-linking of CD30 leads to NF-kappa B activation and enhanced HIV transcription. Thus, CD30-CD30L interactions mediate the induction of HIV expression by a kappa B-dependent pathway that is independent of TNF. This mechanism may be important in the activation of HIV expression from latently infected CD4+ T cells, especially in lymphoid organs where cell to cell contact is conducive to receptor-ligand interactions.","5372":"Understanding the immunological mechanisms of protection and pathogenesis in tuberculosis remains problematic. We have examined the extent to which tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) contributes to this disease using murine models in which the action of TNF alpha is inhibited. TNF alpha was neutralized in vivo by monoclonal antibody; in addition, a mouse strain with a disruption in the gene for the 55 kDa TNF receptor was used. The data from both models established that TNF alpha and the 55 kDa TNF receptor are essential for protection against tuberculosis in mice, and for reactive nitrogen production by macrophages early in infection. Granulomas were formed in equal numbers in control and experimental mice, but necrosis was observed only in mice deficient in TNF alpha or TNF receptor. TNF alpha and the 55 kDa TNF receptor are necessary conditions for protection against murine M. tuberculosis infection, but are not solely responsible for the tissue damage observed.","5373":"","5374":"Type II major histocompatibility complex combined immune deficiency (type II MHC CID or bare lymphocyte syndrome) is a congenital immunodeficiency disease characterized by absent MHC class II expression. Four distinct complementation groups have been identified. Recently, the defective gene in group II type II MHC CID has been isolated and termed CIITA. Here, we demonstrate that CIITA is an MHC class II gene-specific transcription activator. The transcription activation function is provided by the N-terminal acidic domain (amino acids 26-137), which is experimentally exchangeable with a heterologous viral transcription-activating domain. The specificity of CIITA for three major MHC class II genes, DR, DQ and DP, is mediated by its remaining C-terminal residues (amino acids 317-1130). The transactivation of multiple cis elements, especially S and X2, of the DR alpha proximal promoter in group II CID cells is CIITA dependent. Since CIITA overexpression in normal cells did not increase class II expression, we propose that initiation of CIITA expression serves as the on-off switch, while availability of downstream interactor(s) limits transcription.","5375":"CIITA, a gene that can complement a transcriptional mutation of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, was tested for its ability to function as a coactivator, CIITA cDNA clones isolated showed alternative RNA splicing, but only one splice site combination was able to restore class II MHC gene expression. DNA-mediated transfection experiments showed that CIITA directs its activity through the X box element; the presence of CIITA leads to the formation of a higher order complex at the X box region; and CIITA contains a potent activation domain. These findings support the hypothesis that CIITA directly interacts with the MHC class II-specific transcription factors and is required for expression.","5376":"OX40 is a member of the TNF\/NGF-receptor family expressed on activated T cells, whose ligand is found on activated T and B cells. In the present study, we show that cross-linking of OX40L on CD40L-stimulated B cells, alpha IgD dextran-stimulated B cells, or both results in a significantly enhanced proliferative response with no change in the cell survival rate. Furthermore, OX40 stimulation increases immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA levels and immunoglobulin secretion, which could not be blocked by anti-cytokine antibodies. In additional molecular studies, we show that OX40L cross-linking results in the down-regulation of the transcription factor BSAP. This, in turn, leads to a change in the in vivo binding pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene 3' alpha enhancer, suggesting its activation. This effect may thus be one mechanism for OX40-induced increase in immunoglobulin secretion. In conclusion, our data suggest that the OX40-OX40L interaction is a novel pathway in T cell-dependent B cell proliferation and differentiation.","5377":"The transcription factor NF-AT plays an essential role in the inducible transcription of several cytokine genes during T cell activation. The distal NF-AT site of the murine IL-2 promoter binds both NF-AT and AP-1 proteins, and thus represents a composite regulatory site that integrates Ca(2+)- and PKC-dependent signaling pathways in T cell activation. However, the individual contributions of the NF-AT and AP-1 components to promoter activity via this composite site have not been resolved, owing to the absence of a clearly defined AP-1 binding site, which, when mutated abolishes AP-1 binding. We describe here an apparently analogous NF-AT\/AP-1 composite site in the murine IL-4 promoter, which can be mutated to selectively block the recruitment of each component. We show that the cooperative and coordinate involvement of both NF-AT and AP-1 is necessary for full activity of the NF-AT\/AP-1 composite site, and, ultimately, the entire IL-4 promoter.","5378":"The activation of cytokine genes in response to antigenic stimulation of T cells is mediated by NF-AT proteins. Previous studies have identified two NF-AT proteins, NF-ATp and NF-ATc, that are homologous within a 290 aa domain distantly related to the Rel domain. We have isolated two additional members of this gene family, NF-AT3 and NF-AT4, which encode proteins 65% identical to the other NF-AT proteins within the Rel domain. The four NF-AT genes are transcribed in different sets of tissues that included many sites of expression outside the immune system. The Rel homology domain is sufficient for DNA recognition and cooperative binding interactions with AP-1. Although other members of the Rel family bind DNA as dimers, NF-AT proteins are monomers in solution or bound to DNA. Transfection assays indicate that each of the four NF-AT proteins can activate the IL-2 promoter in T cells.","5379":"Recognition of major histocompatibility class I molecules on target cells by natural killer (NK) cells confers selective protection from NK-mediated lysis. Cross-linking of the p58 NK receptor, involved in the recognition of HLA-C alleles, delivers a negative signal that prevents target cell lysis. Molecular cloning of the p58 NK receptor reported here revealed a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Five distinct p58 receptors, with sequence diversity in the immunoglobulin-related domains, were identified in a single individual. All NK clones tested expressed at least one p58 member. Three different types of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains exist, even among receptors with closely related extracellular domains. These data revealed a repertoire of NK cells with clonally distributed p58 receptors exhibiting diversity in both extracellular and intracellular domains.","5380":"","5381":"The functional necessity for two CD28 counterreceptors (B7-1 and B7-2) is presently unknown. B7-1 and B7-2 equivalently costimulate IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) production and IL-2 receptor alpha and gamma chain expression. B7-2 induces significantly more IL-4 production than B7-1, with the greatest difference seen in naive T cells. Repetitive costimulation of CD4+ CD45RA+ T cells with B7-2 results in moderate levels of both IL-4 and IL-2, whereas repetitive costimulation with B7-1 results in high levels of IL-2 and low levels of IL-4. Therefore, B7-1 and B7-2 costimulation mediate distinct outcomes, since B7-2 provides an initial signal to induce naive T cells to become IL-4 producers, thereby directing the immune response more towards Th0\/Th2, whereas B7-1 is a more neutral differentiative signal.","5382":"Multiple cell adhesion proteins are up-regulated in vascular endothelial cells in response to TNF alpha and other inflammatory cytokines. This increase in cell adhesion gene expression is thought to require the transcription factor NF-kappa B. Here, we show that peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the proteasome, a multicatalytic protease recently shown to be required for the activation of NF-kappa B, block TNF alpha induction of the leukocyte adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Striking functional consequences of this inhibition were observed in analyses of leukocyte-endothelial interactions under defined flow conditions. Lymphocyte attachment to TNF alpha-treated endothelial monolayers was totally blocked, while neutrophil attachment was partially reduced but transmigration was essentially prevented.","5383":"ZAP-70 and Syk are PTKs required for TCR and BCR function, respectively. Loss of the Syk PTK results in a nonfunctional BCR. We provide evidence here that ZAP-70 and Syk are functionally homologous in antigen receptor signaling by demonstrating that expression of ZAP-70 in Syk- B cells reconstitutes BCR function. Reconstitution required the presence of functional Src homology 2 (SH2) and catalytic domains of ZAP-70. Thus, drug targeting of a single SH2 domain within ZAP-70 should be sufficient to inhibit hematopoietic antigen receptor function. In addition, we demonstrate that both ZAP-70 and Syk can bind directly to the phosphorylated Ig alpha and Ig beta subunits with affinities comparable to their binding to the TCR CD3 epsilon subunit. These data suggest that ZAP-70 and Syk are comparable in their abilities to mediate hematopoietic antigen receptor signaling.","5384":"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase critical for B cell development and function. Mutations in BTK result in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) in mice. Using a random mutagenesis scheme, we isolated a gain-of-function mutant called BTK* whose expression drives growth of NIH 3T3 cells in soft agar. BTK* results from a single point mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, where a Glu is replaced by Lys at residue 41. BTK* shows an increase in phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and an increase in membrane targeting. Transforming activity requires kinase activity, a putative autophosphorylation site, and a functional PH domain. Mutation of the SH2 or SH3 domains did not affect the activity of BTK*. Expression of BTK* could also relieve IL-5 dependence of a B lineage cell line. These results show that transformation activation and regulation of BTK are critically dependent on the PH domain.","5385":"Differentiation of immature CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes into mature CD4+ CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells requires that synthesis of one or the other coreceptor molecule be terminated, a process referred to as lineage commitment. The present study has utilized a novel coreceptor reexpression assay to identify lineage commitment in immature thymocytes and has found that the MHC recognition requirements for CD4 commitment and CD8 commitment fundamentally differ from one another. Remarkably, we found that thymocyte commitment to the CD8+ lineage requires MHC class I-dependent instructional signals, whereas thymocyte commitment to the CD4+ lineage is MHC independent and may occur by default. In addition, an unanticipated relationship between lineage commitment and surface phenotype has been identified. These results are incompatible with current concepts and require a new perspective on lineage commitment and positive selection, which we refer to as asymmetric commitment.","5386":"To determine whether CD3 epsilon and CD3 zeta proteins have unique roles in TCR-dependent functions, chimeric genes encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the human IL-2 receptor alpha chain (Tac) fused to a cytoplasmic domain of either the CD3 epsilon or CD3 zeta chain were introduced as transgenes into both normal and RAG2-deficient (RAG2-\/-) mice. Developmental arrest of T lineage cells at the CD4, CD8 double-negative stage in the transgenic RAG2-\/- thymus was released to the CD4, CD8 double-positive (DP) stage by in vivo cross-linking of TT epsilon or TT zeta with anti-Tac antibody. In TT epsilon + or TT zeta +, RAG2-\/- mice, in vitro cross-linking of TT epsilon and TT zeta induced DP thymocyte cell death and proliferation of mature single-positive T cells. Overall, no qualitative differences were observed between TT epsilon- and TT zeta-mediated functions, suggesting that different CD3 components deliver qualitatively similar signals in inducing TCR-dependent functions.","5387":"The present study has examined the molecular events leading to formation of alpha beta dimers in normal murine thymocytes and mature T cells. We demonstrate that TCR assembly proceeds by initial association of TCR alpha with CD3 delta epsilon proteins and by association of TCR beta with CD3 gamma epsilon proteins to form alpha delta epsilon and beta gamma epsilon trimers; these trimers then associate to form alpha delta epsilon-beta gamma epsilon complexes, within which alpha-beta disulfide bond formation occurs. We also show that TCR-associated protein (TRAP) associates uniquely with CD3 gamma epsilon pairs and that formation of beta gamma epsilon trimers occurs subsequent to TRAP dissociation. Importantly, we document that the assembly step that is quantitatively limiting in CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes is the initial association of TCR alpha with CD3 delta epsilon chains, which appears necessary to protect nascent TCR alpha proteins from accelerated degradation within the ER of immature thymocytes.","5388":"The products of V(D)J recombination are coding and signal joints. We show that the nucleotide composition of the coding ends affects V(D)J recombination. The presence of Ts at the 5' end of either the 12 mer or the 23 mer recombination signal sequence (RSS) greatly decreases coding and signal joint formation, and Ts at the 5' ends of both RSSs eliminate recombination, suggesting that a step during the initiation phase of the recombination is affected. A 5' T coding end can be rescued it the other end contains 5' G, C, or A, implying that synapsis may be required. Furthermore, the presence of As at the 5' end of the 12 mer, but not the 23 mer, RSS affects coding but not signal joint formation. This observation of asymmetric processing of coding ends suggests that different protein complexes are bound to the two RSSs, and become transferred to the aligned coding ends during processing.","5389":"Stimulation of T cells by retroviral and bacterial super-antigens is followed by specific T cell elimination, in contrast with stimulation of T cells by peptide, which is usually associated with clonal expansion. We show here that this differential response phenotype is apparent at the level of individual T cell clones following TCR ligation with peptide or MTV antigen. We exploited selective coupling of apoptosis to TCR ligation by MTV7 to examine some of the intracellular biochemical events that underlie this response. MTV-dependent activation resulting in apoptosis was associated with activation of phospholipase A2 and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. Inhibition of these biochemical events prevented both MTV-dependent activation and apoptosis without affecting the peptide-dependent response of the same T cell clones. These results indicate that clonal expansion or programmed cell death following TCR ligation may be consequences of distinct TCR-coupled signaling pathways.","5390":"To understand the molecular bases for cytokine redundancy and pleiotropy, we have compared the Stat proteins activated in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by cytokines with shared and distinct actions. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) rapidly activated Stat5 in fresh PBL, and Stat3 and Stat5 in preactivated PBL. IL-7 and IL-15 induced the same complexes as IL-2, a feature explained by the existence of similar tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-7R that can serve as docking sites for Stat proteins. IL-13 Induced the same complexes as IL-4, a finding explained by our studies implicating IL-4R as a shared component of the receptors. These studies demonstrate that a single cytokine can activate different combinations of Stat proteins under different physiological conditions, and also indicate two mechanisms by which distinct cytokines can activate the same Stat protein.","5391":"A key cytokine induced during the immune response is IL-2. Following T cell activation, the genes encoding IL-2 and the various chains of its receptor are transcriptionally induced. In turn, secreted IL-2 serves to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes. Several recent studies have implicated Jak kinases in the signaling pathway induced by IL-2. Following this lead, we set out to identify transcription factors induced in response to IL-2. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were observed to contain several IL-2-inducible DNA binding activities. Similar activities were also observed in a transformed human lymphocyte line, termed YT. We have purified these activities and found that the principal IL-2-inducible component bears significant relatedness to a prolactin-induced transcription factor first identified in sheep mammary gland tissue. We hypothesize that activation of this protein, designated hStat5, helps govern the biological effects of IL-2 during the immune response.","5392":"","5393":"We demonstrate that cognate peptide ligands altered at T cell receptor (TCR) contact residues and bound to class II major histocompatability complex can change the cytokine pattern of mature T cell clones. Myelin basic protein peptide 85-99-reactive Th0 T cell clones were stimulated with altered peptide ligands, which acted both as TCR antagonist and induced new mRNA synthesis and protein secretion of TGF-beta 1, while no longer inducing mRNA synthesis or protein secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN gamma. The modified peptides failed to induce a detectable calcium flux, p56lck activation, or thymidine incorporation, yet triggered nearly equal amounts of IL-4 secretion in the presence of ionomycin. Antigen-induced modulation of T cell cytokine secretion may be important in regulating the immune response.","5394":"Protein tyrosine dephosphorylation after Fas cross-linking occurred in Fas apoptosis-sensitive CEM-6 cells but not in Fas apoptosis-resistant MOLT-4 cells, and apoptosis in the CEM-6 cells could be inhibited by the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate. The time course and level of dephosphorylation were correlated with increased hematopoietic cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (HCP) activity, but not with the activity of two other tyrosine phosphatases. The level of expression of HCP was correlated with Fas apoptosis function in eleven human and murine Fas-positive lymphoid cell lines. Expression of recombinant HCP in the MOLT-4 cell line converted this Fas apoptosis-resistant cell line to Fas apoptosis sensitive. HCP-mutant mev\/mev mice exhibited increased expression of Fas but decreased Fas-mediated apoptosis function in lymphoid organs after anti-mouse Fas antibody treatment in vivo. Thus, HCP-mediated protein dephosphorylation is involved in the delivery of the Fas apoptosis signal in lymphoid cells.","5395":"Fas receptor-induced apoptosis plays critical roles in immune homeostasis. However, most of the signal transduction events distal to Fas ligation have not been elucidated. Here, we show that Ras is activated following ligation of Fas on lymphoid lines. The activation of Ras is a critical component of this apoptotic pathway, since inhibition of Ras by neutralizing antibody or a dominant-negative Ras mutant interfered with Fas-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ligation of Fas also resulted in stimulation of the sphingomyelin signalling pathway to produce ceramides, which, in turn, are capable of inducing both Ras activation and apoptosis. This suggests that ceramides acts as second messengers in Fas signaling via Ras. Thus, ligation of the Fas molecule on lymphocyte lines induces activation of Ras via the action of ceramide, and this activation is necessary, but not sufficient, for subsequent apoptosis.","5396":"The conserved invariant chain associates with highly polymorphic alpha and beta subunits guiding class II transport through the secretory pathway. Early associations of these three polypeptides inside antigen-presenting cells are poorly understood. The present experiments provide a detailed picture of the structure and fate of class II alpha and beta subunits in invariant chain mutants possessing different MHC haplotypes. In the absence of invariant chain, A alpha bA beta b is predominantly expressed as free A alpha b and A beta b chains by both splenocytes and activated LPS\/IL-4 blasts, confirming that A alpha bA beta b assembly is strongly dependent on invariant chain coexpression. A quite different situation exists with respect to other allelic products. In the absence of invariant chain, A alpha kA beta k, E alpha kE beta k, and A alpha dA beta d molecules assemble efficiently and are conformationally similar to mature wild-type heterodimers. The contribution of invariant chain to subunit assembly thus differs for allelic variants, suggesting that sequential associations of alpha, beta, and invariant chain may be affected by polymorphic differences.","5397":"Disulfide-stabilized Fvs (dsFv) are recombinant Fv fragments of antibodies in which the inherently unstable VH-VL heterodimer is stabilized by an interchain disulfide bond engineered between structurally conserved framework positions. We now design and produce a disulfide-stabilized Fv of a T cell receptor. It is composed of V alpha and V beta variable domains of the 2B4 TCR stabilized by a disulfide bond between framework residues of the TCR Fv at a site corresponding to that used for disulfide stabilization of antibody Fvs. For ease of production and detection, the TCRdsFv was fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38). The TCR(dsFv) retains its native conformation and is much more stable than a TCR scFv. Moreover, it is functional in biological assays. Because successful disulfide stabilization of the TCR Fv by the positions used for antibody Fv stabilization would not occur unless the mutated residues in TCR Fv are at positions closely similar to those in antibody Fvs, most likely within less than 1.5 A, these results provide very strong experimental evidence for the structural similarity between immunoglobulin and TCR antigen-binding variable domains.","5398":"Alloantigen-stimulated CD8+ mouse spleen cells, either spontaneously or in the presence of IL-12 or IFN gamma plus anti-IL-4, differentiate into CD8+ T cells secreting a Th1-like cytokine pattern (IL-2 and IFN gamma). IL-4 induced differentiation into CD8+ T cells secreting Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10), whereas anti-IFN gamma suppressed the development of CD8+ cells secreting IFN gamma. Clones of IL-4- or IFN gamma-producing CD8+ T cells were relatively stable, as IL-4 or IFN gamma did not cause interconversion of committed CD8+ T cells. Both CD8+ subsets were cytotoxic, failed to provide cognate help for B cell antibody production, and remained CD4-, CD8 alpha+ CD8 beta+. We propose the names TC1 and TC2 for cytotoxic CD8+ T cells secreting Th1-like and Th2-like cytokines, respectively.","5399":"The common gamma chain (gamma c) of the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors is defective in humans with XSCID. Mice lacking gamma c expression had hypoplastic thymuses; the thymocytes responded to gamma c-independent mitogens, but not gamma c-dependent stimuli. Splenic T cells were diminished at 3 weeks of age, but CD4+ T cells markedly increased by 4 weeks. B cells were greatly diminished in contrast with the situation in XSCID. NK cells, gamma delta intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, dendritic epidermal T cells, peripheral lymph nodes, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue were absent. These findings underscore the importance of gamma c in lymphoid development. Moreover, differences in humans and mice lacking gamma c expression indicate species-specific differences in the roles of gamma c-dependent cytokines or in the existence of redundant pathways. These mice provide an important model for studying the pathophysiology provide an important model for studying the pathophysiology of and gene therapy for human XSCID.","5400":"The receptors for IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 share a common beta subunit (beta c), and mice have an additional IL-3 beta subunit (beta IL3). We have independently generated mice carrying null mutations of each molecule. beta c mutant bone marrow showed no response to GM-CSF or IL-5, whereas IL-3 stimulation of beta c or beta IL3 mutant bone marrow was normal. beta c mutant mice showed lung pathology consisting of lymphocytic infiltration and areas resembling alveolar proteinosis, and also exhibited low basal numbers of eosinophils. Infection of beta c mutant mice by Nippostrongylus brasiliensis resulted in the absence of blood and lung eosinophilia. Animals repopulated with beta c mutant bone marrow cells showed slower leukocyte recovery and reduced eosinophil numbers. These data define the role of beta c in vivo, and show a phenotype that is likely to be the cumulative effect of loss of GM-CSF and IL-5 stimulation.","5401":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize peptide epitopes of protein antigens in a hierarchical fashion. We investigated whether proteolytic cleavage, in particular by proteasomes, is important in determining epitope hierarchy. Using highly purified 20S proteasomes, we find preferred cleavage sites directly adjacent to the N- and C-terminal ends of the immunodominant epitope of chicken ovalbumin, Ova257-264, while most of the subdominant epitope, Ova55-62, is destroyed by a major cleavage site located within this epitope. Moreover, we show that variations in amino acid sequences flanking these epitopes influence proteasomal cleavage patterns in parallel with the efficacy of their presentation. The results suggest that proteasomal cleavage within and adjacent to class I-restricted epitopes contributes to their level of presentation.","5402":"In mice injected with superantigens, T cells specific for that antigen proliferate and then die. It has been suggested that the target cells die because they encounter superantigen on the surfaces of nonprofessional presenting cells, such as B cells, which cannot deliver costimulatory signals to T cells. A number of reagents that induce costimulatory molecules on B cells were tested. Lipopolysaccharide very effectively prevented T cell death driven by superantigen. Perhaps surprisingly, the action of lipopolysaccharide was not mediated through the expected costimulatory molecule, B7. Rather, the effects of lipopolysaccharide involved the production of inflammatory cytokines, in particular TNF alpha. The rescued cells survived in vitro culture and were resistant to Fas-induced killing. These data demonstrate that LPS can block antigen-induced T cell death perhaps by interfering with Fas signaling.","5403":"Memory or antigen-experienced CD4 T cells differ from naive CD4 T cells both phenotypically by cell surface marker expression, and functionally by their dissimilar pattern of cytokine secretion and activation requirements through their T cell receptor (TCR). We show here that activation of memory CD4 T cells (CD45RBlo subset), but not naive CD4 T cells (CD45RBhi subset), is inhibited by MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and by CD4 ligation. We propose that the selective negative signal in memory cells is a direct result of the differences in signaling via CD4 and CD3, exemplified in the disparate pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins visible after activation of the two subsets. In vivo, this inhibitory signal may serve to prevent irrelevant interactions between memory CD4 T cells and bystander MHC class II+ cells, and may also be responsible for the defective functioning of memory CD4 T cells in AIDS.","5404":"Human memory B cells that carry mutated IgV region genes were isolated from tonsils by negative selection of IgD+ naive B cells and CD38+ germinal center B cells and plasma cells. They were mainly found within the intraepithelial areas, but not in the B cell follicles of human tonsils. Memory B cells but not naive B cells have the capacity to present antigen directly to T cells, owing to the constitutive expression of the accessory molecules B7-1\/CD80 and B7-2\/CD86. Signals through antigen receptors and CD40 antigen result in these two molecules being further up-regulated more rapidly and strongly on memory B cells than on naive B cells. The unique anatomical localization of memory B cells beneath the surface of mucosa, together with their strong APC capacity, may explain the well-known prompt and robust secondary antibody responses.","5405":"Interactions mediated by TCRs expressed on different T cell subsets may play a role in immunoregulation. To investigate this idea, we studied the regulation of superantigen-induced TCR V beta-restricted responses. We asked whether the in vivo regulation of CD4+ V beta 8+ T cells following SEB injection is controlled by CD8+ T cells. We found that in mice deficient in CD8+ T cells, the down-regulation of CD4+ V beta 8+ T cells below baseline is not observed. Moreover, following SEB administration, CD8+ T cells emerge that preferentially kill subpopulations of activated CD4+ V beta 8+ but not CD4+ V beta 8- T cells in vitro. This TCR V beta-specific cytotoxicity is dependent on beta 2-microglobulin and is inhibited by antisera specific for Qa-1 but not by antibody to MHC class Ia. These data suggest the idea that the specificity of immune regulation may involve CD8+ T cell recognition of TCR V beta determinants and Qa-1 molecules expressed on CD4+ T cells.","5406":"CD8+ T cells control immune responses, and recent studies suggest that this regulation is, in part, specifically directed towards TCR structures expressed by CD4+ cells. To develop a system to study the role of the TCR in regulatory interactions, we isolated clones of CD4+ cells expressing identified TCR V beta chains. These CD4+ clones were used to stimulate and expand autologous CD8+ cells, which kill the inducing CD4+ clone as well as independently isolated autologous CD4+ clones sharing the same TCR V beta as the inducing cell but not CD4+ T cells expressing different V beta TCRs. This V beta-specific cytotoxicity is dependent on the state of activation of the target cells and is not inhibited by an anti-class I monoclonal antibody, W6\/32. We envision that V beta-specific CD8+ T cells of this type may regulate immune responses by direct interaction with antigen-activated CD4+ cells.","5407":"Several tumor antigens are recognized by autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) on human melanoma MZ2-MEL. Some of them are encoded by genes MAGE-1 and MAGE-3, which are not expressed in normal tissues except in testis. Here, we report the identification of a new gene that codes for another of these antigens. This gene, named BAGE, codes for a putative protein of 43 aa and seems to belong to a family of several genes. The antigen recognized by the autologous CTL consists of BAGE-encoded peptide AARAVFLAL bound to an HLA-Cw 1601 molecule. Gene BAGE is expressed in 22% of melanomas, 30% of infiltrating bladder carcinomas, 10% of mammary carcinomas, 8% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and 6% of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Like the MAGE genes, it is silent in normal tissues with the exception of testis. Because of its tumor-specific expression, the BAGE-encoded antigen may prove useful for cancer immunotherapy.","5408":"An Epstein-Barr virus-encoded protein, LMP2, blocks the effects of surface immunoglobulin (slg) cross-linking on calcium mobilization and on lytic reactivation of EBV in latently infected and growth-transformed primary human B lymphocytes. In wild-type EBV-transformed cells, LMP2 is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and is associated with Lyn and Syk protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Baseline Lyn PTK activity is substantially reduced, and slg cross-linking fails to activate Lyn, Syk, Pl3-K, PLC gamma 2, Vav, Shc, and MAPK. Syk, Pl3-K, PLC gamma 2, and Vav are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated, and their tyrosine phosphorylation does not change following slg cross-linking. In contrast, cross-linking slg on cells transformed by LMP2 null mutant EBV recombinants triggers the same protein tyrosine kinase cascade as in noninfected B lymphocytes. These data are consistent with a model in which LMP2 is a constitutive dominant negative modulator of slg receptor signaling through its effects on Lyn, Syk, or regulators of these kinases.","5409":"The superantigen encoded by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is a potent stimulator of T cells when bound to MHC class II molecules. Recent data from this laboratory have shown that the Mtv7 superantigen, Mls-1, elicits a strong T cell response when presented by HLA-DR. To expand these observations further, we have produced the 28 kDa extracellular domain and the 18 kDa carboxy-terminal subfragment of the Mls-1 protein in E. coli and studied their interaction with human MHC class II molecules in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate direct binding of these recombinant forms of the Mls-1 protein to soluble HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4, but not to HLA-A2. Our data imply a unique class II interaction site of retroviral superantigens that is not shared with bacterial superantigens.","5410":"Using a fluorescein-conjugated antigenic peptide, peptide-receptive H-2Kb MHC class I molecules were found throughout the secretory pathways of RMA cells and peptide transporter (TAP)-deficient derivative cells (RMA\/S). RMA\/S cells displayed higher levels of intracellular peptide-receptive molecules, while, surprisingly, RMA cells expressed 3- to 5-fold more cell surface peptide-receptive molecules. Metabolic radiolabeling of Kb-associated oligosaccharides with [1-3H]galactose demonstrated that despite a large difference in the fraction of Kb molecules in native conformation in detergent extracts, Kb transport rates from the trans-Golgi complex to the surfaces of RMA and RMA\/S cells were similar. Thus, although considerable numbers of class I alpha chains reach the RMA\/S cell surface, they are a less productive source of peptide-receptive molecules than class I molecules synthesized by TAP-expressing RMA cells, suggesting paradoxically that TAP functions to increase the amount of peptide-receptive molecules at the cell surface.","5411":"Inoculation of plasmid vectors encoding a viral protein into muscle tissue was shown to result in expression of the transantigen and, consequently, an antiviral immune response. Here, we show that coinoculation of a plasmid expressing the glycoprotein of rabies virus with plasmids encoding mouse cytokines modulated the immune response to the viral protein. Coinoculation with a vector expressing mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhanced the B and T helper cell activity to rabies virus, while coinoculation with a plasmid expressing interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) resulted in a decrease of the immune response to the viral antigen.","5412":"The increased affinity of memory antibody responses is due largely to the generation and selection of memory B cells that accumulate somatic mutations after initial antigenic stimulation. Further affinity maturation and mutation also accompany subsequent immunizations. Previous studies have suggested that, like primary antibody-forming cell (AFC) clones, secondary AFC do not accumulate further mutations and, therefore, the origins of progressive affinity maturation remain controversial. Here, we report the generation of somatically mutated memory B cell clones in vitro. Our findings confirm the existence of a naive B cell subset whose progeny, rather than generating AFC, somatically mutate and respond to subsequent antigenic stimulation. Interestingly, upon stimulation, a subset of memory B cells also generates antigen-responsive cells that accumulate further somatic mutations.","5413":"The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits, the IL-2R alpha, IL-2R beta, and IL-2R gamma chains. The IL-2-induced proliferative signals emanate from the cytoplasmic domains of IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma, but the nature and function of the signaling molecules that transmit these signals are not fully understood. Here, we report that Syk protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) is physically associated with IL-2R in peripheral blood lymphocytes. cDNA expression studies further revealed that this association is critical for the IL-2-induced activation of Syk PTK, which occurs primarily via the serine-rich region of the IL-2R beta chain, which is essential for proliferative signal transmission. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in the hematopoietic cell line, BAF-B03, the activation of Syk PTK results in the induction of the c-myc gene, an event critical for the cell proliferation. Thus, Syk PTK may be a critical integral member of the signaling molecules engaged by the IL-2R.","5414":"Major histocompatibility complex class II molecules bind and present to T cells fragments of protein antigens entering the endocytic pathway. Using normal B lymphoblasts, we have combined metabolic pulse-chase labelling, high resolution organelle fractionation, and immunoprecipitation to examine class II trafficking and antigen loading in a physiological model system. Most newly synthesized class II-invariant chain complexes first entered early endosomes, then accessed multiple discrete endocytic subcompartments cofractionating with late endosomes and immature lysosomes. Invariant chain was removed and peptide-loaded class II molecules appeared in each of these latter distinct organelles. These findings suggest that class II molecules traffic through much of the endocytic pathway, permitting capture of distinct determinants made available under differing conditions of pH and proteolytic activity.","5415":"Mice immunized against a cancer recognize antigens unique to that cancer, but the molecular structures of such antigens are unknown. We isolated CD4+ T cell clones recognizing an antigen uniquely expressed on the UV-induced tumor 6132A; some clones inhibited the growth of tumors bearing the specific antigen. A T cell hybridoma was used to purify this antigen from nuclear extracts by RP-HPLC and SDS-PAGE using T cell immunoblot assays. A partial amino acid sequence was nearly identical to a sequence in ribosomal protein L9. The cDNA sequence of L9 from 6132A PRO cells differed from the normal sequence at one nucleotide; this mutation encoded histidine instead of leucine at position 47. A synthetic peptide containing this mutation was over 1000-fold more stimulatory of T cells than was the wild-type peptide. These results indicate that this unique tumor antigen is derived from a single amino acid substitution in a cellular protein.","5416":"We have studied memory in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice expressing a Db-restricted TCR specific for the male peptide (H-Y). CD8+ T cells from female TCR transgenic C57BL\/6 (B6) mice were activated by transferring them into X-irradiated male (B6 x bm12)F1 hybrid recipients. Subsequently, they were highly purified by cell sorting and transferred for various lengths of time into female B6 nu\/nu recipient mice. Other nu\/nu recipient mice received highly purified naive T cells expressing the transgenic TCR. The functional potential of naive and \"memory\" T cells was analyzed by stimulation with male cells in vivo. The results show that memory cells can be derived from activated T cells and persist in the absence of antigen for at least 13 weeks. Naive and memory T cells differ in that memory T cells give a more vigorous and sustained response than naive T cells.","5417":"Direct and indirect cytopathic mechanisms have been proposed to account for the loss of CD4+ T cells after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We report here that HIV-1 infection of the human thymus in vivo results in thymocyte depletion by at least two different mechanisms. Thymocytes within multiple stages of differentiation are induced to die of apoptosis; most of these cells are uninfected. Additionally, thymopoiesis is interrupted by direct infection and destruction of intrathymic CD3-CD4+CD8- progenitor cells. These mechanisms are differentially induced by distinct isolates of HIV-1.","5418":"Motheaten viable (mev) mice are deficient in the cytosolic protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1C, and exhibit severe B cell immunodeficiency and autoantibody production. The role of PTP1C in B cell selection and function was analyzed by breeding immunoglobulin transgenes specific for a defined antigen, hen egg lysozyme, into mev mice. Antigen triggered a greater and more rapid elevation of intracellular calcium in PTP1C-deficient B cells, indicating that this phosphatase negatively regulates immunoglobulin signaling. Elimination of self-reactive B cells carrying this signal-enhancing mutation was triggered during their development by binding a lower valency form of self-antigen than is normally required. These findings establish that activation of distinct repertoire-censoring mechanisms depends on quantitative differences in antigen receptor signaling, whose thresholds are determined by negative regulation through PTP1C.","5419":"High endothelial venules (HEV) in lymphoid tissues support high levels of lymphocyte extravasion from the blood. We purified high endothelial cells from human tonsils by immunomagnetic selection with MECA-79 MAb to construct an HEV cDNA library. Differential screening of this library using cDNA probes from HEV (plus) or flat-walled vessel (minus) endothelial cells allowed us to characterize a novel human cDNA expressed to high levels in HEV. The cDNA encodes a secreted acidic calcium-binding glycoprotein of 664 aa residues, designated hevin, exhibiting 62% identity with the antiadhesive extracellular matrix protein SPARC, over a region of 232 aa spanning more than four fifths of the SPARC coding sequence. The primary structure and sequence of hevin and similar to SPARC-like proteins from rat and quail, called SC1 or QR1. Hevin could contribute to the induction or maintenance of features of the HEV endothelium that facilitate lymphocyte migration.","5420":"We previously identified possible intermediates in V(D)J recombination at the TCR delta locus and characterized molecules with signal ends and with covalently sealed (hairpin) coding ends in thymocytes of scid mice by Southern blotting. Here, we use a sensitive ligation-mediated PCR assay to demonstrate that all coding ends detected in scid thymocytes are covalently sealed. Neither coding nor signal ends exhibit loss or addition of nucleotides. These data imply that hairpin formation is coupled to the initial cleavage at the signal\/coding border, and that the cleavage step in V(D)J recombination is conservative. In scid\/+ or wild-type thymocytes, hairpin coding ends are at least 1000-fold less abundant than signal ends. These results provide insight into the mechanism of V(D)J recombination.","5421":"","5422":"Class I MHC expression by target cells inhibits lysis mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, often in an allele-specific fashion. It has been proposed that NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize complexes of class I molecules with specific cellular peptides that define self, displacement of which would render cells NK sensitive. By loading the mostly empty Dd class I molecules of cell lines deficient in peptide transporter molecules with synthetic or natural Dd-bound peptides, we have demonstrated specific dose-dependent inhibition of the Ly49+ subset of activated NK cells by class I-peptide complexes. Inhibition occurred with most if not all Dd-binding peptides, suggesting that Ly49+ NK cells recognize class I-peptide complexes largely independently of peptide composition. The results suggest a primary role of NK cells in the destruction of cells that have down-regulated or extinguished cell surface expression of some or all class I molecules.","5423":"To address the role of apoptosis in the humoral immune response, we have examined a well-characterized T cell-dependent B cell response in mice expressing transgenic Bcl-2 in their B lymphocytes. The selection of somatic mutants and the appearance of high affinity antibodies was not affected by constitutive Bcl-2 expression. Such expression did, however, disproportionately increase the antigen-specific memory B cell pool, suggesting that the final size of the memory compartment may be regulated by an apoptotic process, which, in turn, can be influenced by Bcl-2. In addition, transgenic mice showed prolonged survival of foci of early antibody-producing cells, suggesting their removal is mediated by apoptosis that can be blocked by Bcl-2.","5424":"Ly-49A+ murine natural killer (NK) cells cannot lyse target cells that express H-2Dd. We demonstrate a functional requirement for carbohydrate recognition by Ly-49A. Treatment of H-2Dd+ target cells with tunicamycin prevents their binding to Ly-49A+ cells and renders them susceptible to lysis by Ly-49A+ NK cells. Fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide, binds to Ly-49A in a calcium-dependent manner, and this binding is inhibited by monosaccharides, particularly sulfated hexoses. The inactivation of Ly-49A+ NK cells by H-2Dd+ target cells is reversed in the presence of glucose 6-SO4. These results indicate that Ly-49A has a functional carbohydrate recognition domain and that target expression of carbohydrates alters their susceptibility to natural killing.","5425":"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) translocates peptides from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An important determinant for the specificity of translocation is the identity of the C-terminal residue of the peptide substrate. In the rat, a suitable C terminus is necessary but not always sufficient for a peptide to be selected for translocation. Here we show that sequence constraints within a peptide of optimal length (9 residues) may interfere with transport; that the transporter selectively translocates shorter derivatives of a 16-mer peptide rather than the 16-mer itself; and that the transporter cimb allele, which is most selective in the C termini it will tolerate, is more relaxed in peptide length preference than is the clma variant.","5426":"HLA-DR molecules associated with class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP) are generated in vivo as an intermediate in class II maturation. Such complexes can be produced in vitro by proteolytic digestion of DR alpha beta I complexes, suggesting that CLIP is a residual fragment that remains associated with class II molecules following I chain degradation. In vitro, CLIP dissociation from DR alpha beta dimers occurs at different rates depending on the allele, and is facilitated by low pH and by detergents containing 8-10 carbon unbranched hydrocarbons, or by primary aliphatic amines or carboxylic acids. The accumulation of DR alpha beta CLIP complexes in HLA-DM-negative antigen-processing mutant cells argues that a functionally similar mechanism, dependent on HLA-DM expression, catalyzes in vivo CLIP dissociation and generation of normal class II-peptide complexes.","5427":"Pan DR-binding peptides engineered by introducing anchor residues for different DR motifs within a polyalanine backbone bound 10 of 10 DR molecules tested, with affinities, in most cases, in the nanomolar range. Because of the small methyl group exposed for T cell recognition, these peptides were poor immunogens but effective blockers of DR-restricted antigen presentation. Introduction of bulky and charged residues at positions accessible for T cell recognition yielded extremely powerful Pan DR epitope peptides (PADRE). These peptides elicited powerful responses in vitro from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Because these cells also cross-react on certain mouse class II alleles, we could also demonstrate that PADRE peptides are active in vivo. In one example of their capacity to elicit T help, they were approximately 1000 times more powerful than natural T cell epitopes. We propose that PADRE peptides may be useful in the development of subunit vaccines.","5428":"Deletion of mature peripheral T cells may result from TCR ligation by bacterial enterotoxins, endogenous provirus-encoded superantigens, and peptide antigens. But the ultimate fate of deleted T cells is not clear. Using a line of T cell receptor transgenic mice injected with antigenic peptide, we have documented that peripheral deletion is accompanied by the induction of abortive T cell activation followed by the disappearance of transgene-positive T cells. As these T cells disappear from the lymph nodes and spleen, they accumulate in the liver, where they undergo apoptosis. This is likely to be a general clearance pathway for T cells that are programmed to undergo apoptosis in vivo, and it may further explain the expansion of the intrahepatic T cell pool in mice with genetic defects in the T cell apoptosis mechanism, such as the lpr mutant.","5429":"The development of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells is controlled by multiple cytokines. These growth factors influence survival, cell cycle status, differentiation into lineage-committed progenitors, final maturation into blood cells, and perhaps self-renewal of stem cells. The specific contribution of IL-6 to these processes in vivo was evaluated in mice with a targeted disruption of the IL-6 gene. Decreases in the absolute numbers of CFU-Sd12 and preCFU-S, as well as in the functionality of LTRSC in these mutant mice, suggests a role for IL-6 in the survival, self-renewal, or both of hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors. In addition, as a result of the IL-6 deficiency, the control between proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells of the granulocytic-monocytic, megakaryocytic, and erythroid lineages into mature blood cells is altered, leading to abnormal levels of committed progenitors of these lineages and to a slow recovery from hematopoietic ablation.","5430":"","5431":"B7-0 or B7-2 (CD86) is a T cell costimulatory molecule that binds the same receptors (CD28 and CTLA-4) as B7-1 (CD80), but shares with it only approximately 25% sequence identity and is expressed earlier during an immune response. Here we show that human CD86 maintains similar (within approximately 2- to 3-fold) overall receptor binding and T cell costimulatory properties as CD80. However, CD80 and CD86 did not bind equivalently to CTLA-4: CD80 bound Y100A, a form of CTLA4lg with a mutation in the CDR3-like region, &gt; 200-fold better than did CD86; inhibition of CD80-mediated cellular responses required approximately 100-fold lower CTLA4lg concentrations; and CD80-CTLA4lg complexes dissociated 5- to 8-fold more slowly, Thus, CD80 and CD86 utilize different binding determinants and have different kinetics of binding to CD28 and CTLA-4.","5432":"Interactions between stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-Kit, are important for development of hematopoietic, melanocytes, and germ cells. T lymphocytes appeared normal in c-Kit (W\/Wv) or SCF (SI\/SId) mutant mice, except for those residing within the intestinal epithelium, the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). Normally, IEL are composed of equal numbers of cells with alpha beta or gamma delta T cell receptors. In mutant mice, beginning at 6-8 weeks of age, the number of gamma delta IEL decreased, whereas alpha beta IEL increased. The latter was due largely to an increased CD4+ CD8+ TCR alpha beta subset, suggesting that these cells may be intermediates in the alpha beta IEL lineage. c-Kit or SCF was expressed by IEL or intestinal epithelial cells, respectively, indicating a potential for direct intercellular interaction. This possibility was supported by reconstitution studies that demonstrated that c-Kit mutations directly affected IEL. Thus, SCF-c-Kit interactions are important for homeostasis of the intestinal immune compartment.","5433":"The crystallographic structure of the MHC class II molecule showed that the alpha beta heterodimer can itself dimerize to form a four chain (alpha beta)2 complex of 120 kDa. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a 120 kDa (alpha beta)2 complex of the class II I-Ek molecules in mouse B cells. Both a 60 kDa and a 120 kDa form of I-Ek are detected by Western blotting and by immunoprecipitation under conditions in which class II alpha beta heterodimers are stable. The 120 kDa I-Ek complex does not contain Ii and, upon warming, dissociates into free alpha and beta chains. The 120 kDa I-Ek complex is expressed at the cell surface, is active in antigen presentation, and appears to play a significant role in T cell responses to low affinity but not to high affinity antigens, possibly by facilitating cross-linking of the T cell receptors.","5434":"Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and the invariant (Ii) gene are inducible by interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) but not by interferon-alpha and interferon-beta. The promoter regions of these genes contain three regulatory elements that mediate constitutive and IFN gamma-induced expressions; however, none of the DNA-binding proteins that interact with these elements are regulated by IFN gamma. Recently, a gene coding for a transactivator (CIITA) of class II MHC genes that complements a HLA-DR-negative immunodeficiency has been isolated. Using one IFN gamma mutant cell line (G3A) that is selectively defective in HLA-DR and Ii induction, four lines of evidence are presented to show that CIITA mediates the IFN gamma induction of HLA-DR and Ii genes. Analysis of another mutant line, G1B, indicates that the lack of DRA and Ii gene induction by IFN gamma is correlated with the lack of RFX DNA binding activity, thus providing the link between RFX and an IFN gamma response.","5435":"Studies with T cell lines and clones have shown that engagement of the TCR results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR subunits. This leads to the recruitment of the ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase, an interaction involving the two SH2-domains of ZAP-70 with tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta and CD3. However, as previously described, murine thymocytes and lymph node T cells express a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta subunit in the basal state. Here, we show that a fraction of ZAP-70 molecules are constitutively associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta. TCR ligation promotes a large increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP-70 as well as other TCR subunits. Genetic studies reveal that the constitutive ZAP-70 association with tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta does not absolutely require either TCR or coreceptor interactions with MHC molecules.","5436":"Although the rabbit IgH locus contains approximately 100 VH genes, the majority of B cells rearrange VH1. To produce a primary repertoire containing a sufficient number of protective antibodies, rearranged VH1-DH-JH sequences may diversify within rabbit B cells in an organ that functions like a chicken bursa, sheep ileal Peyer's patch, or both. It was suggested many years ago that the rabbit appendix could be a bursal equivalent. To reexamine this possibility, we analyzed rearranged heavy chain variable region sequences in B cells from light and dark zones of appendix germinal centers from 6-week-old rabbits. Our findings indicate that antibody diversification occurs by gene conversion-like and somatic hypermutation mechanisms in appendix germinal centers of young rabbits.","5437":"Oct-2, a POU homeodomain protein expressed primarily in B cells, is a powerful transcriptional activator that binds to DNA at sites appropriately placed for major effects on immunoglobulin gene expression. Our examination of B cell development and function in Oct-2 null mice did not support an essential role for Oct-2 early in B cell development. Rather, Oct-2 was required later, when B cells were induced to differentiate to antibody-secreting cells. We show here that Oct-2 is not required for normal immunoglobulin production by mature B lymphocytes. Instead, it is essential for a normal proliferative response to polyclonal mitogens. Responses to signals from activated T cells are unaffected. The requirement for Oct-2 maps to an early activation step in G1, during which B cells make the commitment to progress through the cell cycle and to divide.","5438":"Recent experiments involving disruption of the Oct-2 gene have shown that this largely B cell-restricted transcription factor is not required in the early stages of B cell development. However, B cells that lack Oct-2 may be blocked from differentiation past the surface immunoglobulin-positive stage. To identify a possible function for Oct-2 in the late stage immunoglobulin-secreting cell, we have used the method of somatic cell fusion. When the immunoglobulin-producing myeloma MPC11 is fused to a T lymphoma, Oct-2 production ceases, as does the expression of immunoglobulin, J chain, and several other B cell-specific gene products. In the present study, we show that by preventing the loss of Oct-2 in the hybrid cells, we can preserve expression of all other tested B cell-specific genes. These results establish a central role for Oct-2 in maintaining the genetic program of the immunoglobulin-secreting plasmacyte.","5439":"The initial rolling interaction of leukocytes with the blood vessel wall during leukocyte trafficking has been postulated to rely on members of the selectin family of adhesion molecules. Two selectins, E-selectin and P-selectin, have been identified that are expressed on activated endothelial cells. Mice deficient in E-selectin expression have been produced in order to examine the role of this selectin in leukocyte trafficking. Mice homozygous for an E-selectin null mutation were viable and exhibited no obvious developmental alterations. E-selectin-deficient mice displayed no significant change in the trafficking of neutrophils in several models of inflammation. However, blocking both endothelial selectins by treatment of the E-selectin-deficient animals with an anti-murine P-selectin antibody, 5H1, significantly inhibited neutrophil emigration in two distinct models of inflammation. While neutrophil accumulation at early times during thioglycollate-induced peritonitis was dependent on P-selectin, neutrophil accumulation at later time points was blocked by 5H1 only in E-selectin-deficient mice but not in wild-type mice. Similarly, edema as well as leukocyte accumulation in a model of delayed-type hypersensitivity in the skin was almost completely prevented by blockade of P-selectin function with 5H1 in the E-selectin-deficient mice while the same treatment had no effect in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that the majority of neutrophil migration in both models requires an endothelial selectin but that E-selectin and P-selectin are functionally redundant. These data have important implications in the use of selectin antagonists in the treatment of inflammatory disease.","5440":"The Thy-1.1loSca-1hiLin-\/lo population, representing 0.05% of C57BL\/Ka-Thy-1.1 bone marrow, is highly enriched for hematopoietic stem cells and includes all multipotent progenitors in this mouse strain; however, the functional reconstituting activity of this fraction is heterogeneous. Only around 25% of clonal reconstitutions by cells from this population are long term; remaining clones yield transient multilineage reconstitutions. By fractionating based on lineage marker expression, the Thy-1.1loSca-1hiLin-\/lo population has been resolved into three subpopulations: Lin-Mac-1-CD4-; Lin-Mac-1loCD4-; and Mac-1loCD4lo. Of these, only the Lin-Mac-1-CD4- population is highly enriched for long-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells. A comparison of transient and long-term multipotent progenitors indicates that long-term progenitors have less CFU-S activity, are equally radioprotective, and are less frequently in cell cycle. The ability to predict the longevity of reconstitution based on lineage marker expression indicates that reconstitution potential is deterministic, not stochastic.","5441":"Recombinant GPI-anchored HLA-A2.1 (HLA-A2.1-GPI\/beta 2m) was used as a protein transfer vehicle to deliver a hepatitis B virus antigenic peptide to the surfaces of cytotoxic T cell targets. Empty HLA-A2.1-GPI\/beta 2m was first produced in D. melanogaster cotransfectants and immunoaffinity purified. Cell coating with HLA-A2.1-GPI\/beta 2m was shown to occur rapidly, and to be protein concentration dependent. Protein-transferred HLA-A2.1-GPI\/beta 2m effectively presented a hepatitis B virus peptide to peptide-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted T cell clones in cytotoxicity assays. Protein transfer of functional GPI-modified class I MHC-antigenic peptide complexes represents a novel strategy for delivering functional antigenic complexes to cell surfaces that bypasses limitations of gene transfer and permits control of antigenic peptide densities at cell surfaces.","5442":"MHC class II molecules expressed in T2 cells fail to acquire a normal complement of endocytically generated peptides. The defect is repaired by introducing HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB cDNA expression vectors, determined by the restoration of SDS stability of class II alpha beta dimers, restoration of a normal conformation for HLA-DR3 as detected by a monoclonal antibody, and by a reduction in class II-associated invariant chain peptides. The intracellular distribution of class II and invariant chain molecules is also restored to that of wild-type cells. The HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB products appear to form a heterodimer that, although transported at least to the medial Golgi, is not expressed at the cell surface. These findings are consistent with HLA-DM functioning intracellularly to facilitate class II-restricted antigen processing.","5443":"To define the intracellular site of assembly of endogenous peptide-MHC class II complexes, an immunochemical approach was undertaken employing a monoclonal antibody specific for an endogenous peptide-class II complex in combination with subcellular fractionation. Here, we show that newly synthesized MHC class II molecules, upon exit from the Golgi, are delivered into a dense endocytic compartment (MIIC) distinct from late endosomes and lysosomes. Endogenous peptide-class II complexes are initially formed in this compartment and subsequently traffic through late endosomal vesicles prior to cell surface expression. Exogenous antigen delivered via immunoglobulin receptors is targeted to MIIC en route to lysosomes after passing through early and late endosomes. Processing of an endocytosed antigen was observed in this compartment. Our results suggest a specific role for MIIC in the processing of endogenous and exogenous proteins as well as the assembly of peptide-MHC class II complexes.","5444":"We have established a hemopoietic cell line, BL3, that possesses a rearranged retroviral genome, which we used as a genetic tag for their engraftment into lethally irradiated mice. Analysis of recipients up to 7 months after engraftment indicates that the marker was present in differentiated cells of various hemopoietic organs, in colony-forming cells, pre-CFU-S-forming cells, and in organs of secondary recipients from bone marrow cells of primary recipients. BL3 cells are Thy-1+, Sca-1+, B220-, Mac-1-, and Gr-1-. They express GATA-1 and are able to develop \"cobblestones\" with stromal cells. They do not express and respond to several hemopoietic growth factors known to facilitate marrow recovery. However, they are negatively regulated by TGF beta and can be stimulated by mitogen-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium. We conclude that BL3 cells possess properties of hemopoietic stem cells, including their capability to contribute to long-term repopulation.","5445":"Anti-TCR antibodies can activate or block the activation of T cells. In the present experiments, we have shown that different monoclonal antibodies to the same TCR can have either agonist or antagonist activity, and we have examined the relationship between these functional effects and the avidity of the antibody for the TCR. We show here that it is not the avidity of an anti-TCR antibody that determines whether it acts as an agonist or an antagonist. Moreover, we show that monovalent Fab fragments of agonist antibodies produce detectable changes in T cell behavior. These data suggest that T cell activation may involve not just aggregation of the TCR but also some induced change in individual ligated receptors, and that agonists may produce this change while antagonists do not. We argue that similar effects may apply to peptide-MHC ligands as well.","5446":"We have described a murine model of IBD that was induced in C.B-17 scid mice by transfer of the CD45RBhi subpopulation of CD4+ T cells from normal BALB\/c mice and could be prevented by cotransfer of the CD45RBlo CD4+ T cell subset. Here we have dissected the mechanism of pathogenesis of IBD in this model and used this information for rational immunotherapy of the disease. CD4+ cells from diseased mice displayed a highly polarized Th1 pattern of cytokine synthesis upon polyclonal stimulation in vitro. The administration of anti-IFN gamma MAb to mice soon after T cell transfer prevented development of colitis for up to 12 weeks. Continual neutralization of TNF with anti-TNF MAbs reduced the incidence of severe disease; however, neutralization of TNF during only the first 3-4 weeks had no effect. Severe colitis was completely abrogated in mice treated systemically with rIL-10, but not with rIL-4.","5447":"In vitro generated CD4 cell lines and effectors often produce either Th1 or Th2 cytokines, but stimulation of resting CD4 cells from animals leads to production mostly of IL-2. To determine whether polarization of CD4 effector cells results in development of polarized memory, I generated antigen-specific Th1 and Th2 effectors in vitro and transferred them to adoptive hosts. The effectors gave rise to long-lived populations of CD4 T cells with the phenotype of resting memory cells. Recovered cells responded vigorously to specific antigen, producing a pattern of cytokines closely related to that of the transferred effectors. Thus, encounter with a peptide antigen and directive cytokines at the initiation of culture can lead to generation of both effector and long-lived memory cell populations that produce restricted patterns of cytokines.","5448":"MHC class I molecules present peptides generated by processing of endogenously synthesized proteins to CD8+ T lymphocytes. Recently, large proteolytic complexes, termed proteasomes, were implicated in antigen processing. Two proteasomal subunits, LMP2 and LMP7, are encoded within the MHC class II region, but their precise role in antigen processing is unknown. We have generated mice that harbor a disruption in their LMP2 gene. Proteasomes purified from spleen and liver of these mutant mice exhibit altered peptidase activities, and antigen-presenting cells showed reduced capacity to stimulate a T cell hybridoma specific for H-2Db plus a nucleoprotein epitope of an influenza A virus. The mutant mice have reduced (60%-70% of wild type) levels of CD8+ T lymphocytes and generate 5- to 6-fold fewer influenza nucleoprotein-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors. These findings indicate that LMP2 influences antigen processing.","5449":"","5450":"B-lymphoid and myeloid development are markedly perturbed in a unique transgenic mouse strain, max 41. Pro-B, pre-B, and B lymphocytes were severely reduced but granulocytes were greatly elevated. This phenotype could be adoptively transferred with bone marrow cells. It was not alleviated by bcl-2 or myc transgenes that promote lymphocyte survival or proliferation. Bitransgenic myc\/max 41 mice developed pre-B cell lymphoma. An accompanying massive granulocytosis unexpectedly proved to be clonally derived from the pre-B lymphoma cells. These observations suggest that B lymphopoiesis in max 41 mice has been diverted to granulocyte production. Since neither cell type expressed the transgene, this novel lymphomyeloid deviation probably reflects insertional alteration of a hematopoietic regulatory gene.","5451":"The TAP proteins translocate antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum. Investigation of the specificity of this process has been complicated by TAP-independent factors that influence the amount of peptide that accumulates in the ER in transport assays. We have developed an overexpression system in which binding of peptides to the TAP substrate-binding site and peptide transport by TAP can be quantified separately. Efficiency of peptide accumulation in the ER parallels affinity for the TAP substrate-binding site, but can be modified by interaction with the glycosylation system within the ER and, probably, peptide efflux. Random peptide mixtures of 9-16 aa display significantly higher affinity for the binding site than mixtures of shorter or longer peptides. Peptide binds to TAP heteromers in the absence of ATP and is released by the binding of ATP, suggesting a model for TAP function.","5452":"The mechanism(s) leading to beta cell dysfunction in type I diabetes has not been defined. We have investigated whether islet expression of IFN alpha could be a cause of the lesions that are hallmarks of type I diabetes. Streptozotocin induces the expression of interferon-alpha by pancreatic islets prior to the diabetes induced by streptozotocin. Increased IFN alpha, induced by poly I\/C or expressed from a transgene will exacerbate the diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin. In another rodent model of type I diabetes (the BB rat), islet expression of IFN alpha precedes lymphocytic infiltration and diabetes. As in the streptozotocin model, in the BB rats poly I\/C will induce islet expression of IFN alpha and accelerate the onset of diabetes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that islet expression of IFN alpha participates in causing type I diabetes.","5453":"The ability of cytokines to activate distinct but overlapping sets of genes defines their characteristic biological response. We now show that IFN gamma, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, erythropoietin, EGF, and CSF-1 activate differing members of a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors. Although these factors have distinct physical and functional properties and exhibit different patterns of expression, they share many important features, including recognition of a related set of enhancer elements, rapid activation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and cross-reactivity to antibodies against p91, a cytoplasmic signaling protein activated by IFN alpha, IFN gamma, and IL-6. These shared features point to either parallel or common patterns of signal transduction. A general model of cytokine signal transduction is presented, in which receptor-associated tyrosine kinases activate ligand-specific members of a family of signal-transducing factors. Once activated, these factors carry their signals to the nucleus, where they bind a family of related enhancer elements.","5454":"Using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody specific for murine IFN gamma we show that endogenously produced IFN gamma plays an obligate role in mediating LPS-induced rejection of the Meth A fibrosarcoma tumor in syngeneic BALB\/c mice. To examine the cellular targets of IFN gamma action, we generated IFN gamma-insensitive tumor cells by stably overexpressing in Meth A a truncated dominant negative form of the murine IFN gamma receptor alpha chain. When implanted in BALB\/c mice, IFN gamma-insensitive Meth A cells displayed enhanced tumorigenicity compared with control Meth A cells and were not rejected when tumor-bearing mice were treated with concentrations of LPS that eliminated control tumors. In Meth A immune mice, IFN gamma-insensitive Meth A did not establish tumors while IFN gamma-insensitive tumors grew in a progressive manner. In addition, the IFN gamma-insensitive tumor cells were unable to elicit strong protective immunity to subsequent wild-type tumor challenge. These results show that IFN gamma has direct effects on tumor cell immunogenicity and thus plays an important role in promoting tumor cell recognition and elimination.","5455":"Septic shock caused by a diverse group of bacterial pathogens is a serious human disease. Recognition of bacterial envelope constituents is one mechanism used by mammalian cells to initiate responses leading to bacterial killing or, unfortunately, responses that also cause fatal septic shock. Here we show that CD14 plays a key role in initiating cell activation by a group of bacterial envelope components from Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms, as well as mycobacteria. We propose that CD14 is a receptor used by mammalian cells to recognize and signal responses to a diverse array of bacterial constituents. This finding defines the molecular basis for innate microbial immunity; implicit in these findings are new possibilities for therapeutics.","5456":"Costimulation of T cell proliferation can occur through the CD28 signal transduction pathway. In addition, other cell surface receptors, including the CD28 homolog CTLA-4, have been proposed to be capable of providing costimulatory signals. We have examined the response of CD28-deficient T cells to activation by a variety of agonists. We demonstrate that proliferation of CD28-deficient T cells in the presence of antigen-presenting cells or B7-1 transfectants is markedly reduced. Although CTLA-4 can be expressed on CD28-deficient T cells, we observed no B7-dependent costimulation in the absence of CD28. This data demonstrates that CD28 is the major B7-binding costimulatory ligand on T cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that CD28 is the primary, and perhaps exclusive, costimulatory receptor used by traditional antigen-presenting cells to augment the proliferation of antigen-activated T cells.","5457":"Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen that secretes proteins into host cell cytosol. One such protein, the murein hydrolase p60, is processed by the host cell into the nonamer peptide p60 217-225 and presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes by the H-2Kd MHC class I molecule. Using strains of L. monocytogenes that secrete different amounts of p60, we show that the rate of p60 217-225 production is proportional to the quantity of intracellular antigen. The appearance of p60 217-225 is coupled to the degradation of newly synthesized p60. By accounting for the rate of intracellular antigen secretion and degradation, we estimate that approximately 35 p60 molecules are degraded to produce one p60 217-225 epitope. These findings provide an estimate of the efficiency of antigen processing and shed light on the capacity of the MHC class I antigen processing pathway to accommodate foreign antigens.","5458":"","5459":"To study the potential roles of CD40L in immune responses, we generated CD40L-deficient mice by gene targeting. Similar to the effects of CD40L mutations in humans (hyper-IgM syndrome), CD40L-deficient mice have a decreased IgM response to thymus-dependent antigens, fail altogether to produce an antigen-specific IgG1 response following immunization, yet respond normally to a T-independent antigen, TNP-Ficoll. Moreover, these mice do not develop germinal centers in response to thymus-dependent antigens, suggesting an inability to develop memory B cell responses. Although CD40L-deficient mice have low levels of most circulating immunoglobulin isotypes, they do not exhibit the spontaneous hyper-IgM syndrome seen in humans, at least up to 12 weeks of age. In summary, our study confirms the important role of CD40-CD40L interactions in thymus-dependent humoral immune responses and germinal center formation.","5460":"CD28 and CTLA-4 are related glycoproteins found on T cells. Ligation of CD28 following antigen receptor engagement provides a costimulatory signal required for T cell activation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies were generated to examine the role of the CTLA-4 receptor on murine T cells. Expression of CTLA-4 as a homodimer is up-regulated 2-3 days following T cell activation. Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and Fab fragments augmented T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR. However, when optimal costimulation and Fc cross-linking were present, anti-CTLA-4 Mabs inhibited T cell proliferation. Together, these results suggest that the MAb may obstruct the interaction of CTLA-4 with its natural ligand and block a negative signal, or directly signal T cells to down-regulate immune function.","5461":"Intraepithelial T lymphocytes possess a (TGF beta)-inducible integrin complex that consists of the beta 7 integrin chain in association with a novel alpha chain, murine alpha M290. Using antibodies directed against the murine alpha M290 chain, IL-3-dependent murine bone marrow-derived mast cells demonstrated positive staining after induction with TGF beta. Sequence information from the human intraepithelial T lymphocyte-alpha E gene sequence was used to clone the murine homolog from a TGF beta-induced T cell library. The murine alpha E homolog gene encodes a protein recognized by antibodies to alpha M290. Expression of this gene by bone marrow-derived mast cells was found to be induced by TGF beta or IgE-mediated cross-linking of Fc epsilon R1. Furthermore, exposure of murine TK-1 cells to supernatants from activated mast cells induces the expression of the alpha M290 gene, indicating that a mast cell mediator(s) can act in a paracrine manner to induce expression of this integrin complex by other cells.","5462":"During their intrathymic migration, immature CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes that express a TCR able to recognize the expressed MHC molecules are positively selected, i.e., complete their differentiation program and become mature T cells. Using the immature CD4+CD8+ T cell line DPK, which can be induced to differentiate in culture, we show here that a subset of isolated thymic epithelial cells, but not peripheral antigen-presenting cells, can induce differentiation, suggesting a unique function of these cells in T cell development. In addition, analysis of activation markers induced by thymic epithelial cells versus specific antigen gives the first direct evidence that positive selection is associated with low level cell activation. In contrast with strict affinity-avidity models of thymic selection, we propose that a specialized antigen-presenting cell environment is an essential contributor to TCR-mediated differentiation in the thymus.","5463":"Nef of primate lentiviruses is required for viremia and progression to AIDS in monkeys. Negative, positive, and no effects of Nef have also been reported on viral replication in cells. To reconcile these observations, we expressed a hybrid CD8-Nef protein in Jurkat cells. Two opposite phenotypes were found, which depended on the intracellular localization of Nef. Expressed in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface, the chimera inhibited or activated early signaling events from the T cell antigen receptor. Activated Jurkat cells died by apoptosis, and only cells with mutated nef genes expressing truncated Nefs survived, which rendered Nef nonfunctional. These mutations paralleled those in other viral strains passaged in vitro. Not only do these positional effects of Nef reconcile diverse phenotypes of Nef and suggest a role for its N-terminal myristylation, but they also explain effects of Nef in HIV infection and progression to AIDS.","5464":"","5465":"","5466":"The use of E1-deleted recombinant adenoviruses in gene therapy has consistently been associated with transient gene expression and inflammation due to immune-based destruction of the infected cells. We have used murine models of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to liver to investigate these immunologic mechanisms. Adoptive transfer experiments, as well as studies involving genetic knockout mice, confirmed the original hypothesis that cell-mediated immunity induced by E1-deleted adenovirus destroyed trans-gene-expressing hepatocytes and defined MHC class I-restricted CD8+ cytolytic lymphocytes as the primary immune effectors for hepatocyte destruction. Responses mediated by CD4+ cells per se were insufficient to mediate destruction of hepatocytes in vivo, despite the activation of virus-specific T helper cells of Th1 subsets. A better understanding of the response of the host to in vivo gene therapy is important in evaluating its usefulness in humans.","5467":"To analyze the functions of T cell costimulators in vivo, we have constructed a transgenic mouse strain that constitutively expresses murine B7-1 on mature B cells. Antibody responses to T-dependent hapten-protein conjugates and serum immunoglobulin levels are markedly depressed in B7-1 transgenic mice. This immune deficiency is not due to an intrinsic B cell defect, as antibody responses to T-independent hapten conjugates are normal. Furthermore, treatment with anti-B7-1 restores the capacity of transgenic mice to respond to hapten-protein conjugates, demonstrating that the deficient antibody responses are directly attributable to the expression of B7-1. These results suggest that the temporally regulated expression of costimulators such as B7-1 may contribute to either initiation or down-regulation (feedback inhibition) of T-dependent immune responses in vivo, and that the inhibitory function is dominant in transgenic mice that constitutively express high levels of this costimulator.","5468":"The role of a cell death-associated gene, fas, in T lymphocyte development and responses to antigen has been analyzed by breeding a transgenic T cell receptor specific for the 81-104 peptide of pigeon cytochrome c into fas-defective MRL-lpr\/lpr and control MRL+\/+ mice. Transgene-expressing T cells mature normally in both strains and populate peripheral lymphoid tissues in normal numbers. Mature CD4+ T cells from the lpr\/lpr mice are resistant to suppression by high doses of antigen and to apoptotic cell death. In vivo administration of peptide antigen causes deletion of thymic T cells in both MRL-lpr\/lpr and MRL+\/+ strains. By contrast, antigen-induced deletion of peripheral T cells occurs in the MRL+\/+ but not in the MRL-lpr\/lpr strain. Therefore, the fas gene plays an essential role in activation-induced cell death in mature T lymphocytes, but not in the negative selection of immature cells in the thymus.","5469":"To study the contribution of putative perforin-independent mechanism in the antigen-specific target destruction by cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD8+ CTL lines were established from spleen cells of chimeric mice produced by injecting perforin (-\/-) embryonic stem cells into blastocysts of RAG-2(-\/-) mice. When tested on normal concanavalin A blasts, these perforin-deficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte lines were found to be capable of inducing antigen-specific target cell lysis accompanied by DNA degradation. In contrast, with target cells carrying a mutation in Fas molecule, perforin-independent cytotoxicity was not detectable. These data not only confirmed the primary role of perforin but simultaneously revealed a major contribution of a perforin-independent Fas-mediated pathway in antigen-specific cytolysis.","5470":"","5471":"An adoptive transfer system was used to monitor physically the behavior of a trace population of TCR transgenic T cells in vivo. After subcutaneous injection of antigen in adjuvant, the antigen-specific cells accumulated first in the paracortical region of the draining lymph nodes, proliferated there for several days, and then moved into lymph node follicles, where they accounted for most of the T cells. They then disappeared slowly from the draining nodes, and the remaining cells were hypersensitive to antigenic stimulation in vitro. In contrast, when the antigen was introduced into the blood, the antigen-specific cells rapidly accumulated in the paracortical regions of all lymph nodes, proliferated there for a short time, but never entered follicles. Most of the cells then rapidly disappeared, leaving behind a population that was hyporesponsive to antigenic stimulation. These results provide a physical basis for the classical finding that antigen-specific memory and tolerance can be influenced by the form of antigen administration.","5472":"The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is structurally similar to class I major histocompatibility molecules. FcRn transports maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) from ingested milk into the blood. IgG is bound at the pH of milk (pH 6.0-6.5) in the gut and released at the pH of blood (pH 7.5). We find that alteration of a histidine pair within the alpha 3 domain of FcRn and of a nearby loop (the FcRn counterpart of the class I CD8-binding loop) affects the affinity for IgG. Inhibition studies suggest the involvement of the FcRn B2-microglobulin domain in IgG binding. Fragment B of protein A inhibits FcRn binding to IgG, localizing the binding site on Fc for FcRn to the CH2-CH3 domain interface. Three histidines present at the CH2-CH3 domain interface of Fc could be partially responsible for the pH-dependent interaction between FcRn and IgG.","5473":"The precise time of appearance of the first hematopoietic stem cell activity in the developing mouse embryo is unknown. Recently the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region of the developing mouse embryo has been shown to possess hematopoietic colony-forming activity (CFU-S) in irradiated recipient mice. To determine whether the mouse embryo possesses definitive hematopoietic stem cell activity in the analogous AGM region and to determine the order of appearance of stem cells in the yolk sac, AGM region, and liver, we transferred these embryonic tissues into adult irradiated recipients. We report here the long-term, complete, and functional hematopoietic repopulation of primary and serial recipients with AGM-derived cells. We observe potent hematopoietic stem cell activity in the AGM region before the appearance of yolk sac and liver stem cell activity and discuss a model for the maturation of stem cell activity in mouse embryogenesis.","5474":"The CD8 coreceptor plays a critical role in the recognition of foreign antigens by mature T cells and in the development of class I-restricted T cells. CD8 can be expressed on the surface of T cells as either a heterodimer composed of an alpha and beta chain, or as a homodimer composed of two alpha chains. In this report, we show that a CD8 beta transgene that lacks a cytoplasmic domain can suppress expression of wild-type endogenous CD8 beta and act as a dominant negative mutation. We show that this dominant negative CD8 beta transgene interferes with the development of mature CD8 T cells to different extents depending on the individual class I-restricted TCR. These data suggest CD8 beta plays a role in thymic development, and that different class I-restricted TCRs differ in their dependence on the cytoplasmic tail of CD8 beta.","5475":"The CD4 and CD8 coreceptors have been shown to play significant roles in the differentiation and activation of helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), respectively. Coordinate binding of coreceptor and T cell receptor (TCR) to the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule and coreceptor interaction with the tyrosine kinase p56lck are required for effective signaling. Whereas CD4 is a monomer, CD8 consists of either alpha alpha homodimers or alpha beta heterodimers. Signaling properties of CD8 have been ascribed to the alpha chain, which binds to both the MHC class I and to p56lck, respectively. To study CD8 beta specifically, we have generated mice defective in its expression. We observe a significant reduction in the numbers of CD8+ T cells, but these cells have normal CTL activity. By breeding CD8 beta null mice with animals expressing a class I-specific TCR transgene, we show that CD8 beta plays a significant role in both positive and negative selection of developing thymocytes.","5476":"Thymocyte differentiation proceeds from double positive CD4+CD8+ to single positive T cells. It has been proposed that this process occurs by an instructive or a stochastic mechanism. In this report, we show that in recombination-deficient mice (RAG-1-I-) constitutive expression of a CD8 transgene allows maturation of CD4+(CD8tg+) cells, which express mature levels of a transgenic class I-restricted T cell receptor, F5. Rescued F5+CD4+(CD8tg+) cells have equivalent levels of T cell receptor expression as CD8end+ cells, respond to cognate antigen and, upon stimulation, they exhibit a phenotype characteristic of CD4+ helper T cells. These data are consistent with a model of differentiation that predicts that thymocytes become functionally committed to a helper or cytotoxic lineage before the final step of positive selection and independently of MHC specificity of their T cell receptor.","5477":"Expression of the T cell receptor beta (TCR beta) chain is necessary for the transition from the CD4CD8- stage in the major alpha beta thymocyte lineage. The protein tyrosine kinase p56lck has been implicated in the regulation of early thymocyte differentiation and of allelic exclusion at the TCR beta locus. Using mice overexpressing an activated lck transgene and mice with a disruption of the lck gene, we demonstrate that p56lck participates in a pathway that regulates the expansion of the pool of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to wild-type levels. In addition, p56lck may be involved in the down-regulation of the putative pre-TCR on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.","5478":"","5479":"We investigated the role of blood dendritic cells (DCs) in transmission of HIV-1 from infected to uninfected CD4+ T cells, and the accessory molecules involved. DCs promoted transmission from infected to uninfected CD4+ cells, but DCs themselves were not infectable. DC-mediated transmission was blocked by MAb to CD4 and MHC class II, but strongly increased by MAb to CD40 on DCs or CD28 on T cells. The DC-dependent infection was inhibitable by anti-CD80 and a soluble fusion protein of the CD80 ligand, CTLA4; soluble CTLA4 immunoglobulin also blocked infection augmented by cross-linking CD40. These data suggest a linkage between CD40-CD40L and CD28-CD80 counterreceptors on DCs and T cells, and spread of HIV infection in vivo.","5480":"L-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule expressed by leukocytes, mediates the attachment of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules (HEV) of peripheral lymph nodes and mediates the earliest interactions between leukocytes and activated vascular endothelium. Mice possessing a mutant L-selectin gene that results in the complete loss of cell surface receptor expression were generated by gene targeting. Lymphocytes from these mice did not bind to peripheral lymph node HEV and these mice had a severe reduction in the number of lymphocytes localized to peripheral lymph nodes. Short-term homing experiments demonstrated that L-selectin was also involved in lymphocyte migration to mucosal lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and spleen. Furthermore, significant defects in leukocyte rolling and neutrophil migration into the peritoneum in response to an inflammatory stimulus were observed. Thus, L-selectin plays an essential role in leukocyte homing to lymphoid tissues and sites of inflammation.","5481":"We developed two distinct transgenic mouse models in which virus induced insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In one of these lines, the unique viral transgene was expressed in the islets of Langerhans and also in the thymus, but in the other line, expression was only in the islets. Insertion and expression of the viral (self) gene, per se, did not lead to IDDM, (incidence &lt; 5%). By contrast, induction of an anti-self (anti-viral) CD8+ CTL response to the same virus later in life caused IDDM (incidence &lt; 90%) in both transgenic lines, although the kinetics and requirements for CD4 help, the affinity and avidity of CD8+ CTL differed in each line. Mice not expressing the viral (self) gene in the thymus developed IDDM 10-14 days after infection. CD4+ T cells played no detectable role, since their depletion failed to alter either the kinetics or incidence of IDDM. By contrast, mice that expressed the viral gene in the thymus required significantly more time to develop IDDM. Their anti-self (viral) CD8+ CTL were of lower affinity and avidity than CD8+ CTL generated by nontransgenic controls. Disease was dependent on T cell help, since deletion of CD4+ cells completely circumvented the IDDM.","5482":"Susceptibility to glomerulonephritis (GN) and anti-dsDNA autoantibody production was analyzed in crosses with a newly developed systemic lupus erythematosus-susceptible inbred strain, NZM\/Aeg2410. The mode of inheritance and the number and location of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated susceptibility loci were analyzed by interval mapping in a backcross with C57BL\/6. Three chromosomal intervals containing strong recessive GN susceptibility alleles were identified on chromosomes 1, 4, and 7, each containing several potentially interesting candidate genes. Heterozygosity at H-2 was also found to correlate strongly with GN susceptibility, consistent with previous findings in the NZB\/NZW parental strain model. Logistic regression analysis indicated that each of these susceptibility alleles independently accounted for a component of GN susceptibility, and that susceptibility was inherited as a threshold genetic liability in this model system.","5483":"A locus control region (LCR) is a set of cis-acting elements that regulate chromatin accessibility of a gene locus. In the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha\/delta locus, an LCR might regulate the differential tissue and developmental expression and the rearrangement of TCR alpha and delta genes. We have localized a region 3' of the TCR alpha\/delta locus containing eight T cell-specific nuclease hypersensitive domains (HS-1 to HS-8), which fit the characteristics of an LCR. In transgenic mice, a TCR alpha gene linked to this region is expressed at a high level, independent of the site of integration and correlates with gene copy number. The transgene is expressed in the alpha beta but not the gamma delta T cell subset and is activated at the right time during development. Proper LCR function requires the region containing HS-2 to HS-6. We propose a model of LCR competition to explain the differential regulation of TCR alpha versus delta genes during development.","5484":"In vivo thymocyte maturation models were used to investigate the differentiation role of Bcl-2. In alpha\/beta T cell receptor (TCR) class II-restricted transgenic mice, Bcl-2 was upregulated at the CD4+ CD8+ stage during positive selection. The lckpr-bcl2 transgene was bred onto MHC classes I-I- and II-I-, MHC-I-, and alpha\/beta TCR backgrounds to determine whether Bcl-2 promoted thymocyte maturation in the absence of coreceptor-MHC interaction. Bcl-2 rescued CD8+ thymocytes in class I-I- and alpha\/beta TCR in mice; however, they were not exported to the periphery. Bcl-2 had no effect on CD4 lineage maturation in class II-I- mice. No single-positive thymocytes accumulate in MHC-I- mice despite overexpressed Bcl-2. Thus, Bcl-2 enables selection of certain TCRs on class II molecules and their differentiation along the CD8 pathway; however, Bcl-2 did not substitute for positive selection. In RAG-1-I- mice, Bcl-2 promoted differentiation to the CD4+ CD8+ stage. Bcl-2 can promote thymocyte maturation at several control points.","5485":"Primary B cells are induced to proliferate by cross-linking surface immunoglobulin or by its pharmacological equivalent, phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. However, nuclear responses that have been studied in activated B cells are typically inducible with phorbol esters alone. We show that a factor, indistinguishable from the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), is induced in B cells in response to anti-immunoglobulin signals or the combined action of phorbol ester and ionomycin, but not in response to either reagent alone. The signals necessary for NF-AT induction in B cells, therefore, closely parallel those required to induce B cell proliferation. Transfection analysis shows that B cell NF-AT is a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, NF-AT induction in splenic cells is suppressed by cyclosporin A, suggesting a mechanism by which immunosuppressive agents act on the B cell compartment. We propose that NF-AT should be considered more generally as a nuclear factor of activated lymphoid cells.","5486":"We show here that ligation of surface immunoglobulin or CD40 receptors in conjunction with interleukin-4 induces the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) in normal murine B cells, which is inhibited by cyclosporin (CsA). Lipopolysaccharide, which activates B cells by a Ca(2+)-independent, CsA-resistant pathway, does not induce NF-AT. The NF-AT complex in T cells and B cells appears to be identical, comprising both Fos and Jun proteins and the 120 kDa cytosolic component of NF-AT (NF-ATp). Our transfection experiments using a trimerized NF-AT site linked to the minimal IL-2 promoter driving luciferase activity demonstrate that NF-AT is functional in A20 B-lymphoma cells. These results therefore suggest that the induction of NF-AT forms part of the B cell response to both cross-linking antigens and T cell-generated signals.","5487":"An engagement of CD40 with CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on activated T cells is known to provide an essential costimulatory signal to B cells in vitro. To investigate the role of CD40 in in vivo immune responses, CD40-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. The significant reduction of CD23 expression on mature B cells and relatively decreased number of IgM bright and IgD dull B cells were observed in the mutant mice. The mutant mice mounted IgM responses but no IgG, IgA, and IgE responses to thymus-dependent (TD) antigens. However, IgG as well as IgM responses to thymus-independent (TI) antigens were normal. Furthermore, the germinal center formation was defective in the mutant mice. These results suggest that CD40 is essential for T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching and germinal center formation, but not for in vivo T cell-dependent IgM responses and T cell-independent antibody responses.","5488":"The gene for the mouse Fas ligand was cloned and its chromosomal position determined. Fasl was tightly linked to gld (no crossovers in 567 meiotic events) on mouse chromosome 1 and closely linked with a novel member of the same TNF family of ligands, the Ox40 ligand (Ox40l, 1 crossover in 567 meiotic events). Southern blot analysis did not reveal any difference between the Fasl gene from gld and wild-type mice and levels of Fasl mRNA transcripts were similar in PMA and ionomycin induced wild-type and coisogenic gld T cells. Sequence analysis of the gld gene indicated a single amino acid change (Phe Leu) in the COOH terminal portion of this type II transmembrane protein, and COS cells transfected with Fasl cDNA from gld mice failed to induce apoptosis of Fas-expressing target cells. Thus, the data demonstrate that the gld phenotype is the result of a point mutation in the Fasl gene and that Fasl is part of a complex of ligands structurally related to TNF mapping within a small region of mouse chromosome 1.","5489":"Susceptibility to spondyloarthropathies is strongly associated with the MHC class I molecule HLA-B27, and is hypothesized to result from the presentation of arthritogenic peptides. Subtypes of B27 that differ structurally but are disease-associated ought to be capable of presenting such peptides, while nondisease-associated subtypes would not. We demonstrate that B*2703, the predominant West African B27 subtype that may not predispose to disease, is not recognized by most B*2705-alloreactive CTL, and does not efficiently present a known B*2705-restricted influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) peptide. We show inefficient presentation is due to a reduced binding affinity of B*2703 for the NP peptide. Furthermore, substituting Arg for the naturally occurring Ser at P1 of the NP peptide, restores high affinity binding and efficient presentation by B*2703. Our results suggest that B*2703 will bind and present efficiently only a subset of the peptides that bind to B*2705, in particular those with Arg or Lys at P1. The apparent lack of disease in individuals with B*2703 may be due to an inability to bind and present putative arthritogenic peptides.","5490":"Activation of T cells has been shown to require CD45. CD45 is expressed on T cells as distinct isoforms and these isoforms are expressed differentially on subsets of CD4 T cells. We have generated T cell lines expressing a T cell receptor (TCR) of known specificity, with or without CD4, and examined the effect of different CD45 isoforms on stimulation through the antigen receptor. We find that isoforms differ in their ability to participate in antigen recognition, with the null isoform that is predominantly found on memory CD4 T cells being the most effective. The ability of the CD4 T cells being the most effective. The ability of the CD45 ectodomain to differentially affect sensitivity to specific ligands represents a novel way of regulating the efficacy of signaling through a receptor without altering its specificity. It may play a crucial role both in immunological memory and during intrathymic maturation of T cells.","5491":"RAG-1 and RAG-2 are developmentally regulated genes that are essential for the assembly of antigen receptors in lymphoid cells. Here we describe transgenic mice that carry RAG-1 and RAG-2 under the control of the proximal lck promoter. Persistent expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 was associated with incomplete thymopoiesis and profoundly compromised cellular immunity. In addition, RAG transgenic mice rapidly developed lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and lymphocytic perivascular infiltrates. These effects required both RAG-1 and RAG-2, since mice that carried either gene exclusively were indistinguishable from wild-type controls. We propose that in addition to a previously documented role in V(D)J recombination, RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression must be properly regulated for completion of normal T cell development","5492":"The identification is made in normal mice of the stages in T cell development at which the rearranged beta chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) is utilized to promote T cell maturation, independent of the TCR alpha chain. In addition, evidence is provided that utilization of beta chains in T cell progenitors does not preclude differentiation to TCR gamma delta + T cells. This is consistent with the view that an initial consequence of beta chain expression by early thymocytes is clonal expansion, increasing the size of the pool of useful precursors. This allows the proposal to be made that allelic exclusion may be a byproduct of cell cycle regulation during early thymocyte differentiation, which may in turn explain why the efficiency of allelic exclusion varies at different TCR or immunoglobulin loci.","5493":"T cell tolerance to peripheral antigens is believed to result mainly from the inability of parenchymal cells to present antigens in an immunogenic form due to the lack of expression of T cell costimulator. We found, however, that transgenic expression of the T cell costimulator B7-1 on the islets of Langerhans is not sufficient to abolish the in vivo tolerance to islets antigen. Here, we present evidence indicating that the level of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expressed by islet cells plays a critical role. Mice coexpressing the B7-1 transgene and high levels of the class II MHC antigen I-E on the islets develop an autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. By contrast, expression of the I-E molecule by islets, in the absence of T cell costimulator, leads to specific tolerance of these autoreactive T cells that cannot be reversed by costimulation with B7-1.","5494":"APC-associated B7 and ETC-1\/B7-2 are two major costimulatory molecules for full activation of T lymphocytes during auto- and allogeneic immune responses. In this report, we further examine the role of the two molecules in murine CD4+ T cell activation and anergy development. As suggested in antibody blocking studies, optimal activation of CD4+ T cells in response to anti-CD3 stimulation requires collaborative signaling through the two molecules. Simultaneous blockade of B7 and ETC-1\/B7-2 renders CD4+ T cells unresponsive to anti-CD3 restimulation. PCR analysis and cytokine reconstitution studies show that the observed unresponsiveness is correlated to a significant reduction of Th1-type cytokine production, suggesting B7 and ETC-1\/B7-2-mediated costimulatory signaling may be specifically active in regulation of the function of the Th1 subset.","5495":"Neutrophil tethering and rolling in shear flow are mediated by selectins and have been thought to be two indistinguishable manifestations of a single molecular interaction between selectin and ligand. However, we report that under physiologic flow conditions, tethering to E-selectin requires a ligand distinct from the one that supports neutrophil rolling. Tethering under shear to E-selectin requires a carbohydrate ligand that is closely associated with the lectin domain of L-selectin on the neutrophil surface, as enzymatic removal of L-selectin, chemotactic factor-induced shedding of L-selectin, and L-selectin MAbs effectively block tethering. In contrast, this ligand is dispensable for the ability to roll on E-selectin, since rolling adhesions formed after static incubations were not affected by the presence or absence of L-selectin. Thus, E-selectin interactions with ligands on neutrophils persist after L-selectin shedding. These findings add an additional step for regulation of leukocyte localization in inflammatory sites.","5496":"Peripheral immunological tolerance is traditionally explained by mechanisms for deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cell clones. Using an autoimmune disease model combining transgenic mice expressing a well-defined antigen, influenza hemagglutinin (HA), on islet beta cells (Ins-HA), and a T cell receptor transgene (TCR-HNT) specific for a class II-restricted HA peptide, we demonstrate that the conventional assumptions do not apply to this in vivo situation. Double transgenic mice displayed either resistance or susceptibility to spontaneous autoimmune disease, depending on genetic contributions from either of two common inbred mouse strains, BALB\/c or B10.D2. Functional studies on autoreactive CD4+ T cells from resistant mice showed that, contrary to expectations, neither clonal anergy, clonal deletion, nor receptor desensitization was induced; rather, there was a non-MHC-encoded predisposition toward differentiation to a nonpathogenic effector (Th2 versus Th1) phenotype. T cells from resistant double transgenic mice showed evidence for prior activation by antigen, suggesting that disease may be actively suppressed by autoreactive Th2 cells. These findings shed light on functional aspects of genetically determined susceptibility to autoimmunity, and should lead to new therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling the differentiation of autoreactive CD4+ effector T cells in vivo.","5497":"The peptide selectivity of the human transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) was investigated using a panel of peptides of varying length and sequence. Peptides were assayed for their ability to compete for the translocation of a labeled reporter peptide containing an N-linked glycosylation acceptor site in Streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized cells. We find that human TAP is very promiscuous for peptides in the 8-12 amino acid range, while showing increased selectivity and lower translocation efficiency for peptides in the 13-30 amino acid range. The minimum peptide length appears to be 8 amino acids, while the maximum length appears to be approximately 25 amino acids. Furthermore, a photoactive peptide analogue was synthesized that can photolabel TAP molecules. Using this analogue, we showed that an ATP-independent peptide-binding site exists on TAP, and that competition for translocation reflects competition for peptide binding.","5498":"To determine the potential roles of c-jun in lymphocyte development, we generated somatic chimeric mice by injecting homozygous c-jun mutant embryonic stem (ES) cells into blastocysts from recombination activating gene-2 (RAG-2)-deficient mice. Chimeric mice had poor restoration of thymocytes, but contained substantial numbers of mature T and B lymphocytes in the periphery. Stimulation of c-jun-\/- B cells resulted in normal levels of proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. Likewise, stimulation of c-jun-\/- T cells resulted in essentially normal levels of IL-2R alpha expression, IL-2 secretion, and proliferation. We further showed that the relatively normal activation responses of the c-jun-\/- T cells probably results from the fact that other members of the Jun family contribute to the bulk of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complexes in normal T cells and, as a result, AP-1 complexes are found at relatively normal levels in c-jun-\/- T cells.","5499":"We examined the human xenoresponse to cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs). Human CD8+ T cells proliferate to resting MHC class I-positive PAECs. CD4+ T cells proliferate after MHC class II molecules are induced with swine interferon-gamma. These responses are greater than corresponding allogeneic responses to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Limiting dilution analysis shows a 10-fold higher frequency of xenoreactive than alloreactive anti-endothelial lymphocytes. Species-specific monoclonal antibodies suggest that PAECs directly present swine MHC antigens to human T cells and that human CD4 and CD8 molecules participate in this interaction. Furthermore, PAECs bind CTLA-4-Ig and costimulate human T cells by both the CD2 and CD28 pathways. In contrast, HUVECs do not bind CTLA-4-Ig and only use the CD2 pathway.","5500":"Antigenic stimulation of CD4\/CD8 double positive (DP) thymocytes results in programmed cell death, while the identical stimulation of mature T cells results in proliferation and lymphokine secretion. Using thymocytes from transgenic mice expressing pigeon cytochrome c-specific T cell receptors, we previously demonstrated that major histocompatibility complex class II-transfected L cells were capable of presenting peptide antigen and inducing programmed cell death in DP thymocytes, as well as proliferation and lymphokine secretion in mature CD4 single positive (SP) T cells. We therefore were interested in utilizing this system to compare antigen-induced signal transduction events in DP thymocytes and mature SP T cells. In this report, we demonstrate that significant distinctions between thymocytes and mature T cells are seen upon examination of antigen sensitivity and the phosphatidylinositol signaling cascade.","5501":"T cells are not only required for resistance to tuberculosis, but they likely contribute to the tissue damage characteristic of the disease. To define better the T cell populations that contribute to the immunopathogenesis of human tuberculosis, we investigated the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain repertoire expressed in patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry indicated an expansion of V beta 8+ T cells at the site of disease in some donors, suggesting the possibility that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a superantigen. M. tuberculosis induced strong T cell proliferative responses in tuberculin-negative healthy donors in vitro, with preferential expansion of V beta 8+ T cells, independent of the CDR3 region. T cell stimulation was MHC class II-dependent and did not require antigen processing by the antigen-presenting cells. These findings are consistent with the presence of a superantigen in M. tuberculosis, aspects of which may contribute to the immunopathology of tuberculosis and to the adjuvant properties of M. tuberculosis.","5502":"","5503":"Mouse mammary tumor viruses produce superantigens (vSAGs) which interact with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and stimulate T cells. vSAGs are synthesized as Type II membrane proteins, but at least one of these proteins (vSAG7) is found on the cell surface in a proteolytically processed form. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were used to characterize vSAG7 and its binding to class II molecules. vSAG7 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a 45 kd glycoprotein containing N-asparagine-linked oligomannosyl carbohydrates. vSAG7 transits the golgi complex, where it is modified by the addition of complex-type glycans and proteolysed at three positions. After proteolysis, the amino and carboxyl termini remain noncovalently associated. The ER, golgi, and surface forms of vSAG7 are stably bound to class II, but one of the proteolysed forms comprises the majority of the class II-bound material.","5504":"We show here that the net rate of accumulation of complexes formed by the antigen-specific receptor of T cells (TCR) of a T cell clone with its natural ligand, an octapeptide in association with Ld, a class I protein of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), approaches the maximal value determined by the affinity of the TCR for this peptide-MHC ligand in 1-2 min, which is well within the lifetime of transient T cell-target cell conjugates. Consistent with this finding, we also found that the widely divergent affinity values (equilibrium constants) of this TCR for six related peptide-MHC complexes correlate well with the extent of specific lysis of target cells bearing various level of these complexes."},"articletitle":{"0":"Tissue remodeling by an opportunistic pathogen triggers allergic inflammation.","1":"Multimodal profiling of lung granulomas in macaques reveals cellular correlates of tuberculosis control.","2":"Analysis of mRNA vaccination-elicited RBD-specific memory B cells reveals strong but incomplete immune escape of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.","3":"Combined protein and nucleic acid imaging reveals virus-dependent B cell and macrophage immunosuppression of tissue microenvironments.","4":"Analysis of memory B cells identifies conserved neutralizing epitopes on the N-terminal domain of variant SARS-Cov-2 spike proteins.","5":null,"6":"The interferon-stimulated gene RIPK1 regulates cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade.","7":"Nonresolving inflammation redux.","8":"The lung-brain axis: A new frontier in host-microbe interactions.","9":"Fungus packs a punch in the gut.","10":null,"11":"RIP(K)ing away immunotherapy resistance.","12":"DC1s shield Tpex cells to bolster PD-1 blockade.","13":"Expelliarmus helminthus!
