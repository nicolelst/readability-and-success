Purified protein derivative (PPD) of M. tuberculosis was used for testing of specific cell-mediated immunity in the same two groups. The reactivity to both PHA and PPD was found to be significantly lower in patients with RA, indicating the decreased cell-mediated immunity in this disease, as compared to controls.","3":"1. The detection and quantitation of immune complex-like material in synovial fluid and in serum from patients with joint diseases was done through the measurement of the capacity to bind radiolabeled C1q. It was found that 65% of synovial fluid samples from seropositive or seronegative RA patients had a high C1q binding capacity as compared to other joint diseases. Immune complex-like material was also detected in 63% of serum samples from seropositive RA patients. 2. The existence of C3 or C3PA breakdown products in synovial fluid from most of the synovial fluids from RA patients probably reflects an activation of the complement system occurring in both forms of the disease. C3PA breakdown products were never found in degenerative or post-traumatic joint diseases and only occasionally in other inflammatory arthritis. Apart from their pathogenic significance, these results may have some interest for the clinical investigation of patients with joint diseases.","4":"Ten day embryonated eggs have been used for testing supernatants of pooled RA synovial tissues for the presence of the RA-active agent. A high thermal resistance of the agent was observed up to 40 min of heating both at 100 and 121 degrees C with complete loss of infectivity only after 60 min at 121 degrees C. The high thermal resistance at 121 degrees C suggested that the active agent does not depend on a double-stranded DNA or RNA. It probably has no protein component and has a minimal number of subunits for replication. The CsC1 ultracentrifugation identified a concentration of high infectivity at densities in the range of 1.440-1.490 g\/ml in five experiments.","5":"We have interpreted the above findings as implying that the changes seen may have arisen as a result of co-cultivation, albeit accidental, of Chang cells and cells derived from RA synovial tissue or fluid. A further obvious approach to this problem is to attempt deliberately to repeat the co-cultivation of Chang cells with RA synovial fluids.","6":"The pattern of complement component utilization within the joint space of patients with RA is consistent with activation by immune complexes. Immunogluorescent studies of SF leukocytes revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions of immunoglobulins and complement components, particularly in cells from SF with low complement levels and containing materials which precipitated with either C1q and\/or rheumatoid factor. RA patients with low levels of SF complement tended to have an unremitting course, subcutaneous nodules, and to have been treated with gold. Their joints had more periarticular demineralization, joint space narrowing, cortical impaction by X-ray; and synoviocytic giant cells, fibrosis, lymphocytes, congestion, and fibrin exudation by pathologic examination than did joints of RA patients without low levels of SF complement. Patients with systemic hypocomplementemia had active classical RA with evidence of severe joint involvement and vasculitis. These findings suggest that rheumatoid inflammation of joints is mediated by immunologic activation of the complement system.","7":"The failure to isolate conventional mycoplasmas from 88 synovial membranes and 119 synovial fluids from patients with proven rheumatoid arthritis using a variety of culture media and techniques agrees with the results of recent workers and suggests that these organisms are unlikely to play a role in the aetiology of the disease. In contrast, 'diphtheroid' organisms were isolated from 27 to 30% of rheumatoid specimens, but not from cultures of non-rheumatoid material. A significantly higher incidence of raised agglutination titres to C. acnes and to a 'diptheroid' isolated from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis supports the conclusion that these organisms are present in the joints in such patients, though their role in this disease has yet to be established.","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"Human lymphocytes were separated into highly purified populations using an immunoadsorbent column technique. It was previously reported that both T and B cells exhibited increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in response to PHA, Con A and pokeweed mitogens, whereas only T cells showed increased incorporation in response to specific antigen. In the present studies, the cellular basis of MIF and mitogenic factor production was studied. Both T and B cells produced MIF in response to antigen. The MIF produced by both T and B cells elutes from Sephadex G-100 columns in the same fraction. Studies using BUdR and light suggest that the T cell which produces MIF is also a proliferating cell, whereas the B cell producing MIF is not. Only T cells produce mitogenic factor in response to antigen. The mitogenic factor produced, however, causes both T and B cell populations to increase 3H-thymidine incorporation. The present studies indicate that antigen induced mitogenic factor production and increased 3H-thymidine incorporation are properties of T cells per se, whereas antigen-induced MIF is made by both T and B cells.","12":"","13":"The origin of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is in our opinion a bacterial infection. The infection gives rise to changes in the macrophages, with release of enzymes, etc., and secondarily abnormal immune processes occur. In favor of this opinion is, among other things, the similarity with rheumatic fever, which is caused by streptococci group A, as well as experience gained in connection with experimentally provoked arthritis. In experimental arthritis, produced by streptococci group B (Svartz), there appears in rats the same type of joint disease as in human RA and, besides, a rheumatoid factor (RF)-like macroglobulin, which cannot be distinguished by available methods from human RF macroglobulin. A 7 S hemagglutinating RF (RF II) was also produced in animals, as well as some other immunoglobulins. The RF II has a much weaker hemagglutinating capacity than the usual RF macroglobulin which for comparison could be termed RF I. The streptococci B used in our investigations were mostly isolated from the nasopharynx of RA patients.","14":"Synovitis was produced in the rabbit knee by repeated intraarticular injection of a preparation of mediators of cellular immunity. The mediators were prepared by incubation of KLH with lymph node cells of animals previously immunized with KLH in Freund's adjuvant. Following three intraarticular injections, a chronic synovitis resulted in which hyperplasia of the lining layer and infiltration of the sublining layer occurred. The cell types in the sublining layer were predominantly histiocytes and fibroblasts. These experiments demonstrate that mediators of cellular immunity may produce a chronic inflammatory reaction when injected repeatedly into normal joints. They indicate that the cellular immune response may play a role in the development of the synovitis of immunologically induced arthritides.","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients with positive tuberculin (PPD) skin-tests and controls were studied. The lymphocytes from these groups were cultured in serum-free medium to obtain cell-free supernatants. These lymphocyte cultures were pre-incubated with the appropriate antigen or reconstituted after removal of the cells. Supernatants from RA lymphocytes stimulated in vitro by IgG induced an inhibition of the leucocyte migration, as well as the supernatants from tuberculin-sensitized lymphocytes. However, supernatants from non-RA lymphocytes or tuberculin-unsensitized lymphocytes did not show such an inhibition. These MIF-like supernatants have been studied by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. A MIF activity has been found for PPD and IgG supernatants between the chymotrypsinogen (MW 23,000) and the lysozyme (MW 17,000). This seems to agree with the classical region where MIF can be usually isolated.","20":"Previous work suggests that peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis have altered reactivity. The purpose of this study has been to observe the behavior of cultures of lymphocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis when stimulated with autologous 19S rheumatoid factor and with rabbit serum against autologous IgG fraction. The peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 15 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis were obtained by passage of the leukocyte-rich plasma through a polyamide fiber column. The purified lymphocytes were cultured with rheumatoid factor obtained from the same donor through Sephadex G-200 chromatography. In another set of experiments rheumatoid lymphocytes were stimulated with rabbit serum containing antibodies against the IgG fraction of the same patient obtained through DEAE chromatography. After five days the lymphocytes were examined for large cells plus cells in mitosis. A positive response was defined as an increase of 5% or more in the experimental tubes when compared with the cells cultured alone. Ten healthy normal subjects were used also as lymphocyte and serum donors. These lymphocytes were cultured alone and with rabbit serum, anti-autologous IgG. 80% of rheumatoid lymphocytes responded with an average of 37% of enlarging and dividing cells when stimulated by autologous RF. The same pannel of lymphocytes responded only with an average of 14% stimulation when cultured with rabbit serum anti-autologous IgG. The response to the 7S antigammaglobulin factor from rabbit in 7 normal PBL was similar to that of rheumatoid lymphocytes. There was some relation between activity of the RA and lymphocyte response to RF and rabbit antiserum. These results could explain the lymphoid infiltration and hyperplasia of patients with RA and, on the other hand, would support the idea that entrapment of RF by leukocytes ('RA cell') would be a protective mechanism.","21":"","22":"The chronic, rheumatoid synovitis in four patients (two children and two adults) with immunodeficiency was studied by means of immunopathological examination of synovial tissues and fluids. Their immunodeficiencies were extensively studied, with various tests for humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The two children were boys with Bruton's disease. One adult, female, had common variable immunodeficiency. One adult male had severe hypogammaglobulinemia. All patients had isolated deposits of complement component C3 in their synovial membranes, usually without traces of immunoglobulins. Depressed levels of complement component C3 were found in the joint fluid, in contrast to high levels in the corresponding serum in one patient. Components of the alternate pathway, properdin and C3A, were found in the tissues, but not components of the classic pathway, C1q and C4. The findings suggest that chronic, rheumatoid arthritis in hypogammaglobulinemic patients may be related to activation of C3 by the alternate pathway.","23":"The presence of a serum factor secreted by the thymus has been demonstrated in the serum of mice and man using a rosette inhibition assay. This factor is a peptide with a molecular weight close to 1,000. Its level is age dependent, being stable until the age of 6 months in mice and until 20 years in man. New Zealand Black mice show a premature cessation of thymic hormone secretion preceeding the onset of other T cell abnormalities and auto-immunity. Before any treatment the serum thymic hormone level is abnormally low in most cases of SLE even in patients under 25, an age where control subjects still show high hormone levels. Conversely, normal or high levels are found in RA, PARTICularly in patients over 40 who showed in 60% of cases a hormone level significantly higher than normal controls of the same age. In keeping with this data T cells evaluated by SRBC spontaneous rosette formation show low figures in some patients with active SLE and normal or high values in most cases of RA.","24":"","25":"","26":"Anti-lymphocyte antibodies have been demonstrated in patients with SLE and RA by immunofluorescence. They differ from those arising through iso-immunization by being cold reactive and chiefly of the IgM class. Separate anti specificities were shown for determinants on either T or B cells.","27":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 36 cases, and normal subjects, 49 cases were studied by lymphocyte cultures stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and Con A convalently bound to Sepharose 4 B (Con A-S). The comparisons between the two groups showed a significant difference between the RA lymphocytes and the control lymphocytes stimulated by PHA and Con A. However, no statistical difference was found between the two lymphocyte populations stimulated by PWM and Con A-S. In order to determine the lymphocyte population stimulated by each mitogen, separation of B and T cells from peripheral blood was performed according to the ability for the T cell population to bind the sheep red blood cells (rosette-forming cells). The T cell-rich population was only stimulated by PHA, Con A and PWM. Although the T cell-depleted population showed no response to these mitogens, a response to Con A-S was elicited.","28":"","29":"Comparison of virus antibody titers in JRA and matched controls failed to implicate rubella, measles, parainfluenza type 1 or Epstein-Barr viruses. Neither RNA viruses or mycoplasma were detected in rheumatoid synovial cell cultures by 3H-uridine incorporation. Mycoplasma were not isolated from rheumatoid synovial membranes or cell cultures using the large specimen-broth culture procedure. The balance of available evidence, including our own, suggests that mycoplasma are not involved in RA. Viruses, however, are better candidates, in spite of similar generally negative studies to date, because methods for detecting known latent infection in animals and in vitro are still in their infancy. Those that are known have not yet been comprehensively applied to RA. Thus, supported by indirect evidence from animal models and human diseases like polyarteritis, the hypothesis that viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of RA remains attractive, although direct evidence is still lacking.","30":"","31":"Knee joint arthritis is induced among rabbits previously immunized by intradermal injection with egg albumin (EA) emulsified in adjuvant containing either M. tuberculosis or M. butyricum, then by intra-articular injection with EA. Arthritis evolution involves two phases, an early one during the first 2 months and a late one from 3 months to 1 year. During the early phase, arthritis intensities are similar no matter which Mycobacterium is used. However, during the late phase, only rabbits immunized with M. tuberculosis develop self-perpetuating arthritis. Among more than 50% of arthritic rabbits, immunological lesions of aortic artery and cardiac valvules are found. Among the rabbits immunized with M. tuberculosis, the humoral anti-EA antibody level remains constant during the whole arthritis evolution; but, among the rabbits immunized with M. butyricum, the arthritis intensity decreases from 3 months of evolution. The correlation between arthritis index (AI) and humoral antibody level is only significant among the rabbits with early arthritis. The intradermally immunized rabbits show a positive skin test with EA and tuberculin. The more intense the cutaneous reactions, the greater the chances of developing self-perpetuating arthritis after the EA intra-articular injection. The fluorescent anit-EA antibodies in the synovia and spleen are found only among the early arthritis. After 2 months of evolution, fluorescent antibodies disappear whatever the immunization may be. Among the immunized rabbits, it is probable that antigenic EA does not persist in the synovia. Indeed, the autologous inflamed synovia transplantation, from the donor-challenged knee joint, does not develop an inflammatory reaction in the non-challenged knee joint. The fluorescent immunoglobulins IgG and IgM in the synovium of arthritic rabbits are found with the same percentages as fluorescent anti-EA antibodies. The lymphocyte response to EA, PHA and PWM are positive whatever the immunization and arthritis evolution may be. There is no correlation between AIs and lymphocyte responses to specific and nonspecific mitogens. It is probable that self-perpetuation depends closely on M. tuberculosis whose adjuvant power is much superior than M. butyricum and not on antigenic EA whose essential role would be to trigger the inflammatory process.","32":"The role of acute inflammation and of specific antibody in the retention of antigen in joint collagenous tissues of immunized rabbits was examined. The role of the acute synovitis occurring immediately after IA antigen injection in the retention of immune complexes was investigated by the concomitant IA injection of trace amounts of 1258-BSA and mono-sodium urate crystals and by the production of an acute Arthus reaction using an unrelated antigen in doubly immunized rabbits. In neither case was more 125I-BSA retained in the inflamed joint tissues compared to the contralateral noninflamed joints 7 days after antigen injection. In addition, immunized rabbits depleted of ciruclating polymorphonuclear leukocytes by previous treatment with nitrogen mustard retained 2.7 times more antigen than control, nonimmune animals. In another experiment, antigen retention in joint collagenous tissues was greatest 30 min after IA injection, before the appearance of acute inflammatory synovitis. These findings suggest that acute inflammation is not a major factor in the retention of antigen in collagenous tissues. To investigate the role of antibody in the retention of antigen, nonimmune rabbits were injected i.v. with purified anti-BSA antibody three days prior to the intraarticular injection of BSA. Over 20 times more antigen was retained irreversibly in collagenous tissues obtained from the injected joints of passively immunized animals as compared to similar tissues of control rabbits. When rabbits were injected i.v. with purified anti-BSA antibody and either killed 20 min or 3 days later, in vitro binding of antigen by joint collagenous tissues was seen only in animals where antibody was allowed to equilibrate with the extravascular space for 3 days. These findings indicate that retention of antigen depends on the presence of extravascular antibody. It is concluded that the trapping of immune complexes in collagenous joint tissues of immunized animals depends on: (1) the presence of antibody in the extravascular space; (2) the diffusion of antigen or soluble complexes into this space; (3) the interaction of antigen or soluble complexes with extravascular antibody with subsequent formation of larger and more insoluble complexes, and (4) the trapping of these complexes in the collagen fiber meshwork.","33":"The knee joint in rabbits has been used as an arthritis model for the study of acute immunologic injury. Histologic examination of synovium plus a standardized procedure for irrigating inflammatory exudate from the joint allowed study of damage due to immune complexes, urate crystals, and Arthus type vascular lesions by multiple parameters. With this model Arthus lesions could be abolished with neutrophil depletion and reconstituted with intra-articular injection of neutrophil suspension. The rate and degree of injury could also be diminished by depletion of complement components.","34":"Peripheral blood lymphocytes from some rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients show a reduced response to PHA when stimulated directly after isolation from blood. Cells which have been preincubated in medium with normal serum for 22 h before exposure to PHA show a relatively enhanced response, which approximates the normal. These findings could be compatible either with the blocking of surface PHA receptors of circulating RA lymphocytes, or with progressive maturation of these cells in vitro. Preincubation does not enhance the relatively reduced response of RA lymphocytes to allogeneic RA lymphocytes in one-way mixed lymphocyte cultures. An increased reduction in response to PHA following irradiation of RA lymphocytes suggests an increased radiosensitivity of the PHA-responsive subpopulation. This abnormally reduced response was not seen if the cells were preincubated in vitro prior to irradiation.","35":"","36":"An anaphylactic mechanism involving IgE-sensitized basophils is necessary for immune complex deposition in rabbits. Basophils under stimulation by the IgE-bound antigen actively release a platelet-activating factor. Increased vascular permeability results from action of vasoactive amines from basophils and from aggregated platelets and possibly direct action of PAF on vascular walls. This allows trapping of circulating complexes along vascular membranes. Once deposited complexes produce tissue injury by neutrophil-complement-dependent mechanisms. However, complex deposition seems pathogenic in itself for the glomerular basement membrane. PAF is a 1,100-dalton MW lipid, with hydrophobic properties and positive charge; it exists in human basophils. Patients suffering from SLE or undergoing anaphylactic shocks exhibit marked reduction of basophil counts and PAF level. We propose that anaphylactic increase of vasopermeability may be a common feature at early stages of many immune diseases associated with severe structural injury.","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Blood and tissue distribution of lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.","1":"Enhancement of immunoglobulin and rheumatoid factor synthesis by rheumatoid synovial effusions and synovial membrane culture supernatants.","2":"Screening of cellular immunity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by phytohaemagglutinin skin test.","3":"Complement activation in seropositive and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. 125I-C1q binding capacity and complement breakdown products in serum and synovial fluid.","4":"Thermal inactivation and gradient studies of the active agent in rheumatoid arthritis.","5":"Co-cultivation of human cell lines with synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","6":"Rheumatoid synovitis: complement and immune complexes.","7":"Mycoplasmas and 'diphtheroids' in rheumatoid arthritis.","8":"The role of bacterial adjuvant in experimental arthritis.","9":"Radioimmunoassay of the rheumatoid factors.","10":"The significance of leucocyte migration inhibition by M. fermentans.","11":"Studies on the production of MIF and mitogenic factor using highly purified human T and B lymphocytes.","12":"Mycoplasma hyorhinis arthritis of swine: a model for rheumatoid arthritis?","13":"The origin of rheumatoid arthritis.","14":"Experimental arthritis produced by injection of mediators of delayed hypersensitivity.","15":"Immune complexes and induced release of lysosomal enzymes from mononuclear phagocytes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.","16":"Complement and pathogenesis of rheumatoid and non-rheumatoid synovitis.","17":"The properdin pathway: mechanisms of  complement activation and analogies to the classical pathway.","18":"Altered local metabolism of complement components in rheumatoid arthritis.","19":"Production of MIF-like supernatants by rheumatoid arthritis lymphocytes stimulated by immunoglobulin G.","20":"Study of the effects of antigammaglobulin factors on lymphocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","21":"Cryoglobulins in rheumatoid arthritis.","22":"Evidence for complement activation by the alternate pathway in the arthritis of hypogammaglobulinemic patients.","23":"Evaluation of serum thymic hormone and of circulating T cells in rheumatoid arthritis and in systemic lupus erythematosus.","24":"Lymphocyte subpopulations in rheumatoid arthritis.","25":"Studies on synovial fluid lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.","26":"Studies on antilymphocyte antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.","27":"Mitogens of B and T cells from peripheral blood in rheumatoid arthritis.","28":"Cellular reactions to mycoplasma and aggregated IgG in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","29":"Virologic studies in rheumatoid arthritis.","30":"Mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) in arthritides.","31":"Physiopathological aspect of Glynn's type of experimental arthritis.","32":"The mechanism of trapping of immune complexes in experimental antigen-induced arthritis.","33":"Arthritis in the rabbit knee joint: a quantitated model.","34":"Abnormalities of peripheral blood lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.","35":"Evidence for intracellular complement-fixing complexes of IgG rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid plasma cells.","36":"Passage of immune complexes through vascular walls.
