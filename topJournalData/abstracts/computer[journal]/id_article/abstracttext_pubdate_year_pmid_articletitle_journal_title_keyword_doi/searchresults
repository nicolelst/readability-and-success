But is simple compliance enough to result in behavior change?","2":"The automatic and unsupervised analysis of biomedical time series is of primary importance for diagnostic and preventive medicine, enabling fast and reliable data processing to reveal clinical insights without the need for human intervention. Representation learning (RL) methods perform an automatic extraction of meaningful features that can be used, e.g., for a subsequent classification of the measured data. The goal of this study is to explore and quantify the benefits of RL techniques of varying degrees of complexity, focusing on modern deep learning (DL) architectures. We focus on the automatic classification of atrial fibrillation (AF) events from noisy single-lead electrocardiographic signals (ECG) obtained from wireless sensors. This is an important task as it allows the detection of sub-clinical AF which is hard to diagnose with a short in-clinic 12-lead ECG. The effectiveness of the considered architectures is quantified and discussed in terms of classification performance, memory\/data efficiency and computational complexity.","3":"Health and well-being are shaped by how lifestyle and the environment interact with biological machines. A navigational paradigm can help users reach a specific health goal by using constantly captured measurements to estimate how their health is continuously changing and provide actionable guidance.","4":"Human eye movements indicate important spatial information in static images as well as videos. Yet videos contain additional temporal information and convey a storyline. Video summarization is a technique that reduces video size, but maintains the essence of the storyline. Here, the authors explore whether eye movement patterns reflect frame importance during video viewing and facilitate video summarization. Eye movements were recorded while subjects watched videos from the SumMe video summarization dataset. The authors find more gaze consistency for selected than unselected frames. They further introduce a novel multi-stream deep learning model for video summarization that incorporates subjects' eye movement information. Gaze data improved the model's performance over that observed when only the frames' physical attributes were used. The results suggest that eye movement patterns reflect cognitive processing of sequential information that helps select important video frames, and provide an innovative algorithm that uses gaze information in video summarization.","5":"","6":"How to model and encode the semantics of human-written text and select the type of neural network to process it are not settled issues in sentiment analysis. Accuracy and transferability are critical issues in machine learning in general and are closely related to the viability the trained model. I present a computationally-efficient and accurate feedforward neural network for sentiment prediction capable of maintaining high transfer accuracy when coupled with an effective semantics model of the text. Experimental results on representative benchmark datasets and comparisons to other methods show the advantages of the new approach. Applications to security validation programs are discussed.","7":"The security of encrypted data depends not only on the theoretical properties of cryptographic primitives but also on the robustness of their implementations in software and hardware. Threshold cryptography introduces a computational paradigm that enables higher assurance for such implementations.","8":"As phishing continues to evolve, what's your organization doing to stay off the hook?","9":"Technologies such as BigData, Cloud, Grid, and IoT are reshaping current data systems and practices, and IT experts are just as keen on harnessing the power of distributed systems to boost security and prevent fraud. How can massive distributed system capabilities be used to improve processing, instead of inflating risk?","10":"Security diagnostics expose vulnerabilities and privacy threats that exist in commercial Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA) - diagnostics offer the possibility of securer IVA ecosystems.","11":"","12":"Microscopy could be an important tool for characterizing stem cell products if quantitative measurements could be collected over multiple spatial and temporal scales. With the cells changing states over time and being several orders of magnitude smaller than cell products, modern microscopes are already capable of imaging large spatial areas, repeat imaging over time, and acquiring images over several spectra. However, characterizing stem cell products from such large image collections is challenging because of data size, required computations, and lack of interactive quantitative measurements needed to determine release criteria. We present a measurement web system consisting of available algorithms, extensions to a client-server framework using Deep Zoom, and the configuration know-how to provide the information needed for inspecting the quality of a cell product. The cell and other data sets are accessible via the prototype web-based system at http:\/\/isg.nist.gov\/deepzoomweb.","13":"Mobile health technology has great potential to increase healthcare quality, expand access to services, reduce costs, and improve personal wellness and public health. However, mHealth also raises significant privacy and security challenges.","14":"Securing the Internet requires strong cryptography, which depends on the availability of good entropy for generating unpredictable keys and accurate clocks. Attacks abusing weak keys or old inputs portend challenges for the Internet. EaaS is a novel architecture providing entropy and timestamps from a decentralized root of trust, scaling gracefully across diverse geopolitical locales and remaining trustworthy unless much of the collective is compromised.","15":"We asked 7 experts 7 questions to find out what has occurred recently in terms of applying formal methods (FM) to security-centric, cyber problems. We are continually reminded of the 1996 paper by Tony Hoare \"How did Software Get So Reliable Without Proof?\" [1] In that vein, how did we get so insecure with proof? Given daily press announcements concerning new malware, data breaches, and privacy loss, is FM still relevant or was it ever? Our experts answered with unique personal insights. We were curious as to whether this successful methodology in \"safety-critical\" has succeeded as well for today's \"build it, hack it, patch it\" mindset. Our experts were John McLean (Naval Research Labs), Paul Black (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Karl Levitt (University of California at Davis), Joseph Williams (CloudEconomist.Com), Connie Heitmeyer (Naval Research Labs), Eugene Spafford (Purdue University), and Joseph Kiniry (Galois, Inc.). The questions and responses follow.","16":"Testing is a major approach for the detection of software defects, including vulnerabilities in security features. This article introduces metamorphic testing (MT), a relatively new testing method, and discusses how the new perspective of MT can help to conduct negative testing as well as to alleviate the oracle problem in the testing of security-related functionality and behavior. As demonstrated by the effectiveness of MT in detecting previously unknown bugs in real-world critical applications such as compilers and code obfuscators, we conclude that software testing of security-related features should be conducted from diverse perspectives in order to achieve greater cybersecurity.","17":"Current software development has trended toward the idea of integrating independent software sub-functions to create more complete software systems. Software sub-functions are often not homegrown - instead they are developed by unknown 3rd party organizations and reside in software marketplaces owned or controlled by others. Such software sub-functions carry plausible concern in terms of quality, origins, functionality, security, interoperability, to name a few. This article surveys key technical difficulties in confidently building systems from acquired software sub-functions by calling out the principle software supply chain actors.","18":"While the potential benefits of smart home technology are widely recognized, a lightweight design is needed for the benefits to be realized at a large scale. We introduce the CASAS \"smart home in a box\", a lightweight smart home design that is easy to install and provides smart home capabilities out of the box with no customization or training. We discuss types of data analysis that have been performed by the CASAS group and can be pursued in the future by using this approach to designing and implementing smart home technologies.","19":"The complexity, diversity, and richness of experimental data on cellular systems are inspiring the development of computational analysis techniques that can directly prioritize and suggest new experiments.","20":"Computer scientists are working with biomedical researchers, policy specialists, and medical practitioners to usher in a new era in healthcare. A recently convened panel of experts considered various research opportunities for technology-mediated social participation in Health 2.0.","21":"Translational research projects target a wide variety of diseases, test many different kinds of biomedical hypotheses, and employ a large assortment of experimental methodologies. Diverse data, complex execution environments, and demanding security and reliability requirements make the implementation of these projects extremely challenging and require novel e-Science technologies.","22":"Numerous application areas, including bioinformatics and computational biology, demand increasing amounts of processing capability. In many cases, the computation cores and data types are suited to field-programmable gate arrays. The challenge is identifying the design techniques that can extract high performance potential from the FPGA fabric."},"articletitle":{"0":"Pandemic Parallels: What Can Cybersecurity Learn From COVID-19?","1":"Security Awareness Training for the Workforce: Moving Beyond \"Check-the-Box\" Compliance.","2":"On the Effectiveness of Deep Representation Learning: the Atrial Fibrillation Case.","3":"A Navigational Approach to Health: Actionable Guidance for Improved Quality of Life.","4":"Human Eye Movements Reveal Video Frame Importance.","5":"Opaque Wrappers and Patching: Negative Results.","6":"Can deep learning save us and itself from the avalanche of threats in cyberspace?","7":"Psst, Can You Keep a Secret?","8":"No Phishing beyond This Point.","9":"Access Control for Emerging Distributed Systems.","10":"Alexa, Can I Trust You?","11":"What Happened to Software Metrics?","12":"Enabling Interactive Measurements from Large Coverage Microscopy.","13":"Privacy and Security in Mobile Health: A Research Agenda.","14":"Entropy-as-a-Service: Unlocking the Full Potential of Cryptography.","15":"Whatever Happened to Formal Methods for Security?","16":"Metamorphic Testing for Cybersecurity.","17":"Third-Party Software's Trust Quagmire.","18":"CASAS: A Smart Home in a Box.","19":"Computationally Driven Experimental Biology.","20":"Social Participation in Health 2.0.","21":"e-Science, caGrid, and Translational Biomedical Research.","22":"Achieving High Performance with FPGA-Based Computing."},"doi":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Computer","1":"Computer","2":"Computer","3":"Computer","4":"Computer","5":"Computer","6":"Computer","7":"Computer","8":"Computer","9":"Computer","10":"Computer","11":"Computer","12":"Computer","13":"Computer","14":"Computer","15":"Computer","16":"Computer","17":"Computer","18":"Computer","19":"Computer","20":"Computer","21":"Computer","22":"Computer"},"keyword":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"Deep learningNatural Language ProcessingSentiment analysis","7":"","8":"","9":"Access ControlAccess Control PolicyDistributed SystemsSecurity","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"activity discoveryactivity recognitionmachine learningpervasive computingsmart home","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":""},"pmid":{"0":34385715,"1":34131349,"2":31745372,"3":31213725,"4":33746238,"5":32165762,"6":32127723,"7":29576634,"8":31274878,"9":31092952,"10":29213147,"11":28781378,"12":28663600,"13":28344359,"14":28003687,"15":27890940,"16":27559196,"17":27110033,"18":24415794,"19":24976642,"20":21379365,"21":21311723,"22":21603088},"pubdate_year":{"0":2021,"1":2020,"2":2019,"3":2019,"4":2019,"5":2019,"6":2019,"7":2018,"8":2018,"9":2018,"10":2017,"11":2017,"12":2016,"13":2016,"14":2016,"15":2016,"16":2016,"17":2015,"18":2013,"19":2012,"20":2010,"21":2008,"22":2007}}
