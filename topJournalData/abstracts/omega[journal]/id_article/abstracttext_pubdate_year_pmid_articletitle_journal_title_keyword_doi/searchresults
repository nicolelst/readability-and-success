article examines grief while providing transnational caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are an estimated 275 million migrants living in their destination homeland which is 3.5% of the global population. The transnational family strives to maintain solidarity, intergenerational ties, and cultural values while sustaining family structure across international borders. Transnational caregiving is the exchange of support and care across distance and international borders. The devastating assault of COVID-19 on older adults impacted caregiving significantly, especially transnational caregiving. A qualitative case study method was selected to examine a participant's understanding and experience of transnational caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the interviews and writing of the narrative summary, five themes emerged related to transnational caregiving and COVID-related losses -exposure to sudden and unexpected death, isolation, guilt, loss and change of traditions, and lack of closure.","1":"This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence regarding death anxiety (DA) and related factors among nurses. Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Iranmedex, and Scientific Information Database (SID) databases were extensively searched using purpose-related keywords from the earliest to October 5, 2021. A total of 6819 nurses were included in 31 studies. The DA of nurses based on the Templer's Death Anxiety Scale was moderate. Factors such as personal anxiety, frequency and severity of job stress, burnout, dying patient avoidance behavior, euthanasia, sex, mental health status, social desirability, attitude toward the elderly, humor, social maturity, psychological hardiness, quality of life, lack of social activity, self-efficacy, coping with death, and life satisfaction were associated with nurses' DA. Therefore, nursing policymakers can promote nurses' health to improve the quality of nursing care by considering these related factors.","2":"Critical incidents (CI) trigger acute stress reactions and psychological trauma because of direct or vicarious exposure. These events include natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks and pandemics, and usually result in deaths and serious physical injuries. Their life-threatening nature makes them reasonable candidates to induce mortality salience (MS). The current review aims to consolidate Terror Management Theory (TMT) research using CIs as MS. A systematic literature review was conducted. Overall, 74 articles with 113 studies were included. Through this review, strong support for MS effects of CI has been found. Consistent with TMT, CIs tend to trigger worldview defence, self-esteem enhancement and relationship seeking. CIs have also been found to impact negatively on individual well-being and organisational health. Recommendations specific to crisis interventions and well-being will be discussed. The review concludes with potential future research directions to strengthen and expand empirical knowledge in CI salience.","3":null,"4":"In Islam, religious directives regarding death are derived from the Quran and Islamic tradition, but there is a variety of death rituals and practices, lived by Muslims across contexts and geographies. This narrative study explored the dynamics of death and bereavement resulting from COVID-19 death among religious Muslims in Israel. Narrative interviews were conducted with 32 religious Muslims ages 73-85. Findings suggest several absent death rituals in COVID-19 deaths (i.e., the physical and spiritual purification of the body, the shrouding of the body, the funeral, and the will). Theoretically, this study linked death from COVID-19 with patient-centered care, highlighting disenfranchised grief due to the clash of health authority guidelines with religious death practices. Methodologically, this narrative study voices the perspectives of elder religious Muslims in Israel. Practically, this study suggests ways to implement the cultural perspective in COVID-19 deaths and enable a healthy bereavement process.","5":"This review article examines the recent (i.e., since the late-1990s) research on deathbed visions (DBVs). The reviewed material includes the features of DBV experiences, terminology and definitional issues in the literature, and prevalence reports of DBVs by family members\/caregivers of dying persons, healthcare professionals, terminally ill patients, hospice palliative care volunteers, and nursing home staff. The impact of DBVs on dying persons, why deathbed visitors appear, and possible explanations for DBVs are also considered. The lessons learned from the literature review include the following: DBVs are common experiences that cannot be easily explained, and they typically have positive impacts on dying persons, not the least of which is lessening the fear of death. The literature review also highlights the need for training and education about DBVs.","6":"This cross-sectional and correlational study was performed in order to determine the relationships between the perceived loneliness and social support levels of Turkish oncology patients, as well as their quality of life and symptom management. A total of 370 oncology inpatients participated in this study. Data were collected using, the FACT-G Quality of Life Scale, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the UCLA-Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. A negative advanced significant relationship was found between the MSPSS total scores (r = -0.754, p &lt; 0.01) and the UCLA-LS total scores. As the social support levels of the patients increased, their loneliness levels were seen to decrease and their quality of life was seen to increase. The patients were found to experience the symptoms of fatigue, worry, and feeling unwell more often as their loneliness levels increased and social support levels decreased.","7":null,"8":"End-of-life (EOL) doulas are care providers and companions that offer spiritual, emotional, psychosocial, or psychological care to a person who is dying as well as their family and loved ones (Fukuzawa &amp; Kondo, 2017). However, much like other options for EOL care (e.g., hospice, palliative care), their practice is often underutilized and misunderstood. There is limited research on EOL doulas, including who they are and what they do, leaving an opening for future studies to explore the topic (Krawczyk &amp; Rush, 2020). As part of a larger investigation to gather information on EOL doulas, 12 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with certified doulas regarding their experiences. Three themes emerged from this project: motivations to become an EOL doula, roles of an EOL doula, and challenges of an EOL doula. In this article, only two themes, motivations to become an EOL doula and roles of an EOL doula are discussed.","9":"The Stigma of Suicide Scale (SOSS) is a measure of public attitudes toward suicide decedents, which makes it unique from other scales that measure more general attitudes toward suicide. The aim of this study was to further replicate and extend the reliability and factor structure of the SOSS (both long- and short form) in a sample of individuals directly impacted by suicide. This study also sought to identify factors that impact suicide attitudes unique to this sample. The sample included 312 participants who had personal experience with suicide. Results provided support for the oblique three-factor structure of the SOSS (stigma, isolation\/depression, and glorification\/normalization), with a superior model fit for the 16-item short form version. Correlates of suicide attitudes among individuals exposed to suicide included perceived relationship closeness to a suicide decedent, experience with both loss and attempt, and the sex of the suicide decedent.","10":"This paper outlines a new approach to using participants' self-identified temporal triggers to center data collection around meaningful time periods as it pertains to coping with loss and trauma. We describe the utility of ecological momentary assessment and wearable technology as tools for time-informed data collection; and provide a study protocol for a recent study in which we paired these approaches to gather data from adult respondents who had lost a loved one. Data collection included two phases: a baseline phase and a target date phase. The target date phase was centered around the participant's self-identified temporal trigger. Several lmitations to this mode of data collection are disucsed. The overall approach is client centered and more accurately captures the lived experiences of individuals coping with loss and trauma. Data of this kind will begin to highlight the psychological and physiological impacts of anniversary dates among survivors of trauma and loss.","11":"Understanding the meaning of loss for racialized immigrant fathers and addressing their experiences in a culturally competent manner is important in an increasingly ethnoculturally diverse country like Canada. Culture, customs and rituals influence fathers' grief and culture impacts how individuals discuss death and dying as well as how they perceive the death of a child. This article is part of a qualitative research project, which examined the experiences of racialized immigrant fathers who experienced the death of a child. Guided by Charmaz's constructivist grounded theory, the methodological aim was to develop a theoretical framework grounded in fathers' experiences of child death within the hospital setting. Findings suggest that for racialized immigrant fathers their migration experience compounds their losses in unexpected ways and that experiences of objectification or 'othering' in hospital and by health care staff were significant.","12":"Current research surrounding the experiences of hospice staff is significantly underdeveloped. Additionally, the stigmatisation of death in Western society has formed delusions of hospice care amongst the general public. These findings gained an insight of the lived experiences of six hospice staff across England and Wales, through an interpretative phenomenological analysis. Eight superordinate themes were identified; 'COVID-19 as a barrier to care delivery', 'Discomfort is key for personal growth', 'Self-preservation is paramount', 'Psychological impact of hospice environment', 'Internal conflict surrounding life and death', 'Complexities of a firm belief system', 'Utopian view of hospices' and 'Colleagues are a pillar of support'. All narratives shared overarching themes on growth, acceptance, and morality. These findings have future implications at the organisational level, identifying areas for adjustment for employee wellbeing. Furthermore, this may also educate aspiring end-of-life care staff in preparation for the reality of hospice environments.","13":"We aimed to identify the difficulties of the parents of pediatric palliative care patients and how they cope with these problems in this qualitative study in Turkey. This study was carried out with 20 parents by in-depth interviews. Content analysis was used for data analysis. Four themes were identified: The problems in the process of acceptance, the difficulties of being at the hospital, the expectations from the health staff, the coping strategies. The families had difficulties in coping with the end-of-life of their children. Future researches may focus on the effectiveness of family-centered care and the experience of parents with its implementation. The findings suggest that social support resources and coping strategies can play an important role in the acceptance of the child's disease process and maintenance of palliative care effectively.","14":"Western society is in an era of death awareness, its most recent salience: A Positive Death Movement. This article traces the evolution of American death culture by describing key periods of change, starting with the 1700s and going through the 21st century, and overviews contemporary movement scholarship. Experts suggest our current epoch is one in which a diffuse collection of individuals and organizations advocate for approaching death differently. Movement proponents aim to modify society's \"conventional\" death framework, which is characterized as medicalized, institutionalized, impersonal, and lacking psychosocial emotional preparation and engagement.","15":"This study aimed to shed light on the initial-stage bereavement experiences of an individual bereaved by suicide, at three months from the loss of his spouse to suicide. A semi-structured in-depth interview was conducted with the individual, a man in his thirties. The data were analyzed using qualitative assimilation analysis, based on the Assimilation Model and the Assimilation of Problematic Experiences Scale (APES). The APES ratings of the interview revealed that the individual's bereavement was associated with the earlier stages of APES (all scoring under 3.5). In addition, the swift and frequent fluctuations in the APES ratings gave indications that the bereavement was unstable and complicated. It is suggested that mental health professionals could use APES to evaluate suicide bereavement and take note of the APES evaluations in clinical interventions.","16":null,"17":null,"18":"Ethical bonds transformation is a cultural phenomenon in Taiwanese bereaved families. When the death event occurs, the absent status of the deceased invokes spontaneous change in whole family to cope with the irreparable loss. In the present study, 283 bereaved individuals were recruited to develop the ethical bonds transformation scale. Exploratory factor analysis has generated two factors: ethical bonds and symbolic bonds. Partial correlation has shown that ethical bonds was positively correlated with post-grief growth and negatively correlated with most of the grief related symptoms, indicating that ethical bonds might be a protective factor in the family grief process.","19":"Recent studies investigate grief among soldiers who experienced combat loss, but little research exists on the qualitative lived experience of such an event. In this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with soldiers (n = 19) who lost a comrade (3-21 years ago) to delve into their bereavement process. The reflexive thematic analysis of soldiers' accounts identified six main themes: (1) an unexpected and shattering experience; (2) emotional dissociation; (3) detachment from the outside world; (4) group formation; (5) accommodating the bereaved family; and (6) life-long impact. These themes were positioned on four distinct circles relating to the self and the surrounding social systems, indicating how soldiers' grief unfolds and remains encapsulated and disenfranchised. The findings emphasize the value of peer support groups that should be facilitated and encouraged by official bodies-even years after-as part of providing social recognition.","20":null,"21":"Background &amp; objectives: Identifying the impacts of COVID-19 on patients' and practitioners' access to legal assisted dying and euthanasia (AD&amp;E) services is vital to informing service continuity in an ongoing pandemic.Methods: An anonymous online survey collected qualitative and quantitative data from health practitioners and agencies providing legal AD&amp;E services (n = 89), complemented by semi-structured interviews with 18 survey respondents who volunteered.Results: Following governments' responses to the dynamic pandemic context, rates of AD&amp;E inquiries and requests fluctuated across and within jurisdictions, based on a complex interaction of factors affecting patient access to AD&amp;E agencies and assessors as services were disrupted. Service flexibility and nimbleness became key elements in continuing service availability and included calculated 'rule-breaking' considered justifiable to adhere to established bioethics. Making innovative adjustments to usual practice led to reviewing the effectiveness of AD&amp;E services and laws, resulting in providers now improving services and lobbying for legislative change.","22":"This study examined the relationship between having an opportunity to say goodbye to a dying family member or friend in person or virtually, as well as attending their funeral services in person or virtually, and the bereaved individuals' psychological distress and complicated grief during the COVID-19 pandemic. Five hundred and nineteen US adults who had lost a family member or a friend between January 2020 and June 2021 completed an online survey for this study. Only a small proportion of participants were able to say goodbye to their dying family member or friend in person, and saying goodbye virtually was associated with higher levels of complicated grief and psychological distress. Those who physically attended a formal, in-person funeral or memorial service reported lower levels of psychological distress. The findings suggest a complicated process of saying goodbye in different formats during the pandemic.","23":"Older adults deal with age-related challenges concerning death and dying. Their cognitive and emotional interactions on burial arrangement, funeral expenses and body disposition encapsulate interment stresses. This grounded theory research underscored the development of interment stress among Filipino older adults (n = 26). A three-stage (Yielding, Inflowing and Discharging) model, 'The spillway for cognitive and emotional interactions of interment stress' represented interment stress as a cognitive and emotional interactive process experienced by older adults. The emergent model may be vital to offer death awareness and preparation, and a basis for creating appropriate programs to cope with the interment stress among older adults. This interment stress framework may also contribute to geriatric and gerontological psychology focused on promoting the older adults' psychological well-being and assist in achieving harmonious aging. Ultimately, the findings hope to achieve advances on individuals' and organizations' management of older adults' interment stress within personal, social and professional context.","24":"Previous work has established that gender, age, and self-control can predict Death Anxiety (DA), the distress that centers around thoughts of one's mortality. However, it has not been determined if DA is associated with Delay of Gratification (DG; a tendency to forgo immediate rewards to receive a more favorable outcome in the future), attitudes toward gender roles (as compared to gender identity itself), and Death Reflections (DR; positive goals that occur when contemplating death). To examine these relations, 131 adults (45% women; aged 23-67 years) completed questionnaires that assess these constructs. We found that greater DG, egalitarian gender role attitudes, and engagement with DR were all associated with reduced DA. Gender identity was not associated with any variable, including DA. Age correlated independently with DA, but not when included in the regression models. These results demonstrate that elements of self-regulation and prosocial attitudes may predict baseline DA.","25":"To analyse the available evidence regarding refractory symptoms to treatment in patients receiving palliative\/terminal healthcare. A systematic review of various databases between September and December 2020; Pubmed; Cochrane; Scopus and ScienceDirect. Study eligibility criteria: Studies published between 1st January 2015 and 31st of March 2020, in Spanish, English or Catalan conducted in elderly people or terminal patients. The study included systematic reviews, clinical trials and interventions. The search returned 782 articles, of which 22 articles were finally reviewed. Of the selected articles, 16 were systematic reviews and three were clinical trials. Three refractory symptoms are notable; breathlessness, delirium and existential suffering. There are various therapeutic approaches for the first two symptoms, but palliative sedation seems to be most effective for existential suffering. Although palliative care enables controlling these symptoms effectively, and following a multidisciplinary approach, there remains a group of patients for whom euthanasia could save foreseeable suffering that is difficult to manage. ","26":"This study determined the relationship between death anxiety and COVID-19 related fear and anxiety in women with breast cancer. This is a descriptive correlation-seeking study. The research included 140 women with breast cancer who visit the day treatment unit of the oncology department of a state university hospital. Personal Information Form, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), and Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) were used to collect data. A significant difference was found between the DAS score and body mass index (p = .019) and between FCV-19S score and COVID-19 vaccination status (p = .007). As the fear of COVID-19 and coronavirus anxiety of women with breast cancer increase, death anxiety also increases. In conclusion, death anxiety should be taken into consideration for this patient group while maintaining the continuity of care for these patients now and in future pandemics.","27":"Patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were included among high-risk groups for more severe manifestations in case of COVID-19 infection and higher risk of mortality. The current study aims to (1) examine the relationship between death obsession, religiosity, and fear of COVID-19 among type 2 diabetes patients, and (2) assess if religiosity moderates the relationship between death obsession and fear of COVID-19. This cross-sectional online survey involved 306 type 2 diabetes patients. We found that 35.6 % of the participants were overweight and 14.6 % were suffering from obesity. Results showed that death obsession was positively associated with fear of COVID-19 and more religious individuals experience higher levels of fear. The overall level of religiosity did not moderate the relationship between death obsession and fear of COVID-19 but only the preoccupation with God dimension of the religiosity scale. The practical implications of these findings are discussed.","28":"The current study aimed to address the limitations of the terror management theory literature by using big data analysis to examine the theory's predictions in the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, Google Trends were examined before and after the first COVID-19 case was identified in Singapore. The results showed that there was a significant increase in mortality salience, intergroup conflict, and prosocial behavior, and a significant decrease in materialism after the first COVID-19 case was identified. However, no significant differences were found for anxiety. Limitations include the assumption that search terms reflect intentions that would eventually lead to a relevant behavior and the lack of data from other sources to corroborate with the results from Google Trends. Future research could use data from other sources to examine the effects of COVID-19 on theoretically relevant behaviors.","29":"To deliver quality care, social and healthcare professionals should be competent both in their own professional work and interprofessionally. The aim of this integrative review was to describe interprofessional teamwork and the required competencies for teamwork in specialized palliative care. Totally 14 studies published between 2003 and 2020 were included in the review. Interprofessional teamwork was described from the patients and professionals' perspective. The required interprofessional competencies were described as teamwork knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. Interprofessional teamwork is one of the essential factors in providing holistic and ethically sustainable care to palliative patients. The way how professionals confront death and dying effects the whole team; this suggests that support practices are important in palliative care settings. Ascertaining the interprofessional competence in palliative care will produce better collaborative practices and increase the care outcomes. The findings can be used as a framework when developing interventions to promote clinical and educational practices.","30":"This qualitative study explores the perceptions of impact associated with engaging in a therapeutic recreation-based bereavement camp for families whose child has died from serious illness. Interviews were completed with 12 parents who had participated in a three-camp cycle of the program over 12-month period, including a subgroup who had also attended a reunion camp. Interviews were also conducted with program staff. Thematic analysis generated key themes relating to the perceived impact which suggest that those engaged in this program perceived positive contributions associated with participation, including perceptions of positive impact on coping with bereavement, access to support and implications for family functioning. This study highlights the areas of impact associated with engagement in a therapeutic recreation-based bereavement intervention, and the potential contribution of wider access to these programs for families whose child has died from serious illness.","31":"The management and delivery of bereavement care and support services present practical challenges. A national-level, qualitative study was conducted to examine the current practices in Singapore. The study's purpose was to inform bereavement care practices by drawing from perspectives of service providers offering death, dying and bereavement-related services. This qualitative study was undertaken using focused group discussion (FGD) with service providers from the health, social and death-related sectors. Ten FGDs were conducted with a total of 69 participants. Thematic analysis yield two themes - identifying challenging circumstances to provide bereavement care and strategies for dealing with the gaps in service delivery. The service providers' experiential knowledge could be borrowed to strengthen the current bereavement care practices for the good of the community. The findings have informed the reconceptualization of a local bereavement care and support service model, with the public health model as the recommended underpinning conceptual framework.","32":"Fear of COVID-19 may make the imminence of death prescient for undergraduate students, increasing death anxiety and worsening mental health. Formal death education may provide benefits such as reduced fear of COVID-19 and death anxiety, and improved mental health. In this study, 86 undergraduate students completed a pre- and post-semester online questionnaire on fear of COVID-19, death anxiety, and mental health outcomes. Findings indicate indirect effects of death anxiety on fear of COVID-19 to anxiety. Moreover, fear of COVID-19, individual concerns about death, and death anxiety were reduced over the semester for undergraduate students in formal death education.","33":null,"34":"Research in Terror Management Theory finds that close interpersonal relationships (e.g., parents, romantic partners) mitigate threat reactions to reminders of mortality. Parasocial relationships (imagined relationships with media personalities) afford many of the same benefits as interpersonal relationships. Do these benefits extend to mortality concerns? We investigated whether those with strong parasocial attachments were differentially influenced by reminders of death. Results showed that those with strong parasocial relationships had more defensive reactions to a mortality prime, suggesting that such attachments may not afford the same existential benefits given by close human others and may instead indicate a heightened vulnerability.","35":"This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the caregiver burden, death obsessions, and somatic symptoms; and whether the death obsessions are playing a mediating role in the relationship between the caregiver burden and somatic symptoms. The study was done on the informal dementia caregivers residing in India. Three questionnaires in a google form were circulated. The correlational and mediation analysis revealed that there was a significant and positive correlation between the caregiver burden, death obsessions, and somatic symptoms. Further, the death obsessions significantly mediated the relationship between caregiver burden and somatic symptoms.","36":null,"37":"The integration of assisted dying into end-of-life care is raising reflections on bereavement. Patients and families may be faced with a choice between this option and natural death assisted by palliative care; a choice that may affect grief. Therefore, this study describes and compares grief experiences of individuals who have lost a loved one by medical assistance in dying or natural death with palliative care. A mixed design was used. Sixty bereaved individuals completed two grief questionnaires. The qualitative component consisted of 16 individual semi-structured interviews. We found no statistically significant differences between medically assisted and natural deaths, and scores did not suggest grief complications. Qualitative results are nuanced: positive and negative imprints may influence grief in both contexts. Hastened and natural deaths are death circumstances that seem to generally help ease mourning. However, they can still, in interaction with other risk factors, produce difficult experiences for some family caregivers.","38":"Comprehensively defining end-of-life healthcare is a challenge due to the diverse areas of healthcare involved, the various stakeholders, and the range of patient options. This qualitative study examined many areas of end-of-life healthcare including quality, areas for improvement, and healthcare policy in Tennessee, in which the definition of end-of-life healthcare was a focus. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with 19 participants who included end-of-life healthcare experts and Tennessee legislators. Through this research an operational definition of end-of-life healthcare, encompassing five concepts, was developed. Concepts include: a diagnosis, a timeframe, type of care, location of care, and planning for the future. When considered together, they are the embodiment of what end-of-life healthcare encompasses. Not in a one-fits-all definition, but individually tailored. An understanding of what end-of-life healthcare denotes is essential to maintaining open communication, high quality standards of care, and the protection of patient autonomy.","39":"Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender individuals (LGBT) are at high risk for suicide. This study aimed to examine an integrative psychological model of risk factors among LGBT individuals and explore the psychological pathways connecting social stigma, mental pain, and interpersonal characteristics to suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) in this population. LGBT adults (N = 473) responded to an online questionnaire about stigma, mental pain, interpersonal characteristics, as well as suicidal ideation and behaviors. We found group differences between LGBT respondents in the study variables: Transgender people reported the highest levels of SIB and depression, closely followed by bisexuals. The association between stigma-related variables and SIB was mediated by depression, entrapment, and perceived burdensomeness. These results highlight the role of entrapment and burdensomeness in facilitating suicide risk among LGBT adults, as they may increase the damaging effect of negative societal stigma against LGBTs and thus, elevate the suicide risk in this population.","40":null,"41":null,"42":"Funeral workers (FWs) work within increasingly medicalized and commodified death-management systems. This study explored Worker Health and Safety (WHS) impacts in contemporary death management on Australian and Irish FWs. Mixed methods combined a survey and interviews. Survey data were descriptively summarized, interviews thematically analyzed, and a schematic systems model developed of the combined results. Survey participants (n = 45) reported psychosocial hazards from work pressures, competition, and fatigue. Psychosocial hazards were more frequently reported than physical hazards by Australian FWs. Physical hazards were of greater concern to Irish FWs. Themes from 11 interviews were: Personal Attributes, Work Demands, and Socio-Cultural Context. All FWs reported conflicts between individual capacities, work demands, and resources, resulting in hazardous personal states including difficulty sleeping and stress. Respectfully manually handling human remains and \"event management\" demands for increasingly elaborate funerals created negative WHS impacts. This research informs risk management for FWs and other workers in the increasingly complex death-care industry.","43":"New Orleans is no stranger to trauma. The Crescent City has a vast history of environmental calamities and oppression. Yet, New Orleans is renowned for its \"joie de vivre\"-or \"love of life.\" Specifically, this community is known for its unique practice of second-line parades. Researchers have noted the healing power of second-line processions, but none have analyzed the practice and psychology of this ritual through a trauma-informed lens. The aim of this conceptual paper is to begin the conversation, rather than deliver hard fast conclusions, on the potential therapeutic function of second-line parades in response to grief. Relevant literature is presented to illustrate second-line parades, trauma theory, and to provide evidence that the therapeutic effects of second-lining may, in part, be explained by trauma theory. This paper concludes with remarks on conceptualizing the second-line funeral as a sophisticated trauma-informed approach to grief and a note for future research.","44":"Thanatologists who have researched mortuary beliefs and practices from around the world posit that many societies differentiate between good and bad deaths. The current study utilized in-depth interviews with 30 Akan culture experts to investigate what the Akan ethnic group of Ghana considers to be good death. The results show that Akan good death is natural harmonious death that occurs at advanced age. The deceased would also have experienced a meaningful life devoid of immorality or turpitude. While the bodies of decedents of Akan bad deaths are interred without much ceremony, good deaths are associated with elaborate burial rites and funerary obsequies that serve to honor the decedent. Findings show that Akans generally aspire to achieve a good death, be granted solemn burial rites, and to receive a fitting funerary celebration that would launch them on a journey to join ancestral kin in the hereafter.","45":"This paper considers the way the outbreak of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdown has egregiously impeded the Hindu death ceremonies and mourning rituals in India. It makes a comparative analysis of how Hindu death rituals get renegotiated, modified and reinterpreted across two vastly different regions of India, both of which have their local customs. Whilst death rituals in India are contingent on the deceased's caste, community, class, gender and age, the impediment to the major death rituals creates a central conundrum for all mourners. It results from the substitution of 'sacred' ritual guidelines with new 'profane' ones for the 'disposal' of deceased COVID-19 patients. Departure from many significant pre-liminal rites, specific transition rites, and post-liminal rites has eschatological, ritual and cultural ramifications. The inability to grieve in unison during a Shraddh ceremony denies mourners any scope to quell distressing feelings about mortality which serves as a source of consolation.","46":"With 7.3% of children under the age of 18 experiencing the death of a parent and more who experience a loss of a loved one bereavement is a common experience in the lives of children and youth. The current study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of an 8-week, school-based grief group treatment program in reducing symptoms of grief, dysregulation, and improving social support. A total of 296 children and youth (age 11-18) participated in the grief programming provided by a local hospice agency. With a retention rate of 76% the researchers identified a significant reduction in grief symptomology, frequency of emotion dysregulation, and a significant increase in perceived social support from pre- to post-8-week school-based grief programming. A reduction in intensity of dysregulation was not significant. Implications for school personnel and parental support of children and youth experiencing loss are discussed.","47":"Long-term care facilities for older adults (LTCFs) were directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to discuss the perceptions of occupational therapists about deaths and other losses in LTCFs during the pandemic. This qualitative study is anchored in social phenomenology, and conducted in-depth interviews with eight occupational therapists who worked in LTCFs. Thus, two themes were generated after the Thematic Analyses: \"The proximity of death\" and \"Losses associated with living and dying in a LTCF.\" In the first theme, the interviewees addressed the feeling of imminent death in the daily life of the LTCF, and feelings related to their own death, that of their family members and other older adults. In the second, the professionals highlighted three groups of losses: social, functional, and psychological\/cognitive. These results highlighted the challenges faced by occupational therapists and can contribute to improve behavior and care for institutionalized older adults during the pandemic.","48":"The death of a child in the intrauterine stage has legal, psychological, spiritual, and health-related connotations that condition the woman's experience. To understand better the processes set in motion around early pregnancy loss, this ethnographic study explores the experiences of miscarriage in a group of 15 women. The following themes are analyzed: Experience of losing the child, spirituality, health care, and the need to physically recognize the child. The study shows that the need women have to honor the child who did not live may be conditioned by the perception of an uncertain loss and by the absence of a place to honor him\/her. Attitudes among professionals are revealed that could be perceived as gender-related abuse. The care of women places emphasis on physical aspects, underlining the lack of comprehensive care during the grieving process.","49":"Prolonged Grief (PG-13) Children Form was adapted, then went through basic validation to be applicable on Indonesian adolescents. The form was adapted based on the guidelines by Beaton et al. (2000). Pre-testing was done on 40 adolescents by online interviewing. PG-13 Indonesian Version and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) were then reconstructed into an online questionnaire for basic validation purposes. It was completed by 131 adolescents. Results prove a high internal consistency reliability and acceptable construct validity of the PG-13.","50":"Survivors' adaptation to a suicide loss is likely influenced by their attitudes toward suicide and their respective sociocultural contexts. Our study aimed to compare suicide attitudes and their association with depressive symptoms and sense of community safety in Japanese and American suicide loss survivors. A total of 193 Japanese survivors and 232 American survivors completed online surveys. The results show that Japanese survivors tended not to consider suicide as an illness or to recognize that others understood their experience but were more likely than American survivors to consider suicide as justifiable. Regression analyses indicated that taking suicide as a right was associated with depressive symptoms. Further, their sense of being understood by others was positively correlated with perceived community safety in both samples, but justifying suicide and considering it to be an illness was positively related to perceived community safety only among Japanese survivors.","51":"The aim of the study is to determine the levels of death anxiety and death-related depression in the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample of the descriptive-relational study includes 344 elderly people registered in a family health center. It was determined that the most dreaded fear reported by the elderly who got COVID-19 infection was death, and there was a highly significant positive correlation between death anxiety and death-related depression ratings of the elderly and that as the average death anxiety score of the elderly rises, so does the degree of death-related depression.","52":"Purpose: To examine the validity and reliability of the Thanatophobia Scale-Turkish Form among nurses. Design and methods: This methodological study included 154 nurses. Content and construct validity, item analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and internal consistency were used to evaluate the data. Findings: The content validity index of the scale was 0.91. Item-total score correlation values varied between 0.453 and 0.718. As a result of the confirmatory factor analyses, one factor was confirmed. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.854. Practice Implications: Thanatophobia Scale-Turkish Form is a valid and reliable tool used to evaluate the fear of death among nurses.","53":"Wuhan was the first large city where the initial breakout of COVID-19 took numerous lives. A group of social workers and mental health specialists coordinated the \"Be Together Program\" (BTP), a psychosocial grief intervention program to help a group of Wuhan COVID-19 bereaved people. Under the Dual-process model framework, BTP used the internet and social media as the main tools, combined with group and individual intervention. Additionally, it employed a \"Supermarket Mode\" with abundant intervention themes and approaches for BTP participants to choose according to their special needs. Additionally, Chinese cultural elements are integrated into the program. At the end of the program, the grief scores of participants in the qualified sample reduced significantly, and the prevalence of the potential Prolonged Grief Disorder diagnosis reduced from 75% to 12%. The study also found that the BTP was especially effective for those who had high levels of grief reaction.","54":"In this study, 349 Han and 217 Tibetan college students were investigated via the Templer Death Anxiety Scale in order to assess the potential class and influencing factors of death anxiety among them. In addition, Mplus software was used to analyse the latent categories of their death anxiety, and an R3STEP approach was adopted to perform a multinomial logistic regression of its influencing factors. Whilst the results of the former indicated that there are two latent classes, respectively, defined as 'high death anxiety type' (Han 65.20%; Tibetan 30.30%) and 'low death anxiety type' (Han 34.80%; Tibetan 69.70%), the latter demonstrated that compared with the 'low death anxiety type', the occurrence ratio of the 'high death anxiety type' was 47.00 and 34.04 percentage points higher with each increase in age. Furthermore, the stress and anxiety of Han and Tibetan college students were found to constitute factors that affect death anxiety. More specifically, the death anxiety of Tibetan college students was determined to be deeply influenced by a belief in the afterlife.","55":"The current study examined the role of interpersonal vulnerability, that is, self-perceived threats to one's interpersonal domain, in the mental health of bereaved parents. Israeli bereaved parents in older adulthood (N = 105, aged 48-88, M = 64.06, SD = 9.93) were pair-matched with equivalent 105 non-bereaved parents. Participants completed questionnaires assessing interpersonal vulnerability, satisfaction with life, and depressive symptoms. The results showed higher levels of interpersonal vulnerability among bereaved parents compared to their non-bereaved counterparts. Additionally, parental bereavement and interpersonal vulnerability were associated with worse mental health. Finally, interpersonal vulnerability mediated the association of parental bereavement with worse mental health. This study reveals interpersonal vulnerability as an important vulnerability factor among a significant minority in older adulthood.","56":"The COVID-19 pandemic, a global public health crisis, has triggered anxiety and fear of death in general public and particularly among health professionals. This study aimed to assess the direct and mediated associations between death anxiety, sleep quality, and subjective wellbeing in doctors working during the pandemic. A secondary aim was tested to analyze the interactive role of workplace locality in these associations. An indirect-effect model was tested on a sample of 244 doctors working during the pandemic. Findings revealed that the association between death anxiety and subjective wellbeing was mediated through sleep quality. Furthermore, death anxiety significantly and negatively predicted subjective wellbeing in doctors working in rural setups compared to those working in urban setups. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.","57":null,"58":"The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic sparked such a wave of concern that made access to vaccines more necessary than before. As the vaccine inaccessibility in developing countries has made pandemic eradication more difficult, this study has presented a mathematical model of a sustainable SC for the COVID-19 vaccine that covers the economic, environmental and social aspects and provides vaccine both domestically and internationally. It has also proposed a robust data-driven model based on a polyhedral uncertainty set to address the unjust worldwide vaccine distribution as an uncertain parameter. It is acceptably robust and is also less conservative than its classical counterparts. For validation, the model has been implemented in a real case in Iran, and the results have shown that it is 21% less conservative than its classical rivals (Box and Polyhedral convex uncertainty sets) in facing the uncertain parameter. As a result, the model proposes the construction of two domestic vaccine production centers, including Pasteur Institute and Razi Institute, and five foreign distributors in Tehran, Isfahan, Ahvaz, Kermanshah, and Bandar Abbas strategically.","59":"This article investigates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and their proactive mediation by adaptive operational decisions in different network design structures in anticipation of and during the pandemic. In generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is performed for both two- and three-stage supply chains and different scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design and operational policies since that can destabilize the production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages.","60":null,"61":"COVID-19 global pandemic has had a profound impact on the quality of life and mental state of the community. The aim of the study was the preliminary assessment of social isolation on individual mental state due to SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A detailed online questionnaire was conducted in the period from March 2020 to March 2021 among 587 persons from Poland. Most respondents (46.2%) expect a professional psychological support. This is followed by expectations of psychoeducation (37%) and understanding (34.4%). During the pandemic, most people deal with stress by watching TV series It is a form of escape into a different reality. Obtained results demonstrate that place of residence does not corelate with fear of coronavirus. Statistically significant differences occurred when answers regarding aspects of living during pandemic were checked against gender of respondents. Women experience pandemic-related anxiety more severely than men. This research highlights that psychological care should be part of the wider health care system in the time of crisis.","62":"The purpose of the study was to examine the quality of life and illness acceptance among ESRD patients with the moderating effects of death anxiety. The cross-sectional design was incorporated. The sample was comprised of 240 participants. Individuals with ESRD on hemodialysis were approached above 20 years of age. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. The results revealed that COVID-19 has a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their illness acceptance. Covid-19 affected the general health of patients, their psychological health, as well as their social relationships. The results also confirmed that death anxiety negatively moderates the relationship between quality of life and illness acceptance among ESRD patients. This study will shed light on the need to provide appropriate psychosocial care as well as supportive therapies to people with end-stage renal disease who are experiencing mental distress during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.","63":"Death and dying are woven throughout the work of home care aides, and yet the care they provide at the end of life (EOL) remains poorly understood. This is due in part to the multiple circumstances under which aides provide EOL care. In this paper, we elucidate the EOL care experiences of aides working in home care agencies in New York City. We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 home care aides, and we analyzed these data using inductive, team-based methods. Our findings show that aides may not be aware of or accept a client's EOL status, and they may avoid EOL care. These conditions shape EOL care, and we detail the committed forms of care aides provide when they are aware and accepting. We recommend improved training, support systems, and policy change to enhance aides' contributions to EOL care, while protecting aides' health and well-being.","64":"Disenfranchised grief can be defined as a loss that is not openly acknowledged or a mourning process not recognized socially after a loss. One can also self-disenfranchise as suppressing and not allowing oneself to grieve. The current study aims to examine perceived disenfranchisement, self-disenfranchisement and disenfranchisement of others. For this purpose, three hypothetical unacknowledged loss scenarios, which are pet loss, a romantic relationship break-up and having a psychological disorder, were used to compare self and other disenfranchisement as well as to reveal the relationships to attachment and social support. The findings indicate that the three loss scenarios differ in terms of the acknowledgement of loss, grief and social and professional support for self and others. Subsequently, attachment and social support are significantly related to the evaluations of the disenfranchised grief process. Finally, the implications of the findings are discussed.","65":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased existential concerns, as well as with significant changes in the work force. The current study examined the availability of meaning in work and belonging to a work group as personal resources which may mitigate psychological distress associated with feeling close to death. Data were collected from 450 working Israelis, and results indicated that the connection between feeling close to death and distress was not significant for individuals reporting high levels of belonging and meaning. Implications are discussed from the perspective of Terror Management Theory.","66":"The study aimed to explore experiences of encounters with health care professionals among patients receiving palliative cancer care in specialist palliative care inpatient units. A qualitative explorative study design was conducted in a specialist palliative care inpatient setting. Data collection was implemented using semi-structured individual interviews (20 palliative care cancer patients) and analysed with inductive content analysis. Palliative care patients experienced both meaningful and disrespectful encounters with healthcare professionals. The meaningful encounters encompassed authentic and supportive experiences, while the disrespectful encounters included indifferent and inadequate experiences. Caring for a patient receiving palliative care requires care beyond tending to a patient's physical needs. Patients should be encountered holistically and as equal human beings without highlighting their roles as patients. The healthcare professionals and the organisations should also acknowledge the importance of time and effort spent for encounters and conversations with the patients instead of concentrating resources mainly on physical care.","67":null,"68":"Objective: Previous research has revealed that mental health professionals (MHPs) often experience severe, yet varying, levels of short-term impact in the aftermath of client suicide. Individual differences are significant, yet what factors help explain these differences remains unclear. The current study investigated the role of the MHPs' and the clients' age and gender upon the impact of client suicide. Method: An international sample of 213 MHPs, aged between 18 and 75, reported on a client's suicide and its short-term impact (IES-R). Results: The results indicate that both MHPs' and clients' gender did not affect impact. MHPs' and clients' age did not affect impact individually, although a significant interaction effect was revealed. Conclusion: Age, not gender, of the MHP and client are relevant in light of the impact of client suicide. Potential implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.","69":"Despite research demonstrating positive outcomes of conscious death reflection, very little research directly examines a core proposition of existential psychologists-that death reflection provides an opportunity for more authentic living. The current study compared individuals chronically exposed to genuine mortality cues (funeral\/cemetery workers, n = 107) to a matched control sample (n = 121) on autonomous motivation. It also assessed the moderating role of six constructs implicated in growth-oriented processing of death reflection: psychological flexibility, curiosity, neutral death acceptance, death anxiety, approach-oriented coping, and avoidant coping. Funeral\/cemetery workers were significantly higher on autonomous motivation, and death-related work was found to have a more positive association with autonomous motivation for those higher on flexibility and lower on death anxiety. This has implications for both understanding which individuals are most likely to experience growth motivations when confronting death, and potential avenues for facilitating these motivations to enhance well-being.","70":"Armed conflicts create significant risks on almost every section of the society, as new forms of violence arise and the existing ones get exaggerated. In Kashmir, the long-standing conflict has resulted in the number of widows, orphans and enforced disappearance; however, little in-depth attention has been given in the literature on widows to the impact of this conflict. This present study examined the lived experiences of Kashmiri widows who had lost their husbands to the on-going conflict. Using the snowball sampling approach, 12 women were recruited for the face-to-face in-depth interviews. The findings of the study gained an in-depth understanding of the experiences of violence, deprivation, social stigma and psychological trauma, followed by their strategies for coping and struggle for justice. Widows are the worst hit victims of armed conflict and, therefore, inclusive interventions are needed to enhance the status of widows in a long run.","71":"A Massive-Open-Online-Course (MOOC) on death and dying (Dying2Learn) was offered in 2020, designed to build conversations about death as a natural part of life. In week 1, the content focused on how today's society engages with death through the language we use, humour, public mourning and funerals. This study investigated 2020 MOOC participants' responses to an online activity reflecting on funerals and memorials during the time of COVID-19. From this activity, n = 204 responses were analysed qualitatively. Themes included the positives and negatives of virtual funeral attendance (e.g. opportunity to have a way to participate when travel barriers existed, versus a sense of impersonal voyeurism); and the challenges related to the inability to physically comfort the bereaved due to physical distancing requirements. Comments made as part of this MOOC activity provide a unique insight into the community's experience of funeral changes necessitated by COVID-19, with important implications for the grieving process.","72":"Joiner and colleagues' Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (IPTS), a prominent \"desire-capability\" model of suicide-based on the common-sense idea that people take their own lives because they want to, and can-is critiqued from a biological perspective. Tinbergen's ethological \"four questions\" guide the analysis: evolution, survival value, ontogeny, and proximate causation, each addressing a different aspect of biological understanding. Problems for IPTS emerge with all four. As a parsimonious solution, the desire-capability hypothesis is reconceived as an ultimate, instead of proximate, mode of explanation. By this light, desire and capability for suicide combined in our species' ancestral past, thus making suicide a recurrent survival threat, and driving the evolution of special-purpose defensive adaptations. This stance tallies with the pain-brain theory of the evolution of suicide, and with Joiner and colleagues' own investigation into organismic anti-suicide defenses, which appears to conflict conceptually with IPTS. These defenses' evolved algorithm may make suicide an intrinsically aleatory phenomenon, opaque to usefully accurate prediction. Positive implications for prevention and research are proposed.","73":"This study compared the characteristics of 150 songs (Dutch lyrics, N = 47, English lyrics, N = 103), popular at Dutch funerals, to an equal number of non-funeral songs. The variables explored included those linked with the music (valence, energy, danceability, acousticness, key, and tempo); and lyrics, namely: linguistics-related (first-person singular\/plural, second-person pronouns; past, present, future tense; expressed emotion (positive, negative words, and the discrete emotional categories anger, anxiety, sadness); and category words (those relating to family, friends, death, religion). Funeral music was lower in valence, energy, and danceability and higher in acousticness than non-funeral music. Furthermore, English funeral music lyrics contained more second-person pronouns and were more future-focused than comparison songs. Funeral lyrics were not particularly negative, but English texts contained more words relating to sadness. In conclusion, funeral music differs in severable notable respects from general popular songs that may reflect the special purpose of this music.","74":"Face-to-face 'Pet Bereavement Counselling' (PBC) has been established in private practice to support bereaved animal companion owners, however, to date no research has been conducted on PBC. This study aimed to contribute to the existing knowledge base on animal companion loss and provide a preliminary research base on the potential salience of PBC. Six qualified and accredited PBC therapists were recruited and took part in semi-structured interviews. An inductive thematic analysis revealed participants' perspectives on the acknowledgement of animal companion loss societally and within counselling professions, the diverse ways animal companion loss can impact on bereaved owners, as well as the distinctive attributes and delivery of PBC. The findings have implications for how animal companion loss is conceptualised within counselling professions, teaching and research. Future research recommendations include exploring how bereaved owners experience PBC and how mental health professionals can build upon the support provided to bereaved owners.","75":null,"76":"This study aimed to understand the experiences of bereaved family members in view of restrictive COVID guidelines using qualitative approach. 10 Hindu, Gujarati bereaved family members who lost their loved ones during the first wave were interviewed telephonically after a month of their loss. Findings were difficulty in proper communication during hospitalization, disrupted end-of-life and funeral rituals and accepting harsh realities related to the changes imposed by using content analysis. Most of the family members felt that there was a need of staying with the patients. Telephonic mode of communication was not sufficient for them and created doubts related to death. Most of them felt remorseful as they were not able to see or bring their loved one home during their last moments and felt deprived of the traditional rituals. Also, they had to deal with their grief by themselves.","77":"The current study focused on the associations between the cause of a loved one's death, mourner's emotional distress, mourner's ongoing relationship with the deceased, and posttraumatic growth (PTG). The sample comprised 91 Israeli mourners following death due to traffic accident, military service, or prolonged illness. Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, ongoing relationship with the deceased, and PTG. Findings showed that in traffic-accident deaths, mourners reported higher psychological distress and preoccupation with the deceased compared to that reported by the other mourner groups. Moreover, psychological distress mediated the association between the cause of death and PTG. The findings emphasize the differences between the mourner groups.","78":"This pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study investigated the effect of an educational intervention on nursing students' compassion levels and their attitudes toward death and the care of the dying. Data were collected using the Death Attitude Profile - Revised (DAP-R), the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care Of The Dying (FATCOD) Scale, and the Compassion Scale (CS). The intervention improved participants' DAP-R scores. Participants had higher posttest FATCOD scores than the pretest scores. However, the difference was statistically insignificant. Participants had high CS scores. There was a slight increase in CS scores after the intervention. The results showed that the intervention improved participants' attitudes toward death and the care of the dying. The results also showed that compassion was an important factor.","79":"The benefits of expressive writing have been explored since at least the 1980s. The effect of expressive bereavement-related writing has been studied primarily in college students, yielding inconclusive results. Nonetheless, recent effective, integrated psychotherapy protocols, targeting complicated and prolonged grief, include writing assignments, typically in the form of letters. The present paper explores how and why letter writing might be effective and meaningful as a therapeutic tool in the context of grief psychotherapy. It describes how working with letters, addressed to the deceased, might help facilitate self-disclosure, promote exposure to what is avoided, confront unfinished business, encourage continuing bonds, and help achieve a coherent narrative around experiences with the loss. As a therapeutic tool, letter writing has the potential to be helpful to many bereaved people, as it is a simple, effective, and meaningful way to access and work with relevant clinical material in the context of psychotherapy.","80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":"Death anxiety in cancer patients can cause and exacerbate mental disorders and affect the healing process and survival. In this study, percentage score of death anxiety among Iranian cancer patients was reported. The databases of Scopus, PubMed, ISI, MagIran, and Scientific Information Database were searched and 396 articles were retrieved. Twenty-three eligible studies were included in the analysis considering the inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity among selected studies was assessed through the Cochrane Q test and I2 test. The percentage of death anxiety scores in Iranian patients with cancer was 59.91% (95% confidence interval: 51.57-62.24). The results of subgroup analysis showed that the percentage of death anxiety scores in patients with breast cancer was 67.55% (95% CI: 56.50-78.60) and in patients with other malignancies was 53.78% (95% CI: 50.20-57.36). Death anxiety is high among Iranian patients with cancer and counseling sessions to control and manage this challenge seems necessary.","84":"Purpose: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using videography to alleviate the stress of anticipatory mourning in pediatric palliative care patients. A secondary aim was to expand palliative\/end of life care research by performing a more comprehensive examination of children's experiences with life-shortening illness. Methods: Eligible patients ages eight and older made a legacy video with the assistance of investigative staff and completed a questionnaire to evaluate their emotional states before and after making the video. Bereaved parents also received a questionnaire to assess the impact of the legacy. Results: Nine patients enrolled and eight completed the study through the therapeutic exit interview. Most reported decreased anxiety and a positive experience. Conclusion: Therapeutic videography is feasible and acceptable to accomplish and can improve the emotional state of participants. Conducting research requiring active participation of patients very near the end of life proved to be challenging.","85":"Losing a significant other through death is a tragic experience worsened by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To curb this massive increase of deaths, the South African government introduced various rules to regulate the burial process. However, these COVID-19 regulations have caused major ruptures and disruptions on how bereaved families observe and practice cultural rites and customs following death within an African context. Consequently, many bereaved family members, particularly Black Africans, struggle with adhering to the regulations and funerals have been coined 'super spreaders' of the virus. The concerns raised in this article are twofold, namely, the impact of the Covid-19 regulations on how Black Africans grieve and mourn, as well as the involvement of social workers in formulating regulations that ought to be adhered to. This article explores the fissures and bricolages brought about by COVID-19, ultimately suggesting possible ways of dealing the losses ascribed to the pandemic.","86":"Client suicide refers to cases where a mental health practitioner is exposed, affected, or bereaved by a client's suicide and is known to have a profound impact on MHPs. The current study investigated the role of coping styles in understanding short- and long-term impact of client suicide. An international sample of 213 mental health practitioners who experienced a client suicide completed a survey on coping strategies (i.e., Brief-COPE) and the impact of traumatic events (i.e., impact of event scale-revised, long-term emotional impact scale and professional practice impact scale). Results indicate coping strategies explain 51% of the short-term, 64% of the long-term emotional and 55% of the long-term professional differences in impact of client suicide. Moreover, while an Avoidant coping style predicted more impact of client suicide, Positive coping and Humor predicted less impact of client suicide. Social Support coping did not predict impact of client suicide. Implications for both research and clinical practice are discussed.","87":"Thinking about death is one of the most common problems of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in ICUs. Therefore, this study aims to explore the experiences of critically ill patients with COVID-19 about death and dying. This is a descriptive phenomenology approach. Participants in this study had 12 participants who were purposefully selected. The data collection method was semi-structured through interviews. Data were analyzed based on Colaizzi's approach. Data analysis generated two main themes, including personal, and non-personal; challenge thinking about death, and eight sub-themes. Thinking about the death of critically ill COVID-19 patients is a significant challenge that affects the patient's health and prolongs the treatment process. Therefore, it should be careful in the patient's treatment and care program.","88":"To understand the experiences and perceived impact on the wellbeing of individuals attending a suicide bereavement social support group. A qualitative study guided by a realist evaluation framework. Data were collected from May-July 2020 using online semistructured individual interviews with participants (N = 6), from the North West of England recruited from a suicide bereavement support group's social media. Data were analysed using thematic analysis informed by the realist framework. Effective social support includes the prioritisation of building meaningful connections with like-minded individuals, providing a safe space for authentic self-expression aiding personal relationship maintenance. Contextual factors included: Societal and cultural stigma of suicide, self-stigma and gender norms. Mechanisms influencing support seeking include: Not wanting to burden loved ones due to judgement, and a lack of understanding. Policymakers can reduce demand on healthcare systems by developing tailored support groups to suit individual needs. ","89":"There is a lack of religiosity studies in China especially in relation to mental health and suicidality. In this research, we focus our studies on medical workers of which some studies reported to have higher stress, and to pilot our studies in this adult age-group. Data were obtained by a questionnaire survey in a large public hospital in a big metropolitan city of China. The final sample consisted of 1012 respondents with 237 (23.4%) being male and 775 (76.6%) being female. The respondents were of three groups: (1) Believers (n = 34; 3.5%); (2) Non-Believers or Atheists (n = 547; 55.8%); and (3) Agnostics or Fence-Sitters (n = 400; 40.8%). Suicidality was measured by the NCS-Suicidality Scale, and standard measures were employed for other major variables. In line with other recent studies in China, the religion rate among the urban adults remained low (3.5%). However, about 40.8% of the respondents chose \"don't know\" and could be fence-sitters on the issue of religious belief. Many of them are involved in various folk beliefs which may not be considered as religious. The religious believers were at higher risk of suicidality and depression than the atheists and the fence-sitters. However, the fence-sitters were higher than the believers and atheists on psychological strains, and they were higher on depression compared to the atheists. The religious believers and religious fence-sitters have higher psychopathologic risks and suicidal risk than the atheist group. Religion as of low prevalence in Chinese societies is a social value deviant from the norm and its practitioners are likely to be marginalized or stigmatized. The Strain Theory of Suicide is used for detailed explanations. ","90":"It has been claimed that the advent of modern antidepressants has reduced the suicide rate. To examine the correlation between the suicide rate and the prescription of antidepressants. A dynamic regression was employed to analyze a 73-month-long, monthly time series between 2010 and 2016 in Hungary. The independent variable was the Defined Daily Dose value for the number of antidepressant (AD) prescriptions filled each month. The models failed to show a significant association between the prescription of antidepressants and age- and sex-specific monthly suicide rates. The prescription of antidepressants in Hungary has had no impact on suicide rates. ","91":"In China, older adults whose only child has died are known as shiduers; these people are not only deeply impacted by their individual bereavement from losing their child but are also influenced by macro institutional factors. To further investigate this unintended consequence of the one-child policy and to illustrate the mechanism of influence of institutional factors on the sufferings and grief experiences of this population, this study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 shiduers in Wuhan, China. In line with Ulrich Beck's theory of risk society, the findings argue that the crises inherent in institutional factors not only affect the post-loss experiences of shiduers in harmful ways but also pose a number of life difficulties that are difficult to control and mitigate. More importantly, most shiduers' life difficulties are rationalized, gradually transforming into manufactured and widespread shidu risks that persist long-term throughout their aging process.","92":"The projected rise in health-related suffering warrants the integration of palliative care across all health systems. For traditionally non-palliative care settings, barriers and enablers to palliative care integration remain poorly understood. This study sought to explore these barriers and enablers in the Emergency and Burn Units across two healthcare facilities in the middle belt of Ghana using qualitative description. Thirty-nine healthcare staff comprising 20 burn care staff and 19 ED staff were purposively recruited and interviewed. Interviews were transcribed following which thematic analysis was performed inductively. Two themes and six subthemes emerged from the data. The Ghanaian socio-cultural context often crippled the discussion of death and dying. Overall, there is a perceived tension between emergency\/burns and end-of-life care. Opportunities however exist to improve the situation which will require more work regarding curricula improvement, providing avenues for professional development, culturally sensitive communication, and identifying strategies of engaging relatives.","93":"Studies on end-of-life experiences (ELEs) suggest that caregivers and loved ones of dying patients also have ELEs, though these are rarely explored. This article introduces the Spectrum of End-of-Life Experiences (SELE) as a descriptive list of types of ELEs reported by all members of the care unit, including dying patients, their caregivers, and their loved ones. We applied SELE towards identifying ELEs reported by 143 caregivers and loved ones and successfully identified every experience. Interviews revealed that participants viewed their ELEs as profound communicative events, yet a substantial minority also reported struggling to name and process these experiences. We propose that SELE be included in death education to raise awareness about ELEs that can occur within the care unit, and we suggest that SELE has additional applications, including use as a prognostic aid in end-of-life care and as a therapeutic aid for bereavement support.","94":"In a sequential mixed methods study, interview data showed that bereaved parents consistently reported \"stupid\" or \"insensitive\" things people said that were not helpful when their child died. Subsequently, a discourse analysis of 170 sympathy cards was conducted to assess societal messaging that may influence people's insensitive words. The findings reflected two distinct time periods in the bereavement process: a time of sadness followed by a time of peace. Possible links to insensitive things people said included: suggestions that the sad time should only last a few days, suggestions of \"healing,\" religious statements such as the deceased being with God or advice to pray to God, and notions of celebration in some contexts. Very few excerpts were similar to the advice-giving quotes that interviewees considered to be insensitive. Many cards reflected the love and memories inherent in creating a continuing bond with the deceased and achieving peace.","95":"The loss of the spouse causes several secondary losses, such as loss of family and individual identities, and for that, it is considered a risk factor for complicated grief. Our objective was to investigate the possible specific aspects of widowing. Data collection occurred via an online questionnaire, during the new Coronavirus pandemic and the mixed design (both qualitative and quantitative) research had the participation of 93 individuals. The loss of the spouse was considered the worst loss experienced by the participants. Loneliness, routine, bureaucracy, and rituals were the main difficulties, while spirituality, family, and work were mentioned as protective factors. Signs of complicated grief were associated with age and time since the death of the partner. There was no significant difference between gender nor between the type of death. The manifestations of widowing are similar to other forms of bereavement, but there are specifications that should be taken into consideration by professionals in order to promote quality of life.","96":"Situated in the context of existing literature on wounded healers and the use of self in therapy, the aim of this qualitative study was to examine the experiences of psychological therapists who experienced the death of a parent in childhood. Seven psychological therapists from a range of professions and therapeutic modalities participated in semi-structured interviews exploring how this experience impacted them personally and professionally, in their therapeutic work. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, three master themes emerged: 'A loss beyond words'; 'Navigating in a strange landscape'; and 'Something lost, something gained'. Areas of convergence and divergence between these findings and previous theory and research are discussed, particularly with respect to literature on grieving and the self of the therapist. Implications for therapeutic practice, supervision and training are highlighted, including the importance of self-reflection and supervision in facilitating the use of self, and the value of therapeutic training incorporating self-of-the-therapist work.","97":"To examine the openness to communication in end-of-life care of three major ethno-cultural groups of healthcare providers (HCPs) (in Israel: Israeli Arabs (Arabs), Israeli Jews (Sabras), and Immigrants from the Soviet Union (Russians). An anonymized set of three questionnaires was distributed among 240 physicians and nurses (HCPs) from the three ethno-cultural groups, yielding a response rate of 91% (and 82% when including hospital division). Sabra ethno-cultural group was more open to communicating about and relating to end-of-life with terminally ill patients. While recent exposure to death and external locus of control decreased the effect of ethno-cultural background, the latter remained statistically significant. Gender, age, marital status, and specialty were not found to be influential factors.This research highlights the importance of increasing awareness and responses to the effects of HCPs' culture on end-of-life care as varied cultures and medico-legal requirements come into contact in society.","98":"Healthcare professionals play important roles during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to evaluate nursing students' opinions about COVID-19. This study was planned using a descriptive phenomenological design. The data were collected using a semi-structured interview form during individual interviews carried out through phone calls or online. After the interviews were recorded, they were documented. The study found that students experienced anxiety because of the pandemic, that they protect themselves through personal hygiene and isolation methods, that most of them found the social measures sufficient, that they were worried about their relatives, and that they wanted to go back to their social lives. Positive occupational value and investment in the health sector are positive effects of the pandemic on nursing, while an increased workload and the high risk of death are negative effects. Nursing students should be supported with both theoretical information and psychological support during the pandemic.","99":null,"100":null,"101":"Drawing from the terror management theory (TMT) and evolutionary perspectives of Life-History Strategy, a between-subject online experiment examined the interaction effects of pre-existing death anxiety, fear-inducing media content (coronavirus threat vs. gun violence threat vs. low threat mental disorder), and intrasexual competition for mates on online dating intentions and social distancing intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate the interaction effects of participants' pre-experimental death anxiety and different types of fear-inducing media content on perceived fear and intention to use online dating websites\/apps as well as the interaction effects of pre-experimental intrasexual competitiveness and fear-inducing media content on social distancing intention in the context of online dating. Theoretical contributions to the terror management literature and practical implications for the online dating industry are discussed.","102":null,"103":"This study examines the post-traumatic growth of adolescents who have lost their parents about their experiences. Eight adolescents whose parents had died participated in the study conducted in the phenomenological design. The data were collected with three-step semi-structured interviews and analyzed using the phenomenological analysis technique performed in five stages. The findings were grouped into three main themes as \"reactions to loss,\" \"readjustment,\" and \"post-traumatic growth,\" and nine subthemes under each, and these sub-themes were categorized into forty-five codes.","104":"In pediatric settings, the concept of hope is frequently positioned as a fundamental aspect of care and at odds with the possibility and proximity of death. This arguably fosters silence about death and dying in childhood despite evidence indicating the benefits of open communication at the end of life. In this paper, we describe the unspeakable nature of death and dying in childhood, including its conceptual and clinical causes and dimensions, its persistence, and the associated challenges for children and youth facing critical illnesses, their families, and society. We explore how the tension between hope and death can be reframed and apply our analysis to the context of medical assistance in dying for mature minors in Canada. Considering the lack of related literature, this paper offers initial reflections to form a framework for the unspeakable nature of death and dying in childhood and to advance the crucial need for research.","105":"Despite the increasing incidence of the condition, people with dementia face a double stigma: ageism and the stigma of mental illness. The stigmatization of the condition has negative consequences, and can even lead to self-stigmatization. To develop adequate education programs to overcome the harmful stigma, the degree and the characteristics of that stigmatization have to be identified. In this study, the content and the language of obituaries of well-known people with dementia are analyzed using a qualitative bottom-up approach. If mentioned, the dementia receives little attention and the information given does not exceed common knowledge. Euphemistic language such as metaphors is introduced not to circumvent the condition, but to palliate its degressive nature.","106":"The study's aim is to explore the experiences of people with advanced cancer and professionals participating in a program with focus on rehabilitation and palliative care. The study is based on two adjusted rehabilitation programs for 33 people with advanced cancer and 12 professionals. An observational study was conducted among the participants and two focus group interviews with 10 professionals. The analytic themes were \"Lightness and happiness to gain control in everyday life,\" \"Community and closeness,\" and \"Training as a happiness and changing agent.\" The activities had to support physical functions and everyday activities promoting body identity and well-being as well as emotions like closeness, lightness, and happiness in groups with like-minded people and at home with a partner and other family members. These activities and theory of emotions and body can expand the understanding of palliative care and rehabilitation as separated or integrated perspectives theoretical and in practice.","107":"Stillbirth commonly affects women in Nigeria, but their experiences of grief following stillbirth is under explored. This study aimed to describe Nigerian women's experiences of grief after stillbirth. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 women in Nigeria who experienced stillbirth. The results from the thematic analysis suggest that mothers had an unmet need to see their stillborn baby, and they experienced communication challenges such as being blindsided\/misled about the baby during their interactions with health personnel. The participants experienced emotional and psychological reactions to grief that manifested in the form of emotional pain, sadness, blame and shock, but having a sense of gratitude helped them cope. The findings of this study highlight gaps in bereavement care and suggest the need for basic bereavement training for health personnel.","108":"The current explorative cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of early childhood educators towards death education and their self-perceived comfort to approach the topic of death in the classroom. All data were collected from June to July 2020. One hundred eight (108) early childhood educators participated in the study. The study was promoted through early childhood educators' support groups and social networks. Demographic characteristics, an ad hoc questionnaire, and the Greek version of the Death Attitude Profile-R questionnaire were used to assess the educators' comfort and attitudes. Results showed that participants' self-perceived ability to approach the topic of death in the classroom was affected by gender and personal attitudes towards death (specifically death avoidance and fear of death). Overall, this study emphasized early childhood educators' role in extreme situations which their students may face as death.","109":"Recent developments in Hong Kong end-of-life (EOL) care have shifted some caring work for dying people and their families to cross-disciplinary collaboration in community settings. Social-medical collaboration becomes especially important. This study aims to use social capital as an analytical lens to examine the processes and mechanisms of social-medical collaboration in EOL care and elucidate practice implications for engaging in the care of dying people and their families. Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews. Three major conceptual categories were generated through grounded theory methodology. They are (a) establishing trust through keeping clear and simple boundaries, (b) cultivating mutuality in the multi-disciplinary meeting, and (c) fostering social-medical collaboration in EOL care. Each new stage is based on the social capital accumulated in the previous one through the social interactions between professionals. Such theorization also provides insights into how to achieve effective social-medical collaboration in this context.","110":"This study examined nurses' attitudes towards death, anxiety levels, and socio-demographic characteristics affecting their attitudes towards death. Three hundred and eighty-four nurses participated in the study. A questionnaire form, the Death Attitude Profile-Revised (DAP-R), and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire were applied to the nurses. Nurses' attitudes towards death were positive and their level of fear of death was low. Approach acceptance was high in younger ones; the escape acceptance score was higher in single ones. The neutral acceptance score was higher in those who received training on death. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between nurses' anxiety level and escape acceptance score. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the length of working years of nurses and the escape acceptance and approach acceptance. Nurses should be prepared for and supported on death with in-service training. It will be useful to provide these training programs to nursing students during their education process.","111":null,"112":"The current study was conducted to explore the bereavement (experienced loss of a loved one through death within time frame of 0-3 years span). Seven adolescents (10-19 years old) with intellectual disability were included in the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted through interview guide which was prepared with the help of Piaget's theory of cognitive development concept related to death. Data was analyzed with content analysis and six major themes were derived, that is, meaning of death, death rituals, religious concepts related to death, reasons of death, grieving perception, and coping with grief. Mostly, concepts were explained under the light of religious preaching and their introjection in the lives of adolescents with intellectual disability. Current study helped in exploration of experiential phenomenon of loss in adolescents with intellectual disability.","113":"Medical assistance in dying (MAiD) has been legal in Canada since 2016 and some incarcerated patients who are at the end of their lives are eligible for the procedure. Interviews with nine incarcerated men at a federal penitentiary in Canada provide insight into some of the ways that people who are navigating aging and end-of-life in prison think about MAiD. Interview themes are organized around: experience with death and dying; possibilities and barriers related to applications for release from prison at end-of-life; experiences of peer-caregiving in a prison palliative care program; support for MAiD and the expansion of eligibility criteria; what a good death looks like. Themes are contextualized alongside federal guidelines related to end-of-life care (EOLC) and MAiD for prisoners, highlighting that sound policy requires both generalizable principles and attention to nuance. MAiD rests on patient voluntariness, and thus autonomy over EOLC decisions is paramount for prisoners.","114":null,"115":"We explored the views of members of parliament (MPs) in Ghana on the call to decriminalise attempted suicide. We applied reflexive thematic analysis to Parliamentary Hansards (2017-2020) on calls to decriminalise attempted suicide in Ghana. 11 MPs shared their stance for or against the call. We developed three major themes that entailed, often, opposing views: (1) deterrent effect of the law (against: the law punishes and deters to protect life; for: the law is insensitive and has ironic effects), (2) enforcement of the law (against: leave things as they are, the law is not enforced, anyway; for: crime is not self-inflicted) and (3) prioritisation of suicide prevention (against: focus on more pressing issues, but resource support systems; for: the law and legitimate support systems cannot co-exist). The findings indicate two needs: to extend suicide literacy to Ghanaian MPs, and to initiate a public\/private member's bill on attempted suicide decriminalisation.","116":"A small proportion of older people in the Netherlands want to end their lives because they feel their lives to be 'completed' and no longer worth living. Currently, there is heated debate over whether or not these people should have the right to euthanasia. Drawing on previous research, we conduct a heuristic analysis of views and experiences of three different 'parties' involved in this debate, namely, the older people, their relatives and friends and medical professionals. The views of these three groups tend to be divergent and conflicting, posing a difficult dilemma to decision-makers.","117":null,"118":"In this multimethod study, we examine bereaved parents' capacity for mentalizing the temporal dimension of their grief. The theoretical assumptions of our study draw on the clinical and anthropological perspectives on the passage of time in grief. Parents' mentalization of their experience of grief was measured both in the attachment context, using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) and using the narrative Child Loss Interview (CLI). We used thematic analysis to code parents' mentalizing utterances in order to categorize time-related changes during the grieving process. Parents generally mentalize their grief-related experiences at a lower level of reflective functioning than their general attachment experiences. However, a higher general ability to mentalize contributes to a higher level of RF and greater coherence in mentalizing their grief. Parents experience time in grief through oscillation between the past with the deceased child and a restricted form of existence in the present reality.","119":null,"120":"Contemporary theories conceptualize the anniversary of a traumatic event as a trauma reminder capable of activating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The current study uses the cognitive stress and growth model to examine this model's usefulness in characterizing anniversary reactions. Participants (N = 197) were MTurk workers who endorsed an \"emotionally charged reaction on or near the anniversary of a tragic event.\" They completed assessments of PTSD, posttraumatic growth (PTG), sense of control, rumination, and trauma centrality. Multiple regression analyses found both anniversary-related stress and PTSD symptoms were associated with similar factors with similar magnitude across both outcomes. Trauma centrality was uniquely associated with anniversary-related PTG. Anniversaries marked by stress are characterized by factors similar to PTSD generally, but growth-related reactions have different correlates compared to PTG outside the reaction. These findings suggest the anniversary period may be a time of self-reflection about the event and its impact. ","121":"This study examines the role of general news media consumption during COVID-19 in aggravating mental health and suicide risk in the US population. In a sample of U.S. adults (N = 5,010), we investigated how mental health, COVID-19 health beliefs, and general news consumption influenced the odds of suicidal ideation using hierarchical logistic regression models. Both worsening mental health overall and specifically in regard to COVID-19 increased suicidal ideation. Perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection did not increase suicidal ideation, yet higher levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy reduced suicidal ideation. Overall news consumption did not affect suicidal ideation, but media-specific post-hoc analyses revealed that TV news watching decreased suicidal ideation as much as high levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy decreased suicidal ideation. Furthermore, online news consumption increased suicidal ideation as much as worsening mental health overall increased suicidal ideation. Further implications are discussed.","122":"Guided by family communication patterns theory and terror management theory this mixed-methods investigation explored how parents (N = 112) of young children (ages 3-6) described the way they would discuss death when it comes up in conversations. Responses were coded inductively, resulting in four themes: explanations that death is inevitable, explanations that death is in the distance, the use of religion to frame discussions of death, and finally, discussing afterlife connections to deceased family members. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate whether parents' conformity or conversation orientations were associated with the frequency with which parents discussed death with their child and the content of parent vignette responses. Quantitative analysis revealed parents' conversation orientations were associated with the frequency with which they discussed death with their child and conformity orientations were associated with parents' use of religion and discussing afterlife connections to deceased family members in their responses.","123":"Suicidal risk has been a significant mental health problem. However, the predictive ability for repeated self-harm (SH) has not improved over the past decades. This study thus aimed to explore a potential tool with theoretical accommodation and clinical application by employing traditional logistic regression (LR) and newly developed machine learning, random forest algorithm (RF). Starting with 89 items from six commonly used scales (i.e., proximal suicide risk factors) as preliminary predictors, both LR and RF resulted in a better solution with much fewer items in two phases of item selections and analyses, with prediction accuracy 88.6% and 79.8%, respectively. A combination with 12 selected items, named LR-12, well predicted repeated self-harm in 6-month follow-up with satisfactory performance (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.92; cut-off point by 1\/2 with sensitivity 81.1% and specificity 74.0%). The psychometrically appealing LR-12 could be used as a screening scale for suicide risk assessment.","124":"Individuals bereaved by violent death have a higher risk of developing psychopathology. Consistent data concerning the subjective experience during the traumatic event of the death are still scarce. This study aimed to explore the traumatic experience of the violent death of a loved one. Nine reports of patients bereaved by violence were selected and transcribed. Reports were analyzed using Bardin's Content Analysis. Two final categories were generated. It was observed that most participants remembered details about the traumatic event or the time they were told about the violent death. There were two factors described as important when coping with the loss, social support during the traumatic event, and receiving detailed information from the authorities and others present in that moment. This study provides relevant data for future interventions during violent situations by health and security professionals.","125":null,"126":"Fear is a fundamental response in the face of a life-threatening pandemic, such as COVID-19. To assess COVID-19-related fear, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) has been recently developed and validated in many countries across the globe. The current study aimed to adapt the FCV-19S into German and to examine its psychometric properties. Participants (N = 866) were asked to complete the FCV-19S, report their perceived risk of contracting the virus, and their willingness to comply with mask wearing. Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported both a two-factor structure (emotional and somatic fear) and a more parsimonious one-factor model. Among demographic variables, only female gender was positively associated with the FCV-19S. Moreover, the measure was associated with increased risk perception and compliance with mask wearing. Results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties in German and can be used in future work.","127":"The Covid-19 pandemic has generated a situation where death is the most commonly used term by humans. The attitudes adopted towards the phenomenon of death are the result of existential life and the presented axiology. Looking at the death of a secular and spiritual person makes it possible to notice the existential and spiritual attitudes of two different social groups, interpenetrating one another and fulfilling different roles. The study used a diagnostic survey method using a standardized research tool in the form of the Attitude Profile Questionnaire for Death (DAP-R-PL) and an author's questionnaire. In the light of the conducted research, it can be observed that priests experience the phenomenon of death more existentially and religiously. Laymen consider the problem of death in an existential way and are more afraid than priests. Both attitudes are part of everyday life because each of the groups participating in the research maintains its identity.","128":null,"129":null,"130":"This paper discusses the case of missing persons in Israel, to show how the category of \"missingness\" is constructed by the people who have been left behind, and how this may threaten the life-death dichotomy assumption. The field of missing persons in Israel is characterized not only by high uncertainty, but also by the absence of relevant cultural scripts. Based on a narrative ethnography of missingness in Israel, I claim that a new and subversive social category of \"missingness\" can be constructed following the absence of cultural scripts. The left-behinds fluctuate not only between different assumptions about the missing person's fate; they also fluctuate between acceptance of the life-death dichotomy, thus yearning for a solution to a temporary in-between state, and blurring this dichotomy, and thus constructing \"missingness\" as a new stable and subversive ontological category. Under this category, new rites of passage are also negotiated and constructed.","131":"This study aimed to examine the effect of social exclusion on psychological well-being and suicide possibilities among people with physical disabilities. This descriptive and cross-sectional type study was conducted among people with physical disabilities who are members of the Association of Disabled People. Data were collected using the face-to-face interview method with the \"Participant Information Form,\" \"Social Exclusion Scale for the People with Disabilities,\" \"Psychological Well-Being Scale,\" and \"Suicide Probability Scale.\" It was found that the disabled people participating in the study experienced moderate social exclusion with a score of 72.35 + 31.53, a moderate level of well-being with a score of 34.79 + 16.80, and above a moderate level of suicidal ideation with a score of 78.58 + 9.85. Also, there was a negative moderate and significant relationship between social exclusion and psychological well-being (p &lt; 0.01; r: -0.492), while there was a positive strong relationship between social exclusion and the possibility of suicide (p &lt; 0.01; r: 0.518).","132":null,"133":"Objectives: To explore attitudes towards assisted dying in dementia (ADID) and the rationales underlying these attitudes, among younger and older adults.Method: We conducted separate focus groups with younger (n = 11) and older adults (n = 14) in the United Kingdom with personal or professional experience of dementia. Discussions were prompted by two vignettes depicting scenarios of ADID. The data were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.Results: Though sometimes stronger in the older adults, many of the attitudes and underlying rationales were common across the age groups. Analysis generated four themes: 'Perceptions of the disease', 'A case for empowerment', 'The morality of killing' and 'Logistical complexities'.Conclusions: For some, ADID was a hopeful alternative to the challenges they had witnessed in dementia. For others, the logistical problems surrounding ADID were insurmountable. Discussions were informed and insightful, highlighting the importance of including the general public in this ongoing debate.","134":"Recent research has shown an indirect effect of generativity on fear of death through ego-integrity in older adults. The present paper aims at demonstrating that the indirect effect is valid even when controlling for social desirability. For that purpose, participants (N = 260 German adults) in study 1 provided self-reports on generativity, ego-integrity, fear of death, and social desirability. Analyses confirmed the indirect effect when the tendency for socially desirable responding was statistically controlled. In study 2, participants (N = 133 German adults) also reported on their generativity and ego-integrity. Fear of death, however, was assessed with a reaction time-based measure (i.e., the Implicit Associations Test). Again, the indirect effect could be confirmed. Taken together, the studies lend further credibility to the extant findings on the indirect effect of generativity on fear of death through ego-integrity.","135":"Urgent measures were taken for those at the age of 65 and over who were at the risk group all over the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is known that many individuals at the age of 65 and over have experienced anxiety due to the uncertainties.This study aimed to determine the anxiety and death anxiety in individuals aged 65 and over who were isolation at home due to being diagnosed with COVID-19 or being in contact during the pandemic process.The study is descriptive and cross-sectional. It was performed with 656 home-quarantined individuals aged between 65-80 years with positive or negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result. A form including questions about the death anxiety and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale Short Form prepared by the researchers were administered to the individuals by phone call.Of the participants, 49.5% were male. Median COVID-19 anxiety score was 4 (0-18). Anxiety scores of the male and female participants were similar. Participants with negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and those with death anxiety had higher COVID anxiety scores. Death anxiety has increased by 1.661 times in male gender, 1.983 times in RT-PCR positivity and 0.146 times in the presence of symptoms.Individuals with positive COVID-19 test results or those aged 65 and over who had death anxiety and negative COVID-19 test result but who were in home-isolation due to being a contact had higher anxiety score. For this reason, those with death anxiety can be supported in line with their religious beliefs to reduce anxiety.Those with negative PCR test results in quarantine can be adequately informed about the COVID-19.","136":"To describe intensive care nurses' experiences of caring for dying patients. This study was carried out between July 15, 2019, and September 15, 2019, in a university hospital's intensive care unit. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 14 intensive care nurses to describe their experiences related to patient deaths. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse and report the identified themes. Four themes were identified: (I) Emotions experienced the first time their patient passed away; (II) feelings and thoughts on impact of death; (III) difficulties encountered when providing care and (IV) coping methods with this situation. Despite the passage of time, nurses are unable to forget their death experiences when they first encountered. They oftentimes use ineffective methods of coping and were negatively affected physically and emotionally. ","137":"This study's purpose was to explore how palliative care nurses' views on death and time perspectives are related to their terminal care attitudes. A questionnaire survey-consisting of the Death Attitude Inventory, Experiential Time Perspective Scale, and the Japanese version of the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale-was administered to 300 individuals. Cluster analysis was conducted to categorize the way nurses perceive death, which revealed four types: Avoidant, middle, accepting, and indifferent. As a result of the analysis of variance on the terminal care attitudes, based on the types of views on death and time attitudes, it was found that the middle and accepting types, as well as the adaptive formation of time attitudes, were related to positive terminal care attitudes. In conclusion, more effective improvements in attitudes toward terminal care can be expected by incorporating time perspective, in addition to the conventional approaches focusing on death.","138":"The current study sought to ascertain the impact of inter-parent conflicts on teenage psychological distress, social and academic adjustment and examine the suicide ideation during the COVID-19. The results found to be alarming as 22% of the individuals displayed suicidal tendencies, with 9% having attempted suicide once, 4.6% having tried suicide twice, and 11% stating that they were likely to do so again. Therefore, the media and the government might host awareness programs and counseling initiatives to promote mental health and prevent suicidal behavior. Moreover, parents may be educated on community level, about the effect of inter-parental arguments on the mental health of their children.","139":null,"140":null,"141":"In psychotherapy, ambivalence may be conceptualized as a conflict between two distinct motivations: one that is favorable to change (pro-change) and another that favors the maintenance of a problematic pattern (pro status quo). Previous studies identified two processes by which clients resolve this conflict: imposing the innovative part and silencing the problematic one (dominance), and establishing negotiations between the innovative and the pro status quo parts (negotiation). The present exploratory study examined ambivalence resolution in a sample of clients diagnosed with complicated grief. Results revealed that, in recovered cases, negotiation increases and dominance decreases from the beginning until the middle sessions of therapy and the opposite tendency is observed from the middle to the final sessions. Unchanged cases reveal an overall high proportion of dominance and an overall low proportion of negotiation. These results are partially divergent from those reported in previous studies with samples of clients diagnosed with major depression.","142":null,"143":"An emerging body literature exists highlighting the use of Digital Storytelling as an educational, and\/or therapeutic intervention. Authors of this manuscript have studied Digital Storytelling as a narrative bereavement intervention designed to help individuals make meaning of adverse life events, like the death of a family member. Until recently, Digital Storytelling is typically delivered in person. The purpose of this article is to describe the steps to implementing Digital Storytelling as a bereavement intervention in a completely virtual setting, using Zoom technology. Best practices and lessons learned for the virtual delivery of Digital Storytelling are provided.","144":"The study sample consists of participants as the patient, patient relatives, and nurse. In our study, a significant relationship was found between the ages of patients, and fear of death, avoidance of death, accepting approach, non-acceptance, and the DAP-R scale total score. A positive moderate correlation was found between the fear of death and death avoidance among my nurses who participated in the study. The nurse, the patient, and patient relatives had a good perception of death and had a higher attitude toward death. Additionally, that found to nurses' fear of death and death avoidance behavior are higher than patients and their relatives.","145":"Unexplained experiences are common among bereaved people and are a natural part of grieving, but their consequences may affect their coping with grief. However, professionals lack awareness of these unexplained experiences, which may lead to an unnecessary pathologising of the experiences and a lack of opportunity for the bereaved to process their experiences in a safe environment. The study involved an inductive content analysis of 408 narratives of the consequences of unexplained experiences shared by 181 bereaved individuals. The consequences of the unexplained experiences were: (1) Experiencing after-effects which may alleviate or aggravate wellbeing, as well as be life-affecting; (2) consequences related to sharing or concealing the experiences, and the reactions of others to recounting the experience; (3) documenting the experience through videography, photography and keeping mementos. In conclusion, these experiences have consequences to bereaved which needs to be taken account in support interventions aimed at bereaved individuals.","146":"Mortality salience refers to a state of conscious awareness of death and the inevitable conclusion of life, associated with psychological terror. The COVID-19 pandemic generated increased awareness of illness and death, and effectuated changes in death cognitions and people's experiences around psychological or sociocognitive domains of media and life goals. To understand these changes, this study administered the Multidimensional Mortality Awareness Measure (Levasseur et al., 2015) to 103 emerging adults in India, post which 6 participants proceeded for a semi-structured interview exploring pandemic experiences, news consumption and goal prioritization, to examine specific areas in relation to death cognition. The thematic analysis demonstrates psychological effects, and discusses developments in health and death-related psychological processes. Focus on career goals and health maintenance, cautious news consumption and disadvantageous impacts on mental health are seen, significant in navigating healthcare measures for emerging adults, as we move forward into this 'new normal'.","147":"The Concerns of Grieving Caregivers Scale (COGCS) is the first of its kind to explore caregivers' concerns about their own parenting, as well as their relationships with, and specific behaviours of their bereaved child(ren). Using exploratory factor analysis, we evaluate grieving parents' and caregivers' concerns using data collected across clinical populations from two community organizations supporting grieving families (i.e., a children's grief centre and a community hospice). Two identified factors were established: Concerns about Caregiving and Concerns about the Child. The COGCS demonstrates good internal consistency and criterion validity in its application with two distinct clinical samples. The use of this scale could be of value to clinicians supporting bereaved caregivers and their families as they can integrate concern-specific resources into their practice to better support their clients' presenting concerns.","148":"This article reports on a qualitative study to investigate what bereavement means to older people. Drawing upon 80 in-depth interviews collected from eight British and Australian retirement communities, our study revealed that facing bereavement while ageing includes experiences of losing both others and the wholeness of the self. Core themes identified how the experience of losing others can be compounded by ageing-related challenges, undermining older people's defence from bereavement and frustrating their fundamental meaning and being. The older people's dynamic responses were also captured, highlighting the importance of supporting their agency to deal with the deeper pain of loss. By extending the concept of bereavement in later life, we also called for a more grief literate culture to mitigate the multifaceted and often deeper distresses of bereavement that older people may face alongside ageing.","149":null,"150":"This study explored the processes involved when the bereaved use Facebook to continue bonds with the deceased. Grounded theory was used to analyze Facebook pages and interviews with bereaved Facebook users. Individual attempts at connection, such as posting about the deceased person, were bolstered by others witnessing and replying to the posts. Collective reminiscence occurred through the sharing of memories about the deceased, which sometimes led to learning new things about them. These individual and collective processes helped to maintain and transform a connection with the deceased person, who for some participants was \"still there\" on Facebook.","151":"The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect across the world. In the UK alone, the death toll is 132,742, with 207 people dying the previous day and a total of 6,825,074 cases of Covid-19 thus far (September 1st, 2021). The aim of this study was to look at post-traumatic stress, coping skills and post-traumatic growth in relatives, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. Some 185 individuals took part in a Qualtrics survey. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Coping Assessment for Bereavement and Loss (CABLE) and the Post-Traumatic Growth Questionnaire. There were two major findings. First, there were very high levels of post-traumatic stress, with 94.6% of the sample scoring above the threshold of 33 for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Second, levels of post-traumatic growth were very low. Losing a relative during the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to more PTSD. The circumstances surrounding many Covid deaths, may have long term negative consequences for the bereaved relatives.","152":"Death is an integral part of neonatal intensive care units' (NICUs) environment and little it is known about NICU's staff death concepts. To investigate attitudes and experiences towards death of healthcare professionals (HPs) working in NICUs. Totally 131 participants from six hospitals were included in the study. Research instruments were a questionnaire designed by the authors and the scale Death Attitude Profile-Revised. Gender, marital and educational status, frequent contact with end of life neonates and provision of neonatal end of life care during the research period correlated significantly with dimensions of DAP-R. Impact of NICU neonatal deaths on personal life correlated negatively with fear of death and positively with escape acceptance. Evaluating the interrelationships among personal characteristics, attitudes and experiences towards death among NICU HPs may increase our understanding concerning working with dying neonates and provide direction for educational intervention and continuing professional support. ","153":"Based on an ethnographic and mixed-methods research design, the article explores the social and interactive processes of disenfranchisement of perinatal grief through the mechanisms of silence, silencing and self-censorship in encounters between bereaved women and the social milieu. The analysis finds that disenfranchisement results from the constriction of the social space of bereavement along various lines of discourse, cultural values, practice and materiality, that include: the passing of time (expectations of a quick 'recovery'); competing discourses of loss (simplistic-dominant vs. complex-subordinate meaning-making); the biometrics of pregnancy (lower gestational age being equated with less intense grief); gendered ideas of reproduction and feeling rules; asymmetries in social power; social spheres (hospital, home, community, support groups); socio-materialities and performance\/ritual; and structural aspects of social and familial organization (gender, age, intergenerational and kin v. non-kin relations). These processes are intimately linked to the complication of grief by undermining support, meaning-making and continuing bonds.","154":"Death anxiety is a feeling that exists since birth, continues throughout life, lies at the root of all fears, and develops after the awareness that people will no longer exist and that they can lose themselves and the world. It is associated with death-induced anxiety with many features of the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be seen as a threat to human existence. In this study, it is aimed to compile studies on death anxiety associated with coronavirus disease, list the general characteristics of these studies through descriptive summaries, and combine findings on the level of death anxiety associated with coronavirus disease through meta-analysis. The findings of this study suggest that COVID-19 pandemic process and is affected by socio-demographic factors such as fear of COVID-19, gender, and occupation. As a result of this study, it was determined that death anxiety was relatively high during the COVID-19 pandemic process.","155":"This study aimed to investigate the relations among perceived chronic social adversity, hope and suicidal ideation among Chinese college students. 535 college students completed the Perceived Chronic Social Adversity Questionnaire (PCSAQ), the Suicidal Ideation Scale (SIS), and the Revised Adult Dispositional Hope Scale (RADHS). The results showed that perceived chronic social adversity was positively associated with suicidal ideation, and hope was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. The results also confirmed that hope negatively moderated the relationship between perceived chronic social adversity and suicidal ideation. Further study showed that there was a significant positive relation between perceived chronic social adversity and suicidal ideation under the low hope level, however, there was a non-significant relation between perceived chronic social adversity and suicidal ideation under the high hope level.","156":"This study aims to determine Turkish Muslim physicians' and nurses' views about the Do Not Resuscitate order and the factors influencing these views. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. The sample consisted of 327 health workers including 77 physicians and 250 nurses employed in internal and surgical clinics, intensive care units and emergency services of two different university hospitals located in the northeast of Turkey. 90.9% of Muslim Turkish physicians and 74.4% of nurses request the Do Not Resuscitate order to be legally implemented. The factors predicting 40.0% of Muslim Turkish physicians and nurses requesting the legal implementation of the Do Not Resuscitate order were determined as working at institution 1; requesting implemented before emergencies occur, in emergencies and in both cases; considering informing the patient and their surrogates about as a patient's right; and requesting to be a surrogate for one relatives.","157":"During the direst months of the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of people died alone. This study analyzes these deaths, which occurred without the presence of loved ones, and seeks to a) examine the significance for relatives, as well as professionals, of dying alone, b) determine if these solitary deaths can be considered dignified, or good deaths, and c) evaluate if the treatment of the cadavers and the funeral rites transpired with the desired dignity and sensitivity. The study was carried out in the autonomous community of Madrid using a qualitative, phenomenological, and interpretative approach through in-depth interviews of 49 informants, professionals and relatives. Interviews were conducted between July and November of 2020, followed by an interpretive, categorical, qualitative analysis. Among the key findings are that during the most critical months, deaths lacked the desired dignity, even though the involved professionals did their best to accompany and dignify the deaths.","158":null,"159":"The loss of a child greatly affects the dynamics of interpersonal relationships in bereaved families. This study explored the relationships in bereaved Korean families from the perspectives of mothers after the death of a child due to cancer. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 bereaved mothers of a deceased child with childhood cancer. Thematic analysis identified 12 subthemes related to bereaved mothers' struggles in grief within three significant themes based on family relationships: (a) relationship with husband; (b) relationship with surviving child or children; and (c) relationships with extended family members. Findings highlight bereaved mothers' need to build supportive family relationships while acknowledging bereaved family members' different grieving styles and their own challenges in grieving the loss of a child.","160":"This is an exploratory study to document the demographic characteristics, backgrounds, and services provided by trained and certified INELDA end-of-life doulas. Like birth doulas, end-of-life doulas represent a divergent, yet complementary form of care for dying persons. The purpose of end-of-life care is to facilitate comfort of the dying person and their closest family members. Surveys were completed by 618 end-of-life doulas regarding their demographic characteristics, employment backgrounds, services, and their experiences providing end of life care to dying persons and their closest family members. Follow-up qualitative interviews were also conducted with a subset of 39 respondents who completed the original survey. Results show that trained doulas are largely white (91.4%), female (90.4%), hold a Bachelor's (32.3%) or Masters (32.4%) degree, and are employed outside of their EOLD work (70.1%). Qualitative data details services provided to dying persons and family members in addition to the benefits and challenges of working with traditional healthcare settings.","161":"The COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing limitations have had a profound impact on funeral practices and associated grieving processes. The purpose of the present scoping review is to summarize the existing literature on the emerging use of virtual funerals. Five medical databases, five social science databases, and five grey literature databases were searched, identifying 1,351 titles and abstracts, of which 62 met inclusion criteria. Four themes, each with various subthemes emerged: (a) Impact of virtual funerals on coping with death; (b) Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the funeral industry; (c) Benefits and disadvantages of virtual funerals; and (d) Future implications for health and social work practitioners. Virtual funerals are an evolving resource for individuals, families, and communities to mourn in response to the interruptions to traditional grieving practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","162":"Despite the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in relieving death anxiety and ageism among nurses, there is not a complete consensus on its acceptability, adherence, credibility, and expectancy in the literature. Therefore, this descriptive-comparative study aimed to examine Jordanian nurses' perception of using CBT in relieving death anxiety and ageism. Most participants perceived CBT as a credible and adherable treatment for death anxiety and ageism. Significant differences were found in the CBT credibility and expectancy between nurses grouped according to levels of perceived treatment adherence and acceptability of CBT. The findings provide a promising avenue for adopting CBT to target death anxiety and its associated ageism among nurses and for improving CBT adherence, acceptability, credibility, and expectancy. A better understanding of participants' perception of CBT is crucial for optimal clinical practice.","163":"While distressing, late life spousal loss is considered a normative life event and most demonstrate resilient recovery from grief. However, for 5-7% of the population spousal loss comes early, before the age of 50, and little is known about the factors that influence adjustment in this population. We used the DPM integrative framework to examine correlates and predictors of mental wellbeing and grief intensity in an international sample of 603 young widows and widowers. Contrary to existing bereavement research, loss-orientated stressors (e.g., expectedness and cause of death) did not predict bereavement outcomes. Employment and financial wellbeing were the only statistically significant restoration-orientated stressors associated with coping, mental wellbeing and grief intensity. We found no significant associations between parental status and coping or bereavement outcomes. Loss-orientated coping, followed by inter and intrapersonal protective factors for resilience and financial wellbeing were the greatest predictors of grief intensity. Loss-orientated coping was highest in early bereavement, the greatest predictor of grief intensity and associated with being unemployed, financial insecurity and decreased protective factors for resilience. Restoration-orientated coping was highest in later bereavement, was a weak predictor of grief intensity and associated with being employed, increased financial wellbeing and protective factors for resilience. Overall, we found the young-widowed population is at heightened risk of poor adjustment. Almost two-thirds reported decreased functioning, probable depression with high rates of psychological distress. Nearly half met diagnostic criteria for prolonged grief disorder. We discuss implications for research and clinical practice.","164":"Organ transplantation is considered an alternative treatment to save lives or to improve the quality of life and is a successful method for the treatment of patients with end-stage organ diseases. The main objective of the current study was to explore the determinants of the attitudes and willingness to communicate the posthumous organ donation decisions to the families. Questionnaires were used to test the hypothesized relationships. The results confirmed altruism, knowledge, empathy, and self-identity as the antecedents to attitude. We also found perceived behavioral control, moral norms, and attitude as significant antecedents to the willingness to donate organs after death. The results of the study also indicated that those who were willing to sign the donor card were also willing to communicate their decision to their families. Religiosity moderated the relationship between willingness to donate and signing the donor card, and it strengthened the relationship. The findings of this study would provide insight into the factors which can influence posthumous organ donation among university students in Pakistan.","165":"The cremation has been documented since prehistoric times and it was a common funerary custom until the advent of Catholicism. Falling into disuse, during XVII-XVIII centuries there were new movements to bring it back according to modern criteria, mainly due to hygienic reasons and cemeteries overcrowding. This also led to the prototyping of new crematory ovens to improve the ancient open-air pyre. Lodovico Brunetti was the first to carry out a crematory experimental research in the modern countries. Since Brunetti's studies were based on the study of ancient cremations, a comparison with a modern experience of reconstruction of archaeological cremation is presented to evaluate the validity of his crematorium oven. Furthermore, the social and religious aspects related to Brunetti's inventions and the revitalization of cremation shows how tools and technologies and also the cultural environment have evolved over the years, effectively accepting the cremation practice as an alternative to inhumation.","166":"Youth suicide is a significant public health problem in Low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), including India. It is a distinct phenomenon with various bio-psycho-social determinants. Despite this, comprehensive literature on this topic is lacking from India. Thus, the current paper aimed to review the available literature on youth-suicide from India and other LMIC, discusses the contentious issues, including potential solutions for the possible roadblocks, and provides recommendations for the national suicide-prevention policy and strategy (NSPPS) in the Indian context. We found that the magnitude of youth suicide in India is substantial with the distinct bio-psycho-social determinants. Although, youth-specific suicide prevention and therapeutic intervention do exist; its feasibility and effectivity in the Indian context are yet to be established. The is an urgent need for the NSPPS; experiences from other LMIC should be incorporated while framing such policies. More research is required from India in this area.","167":"Hastened death practices are legal in several countries. Psychologists are increasingly taking a more active role in end-of-life issues, but the role of psychologists in requests to hasten death is not established. This study aims to contribute guidance for psychological practice in the context of requests to hasten death. We conducted a cross-sectional and cross-cultural study with Psychologists from Portugal and Luxembourg who answer closed and open questions to provide views about their role in hastened death. Psychological assessment, psychological support to patient and family, the exploration of patient decision-making and reorientation of patients were viewed as roles for psychologists. However, these roles may differ depending whether the patient has a terminal or non-terminal illness.","168":"We identify and analyse practices and management regimes around burial and handling of ashes across eight case study towns within six Northern European countries. We analyse management of cemeteries and crematoria gardens, majority practices and provision for minority communities, including various burial types, cremated remains, the re-use of graves, and costs for interments. Comparative data is drawn from analysis of national and local regulations, interviews with stakeholders, and observations at cemeteries and crematoria gardens. The findings show significant variation in national and local regulations and practices for burial and cremation particularly around the re-use of graves, handling of ashes and costs for grave space and cremation. We identify the opportunities and constraints of these variations in terms of accessibility, diversity and equality; and argue for national directions to avoid unequal treatment within nations. Furthermore, we stress the importance of a liberal and inclusive management of European cemeteries and crematoria gardens.","169":null,"170":"This study examines the goals of medical aid-in-dying (MAID) legislation introduced to the US Congress from 1994-2020 using a policy mapping analysis approach. Using congress.gov, we identified 98 bills, 23 bills were analyzed in this study. Most of the bills aimed to restrict the use of federal funds, to regulate the drugs commonly used for MAID, to prohibit the development of policies or practices supporting MAID, and to regulate practitioners' roles in MAID. In practice, these bills would limit patient access to MAID by restricting drugs, funds, health care services, legal assistance, policy, and research. These findings suggest there lacks congressional support for MAID, even though polls of the public are divided yet favorable. Policymakers who support MAID should consider affirmative policies that 1) prevent MAID policies from discriminating against vulnerable groups, 2) support funding to study the use of MAID, and 3) build avenues to allow all qualified people to access MAID in places where it is legal.","171":null,"172":"Research articles examining psychological adjustment to spousal bereavement in older adults (65+) were identified through searches on five electronical databases alongside forward citation and reference list searches. A total of 15 articles involving 686 unique participants were identified. Five characteristics were discovered which can facilitate and inhibit psychological adjustment to spousal bereavement in older adults: the pre-loss spousal relationship, social support, finding meaning and spirituality in loss, the surviving spouse's personality traits, and death characteristics. These findings support that concepts of 'meaning making' and social support should be incorporated into therapeutic work with bereaved spouses to help facilitate psychological adjustment.","173":"Extant grief studies examine the way humans mourn the loss of a nonhuman, be it an animal, object, or abstract concept. Yet little is known about grief when it comes to robots. As humans are increasingly brought into contact with more human-like machines, it is relevant to consider the nature of our relationship to these technologies. Centered on a qualitative analysis of 35 films, this study seeks to determine whether humans experience grief when a robot is destroyed, and if so, under what conditions. Our observations of the relevant film scenes suggest that eight variables play a role in determining whether and to what extent a human experiences grief in response to a robot's destruction. As a result, we have devised a psychological mechanism by which different types of grief can be classified as a function of these eight variables.","174":"Endorsement of science might entail a belief in \"secular death\", in which an individual faces annihilation as the bodily functions cease. In this article, we examine what science-oriented individuals think happens to humans after death. Does endorsement of science entail views on human annihilation or do people also express continuity beliefs? The open-ended responses of 387 Finns were analysed. The respondents were recruited online via organisations that promote science and research. The results suggest that while science-oriented Finns mainly endorsed annihilation and secular death, some also expressed (mostly nonreligious) views on continuation, e.g., in social bonds and nature. Secular forms of continuity were more likely mentioned by unbelievers, while theist respondents relied primarily on afterlife beliefs.","175":"Suicide research and suicide prevention have given comparatively little attention to the older adult residents of nursing homes. This population is characterized by advanced age, significant infirmity, limited autonomy and social connections, and other factors associated with high suicide risk such as self-neglect. However, little is known of the actual incidence and prevalence of suicide in older adults in such residential care settings, partly because of how such deaths are reported. Suicide risk screenings are nominal, facility staff lack training to identify signs of suicidality, and suicide prevention programs are not common in the nursing home industry. These deficits can be remedied by increasing awareness among family members, facility caregivers, contracted providers, community aging services, accrediting and regulatory agencies, and residents.","176":"Families encounter some issues after the death of their loved one due to COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the family's views on the death of their loved one due to COVID-19. This integrative review was conducted from May to Jan 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, CINHAL, Magiran, and SID databases. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The results were classified into two categories, including before and after death. The issues raised before the death of the loved ones include no visit and absence at death time, fear of being infected with the COVID-19, death anxiety, failure to perform religious rites at death, and psychological problems. The after-death issues were related to funeral, burial, rituals, prolonged grieving, maladaptation, loneliness, and repeated mourning. Therefore, health policymakers should provide support before and after the death of loved ones for families.","177":"Frequent exposure to patient deaths prompts nurses to experience grief. Unresolved grief leads to harmful consequences of nurses' mental health and quality of nursing care. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted to determine the psychometric properties of the Grief traits and State Scale for Nurses. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factors measuring the level of nurses' grief traits (Cronbach's alpha: 0.84) and two factors in grief state (Cronbach's alpha: 0.86). Nurses' feelings of unable to provide good care were associated with a higher risk of grief (odds ratio (OR): 4.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-12.75), uncomfortable feeling toward deaths (OR: 11.29, 95%CI: 1.48-85.91), and emotional exhaustion (OR: 7.12, 95%CI: 1.63-30.99). Results indicated that the scale was reliable in determining the levels of their grief. Nurse managers can use the scale to identify their nurses' levels of grief, creating opportunities to influence the resolution of the grief experiences.","178":"As childhood death is considered nonnormative and outside of the life course, children may be memorialized differently than adults who have had an opportunity for fuller lives. As obituaries are cultural artifacts used to provide public documentation of personal legacies, this study sought to determine how children obituaries differ from traditional obituaries of those who have lived full lives. I content analyzed 63 children's obituaries to determine how they differ in intention and use of linguistic devices from what we know about traditional obituaries. Several key themes emerged in the obituary content - passions, religion and faith, children's role as siblings, their effect on those around them, and messages written directly to the deceased children. These children's obituaries read as tributes to the children's lives, rather than as resumes as traditional obituaries often do.","179":null,"180":"The aim of this study was to describe the experiences and practices of nurses providing palliative and end of life care. The study was conducted in the palliative care unit of a territory hospital in Turkey. The sample consisted of 11 nurses who had been working as palliative care nurses for at least one year. The face to face interview method was used to collect data, with a semi-structured in-depth individual interview. 5 main themes and 24 sub-themes were emerged in relation to the experiences and practices of the nurses. The majority of participant nurses pointed that inadequacy in the number of nurses, secondary nursing care activities, refusal of treatment, cultural and ethical problems were barriers in the provision of nursing care. They frequently experienced ethical issues when caring for end of life patients, and for this reason they felt the need for ethics counselling which they could consult.","181":"The present study explored the determinants of registration to facilitate the promotion of posthumous organ donation based on the theory of reasoned actions. A total of 211 university students participated in the study. Logistic regression, multiple regressions, and path analysis were conducted. The logistic regression model correctly predicted nearly 80% of registration status, and a good fit model of registration for posthumous organ donation (MRPOD) was proposed. Findings suggested that affective attitude, subjective norm of family, self-rated knowledge, distance from death, and age were predictors of registration. Worries about organ removal and postmortem mutilation anxiety were also mediated through bodily integrity, which had an indirect effect on the registration through affective attitude. Policymakers are suggested to address the negative emotions associated with challenges towards bodily integrity, encourage parents to initiate discussions with children, instill correct knowledge of brain death, and intervene the bystander effect on organ donation.","182":"The aim of the study was to explore the relationships between recent changes of anhedonia or particular symptoms of recent changes of anhedonia and suicidal ideation taking into account the severity of suicidal ideations. In a group of 173 medical students, scores of the anhedonia subscale (ANH-BDI) of the BDI-II (i.e. 4 anhedonia items: loss of pleasure, loss of interest, loss of energy and loss of interest in sex) were compared between 95 subjects without suicidality, 24 subjects with life-time suicidal ideation, 28 subjects with recent suicidal ideation and 26 planners. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed referring to groups as independent variables, the cognitive-affective subscale (CA-BDI) of the BDI-II as a covariate, the ANH-BDI and each of the four anhedonia items as dependent variables. High levels of loss of interest characterized planners when compared to the other three groups. Loss of interest could be associated with recent and severe suicidal ideation.","183":null,"184":"Death is a ubiquitous theme in television dramas and we argued that mediated depictions of end-of-life experiences have the potential to provide glimpses into the ways in which characters experience real-life issues and can serve as conversation starters within family viewers. The study aimed to identify how a popular television drama, This is Us, depicted end-of-life communication. Analysis of season one revealed 54 conversations about end-of-life, two explicit death scenes, and three implied death scenes. Results also illustrate how the storyline within the show clearly depicts the impact end-of-life has on the family system, emphasizing the ongoing interdependence, hierarchy, and boundary (re)negotiation as a result of death. Findings advance understanding of how mediated narratives can illustrate end-of-life scenarios and conversations within the family system and can provide observational opportunities for modeling end-of-life communication behaviors within their families.","185":"While extensive research exists on parental loss in childhood and the related psychological interventions, little has been done in the adolescent population. Adolescence is a particular phase of life characterized by a singular psychological, emotional, neurological, and endocrinological development, paralleled by the process of self-affirmation and an opening toward social relationships. This complex neuropsychological phase should thus be understood independently from children and adults. The objective of this work was to review the literature studying the impacts of parental loss in adolescents. The current review identified a wide range of behavioral and emotional responses to parental death in adolescence, including depression, suicidal ideations, anxiety, insomnia, addiction and impaired function at school and home. The role of peers, school life, and family and social environment are important for the recovery from loss. More studies are required to better understand the different psychological trajectories in adolescence after parental death and tailor mental health interventions accordingly.","186":"Based on the theoretical view of Terror Management Theory, the current research examines whether higher levels of death anxiety symptoms, in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, increase the extent to which participants are exposed to information regarding the spread of the pandemic, as well as the fear of contagion and symptoms of hypochondriasis, which all in turn increase symptoms of adjustment disorder. A total number of 302 participants filled out self-report questionnaires regarding death anxiety, adjustment disorder, the extent of exposure to information regarding COVID-19, fear of contagion, hypochondriasis, and demographic information. Structural Equation Modeling analysis indicated a very good fit of the theoretical model with the data, confirming the mediation effect of exposure to information, fear of contagion, and symptoms of hypochondriasis on the association between death anxiety and adjustment disorder symptoms. Implications for practice are discussed.","187":"The aim was to determine the experiences of Turkish midwives and nurses when caring for families with perinatal loss. It was a descriptive and qualitative study. One-to-one interviews were conducted with ten midwives and five nurses using a semi-structured interview form. It was found that the nurses and midwives experienced pain and grief during caring for women who had perinatal losses, and they tried to relieve these feelings by using positive thinking and prayer. The nurses and midwives stated that they were unsure how to approach women or family experiencing perinatal loss, and they needed mentoring and training. The results showed that it would be beneficial to plan training for nurses and midwives and to conduct mentoring for those experiencing difficulties. For nurses and midwives frequently facing perinatal loss, there will be benefit in planning grief care training at regular intervals and mentoring for those experiencing difficulties.","188":"The purpose of this study is to better understand what happens to families when a parent remarries quickly after the death of a long-term partner. Men typically re-partner much more rapidly than women do after the death of a spouse. We used a qualitative, grounded-theory method to interview six parents (all men) and their adult children (12 participants total) about their experiences when fathers lost their spouse and re-partnered quickly. We found a variety of reasons for rapid remarriage, and a number of implications for parent-child relationships, including feelings of losing one parent in body and another in relationship, different expectations between parents and children related to holding on to memories of the deceased and finding ways to let go, remaining parents looking back with unexpressed regret, and finally experiences of repair. Clinical recommendations for therapists are provided.","189":"This study explored bereaved parents' responses to their child's death in the 2014 Sewol Ferry sinking incident, focusing on identifying changes in parental self-identity two and five years after their loss. To understand the unique meaning of their loss and its impact on their self-perception, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight mothers and four fathers at two timepoints. Three patterns of parental self-identity: reintegration, disintegration, and coexistence emerged. Patterns emerged in five domains: (a) relational identity, (b) physical identity, (c) financial identity, (d) professional identity and (e) spiritual identity. Each of these domain-associated themes provided insights into the patterns and characteristics of the changes in bereaved parents' self-identity following their loss. Recommendations for future research and potential implications are discussed.","190":"This study surveys the differences of relatively healthy proponents of end-of-life choices and people with irremediable health conditions having already made the decision to hasten their deaths on what each group considers important in influencing a desire to hasten death. Psychosocial factors were more important than physical ones for both groups; but those contemplating what might influence them to hasten their deaths in the future thought pain and feeling ill would be much bigger factors than they turned out to be for those deciding to do so. Those having decided to hasten their deaths cited the lack of any further viable medical treatments and having to live in a nursing home as bigger factors. Identifying these psychosocial factors influencing a desire for a hastened death suggests that caregivers and medical providers may want to review what compassionate understanding and support looks like for people wanting to hasten their death.","191":"Like many countries where voluntary assisted dying (VAD) is legal, eligible doctors in Victoria, Australia, have sole legal authority to provide it. Doctors' attitudes towards legalised VAD have direct bearing on their willingness to participate in VAD and consequently, on whether permissive laws can effectively facilitate access to VAD. The study aimed to explore how some Victorian doctors are perceiving and experiencing the provision of legalised VAD under a recently commenced law. Semi-structured interviews with 25 Victorian doctors with no in-principle objection to legalised VAD were conducted between July 2019-February 2020. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval from the relevant institution was obtained. Doctors perceive or experience VAD to fundamentally challenge traditional medical practice. Barriers to access to VAD derive from applicant, communication, and doctor-related factors. Doctors' willingness to participate in VAD is situation specific. ","192":"Considering the need for observing health protocols, the experience of the loss and the grieving process has changed in nature during this disease. Therefore, this study aims to gain a deep understanding of the experience of mourning during COVID-19 pandemic by exploring the experiences of survivors of the death of their loved. During COVID-19 pandemic, the inability to hold the usual ceremonies for mourning and receive the social support needed in this period, the relatives of the deceased encounter various conditions that disrupt the grieving process and may lead to the spread of unresolved grief in future.","193":"The aim of the study was to investigate the level of death anxiety and related sociodemographic and clinical variables in schizophrenia patients. One hundred and ninety schizophrenia patients and 110 healthy controls were included the study. Death anxiety measured with Templer Death Anxiety Scale (TDAS). The patients were also evaluated with scales in terms of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicide. The death anxiety level in patients with schizophrenia was significantly higher than the healthy controls. The severity of depressive and psychotic symptoms were related to the level of death anxiety. Patients with schizophrenia may need more protection and psychosocial interventions about death related themes.","194":"This article demonstrates the innovative practice of using a card game to teach participants about Advance Care Planning (ACP) and palliative care in Thailand via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess the feasibility of using online workshops to conduct sensitive topics of palliative care and death and dying. The interactive online workshops were conducted after imposition of the COVID-19 restriction and national lockdown in Thailand between March and September 2020. The sessions were conducted via Zoom meetings and Facebook secret group. Trained facilitators plus one IT team member hosted each workshop. Participants were given an anonymous post-course evaluation with open-ended written feedback form. Content analysed was used. Eleven sessions were conducted. 103 participants joined the online classes. Participants gave an overwhelmingly positive of the workshops, emphasising on: (i) convenient; (ii) social connectedness during the lockdown; (iii) bichronous element of the activities. ","195":"A qualitative approach was used to explore how online web forums might facilitate recovery and the process of coping. Ten online web forums written by young people who have personally experienced the death of a parent formed the data of this study. Previous research suggests forum users do not receive the supportive reactions from face-to-face interactions that they desire. Thematic analysis found that forums created an environment where young people can process the bereavement of a parent. Forums allowed young people to use their experience of bereavement to positively support others with similar experiences. The findings imply that the process of using forums can positively impact individuals who have experienced the loss of a parent. This supports recommendations by professionals, to consider online forums as a coping strategy. This study presents one of the few analyses of web forums written by young people who have experienced parental bereavement.","196":"Telling the truth to the terminal-stage cancer patients differs socio-culturally based on the priorities assigned to patients' autonomy and the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. After conducting in-depth interviews with 108 terminal-stage adult cancer patients, 306 family members, and 25 physicians, in private and public hospitals in both rural and urban areas, in the state of West Bengal, India it has been found that even though 85.60% of the patients prefer full disclosure, only 22.03% are actually informed. Though demographic characteristics, like age, gender, education etc., have marginal influences over the pattern of truth-telling, the main factor behind non-disclosure is the family members' preference for principles of beneficence and non-maleficence over patient autonomy. Hence, only 9.32% of those 118 patients' family members have agreed to full disclosure. Physicians comply with this culture of non-disclosure as family, in India, is the centre of decision-making and acts as the primary unit of care.","197":"Suicide is a major public health issue, however, little is known about the characteristics\/circumstances of suicide events. Data from law enforcement (LE) call reports are an important source of information related to suicide. Hence, this study explores suicide events captured in LE call reports. This mixed-methods study used data from call reports collected in a metropolitan county in 2017 in a Midwestern state wherein LE responded to suicide incidents (N=213). Descriptive and bivariate analyses of quantitative data were used to assess differences between incident type (i.e. attempts vs. deaths). Themes of suicide emerged from the qualitative data. Findings revealed that suicide decedents tended to be male, older, and had at least one intrapersonal issue as a precipitating factor. The qualitative sections illuminated three themes across suicide attempts: self-harm as an autonomy seeking strategy; challenging claims of suicidality; and promising to not self-harm. Suicide incidents that rise to the level of crisis requiring a LE response is understudied in both the suicide and LE literature. Increasing the sophistication of call report documentation procedures would allow for communities to deepen their understanding of how suicide manifests and could create pathways to non-institutionalized care. ","198":"After death communications(ADCs) are defined as perceived spontaneous contacts with living individuals by the deceased. This research presents on a subset of data from a recent large international survey of individuals who experienced ADCs and provided systematic information regarding these experiences. In our research we explore the impact of having an ADC on reported spirituality, religiosity, beliefs and attitudes about death and dying and also explore the moderating factors of this impact. We found that having an ADC was perceived as a positive life experience and that it was associated with a reduction in fear of death, belief in life after death and that the deceased could communicate with the living, and increased reported spirituality. Moderating factors include aspects of having or desiring physical contact with the deceased as well as perceiving some emotional reaction to the ADCs. Future directions for research exploration are also provided based on our findings.","199":"While there is extensive research on the adaptive grief styles developed by Doka and Martin, this study is the first of its kind to explore the language used among each style of grief. This study used clinical vignettes from a variety of sources on instrumental and intuitive grieving in an attempt to decipher the language use across various linguistic and psychological processes. Following this analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was used fitting a two-topic model to analyze differences between topics while additionally performing a supervised LDA analysis. The strongest data from this study relate to intuitive grief, which found a higher use of present-tense language in comparison to the instrumental grief style. In addition, results found that the language used by intuitive grievers is slightly more distinguishable than that of its instrumental counterpart. Several implications for counseling and research were developed in response to these findings.","200":null,"201":"While religiosity is usually associated with lower death anxiety, holding doubts about one's faith are associated with higher death anxiety. Using longitudinal data from the Religion, Aging, and Health Study (2001-2004), this study examines within-individual changes in religious doubt and death anxiety. Results from lagged dependent variable models suggest that compared to older adults who did not experience any doubt about their faith, those holding consistently high doubt or increasing or decreasing doubt reported greater death anxiety. Lingering religious doubt was associated with higher death anxiety among weekly religious attenders. Taken together, our findings suggest that being more assured in one's faith and spiritual understanding may lead to a more peaceful experience when confronting thoughts about one's own mortality, especially for older adults holding a stronger religious identity. We situate our findings within the literature on the \"dark side\" of religion and well-being in later life.","202":"This study examined cultural differences in advance care planning (ACP) and various strategies that social workers use to initiate conversations on ACP. We conducted qualitative interviews with 12 social workers in South Korea and the US and a thematic content analysis of the transcribed data. Our findings show that different cultural norms and generational viewpoints surrounding death and health-related decision-making influence how people prepare for end-of-life care (EOLC). Whereas principles of self-determination and autonomy guide ACP practices in the US, decisions regarding EOLC are more often made in consultation with family members in Korean and Korean-American communities. Nevertheless, social workers in both countries identified relationship-building, empowerment, and individualized approaches as common strategies in initiating discussions on ACP.","203":"The complicated grief experienced by suicide loss survivors leads to feelings of abandonment, rejection, intense self-blame, and depression. Stigma surrounding suicide further burdens survivors who can experience rejection by their community and social networks. Research in the field of psychology has delved into the grieving process of suicide loss survivors, however the effects of suicide require more sociological study to fully understand and support the impact of the suicidal bereavement process on the social interactions and relationships of those left behind after death. This study aims to contribute to the body of research exploring the social challenges faced after the suicide of a loved one. Based on the analysis of powerful personal narratives through qualitative interviews shared by 14 suicide loss survivors this study explores the social construction of the grieving and healing process for suicide loss survivors. Recognizing that the most reliable relief is in commiseration with like experienced people, this research points to the support group as a builder of social solidarity. The alienation caused by the shame and stigma of suicide loss can be reversed by the feelings of attachment to the group that listens, understands and accepts. Groups created by and for suicide loss survivors should be considered a necessary tool to be used toward healing those who suffer from loss by suicide.","204":null,"205":"COVID-19 has devastated the United States (U.S.). One of the more notably impacted areas is the South. Compared to the rest of the U.S., the South is characterized by increased rurality, lowered access to healthcare, older populations, and higher religiosity, all of which might predispose its residents to more detrimental effects of COVID-19, including COVID-related fatalities. As such, this paper provides important considerations for individuals engaging in work with Southern, rural Americans dealing with COVID-related grief and loss. A review of the literature addressing the impact of Southern legislature, rurality, cross-country factors, and faith on COVID-related grief among Southerners was conducted, with applicable considerations expressed. Care should be taken by providers working with rural, Southern residents to attend to tangible and intangible losses experienced as a result of COVID-19. These considerations can help inform work with rural Southerners dealing with grief during the pandemic.

The objective of this study was to investigate trauma-related experiences of suicide survivors. This is a qualitative study with people who had recently lost a family member or a close one to suicide, conducted at least two months after the event. Forty-one participants agreed to take part in the study and were interviewed. The interviewees' perception was that suicide brought harm, symptoms, and suffering. Traumatic experiences can begin immediately after the event, with many reporting symptoms lasting many months and persistent impact, both personal and to the family. Postvention models after suicide should incorporate such findings, and investigate trauma consistently.","208":"This study examined types of and reactions to loss experienced by a sample of 162 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States amid the COVID-19 global pandemic. Results indicated students reported an average of 6.33 losses with loss of normalcy being the most prominent. The number of losses experienced was a significant predictor of loss of control and avoidance. A significant positive relationship was revealed between spirituality and positive reappraisal whereas a significant negative correlation was identified between spirituality and loss of control and avoidance. Age was also negatively associated with expressions of avoidance and loss of control. Finally, students who attended faith-based institutions reported higher levels of positive reappraisal and lower levels of loss of control. Results suggest the need for educators and mental health practitioners to assess non-death losses among college students and provide supportive interventions aimed at promoting psychosocial-spiritual coping and resilience during and following a pandemic.","209":null,"210":null,"211":"The aim of this pilot study was to test the effectiveness of an educational forgiveness intervention on mental health in grieving parents. 21 grieving parents were randomly assigned to the experimental group (in which the educational forgiveness intervention occurred) and to the control group (in which a psycho-education grief intervention with a humanistic approach took place). Participants in both groups completed 12 individual hourly sessions for three months. The results showed that participants in the experimental group achieved statistically greater improvement in forgiveness towards others, self-forgiveness, and a greater decrease in depression in the post-test and follow-up test; a greater decrease in anxiety and anger in the post-test; as well as higher improvement in the post-traumatic growth in the follow-up test, four months after the end of the intervention. We highlight the potential benefits of using a forgiveness intervention with bereaved parents.","212":"Taking an integrative approach toward developmental psychology and neurophysiology, this review selects findings from the psychological and medical literature on guilt and bereavement that are relevant to considering whether and how guilt contributes to the development of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in bereaved persons. Mention of guilt is ubiquitous in literature on general grief and PGD, including 54 articles related to the neuropsychological development and manifestations of guilt and grief, as well as their neuroimaging correlates, that met scoping review criteria. However, mechanisms connecting guilt to development of PGD are scarce. Aspects of guilt are conceptually connected to many PGD criteria, opening avenues to explore treatment of PGD by targeting guilt. Positive and prosocial aspects of guilt are especially neglected in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and consideration of these aspects may improve interventions for PGD such as complicated grief treatment.","213":"","214":"This analysis of a convenience sample survey of 195 suicide bereaved adults focuses on predictors of three important highly interrelated experiences among the suicide bereaved: grief problems, depression and suicidal thinking. Although each of these three experiences can be explained by a unique set of predictors, they share many commonalities. Several predictors stood out especially in either aggravating or alleviating these experiences: personal (or post-traumatic) growth, perceived social support, feelings of blameworthiness, perceived suicide stigma, years since loss and a respondent's mental health difficulties experienced prior to their suicide loss. We also review the clinical implications of these results.","215":"This study aims to examine the effect of COVID-19 perceived risk on death anxiety, satisfaction with life, and psychological well-being. The application part of the research was conducted on staff working in a public hospital. A convenience sample of staff working in a public hospital was used and data were obtained from 573 individuals. The result of the analysis determined that the COVID-19 perceived risk explains 13.5% of the total variance on death anxiety. The regression models identified that the increase in COVID-19 risk perceptions of the participants statistically increased their death anxiety and decreased their satisfaction with life and psychological well-being.","216":"Studies have shown that losing a spouse can cause both physical and mental suffering for the bereaved. This qualitative study aimed to gather knowledge about how men and women in the Faroe Islands, a small-scale society in the North Atlantic Ocean, managed the transition to widowhood. Five women and three men were interviewed, their age varying from 67 to 74 years. A hermeneutic analytic method was applied. Our findings showed that managing the transition to widowhood followed two tracks, namely the process of loss and the process of restoration. For participants locked in either process, the transition caused severe disruption in daily living, while participants who managed to oscillate between the two processes appeared to manage the transition to widowhood and get on with their lives. Our findings, and those from other studies, point to the need to offer structured individual support for people who have lost their life partner.","217":"Research over how suicide survivors approach services is limited. Aims: This cross-sectional study explores the psychological state and perceived social support of Italian survivors, including those who have not sought for help, and investigates differences for gender or kinship with the departed. Methods: Rule-based system (RBS) analyses identified relationships between social support and reported formal\/informal help-seeking behavior. One-hundred thirty-two (103F; 27M) suicide survivors (53 having never sought for support) answered an anonymous online survey. Life satisfaction, wellbeing, perceived social support, suicidal ideation and formal\/informal help-seeking were investigated. Results: RBS analysis identified different help-seeking behaviors: survivors lacking social support may avoid reaching a psychologist and prefer GPs, look for advice in online forums and rely on people out of their narrower network such as co-workers. Conclusion: These unique study's results offer insight to identify which specific areas would be fruitful to investigate while assessing social support in bereaved individuals.","218":"Bereavement and mourning are arguably one of the research interests of psychologists, psychoanalysts, and psychiatrists since Freud's publication of Mourning and Melancholia. This paper is a qualitative case study that sought to examine the mourning experience of the participant from childhood until his adolescence. For theoretical foundation, the four tasks of mourning primarily developed by James Worden was utilized for the proper direction of the research inquiry; namely: a.) accepting the reality of death; b.) experiencing the feeling of grief; c.) adjusting and creating new meanings in the post-loss world; and d.) reconfiguring the bond with the lost person. The paper finds that the participant's cognitive attitude, emotional experiences, and personal observations of the environment enable him to overcome actively (in an overlapping manner) the three tasks of mourning. However, the failure to find an enduring connection with his deceased parents is not a result of strong attachment but with the absence of personal belief about the meta-existence of God.","219":"This exploratory qualitative study explores the experiences of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units and after discharge. Semi- structured telephone interviews were conducted with 18 COVID-19 patients admitted to and discharged from intensive care units between March and September in 2020. The themes of this study were determined as \"feelings about the illness and intensive care,\" \"psychological and physical damages,\" \"nurses' efforts and the importance of care.\", and \"protecting health and life\". COVID-19 patients in intensive care units may experience permanent physical and psychological damages. The findings suggest that the first step in carrying out interventions in the intensive care units is to ensure that continuous communication with patients is maintained so that their orientation to the new circumstances can be achieved. Nursing interventions to patients missing their families can have compensated for the loss of family support and care during their critical illness.","220":"The authors examine funeral reform in the second half of the 20th century in Central and Eastern Europe via the historical comparative analysis approach. Examining the case studies of Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the article argues that although the newly-developed civil (socialist) funeral ceremonies in the two countries followed a similar pattern, in the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, civil funerals followed by cremation became the norm during the forty years of communist rule, whereas in Hungary they did not become the popularly accepted approach, in a similar way to the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, where Roman Catholic funerals and inhumation remained dominant. The significant difference in the results of efforts toward reform was due principally to differing cultural histories, attitudes toward both religion and cremation and the availability of the infrastructure required for conducting civil funerals.","221":"We examined whether burnout, depression, anxiety, stress, lifetime suicidal ideation, self-efficacy in preventing suicide and demographic factors predicted the understanding of and willingness to help suicidal patients among hospital healthcare workers. A total of 368 healthcare workers from the major surgical and medical departments in a general hospital setting were recruited. Participants responded to the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, Self-efficacy in Suicide Prevention, and Understanding Suicide Attempt Patient Scale. Those from the psychiatric department, with higher suicide prevention self-efficacy, and lower personal accomplishment indicated more understanding and helpful attitudes; doctors, depressed and anxious healthcare workers reported less understanding and helpful attitudes. Suicide prevention efforts must be conducted in tandem with equipping and supporting the healthcare workers who manage suicidal patients.","222":null,"223":"There is little known about the clinicians' experience of collaboration using the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicide (CAMS) framework. This study aimed to give voice to the clinician experience. A qualitative design utilised semi-structured interviews with ten psychologists who worked in a Suicide Assessment and Treatment Service (SATS) in Ireland which utilises the CAMS framework. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach revealed several important findings. The superordinate themes included 'Finding Safety', 'Regulation of the Self', 'Connecting', and 'Systemic Challenges'. The CAMS framework plays an important role in providing a safe base for the clinician (in terms of understanding suicidality, in addition to the structures of the framework). It provides a mechanism in which to process difficult emotions, and a way of communicating a formulation of suicide to the treating team. Importantly, the CAMS emerged as facilitating a collaborative, therapeutic way of working. ","224":"This study explores the cognitive structure of death and long-term changes of death cognition after catastrophes for Chinese college students. Two months before Wenchuan earthquake, a week after, a year after, and ten years after, a total of 1507 participants' associated words of death were collected, after clustering high-frequency words' similarity coefficients, results showed that death was represented by four advanced clusters: death contact, death anxiety and its reminders, deathafter, and defense mechanism; a week after earthquake, death anxiety and its reminders, defense mechanism were activated; a year after, death contact, afterdeath were appreciated, death anxiety and its reminders, defense mechanism were underappreciated, this phenomenon still existed even ten years later, which suggests that the earthquake permanently changed their death cognition, and this change stabilized one year later. In addition, this paper provides an effective method to uncover cognitive structure of one certain concept.","225":"This article explores the use of creative personal rituals and ceremonies for accepting loss, managing strong emotions and inviting the sacred into the grief journey. These tools can help clinicians incorporate spirituality and multi-cultural modalities into a grief counseling practice, and can be used effectively by both intuitive and instrumental grievers. The use of ritual and ceremony can also help end-of-life and bereavement professionals become more present for the dying, and more competent in spiritual meaning-making for the bereaved.","226":"To review which are the most influential variables in achieving levels of psychological well-being at the end of life and to verify whether, as certain studies suggest, spirituality, resilience and social support are the pillars on which the psychological well-being construct is based. A systematic search through the Scopus, Pubmed and PsycInfo electronic databases was carried out using keywords such as: \"wellbeing\" OR \"psychological-well-being\" AND \"resilience\" AND \"spirituality\" AND \"social support\" AND \"palliative care\" and their multiple combinations. Eleven studies were selected, in which terms such as spiritual well-being, absence of discomfort and quality of life were used in substitution of psychological well-being and a certain consensus was found regarding whether resilience, spirituality and social support are predictive variables of psychological well-being. Resilience, social support and spirituality are highly relevant variables at the end of life and contribute decisively towards psychological well-being. ","227":"In the context of violence and enforced disappearance in Mexico, the concept of mourning is recontextualized from a psychoanalytic perspective. Two themes of the psychoanalytic theory of mourning are considered: 1) the impossibility to confirm the death of the missing person and 2) the availability and purpose of symbolic resources (rites, community activities). The private and public aspects of mourning are reviewed in relation to the afflictions of the relatives of the missing. Without a body to mourn, the rites that are performed around the disappeared have a different function than funeral rites. Nuanced by repetition, these rites attempt to work through the traumatic loss. The role of search groups in working through the pain of loss is also explored. The notions of intrapsychic crypt and endocryptic identification are reviewed, to better understand the encrypted mourning -the particular state of prolonged grief- endured by the relatives of the disappeared.","228":"In this study, we analyse the electronic patient record (EPR) as a genre and investigate how a death is documented as part of the EPR, that is, what kind of textual practices can be found, and how they can be understood based on extracts from 42 EPRs from medical wards in Norwegian hospitals. Following from our analysis, we see four distinct patterns in the documentation of patient death: a) registering the bare minimum of information, b) registering a body stopped working, c) documenting dying quietly and placing it in peaceful surroundings, and d) highlighting the accompanied death. The textual practices of documenting the transition to death in the EPR make death appear manageable and sanitised, depicting death as either uneventful or good. While the EPR genre is steeped in biomedical language, other discourses relating to death can be seen as ways to accommodate the ideal of a dignified death.","229":"According toterror management theory (TMT), older adults may often be a reminder of death for younger adults. Therefore, dealing with older adults may be associated with increased levels of death anxiety and decreased levels of self-esteem, interpersonal reactivity, and symbolic immortality, leading younger adults to develop ageist attitudes and behaviors in defense. However, to date, these associations have not been empirically examined, especially among nurses. Self-report questionnaires were used on a sample of 163 nurses to explore the issue of ageism among nurses from the TMT perspective. The results indicated that, after controlling for sociodemographic variables, high levels of death anxiety and low levels of self-esteem, interpersonal reactivity, and symbolic immortality were associated with increased levels of ageism among nurses. Thus, the current study uses TMT to explain ageism among nurses, and the study findings may contribute to the development of psychological interventions aimed at reducing nurses' ageism.","230":"Although it has been widely discussed in the literature, no scale has yet been developed to measure the consumption aspect of death. This study aims to develop a domain-specific death-related status consumption (DRSC) scale to bridge this gap in the field. Results reveal the following three dimensions of the scale: conspicuousness, planning, and showing respect. In four studies, which collate the views of 1,302 participants, both students and adults, the DRSC demonstrates internal consistency and validity across cultures (Turkey, the U.S., and culturally diverse sample). The importance of such a scale for the field is discussed.","231":"The delivery of death notifications may affect the mental health of bereaved individuals. Police officers are often the first people with whom the bereaved have contact in this exceptional situation. Therefore, it is essential to assess the behavior of police officers and the impact on the bereaved. We examined the experiences of 86 individuals who received the notification through the police and assessed symptoms of prolonged grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The interaction with police was associated with posttraumatic avoidance behavior and the presence of another supporting person was associated with higher scores of depression. Handing out information material and staying with the bereaved was related to a positive evaluation of police behavior. It appears important to identify helpful and problematic behavior for a better understanding and for an adaptation of existing guidelines.","232":"End-of-life care in long-term care facilities for older adults requires numerous skills. However, many professionals, including occupational therapists, feel unprepared to deal with death and dyingand have difficulties to attend to the real needs of the older adults and their families.This is a qualitative study anchored in phenomenologywhich had the objective to understand the perception of occupational therapists regarding death and dying inlong-term care facilities. Data were collected through focus groups and analyzed by thematic content analysis. A total of 12 occupational therapists participated in this study, and two themeswere generated: \"The Experience of Death and Dying\" and \"The Occupational Therapist's approach in Facing Death and Dying\". These results may contribute to improvingthe care provided to older adults in the process of death and dying.","233":"In this contribution, we respond to a letter in Omega: Journal of Death and Dying by Doka. Signatories of this letter to the President of the United States convey concerns that deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a higher prevalence of severe and persistent grief, i.e., prolonged grief disorder. We support their call to action to direct government funding to helping those who develop this condition during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we think that concerns about prolonged grief disorder during the pandemic can be more convincingly conveyed by firmly embedding such concerns within scientific literature. Therefore, we highlight prior scientifically informed opinion pieces from various international researchers who voiced similar concerns in the early months of the pandemic. Additionally, we provide an overview of pioneering empirical research elucidating whether prolonged grief disorder and related mental health problems will become more prevalent during the pandemic.","234":"This study examined mediatized death and emotion, specifically parasocial grieving, toward high-profile celebrity Stephen Hawking's death from a global perspective. A thematic analysis of public tweets explored how social media mourners expressed parasocial grieving following Hawking's death and how that shaped mediatized global flows of emotion in terms of digital affect culture. Findings showed varied forms of mediatized emotional responses associated with parasocial grievings, such as sadness, shock, confusion, love, and longing. Mourners also adopted varied coping mechanisms, including individualized tributes, reminiscing, memorializing, and advocacy. Findings suggested that Hawking's mourners performed parasocial death rituals on Twitter as a legitimate public space of mourning. Findings contribute to parasocial grieving scholarship and mediatization of death and emotion.","235":"The aim of this study is to discover medical students' ideas on the phenomenon of death; produce information on how these students interpret the value-related problems regarding death that they come across in different units of hospitals; and assess this data in ethical terms. This study included a qualitative research in which 12 focus group interviews were conducted with 92 fifth- and sixth-year medical students. Data obtained from interviews were assessed using a thematic content secondary analysis. The main themes were specified according to the medical students' statements and were reviewed under the contexts of the \"dying process\"; \"effects of death\"; \"attitude and behavior of health professionals\"; \"seeing a dead body\/looking at a dead body\"; \"accepting death\"; and \"forms of expressions of death.\" Medical students' encounters with death in different units of hospitals leads them to question their values and familiarize themselves with the borders of their areas of profession.","236":"Sensory and quasi-sensory experiences of the deceased (SED), also called bereavement hallucinations, are common in bereavement, but research detailing these experiences is limited. Methods: An in-depth survey of SED was developed based on existing research, and 310 older adults from the general Danish population participated in the study 6-10 months after their spouse died. Results: SED were reported by 42% of the participants with wide-ranging phenomenological features across sensory-modalities. In particular, seeing and hearing the deceased spouse was experienced as very similar to the couple's everyday contacts before death. SED were endorsed as positive by a majority of experiencers, and the experiences were often shared with family and friends. Discussion: SED are conceptualized as social and relational phenomena, which may comfort the surviving spouse in late-life bereavement, but also provide tangible help to some experiencers. In clinical practice, SED may be considered a potential resource for the therapeutic grief process.","237":"Death, grief, and loss have always been a part of the military community. Historically, research on grief in the military has focused on the impact of combat operations and deployment separations on the grief experience of service members and loved ones. However, as the transient nature of military life and the dangers of military service exist outside of combat operations and military deployments, it is important to examine how grief may impact the military community in times of peace as well as war. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss the components of the military community that place its members at a higher risk of experiencing complicated grief.","238":"One approach to measure the demographic impacts of death is to examine the number of lost years of life. The present paper aims to estimate the \"Years of Lost Life\" (YLL) due to the main causes of death in Yazd province of Iran. The present study is an epidemiological examination for which the statistical population included all the death incidents in Yazd province (excluding stillbirth cases) over two time periods of 2011 and 2016 with a 5-year distance. The required data were obtained based on the Comprehensive System of Mortality Registration maintained by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education; while the standard life expectancy data were based on the World Health Organization standards using standard life table, level 26 of the West model (Coale and Demeny) for Japanese men and women. The standard YLL was calculated according to the WHO standard using a 0.03 relaxation rate for the future time and weighting coefficient for various ages and life years through the formula using the Microsoft Excel software. The findings of the present study suggest that two main causes of YLL in Yazd province during the year of 2011 were cardiovascular difficulties with the rates of 31.6 per 1000 persons for women and 27.1 per 1000 persons for men, and cancers with the rates of 14.9 per 1000 persons for women and 16.2 per 1000 persons for men. While the above numbers in 2016 were, respectively 22.5 per 1000 persons for women and 25.5 per 1000 persons for men due to cardiovascular difficulties; and 18 per 1000 persons for women and 15.5\/1000 for men due to various types of cancers. Our findings suggest that cardiovascular diseases and cancers are the main factors leading to Years of Lost Lifetime for the residents of Yazd province in Iran.

Additionally, providers personal discomfort and personal experiences may influence how they engage (or avoid) ACP conversations. Narrative medicine (NM) offers one approach to help practitioners develop ability to hear and understand the story of others in ways that may overcome barriers to quality conversations. This study investigated the effectiveness of a 3-hour NM workshop to develop communication skills around ACP and facilitate reflection on the relationship between personal experiences and professional practices in ACP and end-of-life care. Twenty-five participants completed post-assessments of the workshop. Key themes included increased awareness, improved skills for active listening and eliciting stories, and improved understanding of how personal experiences shape professional practice. Results indicate practitioners value the NM approach to ACP suggesting this approach may provide impactful change in practice.","241":"Sudden cardiac arrest is common and is one of the leading causes of death in the western world, and the sudden loss following cardiac arrest may have a significant impact on bereaved family members' health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe symptoms of prolonged grief and self-reported health among bereaved family members of persons who died from sudden cardiac arrest, with comparisons between spouses and non-spouses. This was a cross-sectional observation study with 108 adult family members who completed a questionnaire. A fifth of the family members reported prolonged grief, and problems with self-reported health were common, especially regarding anxiety. Spouses reported more problems with prolonged grief and self-reported health compared with non-spouses. The risk of these family members developing prolonged grief and health problems should be recognized, and professional support should be offered.","242":null,"243":null,"244":"Religiosity often predicts better adjustment after the death of a loved one, but findings vary. One source of variability could be the perceived faithfulness of the deceased. In study 1, more religious college students found the death of a hypothetical faithful person to be less sad than the death of a hypothetical unfaithful person, whereas less religious college students did not. In study 2, MTurk participants and highly religious Christians reported that the death of a faithful loved one was less difficult than the death of an unfaithful loved one, but the difference was greater for the highly religious Christians.","245":null,"246":"The unanticipated outbreak of Coronavirus had proven detrimental to human existence.

The current study aimed at investigating the experiences and needs of adult children and parents in end of life situations regarding their provision and receipt of support. The study employed a convergent parallel mixed-methods design, combining explorative qualitative interviews with the quantitative self-report Berlin Social Support Scales. Sixty-five patients (dyad 1: 19; dyad 2: 46) and 42 family caregivers (dyad 1: 13; dyad 2: 29) participated in the study (02\/2018-11\/2019). Results show that ill adult children felt less (well) supported than ill parents. Parent caregivers were often limited in the support they could provide, due to their age and health conditions. Hypotheses were deduced from patients' and family caregivers' notions to inform dyad-specific recommendations for support interventions.","251":null,"252":"A multivariate model was used to study outcomes of childhood bereavement. The model included exogenous factors such as engagement and within-person resilience factors. Sixty-two parent-child dyads were recruited from a local children's grief center and completed measures of engagement in the programming, resilience and grief. A complex model was revealed in which parental engagement in the grief program was related to child engagement and the child's control beliefs which in turn were significantly related to the child's grief symptoms. These variables existed within a system, rather than within an individual.","253":"The purpose of this transcendental phenomenological study was to understand the bereaved Older males' experiences with the interaction and ownership of a companion animal after the death of their partner. The primary researcher recruited 13 participants via a criterion-based purposeful sampling method to assure the quality of the information collected. Results revealed six themes: (a) bonds with their pets grew stronger and closer after the loss of their wife; (b) men were able to express their grief to their pets; (c) companion animals helped the men psychologically during grief; (d) pets were influential during times when the wife's presence would have been valuable; (e) companion animals helped men with loneliness and social connection; and (f) companion animals helped men find a new normal by providing a purpose and routine during bereavement. The pets proved to be a source of support for these widowed men.","254":"The Covid-19 crisis led to an increase in the 'total pain' of many terminally ill patients who faced a reduction in support, due to the temporary closure of front-line palliative day therapy services. A hospice volunteer, I instigated an online day therapy programme for patients previously attending face-to-face day therapy. Participant feedback revealed the importance of providing a space for ongoing peer support for participants' changing sense of identity, an issue for time-limited day therapy programmes. An exploration of key concepts associated with palliative care established the multiple connections between such changing identity and arts-based approaches to living well. This article charts how I used this understanding to develop an alternative, online arts-based support programme, Live well, die well. It explores the links between ongoing mutual support, arts-based activity and the reactions to a shifting identity in patients with a life-limiting illness.","255":"The study aimed to describe views on Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD), gleaned through qualitative analysis of participant responses to a set activity, run during the 2018 'Dying2Learn' Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). Data from 508 participants, most of whom identified as health professionals, were analysed using thematic content analysis, and themes generated. A large proportion of participants discussed their personal views related to VAD, specifically around choice, control, dignity, palliative care and dying at home, medical intervention, societal factors, the impact on those left behind, laws and regulations, dying 'naturally', advance care directives, and being in pain. In this study, participants had many different views on the act itself, often divisive, but also with common concepts such as respecting the choices and decisions of others.","256":null,"257":"Although the Medicare Hospice Benefit mandates that hospices offer bereavement support services to families for at least 1 year following the death of a patient, it does not stipulate which services they should offer. As a result, little is known about what bereavement support services hospices provide, especially on a national scale. The current study recruited a national sample of hospice representatives who responded to an open-ended question that asked, \"What types of bereavement support services does your hospice provide to families?\" Seventy-six viable responses were recorded and content analyzed. Four overarching domains emerged: (a) timing of support, (b) providers of support, (c) targets of support, and (d) formats of support. Other notable findings included the underutilization of bereavement support services and the utility of informal support formats. These findings present implications for future study regarding which specific aspects of hospice bereavement support services are most beneficial to bereaved families.","258":"Considerable effort has gone into studying bereavement in children, adults and the elderly, but few studies have investigated the effects of bereavement or grief interventions in young adults. Even fewer studies have reported on the effect of interventions for young adults with grief complications. The present study seeks to help fill this gap by describing a Danish treatment program specially developed for young adults with complicated grief reactions. The dual process model of coping with bereavement, psychodynamic theory, and a narrative approach provide the foundation for the treatment. In addition, it utilizes an eclectic use of techniques and a group treatment modality that involves providing individual therapy within a group context. The core elements of the treatment are discussed and then exemplified in two case studies.","259":"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a hold on the Silent Mentor Programme (SMP); this pause has not only caused unprecedented challenges for the delivery of medical education but has forced changes in the programme ceremony sessions. We aimed to describe the psychological impact and experiences of family members of silent mentors during the COVID-19 pandemic using qualitative interviews. Many expressed feelings of remorse and unrest about the unprecedented delay of the SMP. The delay increased negative emotions particularly among some elderly family members; however, there was no prominent negative effect on their functional health and well-being. Several participants relayed the belief that the soul cannot rest until the body receives a proper burial while some worried about the deterioration of the physical condition of the mentors. In conclusion, findings provide insights into the importance of not overlooking the mental health implications of delaying the SMP in future outbreaks or crises.","260":"Positive attitudes and a sense of competence toward end-of-life care are the key to adequately support terminally ill patients. This qualitative study aims to explore healthcare students' attitudes toward caring for terminally ill patients. Eleven students from the University of Applied Health Sciences in Switzerland participated in focus groups. Attitudes were overall positive. Most participants felt that supporting dying patients was a way to achieve professional fulfillment. However, most students felt not competent in palliative care and lacking experience. They wanted to receive better training, more specifically in good practices and appropriate behaviors. Our study fills a knowledge gap regarding the opinions and pedagogical needs of healthcare students, and highlights the importance of experiencing end-of-life care during the educational process. We recommend early exposure to terminally ill patients and appropriate attitudes toward death and dying as part of the bachelor's curriculum, accompanied by benevolent guidance from teachers and health professionals.","261":"According to the World Health Organization, development of the COVID-19 vaccine is occurring in record time. Administration of the vaccine has started the same year as the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United Nations emphasized the importance of providing COVID-19 vaccines as a global public good, which is accessible and affordable world-wide. Pricing the COVID-19 vaccines is a controversial topic. We use optimization and game theoretic approaches to model the COVID-19 U.S. vaccine market as a duopoly with two manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The results suggest that even in the context of very high production and distribution costs, the government can negotiate prices with the manufacturers to keep public sector prices as low as possible while meeting demand and ensuring each manufacturer earns a target profit. Furthermore, these prices are consistent with those currently predicted in the media.","262":null,"263":"","264":"The aim of this research was to conduct a risk assessment and management of psychological, structural, social and economic determinants (PSSED) in a suicide attempt. The sample consisted of 353 individuals who had a recorded history of suicidal attempt; and 20 professional individuals by purposive sampling method within a descriptive cross-sectional design. Worksheets for RAM and AHP were used for data collection in this study. The rate of suicide attempt was 7.21 per 100,000 population in this study. Analysis showed that depression and mental disorders; personality disorders; family problems; socio-cultural and economic problems; lack of awareness; and low level of education have a high level of risk for suicide attempts. Psychiatric and psychological services; awareness and knowledge of life skills; medical services to dysfunctional families; development of community-based planning for PSSED of suicide; and employment and entrepreneurship services may lower suicide attempt risk.","265":null,"266":"The persistent stigmatization of suicide calls for a careful examination of the thought processes involved in perceptions of suicide. Hence, the present study is the first to apply terror management theory (TMT) and use experimental methods to examine whether reminders of death lead to increased stigma towards suicide and whether self-esteem moderates these stigmatized reactions. Consistent with the predicted effect of the death anxiety and self-esteem hypothesis, findings revealed that, for respondents with low self-esteem, thinking about their own death led to more stigma, less willingness to intervene, and allocated less money to a suicide prevention organization as compared to those who did not think about death. Findings from this study could have important implications for how we understand the psychological underpinnings of stigma and the role of death anxiety in hostile attitudes and decreased altruism - especially for mental health professionals working with individuals affected by suicide.","267":"Residents who are terminally ill often experience transfers to the emergency department resulting in hospitalizations, which may be potentially avoidable with treatment in the nursing home. This qualitative study explored the perspectives of 15 residents, 10 family members, and 20 nursing home staff regarding end-of-life care and the circumstances prompting resident transfers. Data analysis of participant interviews conducted January to May 2019 in a South Florida nursing home identified four themes related to transfer to the hospital: time left to live, when aggressive treatments would be unavailing, not knowing what the nursing home can do, and transfer decisions are situation-dependent. Study findings underscore the importance of increasing resident and family awareness of treatments available in the nursing home and person-centered advance care planning discussions. Further research should explore the reasons for residents' and family members' choice of aggressive therapies and their goals for care at the end of life.","268":"The present study investigated linkages between multiple socio-economic vulnerabilities with infant and child mortality in India and its specific regions. Data from the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) was used for calculating the key-outcome variables, namely infant mortality and child mortality. The effective sample size for the study was 259,627. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were employed to examine three dimensions of vulnerabilities such as education, wealth, and caste on infant and child mortality. Children born to women with multiple-vulnerabilities were more likely to die than those born to non-vulnerable women. Women who were vulnerable in all the three-dimensions were more likely to have their children die as infants than those who were not vulnerable in any dimensions (predicted probabilities; 0.054 vs 0.026). The predicted probability for child mortality was 0.063 for women who were vulnerable and 0.028 for non-vulnerable women.","269":"Thirteen parents who lost the mother or father to their child were interviewed, using semi-structured interviews. Participants reflect on their young children's (3-6) grief, support needs, and what they learned from this trying time. The event scarred all participants. While some moved on, others were still struggling years after. The study uncovers difficulties associated with informing a young child, with a limfited understanding of illness and loss, in a life-situation where parents themselves are clinging to hope. While support is available from daycare, it can be better organised and structured. Proactive support that assists the child through illness and death relieves the parental care burden.","270":"To map the current research status and understand existing findings regarding end-of-life care needs in Mainland China. First-hand, empirical studies on the needs of dying patients and\/or their families in Mainland China were searched in Web of Science, Scopus, Proquest, Taylor &amp; Francis Online and CNKI in December 2019. Findings were synthesized. A total of 33 (10 qualitative) studies were involved. Chinese dying patients and their families had physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs and needs for knowledge and information. Prevalent needs of dying patients were mainly symptom control and decent look, being treated kindly by professional caregivers, family accompany, dignity, and comfortable environment. Families mainly need healthcare professionals to take good care of patients and wishes for information, knowledge, and facilities to help themselves become better caregivers. Findings lay the foundation for effective and tailored services for Chinese clients and provided insights for future investigations. ","271":"One of the many problems cancer patients experience is death anxiety. This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between authenticity and death anxiety in cancer patients. The participants were 172 cancer patients who referred to medical centers in southeast Iran. The data were collected using authenticity inventory, and death and dying anxiety scale. There was a negative correlation between authenticity and death anxiety, i.e. patients who indicated higher authenticity scores showed lower levels of death anxiety. It seems that developing a comprehensive care program for increasing awareness of authenticity in patients, may be effective in reducing patient death anxiety.","272":"This qualitative study examined teachers' experiences dealing with bereaved students following the death of a parent. The researchers conducted in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with 25 teachers in Israeli schools who had counseled one of their students after the death of a parent. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and underwent content analysis. Analysis of the findings revealed that the teachers felt helpless, confused, overloaded emotionally and anxious when counseling students who had lost a parent. In addition, the teachers discussed the complex nature of their relationship with the remaining parent, ranging from a desire to support the family through avoidance for fear of hurting the parent to fears of being overwhelmed by the child's problems. Many teachers mentioned their need for support from school officials.","273":"This study aims to investigate the phenomenon of suicide, which is a global health problem, by utilizing suicide notes. Our main concern in this article is to understand why a person leaves suicide notes before committing suicide; indeed, this question may shed light on particular personal characteristics of the note-leavers. 12 documents containing suicide notes, belonging to Turkish males, were obtained from Prosecutor office. By using an inductive and interpretative method, firstly, we conducted a semantic level analysis; and subsequently, we deeply analyzed the data by conducting latent level analyses from a Lacanian point of view. At the end of this cumulative process, we labelled the latent themes as 'ambivalence of emotions', 'issues associated with separation' and 'issues associated with the Law'. Within the scope of those findings, a diagnostic discussion was provided. This discussion designated a picture of narcissism in addition to a psychotic structure, specifically paranoia.","274":null,"275":"This study aims to identify the role of socio-economic and female indicators on child mortality in Bangladesh from the data of 1975 - 2019. A number of econometric techniques of time series analysis like Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Autoregressive Distributive Lag bounds and pair-wise Granger causality tests have been applied to ascertain the desired outcomes. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test has confirmed that neither series is integrated at level two and the Autoregressive Distributive Lag bounds testing approach has shown the cointegration and short-run and long-run relationship between the variables. Total fertility rate and urbanization have a positive effect, and female education, female life expectancy at birth, and economic growth rate have a negative effect on the child mortality rate. The pair-wise Granger causality test has shown the unidirectional and bidirectional causal relationship among the studied variables. All the outcomes are theoretically consistent and the policy recommendations are made based on findings.","276":"Based on the principles of Narrative Medicine, this study explored a narrative-based workshop for multi-level interdisciplinary clinicians who have EOL conversations. Fifty-two clinicians participated in narrative-based interactive workshops. Participants engaged narrative in three forms: viewing narratives, writing\/sharing narratives, and co-constructing narratives. Post workshop interviews were conducted and thematically analyzed. Five themes characterized how the workshop shaped learning and subsequent care experiences: (1) learning to enter\/respond to the patient stories, (2) communicating across professions and disciplines, (3) practicing self-care. Additional themes emphasized (4) barriers to narrative learning and (5) obstacles to applying narrative to practice. Results highlight the function\/utility of narrative forms such as the value of processing emotions via reflective writing, feeling vulnerable while sharing narratives, and appreciating colleagues' obstacles while observing patient-clinician simulations. Challenges associated with narrative such as writing anxiety and barriers to implementation such as time constraints are detailed to inform future initiatives. ","277":"Grief-related panic attacks (GRPAs) are a relatively common yet debilitating psychological reaction to loss, the mechanisms of which remain poorly understood among scholars. The purpose of this study was to identify the personality traits that underlie GRPAs in a sample of 314 bereaved adults. The results indicate that GRPAs were relatively common (55.4%) and that anxiety sensitivity uniquely predicted both frequency and impairment associated with these kinds of attacks, while taking into account the effects of neuroticism, trait worry, grief, and gender. Findings suggest that anxiety sensitivity may be a risk factor for GRPAs and magnified grief for some mourners. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed.","278":"China accounts for an estimated third of the world's suicides, yet individuals experiencing suicidality typically do not seek out or receive treatment. This study examines community perceptions and public stigma toward suicide. In Shanghai, China 186 adults were recruited to participate in a survey with an experimental vignette describing a suicidal individual, manipulated on gender and age, followed by questions eliciting attitudes toward suicide. Most participants agreed that the suicidal subject had a serious problem, with seriousness of the problem decreasing with participant's age. Participants reported moderate levels of public stigma. More stigma was found toward adolescent subjects rather than adult. Male subjects were perceived as being more likely to change than females. The public's accurate view of suicide without biases could help prevent suicide from getting worse. Public perceptions regarding a suicidal individual's likelihood to change could lead to stigma reduction, which can subsequently help with effective crisis intervention.","279":"The mortuary plays an important, under-recognized role in end-of-life care. A 'Life-affirming strategy' was introduced in the mortuary of a university hospital to enhance respect for the deceased and next-of-kin (NOK). Design: NOK who collected bodies in the mortuary of a university hospital participated in a survey. The satisfaction scores, needs and expectations were compared with a similar survey from 2015. Results: The overall experience for NOK improved significantly compared with 2015. The greatest improvement was achieved in 'mortuary environment', 'attitude of mortuary staff' and 'body viewing arrangement in the mortuary'. The perceived need for additional psychosocial support was significantly reduced. Conclusions: Results demonstrate success of the life-affirming strategy in enhancing end-of-life care for bereaved families. The person-centered approach modernizes and professionalizes mortuary services, with a positive impact on the deceased, NOK, mortuary staff, hospital administration and wider community.","280":null,"281":"In order to achieve an in-depth understanding of professional caregivers' experiences of bereavement after patient deaths in Mainland China, qualitative description was employed. 24 physicians and nurses from hospitals in Nanjing, China, participated in one-to-one, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was adopted for data analysis. Five themes were generated: the nature of professional bereavement experiences, the meaning of patient deaths, immediate bereavement reactions, long-term changes, and coping strategies. Each theme included personal and professional dimensions. Professional bereavement experiences in Mainland China were found to be influenced by workplace violence against professional caregivers, traditional Chinese medical ethics, the strong death taboo, and inadequacies of the healthcare system. Professional bereavement experiences are meaning-driven, comprehensive, and usually disenfranchised. They involve multidimensional reactions and have both short-term and long-lasting, both event-specific and accumulated impacts. Cultural and systemic factors could shape professional bereavement experiences.","282":null,"283":"In Australia, midwives care closely for women during pregnancy and birth and the immediate postnatal period. This scoping review aimed to explore the experiences of female maternity healthcare professionals when they return to work following a personal pregnancy loss or neonatal death.Methodology: A scoping review was carried out on published and unpublished research and grey literature looking at how maternity healthcare professionals who have had a personal perinatal loss experience working in a maternity setting following the loss. A search of the literature was performed between October and December 2018, with no set limitations. A search for relevant references from included papers was also carried out. The literature was analysed thematically. The types of perinatal loss were defined as per Australian guidelines. 10 articles were included in this scoping review. Four themes emerged from the literature and these were: 1) Impact of being asked, \"have you got children?\"; 2) Impact on professional practice; 3) Impact of pre-existing professional knowledge; 4) Importance of collegial support on return to work. Return to work in a maternity setting following a personal perinatal loss is emotionally challenging and requires a range of supports. Further research is needed in this area. ","284":"The purpose of this study was to examine racial differences in the creation of a living will among older adults, guided by the Andersen model of healthcare utilization. Data from the 2018 National Health and Aging Trends Study were used to examine differences between Black and Hispanic older adults compared to Whites. Weighted bivariate analysis and a weighted logistic regression model were used to determine the presence of a living will. After accounting for predisposing, enabling and need factors, Black and Hispanic older adults were significantly less likely to have a living compared to White older adults. Results indicate the need to examine cultural, historical, and systemic factors that could affect engagement in advance care planning among Black and Hispanic older adults.","285":"We examine and integrate last two decades of research on euthanasia from a cultural perspective. After an exhaustive search from Scopus and Web of Science, 40 studies matching our criteria are included in the review. We qualitatively summarize the literature country-wise and use text map of co-occurring terms in the titles, keywords, and abstracts of these articles to determine the similarities and differences among sub-themes in continental clusters. Research done in Asian, European, North American, and multi-cultural studies suggests that attributes unique to each culture are instrumental in shaping public attitudes towards euthanasia. We also find that some cultures, despite the prevalence of euthanasia, are underrepresented in empirical research. This review of literature on the cultural nuances in end-of-life decisions such as euthanasia is pertinent to social scientists, healthcare professionals and social workers in any given time, but more so during such critical events as worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.","286":null,"287":"The loss of a child comes with trauma, which affects parents and the entire family. Yet, there is limited support for parents who lose their child and little empirical research has been devoted to the experiences of parents who lose a child in the Ghanaian context. Based on interviews with 20 participants purposively sampled from the Accra Metropolis, this study explored parents' psychosocial experiences of child loss using a qualitative approach. The study's findings indicated that bereaved parents showed signs of complicated grief and experienced spousal neglect, self-blame, and emotional pain. Bereaved parents may become sensitive to child comments years after child loss. The quality of interaction after child loss influences how parents experience the loss. Findings underscore the need for a joint effort by government and other stakeholders in the health sector to address issues related to child loss and provide improved services to those who suffer child loss.","288":"According to Terror Management Theory, there are three common buffers that minimize the anxiety of mortality salience: affirmation of one's cultural worldview, the self and one's personal values, and one's significance in the context of close personal relationships. The current study aimed to explore the manner by which Jewish Israeli undertakers manage their constant exposure to death and buffer against death anxiety. A deductive and inductive thematic analysis captured a dialectical movement between, and within, two conflicting worldviews participants were engaged in, in their attempt to manage the mortality salience effect they experience and buffer against death anxiety.","289":"Twenty-two members of a nursing home took part in a study examining their experiences with and beliefs about unusual end-of-life phenomena (EOLP). Nearly all the staff members had witnessed and\/or been told about residents holding on for someone to arrive or for a specific event to occur before dying (95% and 91%, respectively). Other commonly witnessed\/reported EOLP included residents having sudden, unexpected moments of lucidity, sensing or feeling the presence of deceased residents, residents' dreaming about deceased relatives, friends or pets, and deathbed visions. More than three-quarters of the staff members regarded EOLP as transpersonal experiences, as comforting to dying residents and their family members, and as part of the dying process. Fourteen staff members described experiences they had had with EOLP in the nursing home. The most frequently described experiences involved the appearance of apparitions. Seventy-seven percent of the staff members expressed an interest in learning more about EOLP.","290":"The study of survivors of a serious suicide attempt (SSA)--an attempt that would have been fatal had it not been for the provision of rapid and effective emergency treatment--can help researchers understand the suicidal mind. Serious suicide attempters are epidemiologically very similar to those who died by suicide, and thus can serve as valid proxies for studying suicides. In this paper, our objective was to briefly review the main risk factors that may facilitate more dangerous suicide behavior with high levels of intent. Our review highlights several dimensions of risk factors for SSAs, including psychopathology, mental pain, communication difficulties, decision-making impulsivity, and aggression. Several studies have indicated that the interaction between some of these dimensions, especially between mental pain and interpersonal difficulties, may serve as major catalysts for SSAs. Suicidal risk assessment should incorporate a designated evaluation of these risk factors as part of suicide prevention models.","291":null,"292":"The current manuscript presents a study that examines contextual factors that can explain two distinct types of viewer responses to death in narratives. Using procedures developed in past research, we explore why some narrative character deaths elicit poignant, eudaimonic responses while others elicit joyful, hedonic responses. We incorporate a control group to examine whether freely-recalled memorable deaths are more closely associated with feelings of meaning or pleasure. Results suggest that meaningful deaths lead to appreciation; befall liked, moral characters; and elicit mixed\/negative affect, whereas pleasurable deaths lead to enjoyment; befall disliked, immoral characters, and elicit positive affect. In addition, freely-recalled character death is more closely aligned with meaningful death and its correlates than pleasurable death and its correlates. We conclude with a discussion of how the current findings can improve the use of mediated death in clinical settings, particularly as a strategy for approaching instances of disenfranchised grief.","293":"The aims of this study is to analyze the experiences of family members and hospice teams regarding hospice care in Korea where culture and institution for well-dying is in the early stage. The study was conducted through in-depth interviews based on the grounded theory method. The participants were 12 individuals, 5 family members and 7 individuals from the hospice team. 133 concepts, 34 subcategories, and 11 categories were derived. The core phenomenon was \"maintaining balance by becoming a ballast in the journey toward death\". From the analysis of paradigm model, this phenomenon was caused to the medical-centered hospice service, the negative social and cultural context of death. It was strategically responded to the scope and contents of the interventions by the hospice team. Systematic, policy, and implementation plans that could improve the quality of hospice care were discussed.","294":"The Inventory of Youth Adaptation to Loss (IYAL) was developed to understand the feelings and social supports experienced by bereaved youth to develop an evidence-base for bereavement interventions. The sample included 400 youth ages 9-17, permitting robust psychometric testing of the IYAL. To evaluate the reliability of the IYAL, the sample framework was national in scope, encompassed a range of different types of youth bereavement programs, and purposively sought diversity in the sample. Exploratory factor analysis identified five factors with distinct sub-scales indicating that the IYAL is a valid and reliable assessment instrument of youth coping with grief and their social support relationships.","295":null,"296":"Most people will experience bereavement grief, but some suffer from persistent or prolonged (PoP) grief, grief that used to be identified as \"complicated\" before recent DSM-5 and ICD-11 definitional developments. In 2020, a scoping literature review was undertaken to identify and consolidate contemporary evidence from research articles published in 2018 or 2019 in paper-based and open access peer-review journals on: (a) the incidence or prevalence of PoP grief, and (b) who develops it or is diagnosed as suffering from it, and correspondingly what causative factors or predictors are associated with PoP grief. All of the 11 identified research articles reported an incidence or prevalence rate, with these varying greatly, but with a much higher rate now that a 6-month post-death measurement timeframe is used. The predictors or factors among people who were identified as having PoP grief also varied considerably, although sudden and unexpected deaths were often implicated.","297":"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a diagnosis given to infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly before the age of one. After decades of research into SIDS, little has been conclusively determined regarding the etiology of this phenomenon. While SIDS deaths are in reality undetermined deaths, there is resistance to abandon SIDS and synonymous terminology. This paper identifies the social functions that a diagnosis of SIDS provides both to the families of the deceased, as well as the physicians who treat them. It is suggested that these social functions help to explain why, despite being inaccurate and misleading, SIDS is still widely used today. It is argued, however, that the forensic pathology and medical community as a whole should lead a systematic shift away from the use of SIDS as a diagnosis. Adopting more medically-appropriate terminology would better serve the goals of the medical profession and the families they serve.","298":"This article examines how writing can increase the self-awareness of a socially isolated and often stigmatized population: those bereaved by addiction. Writing about a traumatic event has been shown to increase self-awareness which can improve health and regulate negative behaviors. Using narrative analysis on the writing of individuals bereaved by addiction, this study found that participants were able to increase their self-awareness through writing to the dead, the living and themselves. Participants' writing also demonstrated their attempts to make sense and make meaning out of their loss which are both strong predictors of positive health outcomes. All participants in this study demonstrated increased self-awareness as well as sense-making and\/or meaning-making which can lead to improvements in behavior regulation, psychological health and physical heath. This suggests that writing may be a uniquely beneficial therapeutic intervention for those experiencing disenfranchised grief as a result of bereavement by addiction.","299":"Death is an important reality that the elderly face. In preparation for death, old people engage in reminiscence. However, the presence of addiction in the elderly may influence this process. The current study examined the life of Burt, a sixty-five year old man with substance use disorder, his reflections on death, and the different types of reminiscence he uses. Using a case study, six themes were uncovered. Burt's reflections on death revealed his awareness of his death, how he plans to spend his dying days, and his idea of a symbolic death by losing his loved ones. Burt engages in reminiscence patterns that are composed of identity recollections, life milestones, and painful experiences. These themes were examined in order to understand how an elderly person with addiction prepares for his own death. Research limitations, recommendations, and implications in clinical practice and human development research are also discussed.","300":"The present study applied several concepts typically included in thanatology research to an atheist sample. Atheists are a growing segment of the population in the United States, though little is known about this group. A sample of 355 adults who self-identify as atheist completed an online survey assessing forms of spirituality, anti-atheist discrimination, and meaning reconstruction in order to examine associations between these variables and bereavement outcomes of complicated grief and psychological distress. Results of a multiple regression analysis suggested that spirituality was not related to bereavement outcomes, anti-atheist discrimination was related to poorer bereavement outcomes, while the relationship between meaning reconstruction and bereavement outcomes was mixed. These results provide a foundation for additional exploration of bereavement processes in atheist individuals, and implications for future research and practice are discussed.","301":"The study was planned as a descriptive qualitative study to determine the emotional responses of neonatal intensive care nurses to work in the neonatal unit and to neonatal deaths. The sample of the study consisted of 7 nurses who work at the neonatal intensive care unit since data saturation was achieved. The data were collected using the \"Semi-Structured In-Depth Interview Guide for Nurses\". The data were analyzed using the content analysis method. Following codes were reached as a result of the study: 'happiness-sadness', 'professional satisfaction-exhaustion', 'empathy', 'responsibility-guilt', 'hope-despair' under the theme of being a nurse at neonatal unit'; 'unforgettable first loss', 'professionalism in intervention-and then: sadness, 'mature-premature difference', 'difficulty in giving hurtful news-inability to associate with death' and 'attachment-burnout' under the theme of experiencing neonatal loss.It was seen that nurses' emotions about working at neonatal intensive care unit were generally positive; however, these emotions changed to negative after neonate's relapsing and death.","302":"The purpose of the current inquiry is to measure Jordanian student nurses' attitudes towards the care of dying patients using a cross-sectional survey. The sample of this study comprises 300 nursing students. Data was collected using the Frommelt's Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Form B (FATCOD-B). Most of the students were female (72%) in their second year (40.3%). The mean total score of all FATCD-B items was 95.8 out of 150 (SD 8.7). Student nurses had low mean scores for their attitude towards care of the dying. Two approaches could be taken to improve this situation. First, research is needed to fully understand and explain students' attitudes towards the care of dying patients. It might be more appropriate to utilize mixed research methods. The second is to integrate end-of-life care courses within the curricula of nursing programmes, currently the mainstay in improving students' knowledge and attitudes toward care of the dying.","303":"Although research acknowledges the existence of parasocial relationships, if these relationships are possible then, inevitably, these relationships will dissolve. The emotions associated with parasocial breakups, especially that of grieving, are vital to understanding the totality of relationships between spectators and sports figures. After the devastating death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, a content analysis was used to explore the emotional and mental responses of grief posted on Reddit. The results suggest that sadness and shock were the most common responses of grief across Reddit threads, while the use of reminiscing and memorializing was also prevalent across both. Additionally, this study provides evidence to support the notion that like real relationships, emotional responses of grief like sadness dissipate over time, while other emotional responses like love increase. Thus, any study examining parasocial grieving must do so longitudinally as parasocial grief, like real grief, is a process not momentary.","304":"This study examined the different dimensions and instruments used in committing suicide and how it gave rise to suicidal thoughts among Nigerian university students who had witnessed these suicide cases posted in social media platforms. Convenience sample of 30 students who had witnessed social media reported suicides were studied using focus group discussion. It was found that suicide a single person affair becomes a group affair through the power of its postings in social media platforms which generates different discussions on it. Students tend to have different suicidal thoughts following suicides they watched in social media platforms. These suicidal thoughts come in the form of high suicidal ideation, near suicidal ideation and no suicidal ideation. Use of sniper (a chemical used in killing insects) in committing suicide by students generated more thoughts of suicide especially when posted in social media platforms than other means of committing suicide.","305":null,"306":"The rate at which children are raised in kincare has steadily been on the rise. Prior research indicates that this group of individuals are at an increased risk of mental health problems. The current study examined the suicidality and depressive symptoms of adults who were raised in kincare compared to those raised by their parents. There were a total of 1,486 participants, 171 of whom were adults raised in kincare, and 1,315 who were raised by one or both of their parents. Participants completed a measure of suicide risk and reported symptoms of depression and anhedonia.Those raised in kincare scored significantly higher on the measures of anhedonia and suicide risk. However, there were no differences in general depressive symptoms. Further analyses found that more frequent attendance of religious activities and higher levels of household income acted as protective factors. These findings suggest kincare is associated with adverse mental health outcomes.","307":null,"308":"When we are trying to come to terms with death and dying, or the loss of a loved one, cultural practices can fulfill important functions. Literature, music, and the arts can help us cope with loss by expressing our emotions in a way which seems to be universal. This paper investigates the role of co-written centenarians' autobiographies in this context. It focuses specifically on autobiographies by African American centenarians and white co-authors. The article investigates the dialogue between the centenarian and the co-author as a ritual for coming to terms with the co-author's fear of mortality. It argues that for a white readership that defines itself as secular, the black centenarian - deeply religious himself - can serve as a surrogate and a role model. Just as he assures his middle-aged, white co-author that death is not to be feared, his autobiography may offer a secular readership a model for dying.","309":"We explored the relationship between medical illness-related stress and fear of death and dying in a population of individuals with self-reported medical illnesses. Medically ill participants identified their level of stress related to their medical condition, their level of fear of death and dying, and what treatments they would most prefer for addressing any fear of death and dying as well as their medical illness-related stress. Participants' medical illness-related stress levels were high with an average endorsed score of 7.23 out of 10 (most extreme stress). The majority (70%) of participants endorsed \"some,\" \"a little,\" or \"no fear\" of death and dying. Overall, reported medical illness-related stress was not significantly correlated with fear of death and dying. Seventy-five percent of participants reported preferring psychotherapy or mindfulness interventions for addressing their stress. Psychotherapy, anti-anxiety medications, and meditation were the top three choices for addressing fear of death and dying.","310":"A review of the literature on adaptation to bereavement during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted to assess the current state of knowledge. Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. 44 articles were included in the review. Narrative synthesis showed that knowledge was largely based on expert assessments of prior bereavement research and professional experience; there is so far absence of empirical evidence linking features of COVID-19 bereavement situations to health outcomes. Severe negative consequences have been consistently predicted by authors. There is still relatively little consideration of positive or compensatory processes or the possibility that these could alleviate the effect of the shocking, traumatic circumstances. With two notable exceptions, there has been lack of attention to the role of theoretical models for guiding research and practice. A theoretical perspective (the Dual Process Model, DPM) was applied to the information derived from the available articles. Two features of the DPM framework illustrated its relevance: 1. It enables systematic assessment of the range of loss- and restoration-related challenges for the bereaved; 2. It speaks for extension of psychotherapeutic intervention to manage secondary, restoration- as well as primary, loss-oriented stressors; studies have demonstrated that this may increase the effectiveness of intervention. Directions for future research and DPM application are suggested.","311":null,"312":"Suicide is a serious but under-researched public health problem in Bangladesh. In light of this, we sought to explore the association between masculinities and suicide. We interviewed 20 family members\/friends of men who died by suicide across 12 rural areas of the Jhenaidah district, Bangladesh. We found that male suicide was attributed to men's inability to fulfil hegemonic masculine demands such as financial provision and meeting the sexual needs of their spouses. Suicide was also linked to men's loss of self-respect and respect from others. Some participants mentioned that men committed suicide as an act of self-sacrifice, while others cited mental and physical illness. As a result of these findings, we propose that addressing socio-cultural and religious issues associated with men's troubles may help to prevent suicide. At the same time, changing the restrictive gender roles and masculinity-related ideals is also needed to counter the problem.","313":"Child mortality is a sociodemographical problem in India. Although nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey) showed child mortality was gradually declining, that was not satisfactory, and child mortality differentials prevailed all over India. The study intended to identify the effect of maternal educational level along with some sociodemographical determinants on the mortality of their children. The study was run through bivariate association and logistic regression using the data from National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-2016). Findings declared that maternal education had significantly high influence (odds ratio: no education 3.9, primary 2.9, secondary 1.8; adjusted odds ratio: no education 2.9, primary 2.3, secondary 1.6) on child mortality in the Indian context.","314":"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and prolonged grief disorder (PGD) are well-documented in parentally bereaved adolescents. Whether or not the parent's death is perceived as traumatic may be influenced by several end-of-life-related factors. This study aimed to examine the associations between end-of-life-related factors, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), symptoms of prolonged grief disorder and PGD, and the association between PTSD and PGD. Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman correlation were used to analyze the relationships between end-of-life-related factors, PTSD, and PGD. Regretting one's decision to be present or not present at the time of death resulted in a significant difference in self-reported scores for PTSD, but not PGD.","315":"This paper examines how history and psychiatry have shaped social work approaches to suicide prevention. Current social work intervention strategies rely on the following four positivist assumptions: (1) suicide is the result of mental illness, (2) suicidal individuals are irrational, (3) social workers have more knowledge about suicide than their clients, and (4) that preserving life is the least harmful outcome. Analysis reveals that these assumptions hold little validity and cannot be generalised to all cases. Discussion encourages intervention strategies that are informed by the experiences of attempt survivors and a broader sociopolitical context. Social workers are encouraged to use methods that are not only life-preserving, but life affirming. Finally, community specific initiatives to increase resources and decrease isolation and marginalization are posited as potential ways to reduce suicide ideation.","316":null,"317":"Effective communication is important in providing quality care to families at the end-of-life. In the end-of-life situations, the nurses' views on how to communicate with the family are not well understood. This study was conducted to explore the nurses' experiences of their communication with families of patients at the end-of-life situations. The authors used standards for reporting qualitative research. The data were analyzed by conventional content analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 Iranian nurses who had the experiences of dealing with patients' families at the end-of-life. Nurses' perceptions of communication with families emerged base on the main theme: \"Disrupted communication\" consisting of two categories: \"restricted communication\" and \"abortive communication.\" The results of this study highlight the need to increase the professional and ethical sensitivity of nurses in dealing with patients' families at the end-of-life. ","318":"The research evidence shows that war had many detrimental effects on the mental health, wellbeing, and social functioning of the people of Kosova, which is similar to the findings in many other postconflict societies. However, there are few studies focusing on the process of meaning-making of war experiences and their impacts on resilience and growth. This phenomenological study aimed to explore the lived war experiences of citizens of Kosova from the perspectives of three generations (grandparents, parents and children) through semistructured interviews, which were conducted with 37 participants. Thematic analysis revealed that the journey of the meaning-making of war experiences in Kosova is rather dynamic and reflects the context in which each generational cohort lived and grew. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the strategies used by each generation for meaning-making and how these strategies contributed to resilience and growth. The implications for mental health counselors, social workers, and policymakers are discussed.","319":null,"320":"This paper elaborates on relational processes of social support after widowhood in mid-life. It extends knowledge in effective support by examining themes of friendship communication between widows and their friends rather than widows' individual perceptions, and co-construction of support communication. Findings indicate that when social support is constructed between individuals with a focus on the specific relationship, support is highly valued. General support that does not consider the individual or relationship between widow and other is seen as unhelpful. It concludes by suggesting future research on social support take a dyadic approach.","321":"Early large-scale swab testing is a fundamental tool for health authorities to assess the prevalence of a virus and enact appropriate mitigation measures during an epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a country's testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity. Accordingly, we propose short-term and long-term recommendations for policy makers and health authorities.","322":"This study looked at the loss of a parent in adulthood and whether this was followed by post-traumatic growth? Participants, 100 bereaved adults, from Pakistan and England, lost parents in the last 10 years. They completed three questionnaires. The study hypotheses were, first, that participants whose bereavement occurred more than five years ago would show significantly higher levels of post-traumatic growth. Second, participants with higher levels of post-traumatic growth would experience significantly higher grief scores. Thirdly, participants with higher levels of post-traumatic growth would show significantly higher levels of coping skills. Two hypotheses were rejected, only one received partial support. Yet, levels of post-traumatic growth were high in this sample. Post-traumatic growth does not follow every bereavement. The authors provide autoethnographic material to challenge this. Circumstances surrounding bereavement during the Covid-19 pandemic, are more likely to lead to increases in complicated grief reactions, rather than post-traumatic growth.","323":null,"324":null,"325":"Nursing students may feel unprepared to manage the care of dying individuals and may experience anxiety and fear related to death and dying. Preparing nursing students for this situation can help them provide quality care to dying patients. This study aimed to examine the end-of-life care values and behaviors and death attitudes of senior nursing students. In examining these variables, the Values and Behaviors of Intensive Care Nurses for End-of-Life Instrument and the Death Attitude Profile-Revised Scale were used. It was found that the students developed positive attitudes and behavior towards end-of-life care, and that they believed death to be a natural part of life and there is life after death. Students who felt that the information they received during their education was partially sufficient were more likely to have negative death attitudes. It can be recommended that teaching strategies in the education of the nursing students be developed.","326":"The COVID-19 outbreak put health threat to people globally, and self-quarantine was suggested by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak. In self-quarantine, media was the most important way to get information about the outbreak. However, the relationship between media involvement and death anxiety, and the underlying mechanism are poorly understood. We conducted an online survey of 917 participants to assess the media involvement and other potential factors (empathy, sympathy and affect) which might affect death anxiety. Correlation analysis and mediation models were conducted to examine the relationship between media involvement and death anxiety, and the possible mediating roles of empathy, sympathy, and affect. It was found that media involvement was positively associated with death anxiety. Empathy, sympathy, and negative affect played mediating roles between them. However, empathy and sympathy act differently in the association, as empathy could lead to the increase of negative affect, while sympathy did not.","327":"Grieving a child following cancer is a substantially difficult task. The objectives of this research were: 1) to describe current quality of life (QoL), psychological distress and symptoms of grief of bereaved parents, and 2) to explore the role of possible contributors of QoL and psychological distress. Forty-six parents (32 mothers) of children who died of cancer were surveyed on their QoL, distress, and complicated grief. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Parents had a high frequency of grieving symptoms (58%). Mothers reported more retrospective grief symptoms than fathers when describing the year after child death. Current lower mental well-being was associated with experiencing higher retrospective grief symptoms, a shorter period since child death, and being a father. Hence, parents experienced disturbances even long after child death. Mothers and fathers may present specificities that should be considered when developing supportive activities for this vulnerable population.","328":null,"329":null,"330":null,"331":"Early planning and knowing which factors to consider when planning the location of death (LOD) of a palliative child, may help minimize the burden of hasty decision-making in the future, and may provide families with a sense of control. The current paper reviewed which factors were associated with pediatric LOD and further considered some emerging factors that should are important to better facilitate integrative planning. Three overarching areas of consideration related to pediatric LOD planning were identified including health service factors, familial factors and patient factors. Multiple sub-factor considerations are presented. Further, the paper presents a conceptual model of the factors found to be related to pediatric LOD planning. The limitations that exist with rigorously and empirically studying pediatric LOD preferences are apparent from the dearth of knowledge seen in the field. However, future studies should continue to examine such factors more closely to better understand the nuanced implications.","332":"The WHO has included the spiritual dimension in its definition of palliative care since 1990, but this dimension is frequently confused with notions of religion. Yet, the spiritual suffering experienced by palliative care patients is primarily a matter of existential suffering. The objective of this study was to examine the ways in which the existential dimension was manifested in the experiences of those present in a palliative care unit. This anthropological monograph was conducted in a palliative care unit in a French University Hospital. The existential dimension appears to reside in the connections between individuals and the proximity of death appears to shed new light on the meaning of life. The mirror effect of death on life, could serve to encourage greater appreciation of the value of our connections with others, and the desire to take care of others, which offers new insight into forms of solidarity and social organisation.","333":null,"334":"This feminist qualitative study investigates spousal bereavement experiences of Turkish martyr spouses within the context of gender regime, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 martyr spouses. From on the thematic analysis of these interviews, this study demonstrates that (1) the spousal bereavement process was complicated conjointly by traumatic and military context as well as martyrdom, (2) this complexity created conditions requiring struggle, and (3) coping resources were available to deal with this complexity. Further, it presents \"how the Turkish gender regime affected the spousal bereavement process of martyr spouses.\" This study finds that martyr spouses' steps toward back to normal life, namely recovery after loss, were not supported or acknowledged by society. The authors propose the concept of \"disenfranchised recovery\" to explain this situation, based on concept of disenfranchised grief.","335":null,"336":"Little is known about health professionals first experiences of End-of-Life care in hospital. This study aims to understand the psycho-social process that occurs when hospital-based health professionals engage in caring for a dying patient for the first time. We conducted a Grounded Theory study, with 19 health professionals. Challenging professional boundaries is the core category which explains the overall process. The theoretical model we conceptualized evidenced three phases: 1) building a relationship between patient\/family and professionals, 2) the disrupting impact and 3) the reaction phase. Our analysis highlighted the initial strong impact of this experience, which brought professionals to perceive emotional suffering and feelings of inadequacy. The new aspect our grounded theory revealed is that all the categories are pertinent to all the professionals involved, therefore they explain important aspects of interprofessional collaboration in End-of-Life care.","337":null,"338":"Using a qualitative approach, this study aimed to examine the changing nature of death, dying and mourning among Muslims of Kashmir due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephonic Interviews were conducted with 17 participants, whose loved ones died after the outbreak of the COVID-19 in Kashmir. The findings of the study revealed that the deceased mostly died in isolation with no one around. Mourning the loss was also highly challenging with participants receiving less in-person support thus leading to mourning in isolation. The inability to perform last rites added yet another layer of grief which resulted in prolonged grief among the bereaved and impacted their overall wellbeing.","339":null,"340":"Urgent measures established to contain the transmission of COVID-19 and prevent biological hazards included very restrictive interventions on public Holy Masses and funerals. Italy banned any burial procedure and the decision particularly affected both catholic and islamic communities. The dignity of death and the religious competence as cultural competence during COVID-19 epidemic represent important aspects of the epidemic preparedness. This article provides relevant considerations about the topic from an ethical perspective.","341":"Grief has been shown to weaken bereaved persons' health, but measurements of their lost time and medical expense remain rare. Funerals traditionally managed and assuaged grief through ritual expression, approval, and social support. Research suggests that satisfying funeral participation reduces grief, while poverty exacerbates it. We hypothesized that: (1) psycho-physical symptoms of grief, (2) abbreviation\/dissatisfaction in the funeral, and (3) poverty, correlate with decreased productivity and increased medical and social services use. We collected data from 165 mourning families about their grief, funerals, and subsequent medical conditions. (1) Deeper grief after bereavement in Japan correlated with more physical problems, more down time, and more medical dependency. (2) Low satisfaction with funerals correlated with higher hospital, pharmacy, and counseling costs. (3) Low income families lost more time, while declining incomes showed increased pharmaceutical costs. This suggests that satisfying funerals and income safeguards may reduce costs of low productivity and increased public services dependency.","342":"The aim of this study is to explore nursing students' experiences with death and terminal patients during clinical education. A secondary analysis of qualitative data that were collected through 11 focus group interviews with nursing students was performed. Data obtained from the interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. There were a total of 9 themes across 3 contexts. Data were grouped under the following themes: feelings experienced when encountering death for the first time, reactions to the first encounter with death, factors affecting the reactions to death, involvement in terminal patient care, being informed about the physical process that terminal patients are going through, students' approach toward terminal patients and their relatives, health professionals' approach toward terminal\/dying patients\/their relatives, changes in the ideas about death, and changes in the ideas about terminal\/dying patients. The study shows a lack of guidance on the part of teachers who also avoid patients and families who are considered terminally ill.","343":"There has been an increased interest in optimizing pricing and sourcing decisions under supplier competition with supply disruptions. In this paper, we conduct an analytical game-theoretical study to examine the effects of supply capacity disruption timing on pricing decisions for substitute products in a two-supplier one-retailer supply chain setting. We investigate whether the timing of a disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing strategy of the retailer. We derive the optimal pricing strategy and ordering levels with both disruption timing and product substitution. By exploring both the Nash and Stackelberg games, we find that the order quantity with the disrupted supplier depends on price leadership and it tends to increase when the non-disrupted supplier is the leader. Moreover, the equilibrium market retail prices are higher under higher levels of disruption for the Nash game, compared to the Stackelberg game. We also uncover that the non-disrupted supplier can always charge the highest wholesale price if a disruption occurs before orders are received. This highlights the critical role of order timing. The insights can help operations managers to proper design risk mitigation ordering strategies and re-design the supply contracts in the presence of product substitution under supply disruptions.","344":"In the Western world including Canada, grievous and irredeemable health conditions, which cause unbearable suffering, has given support to the legalization of medical aid in dying (MAiD). It is unknown how Asian Buddhists who are in contact with the Western culture perceive MAiD. In this qualitative study, 16 Asian Buddhists living in Montreal took part in a semi-structured interview. Contrary to general findings in the literature, religious affiliation do not always determine moral stances and practical decisions when it comes to MAiD. Some participants were willing to take some freedom with the doctrine and based their approval of MAiD on the right to self-determination. Those who disapproved the use of MAiD perceived it as causing unnatural death, creating bad karma, and interfering with a conscious death. End-of-life (EoL) care providers have to remain sensitive to each patient's spiritual principles and beliefs to understand their needs and choices for EoL care.","345":"Perinatal loss may deeply affect the attachment relationships of mothers and their next-born children. The aim was to explore the subjective perceptions of mothers, who had fetal death during the first pregnancy, and their adult subsequent firstborn children regarding the impact of the perinatal loss on the mother-child relationship and children's self-perception. Fifteen mothers who experienced a fetal death during the first pregnancy and their adult subsequent firstborn children were interviewed. A Grounded Theory approach was used. Five main themes were identified: fetal death as a real loss producing prolonged grief; the importance of the communication about the dead sibling; creating and maintaining a relationship with the lost sibling; the mother-subsequent child relationship: between detachment and overprotection; significant effects of fetal death on adult subsequent children's self-perception. Results highlighted a deep impact of fetal death on the subsequent mother-child relationship, as perceived by both mothers and adult children.","346":"Aortic dissections and aneurysms (ADA) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and location of death for these patients is important in determining impact on end of life care. We analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. Black and Hispanic backgrounds had decreased odds of dying at home from ADA. Married or educated individuals tended to die at home at a higher rate than unmarried individuals. Overall, we have shown place of death in individuals with ADA is different among individuals of different demographics.","347":"This study aims to identify the factors that influence Chinese professional caregivers' bereavement experiences after patient deaths. Through a content analysis, the study reanalyzed the qualitative data initially collected to understand the lived experiences of professional bereavement in Mainland China. Specifically, the study assessed semi-structured interview transcripts conducted with 24 Chinese physicians and nurses and generated 15 open codes, reflecting the influencing factors. These were further categorized into four themes: dying and death conditions, professional caregivers' characteristics, professional caregivers' involvement, and the bereaved family. The results revealed that professional bereavement experiences and the unveiled factors relate to both the personal and professional lives of the interviewees. Overall, the health care system and cultural backgrounds should be listed as influencing factors for professional bereavement experiences in addition to the aforementioned four.","348":"","349":"This study compared reports of parental life experiences from bereaved parents at two and five years after the death of their adolescent children due to the sinking of the Sewol Ferry in South Korea. Twelve bereaved parents (eight mothers and four fathers from eight families) were interviewed regarding the changes and stabilities they experienced over time at two time points of data collection. Twenty-eight in-depth interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Outcomes of parental bereavement and changes in life over time may be classified into four main categories: (a) personal changes, (b) changes in perspectives, (c) changes in family relationship, and (d) changes in social relationship and work attitude. This study includes a detailed examination of the phenomenon among the bereaved parents. Discussions and implications are provided based on the results.","350":null,"351":"The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a rise in psychological distress worldwide. Although fear appears to be a major contributing factor, there has been no systematic research to determine which specific facets of fear predict psychopathology during the coronavirus crisis. The present study is the first to examine which fear factors uniquely predict clinical levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety. Data were collected from 256 adults in the United States recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during the coronavirus pandemic. The results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism, coronaphobia, and hypochondriasis were fear factors that predicted pandemic-related psychopathology in adults. These findings suggest that mental health professionals should screen individuals for this set of fear factors when choosing appropriate assessments and interventions for treating people who are suffering during the crisis.","352":"Complicated grief is a significant health concern for older adults, resulting in significant psychological and physical morbidity. Elements of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are often present in individuals with complicated grief. Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is a brief form of psychotherapy that utilizes the techniques of imaginal exposure, rescripting of events, and lateral eye movements that may be useful in complicated grief with PTSD symptoms. Two cases where ART was used for complicated grief with PTSD are presented. Both individuals had attempted to come to terms with their loss through traditional grief therapy with an inadequate response and substantial residual grief symptoms. These cases illustrate how ART can be used to address CG and PTSD and describe situations where it may be appropriate. Clinical and research implications are also discussed.","353":null,"354":null,"355":"The current study explores the end-of-life (EOL) preferences of a national representative sample of adults aged 55 and older in Switzerland and shows how these preferences vary by respondents' sociodemographic characteristics and the linguistic region in which they live. Many of the presented EOL attributes are considered as (very) important by a large majority of the older population in Switzerland with significant variations across sociodemographic groups. Specifically, gender is related to psychosocial aspects of EOL, age to the importance attached to avoiding being a burden on the society, and education levels to preferences regarding overtreatment and advance care planning. The results highlight the importance of a personalized, holistic and interdisciplinary approach to EOL and EOL care, since social, psychological, organizational and physical aspects of EOL are rated as (very) important with significant differences in EOL preferences across sociodemographic groups.","356":"This study focuses on the impact of common spiritual beliefs regarding metaphysical questions in agreeability with the practice of hastened death. A sample of 497 Portuguese medical students was collected. Differences between genders and religions, predictors for agreeability with hastened death and the association between spiritual beliefs and opinion towards hastened death cases were assessed. Respondents were mostly favourable to the practice of hastened death. Formal religious affiliation and higher levels of religiosity significantly associated with lesser agreeability with hastened death. Statistically significant association was found between every hastened death scenario and multiple of the spiritual beliefs used. A number of spiritual beliefs were predictors of agreeability. We discuss the implications of religion and spirituality in agreeability with hastened death. Further research is required to better understand the true weight of spirituality in one's opinion towards this ethical dilemma.","357":null,"358":"Theories of good death focused on acceptance, control, and meaning-making inform adult palliative care in high-resource settings. As children's palliative and hospice care (CPHC) develops in resource-limited settings, critical conceptualisations of a good death for children across these diverse settings are unknown. Assessed against high-resource setting tenets of good death from carer perspectives, results suggest: carer agency is limited; advanced discussion of death does not occur; distress results from multiple burdens; basic survival is prioritised; physical pain is not an emphasised experience; and carers publicly accept death quickly while private grief continues. Hegemonic conceptions of 'good death' for children do not occur in contexts where agency is constrained and discussing death is taboo, limiting open discussion, acceptance, and control of dying experiences. Alternate forms of discourse and good death could still occur. Critical, grounded conceptualisations of good death in individual resource-limited settings should occur in advance of CPHC development to effectively relieve expansive suffering in these contexts.","359":"Bereavement is a significant stressor that can affect and be affected by social support, yet there is little known about the social networks of bereaved individuals. We conducted an in-depth qualitative examination of the social networks of bereaved spouses through an interpretive phenomenological analysis. Five participants were interviewed about their social networks prior to and following bereavement. Participants described considerable changes in their social networks. They reported connecting with others who had experienced similar stressors, including via online support groups for widows\/widowers, as a key strategy for re-engagement with their social worlds. The death of a spouse can precipitate the dramatic reorganization of social networks to incorporate and adapt to this crisis. Findings offer guidance for service providers to support bereaved spouses to harness existing social networks to optimize received support.","360":"Much research has focused upon the association between mortality awareness and mental ill-health. In this study we attempt to explore positive as well as negative psychological concomitants of mortality awareness. 170 participants were recruited in an online questionnaire study, measuring seven independent variables - marginalisation, childhood adversity, rebelliousness, time perspective, attitudes toward age and stage of life, health attitudes and demographics - and five dependent variables, specifically mortality legacy, mortality fearfulness, mortality acceptance, mortality disempowerment and mortality disengagement. Several significant bivariate associations were found. Follow-up regression analysis observed combined effects of variables accounting for 28% of variance in mortality legacy, 27% for mortality fearfulness, 13% for mortality acceptance, 42% for mortality disempowerment and 25% for mortality disengagement. Time perspective, contentment with age, and paternal antipathy and neglect were the most notable independent predictors. It was concluded that attitudes towards health, stage of life and childhood experiences significantly predict mortality awareness.","361":"This study explored oncologists' experiences of delivering bad news to patients with cancer and their families. Nine oncologists recruited from three superior hospitals in Korea completed in-depth interviews. The results of thematic analyses identified four themes: precursors to bad news delivery, why it is difficult to deliver bad news, when it is more difficult to deliver bad news, and strategies of delivering bad news. The participants felt unprepared for the task and stressed because breaking bad news goes against their responsibility to do no harm and their professional objective to promote healing. Although they were unclear about best practices regarding communication styles, they individualized their communication style to meet the needs of their patients, who have an array of cultural, social, and spiritual backgrounds. Understanding oncologists' perceptions of bad news delivery can inform culturally appropriate interventions for alleviating their stress and improving patient-physician relationships in communication of bad news.","362":null,"363":"To palliate suffering, understanding the circumstances leading to suffering and its amelioration could be helpful. Our study aimed to explore contributing and relieving factors of suffering in palliative care. Adult palliative care stage III or IV cancer in-patients were recruited from University of Malaya Medical Centre. Participants recorded their overall suffering score from 0 to 10 three times daily, followed by descriptions of their contributing and relieving factors. Factors of suffering were thematically analysed with NVIVO. Descriptive data were analysed with SPSS. 108 patients participated. The most common contributing factor of suffering was health factor (96.3%), followed by healthcare factor (78.7%), psychological factor (63.0%) and community factor (20.4%). The most common relieving factor was health factor (88.9%), followed by psychological factor (78.7%), community factor (75.9%) and healthcare factor (70.4%). Self-reported assessment of suffering offers a rapid approach to detect bothering issues that require immediate attention and further in-depth exploration.","364":"In this study we examined a case where twelve participants conducted farewell ceremonies for their deceased relatives. Taking a qualitative approach, we used interviews and questionnaires to focus on life stories that involve grieving. Specifically, we asked about experiences of the grief process as related to choice of music. Our results indicate that the role of music in farewell rituals is important for the grieving process in several ways. Firstly, music was associated with positive memories of the loved one and gave rise to experiences of recognition. Secondly, music facilitated active participation in the grieving process through choosing farewell music together with a relative. Thirdly, selecting music for the funeral in advance, together with their loved ones, was also experienced as hopeful, comforting and consoling before, during and after the bereavement.","365":"Having a parent with a life-threatening illness is challenging throughout the illness trajectory, and for some also in bereavement. Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states a child's right to express their opinion and have it respected in processes that affect them. The aims of this paper were to explore the child's active participation in a family support programme, the Family Talk Intervention, in accordance with Article 12, when having a parent cared for in palliative care. Twenty families with 50 children participated. Fieldnotes were taken during the programme and later analysed with interpretive descriptions. The study shows that all children were listened to, but only a quarter reached the minimum point required in Article 12, where their views were taken into account. The Family Talk Intervention in palliative care would benefit from implementing a child-centred approach in order for all children to be active participants.","366":"Adolescents are at high-risk for adverse health outcomes associated with high-risk behavior. The present study aimed to test the high-risk behavior model among the students based on religious orientation with the mediation of fear of death. This descriptive correlational study utilized structural equation modeling. The statistical population comprised all senior high school female students in Mashhad. 200 students were selected using cluster random sampling method. Data collection tools included the Iranian Adolescents Risk-taking Scale, Templer Death Anxiety Scale, and Allport and Ross Religious Orientation Scale. The result of a structural equation model suggested that the relationship between religious orientation and high-risk behavior was mediated through fear of death. Furthermore intrinsic religiosity has a negative direct relation with fear of death and high-risk behavior, and extrinsic religious orientation have a positive direct relation with fear of death and high-risk behavior. On this basis, it was concluded that religious orientation influences high-risk behavior indirectly through fear of death.","367":"Those who are bereaved during the current COVID-19 pandemic are subject to restrictions on funeral sizes and practices. We conducted a rapid review synthesising the quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, KSR Evidence, and COVID-related resources were conducted. 805 records were screened; 17 studies of variable quality were included. Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them. Findings highlight the important role of funeral officiants during the pandemic. Research is needed to better understand the experiences and sequalae of grief and bereavement during COVID-19.","368":"Indigenous peoples have not only experienced a devastating rate of historical loss of lives, they are more likely to experience mortality disparities. The purpose of this article is to examine Indigenous women's lived experiences of grief and loss in two Southeastern tribes and the relationship between depressive symptoms and recent loss of a loved one. Our exploratory sequential mixed-methods research was informed by the Indigenous based Framework of Historical Oppression, Resilience, and Transcendence (FHORT). We summarized key qualitative themes from ethnographic data from 287 female participants across the two tribes, collected through focus groups, family interviews, and individual interviews. We then quantitatively examined how these themes predicted depressive outcomes among 127 respondents. Specifically, we examined associations between depressive symptoms and components of historical oppression-historical loss, loss of lives, and the presence of PTSD symptoms-along with resilience and transcendence.","369":"The need for training to help healthcare professionals and hospice palliative care volunteers deal with unusual experiences at or around the end of a person's life is an oft-repeated theme in the scientific literature. A pilot study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a training module designed to improve volunteers' ability to recognize, understand, and respond to unusual end-of-life phenomena (EOLP) in their work with dying patients and their families. Twenty-four volunteers from two community-based hospice palliative care programs completed the 25-item Coping with Unusual End-of-Life Experiences Scale (CUEES) prior to and immediately after attending a lecture and PowerPoint training module. A series of paired samples t tests revealed significant pre- and post-training differences on 14 items, suggesting that volunteers felt more knowledgeable about EOLP, better prepared to deal with EOLP, and more comfortable talking about EOLP with others following the training. The need for additional data is discussed.","370":"","371":"","372":"This study aims to explore the attitudes of college-age students to determine how they approach the idea of death by using a questionnaire that explores five separate dimensions of attitudes and beliefs. We received 1,206 completed surveys and found evidence of a substantial gender difference in attitudes toward death. These differences remain after adjustment for differences between males and females in other correlates of death attitudes and are not a function of gender differences in the dimensionality of the five scales used to characterize attitudes. We speculate that these differences originate in culturally defined expectations that are gender-related, as well as in substantial differences in individual family experiences of death. These speculations can take the form of testable hypotheses that should explain differences within genders as well as between genders. We believe that better education about death for college students can shape a healthier mental state among them.","373":"In many countries, an increasing proportion of deaths occur in residential aged care (RAC) (nursing homes) meaning that these have become both a place to live - a home- and a place to die. This paper reports on death practices and rituals in 49 RAC facilities in Aotearoa\/New Zealand narrated in semi-structured interviews with staff. Themes coalesced around 'good death'. Dying alone was not seen as a good death and the demands of trying to prevent this caused tension for staff. Meeting family wishes, post death decision-making, after death practices and rituals, including communicating and remembrance of the death, were explored as part of good death. Overall, death rituals in RAC were limited. Balancing the needs of the living, the dying and the dead created tension. The rituals and practices facilities are currently enacting in death\/post-death require attention, since more people will die in RAC with increasingly diverse needs.","374":"The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship of suicide exposure with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder across three occupational groups likely to be exposed to suicide (i.e., first responders, crisis workers, mental health professionals). An online survey was completed by 1,048 participants. Results indicated that first responders, mental health professionals, and crisis workers were all exposed to suicide in the routine course of their occupation. Exposure to suicide significantly impacted mental health, specifically on depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. The level of exposure to suicide was associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.","375":null,"376":"The study expounds upon the psychological concept of 'ambiguous loss,' proposed by Pauline Boss. The article attempts to broaden the concept's individualistic focus by offering a more ethnographically nuanced and socioculturally contextualized application of the concept. It examines how Okinawan WWII survivors, who repatriated from the Northern Mariana Islands after the war, relied on their belief system to make sense of 'abnormal' deaths during war, and the lack of proper mortuary rituals usually conducted for 'normal' deaths. The article argues that religio-spiritual rituals during their pilgrimages to the Marianas were the means with which those struggling with ambiguous loss attempt to deal with their psychological trauma and spiritual pain. It is also argued, however, that the uncollected bodies\/bones continue to haunt the bereaved families, so their struggle with the loss cannot come to a complete 'closure,' resulting in their repeated visits to the sites of their loved ones' violent deaths.","377":"The aim of the research was to conduct the Turkish validity and reliability study of the Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying Scale. The study used a cross-sectional research design. The sample of the study consists of 236 intensive care nurses. The data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 and SPSS AMOS 22.0 programs. Descriptive statistical methods, reliability analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used in the analysis of the data. According to the findings of the exploratory factor analysis, the scale was divided into six factors as in its original. According to results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the goodness of fit of the scale was acceptable level. Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying and subdimensions were found to be between 0.606 and 0.800. These results showed that the Turkish form of scale was valid and reliable and it had the necessary conditions for using Turkish form.","378":null,"379":null,"380":"This study describes the characteristics of-and the counseling received by-counselees who passed away through self-ingesting self-collected lethal medication after receiving demedicalised assistance in suicide. We analyzed registration forms filled in by counselors working with Foundation De Einder about 273 counselees who passed away from 2011 to 2015. The majority of these counselees had a serious disease and physical or psychiatric suffering. Half of them had requested physician assistance in dying. This shows that patients with a denied request for physician assistance in dying can persist in their wish to end life. This also shows that not all people with an underlying medical disease request for physician assistance in dying. Physicians and psychiatrist are often uninvolved in these self-chosen deaths while they could have a valuable role in the process concerning assessing competency, diagnosing diseases, and offering (or referring for) treatment.","381":"Much of the scholarly literature sees death as a taboo topic for Chinese. To test this assumption, this study held seven focus groups in the Greater Toronto Area in 2017. It found that the majority of the older Chinese immigrant participants talked about death freely using either the word death or a euphemism. They talked about various issues including medical treatment and end-of-life care, medical assistance in dying, death preparation, and so on. A small number did not talk about death, but it seemed their reluctance was related to anxiety or discomfort or simply reflected a choice of words. The study concludes death as taboo could be a myth, at least for older Chinese immigrants.","382":"Pregnant women in Switzerland expect safe and healthy birth outcomes for themselves and their babies. However, in 2018, 691 died in infancy with gaps identified in the provision of services to parents in such circumstances. Our study aims to illustrate these gaps and how, from participants' perspectives, they were addressed. A hermeneutic method was employed to analyze three cases: one from each major language region was via primary health-care providers. A thematic analysis was carried out with individual participants followed by a cross-case comparison which showed a hermeneutic of rupture, the juxtaposition of time and reshaping the family. This article shows the unique journeys experienced by parents whose baby dies before or shortly after birth in one country where neither the language nor experience is shared. The derivation of three hermeneutic themes may resonate with other parents or health professionals.","383":null,"384":null,"385":"The purpose of this research was to ascertain the availability and depth of services of bereavement care for mothers who live rurally. The specific focus is on those who experienced early losses including pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal, and young children who were born with fetal anomalies or neonatal disease that resulted in death. The convenience (nonprobability) sample originated from a population of mothers who lived in rural east central Minnesota. Participants were interviewed in a 60-minute interval. All data were coded confidential. Common themes, incidence of resources, or lack of bereavement resources for the participants' lived experiences were considered using a descriptive phenomenological approach. Our appreciation of the continuing bond between mother and child compels us to believe that there is an ethical obligation to reduce and remove these barriers and inequalities in bereavement support services for those who live rurally and have experienced perinatal and infant loss. Results of this study indicate the need for further study and establishment of bereavement resources in rural outreach for perinatal and early childhood loss.","386":"Few studies of death preparation in South Korea are available. This article describes South Koreans' experiences of death and a funeral in a hospital setting to improve health care providers' ability to care for dying patients and their family. Using Colaizzi's phenomenological method, we conducted semistructured interviews with 40 South Koreans who had lost a family member in a hospital setting. Participants' statements were classified into 12 themes, 5 theme clusters, and 3 categories: (a) vagueness of funeral culture, (b) distortion of meaning in funeral culture, and (c) the need to prepare for death and process grief. Our findings are relevant to hospital-based health care providers who care for dying patients and their family. Targeted educational information could help health care providers better serve patients and family. Policy changes could improve quality of care by allowing health care providers to transition with the family from hospital units to a hospital-based funeral setting.","387":"Very little is known about the provision of or the need for palliative care in the Middle East, including Jordan. This study investigated the mortality rate, demographics, and clinical attributes of patients with cancer who had died in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a national cancer center over a 3-year period in Jordan. We reviewed the records of 661 patients who had died and found that the majority of the people were terminally ill at the time of admission (had metastatic cancer, multisystem organ dysfunction, and seriously ill). This approach differs from the usual practice worldwide in which it is uncommon to admit patients with cancer to the ICU at the end of life. Improving end-of-life care in the ICUs in Jordan requires further exploration of the cultural context in which end-of-life care practice occurs in Jordan and developing a palliative care approach that fit with the Islamic and Arabic culture.","388":"Knowledge about how bereaved persons grieve can enhance quality in providing the support and potential services that they need. We aimed to identify ways in which drug-death-bereaved Norwegian parents go on with their lives and what inhibits or promotes adaptation during their grieving. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze 14 semistructured in-depth interviews. We generated three themes: (I) processing grief emotions, (II) proactive coping, and (III) giving and receiving support and assistance. Processing guilt rumination, reflections on blame and a burden of grief emotions characterized grieving early on. Using cognitive strategies and functional-support-giving were found to be the most frequently used strategies. Oscillation between processing stressors and reorientation to the world promoted adjustment to ongoing life. We discuss characteristics of parents who struggle to reorient and outline important implications for policy and practice.","389":"The rise in research publications over the last few decades about disenfranchised grief has deepened our understanding of this field. Importantly, it raises awareness and validates human experiences of bereavement, which are often socially ignored, muted, and stigmatized. However, while researchers in the field actively engage in the task of \"enfranchisement,\" as they present their work at scientific conferences, they might experience what we term disenfranchisement by association in the academic sphere. Based on our own experience, this article will demonstrate the parallel pathways between disenfranchisement of bereaved individuals and disenfranchisement of disenfranchised grief researchers, as it emerges in three main expressions of disenfranchisement: reluctance to listen, shame and guilt inflicting, and demand for euphemism. A conclusive note on how to address this kind of disenfranchisement is suggested.","390":null,"391":"The aim of this study was to explore factors that helped adolescents to adjust and continue with life after the death of a parent. A qualitative research design was utilized, in which 12 participants participated in semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed according to thematic analysis. The following categories and themes emerged from the data: family support-supportive remaining parent, parent has a supportive partner and supportive extended family; social support-child has supportive friends and supportive community; religion--religion as a coping mechanism and religion as means of communicating with the deceased parent; and a strong personal sense of coherence (the ability to relate to and make sense of the world) as an intrapersonal coping mechanism. In addition, the following themes also emerged: exercising, allowing time to prepare for the death of a terminally ill parent, tangible reminders of the deceased, and journal writing. The findings can be used to design interventions for adolescents whose parent has passed away.","392":null,"393":"This study examined the aftermath of adult homicide on Trinidadian mothers. This is an understudied population, and the ability of these mothers to cope with the aftermath of such a tragedy needs to be fully acknowledged in order to understand their mental health status after the traumatic death of an adult child. This study utilized a narrative analysis approach to interview 20 mothers and used NVIVO 12 software to analyze the data. The findings highlight that factors such as multiple deaths, the scale of loss, and attempts to seek justice complicated the grief process. Although none of the mothers interviewed were diagnosed with a grief disorder, it was evident that their grief was indeed traumatic. It took more than a year for some mothers to find ways and opportunities for resilience, while others continue to struggle in the aftermath. Homicidally bereaved mothers are a distinct population that should be studied as they have the experiential knowledge and are willing to share the feelings and trauma-related needs after their loss.","394":"The aim of the article is to design a conceptual framework within the theory of psychosocial ego development that will allow for a better understanding and explanation of attitude toward death in the life cycle. The main weaknesses of previous studies on death attitude were examined; Erikson's concept may help exceed these limitations. The use of the model of hierarchy of defense mechanisms to study death attitude within Erikson's theory was proposed. The concept of the death complex was mentioned to better conceptualize the problem of attitude toward death as a part of the psychosocial theory. Finally, the evolution of attitude toward death in the consecutive phases of psychosocial development was discussed in the light of the concept of syntonic and dystonic ego features, as well as death complex, defense mechanisms, and psychosexual modes.","395":"Suicide is a self-destructive behavior and social support can be of utmost importance in preventing it. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between personality traits, psychological needs, and perceived social support in individuals with self-harm behaviors in 2017. This study was performed as a cross-sectional study with participation of 115 suicide attempters by poisoning selected via convenience sampling method. The NEO Personality Inventory, the Basic Needs Satisfaction Scale, and the Social Support Questionnaire were used to collect the required data, which were then analyzed using SPSS Statistics. The findings revealed a significant relationship between personality traits, psychological needs, and perceived social support in suicide attempters by intentional poisoning. Some of the personality traits, perceived social support status, and satisfaction with basic psychological needs were important risk factors affecting suicide attempts by intentional poisoning.","396":null,"397":null,"398":"This study examined persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD) symptoms' ability to predict emotional reactions of 69 bereaved adults who participated in grief interviews. The results supported the predictive validity of PCBD symptoms for both self-report and behavioral observation measures of sadness but with only one behavioral measure of happiness. Furthermore, PCBD symptoms uniquely predicted sadness in all but one measure of that emotion while accounting for symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress, and separation anxiety. Because interviews are the primary method of psychological evaluation for clinicians, these findings collectively support the validity of the PCBD construct.","399":null,"400":"This article is aimed to examine the relationship between socioeconomic factors and child mortality in South Asia because the relationship between child mortality and socioeconomic factors cannot be overlooked for better progress. Panel data were obtained from (World Development Indicators) and (Human Development Index) for the period 1990-2017. The data were quantitative. Levin, Lin, and Chu and I'm, Pesaran, and Shin test were used to check the stationarity of data. A cointegration test was applied to check the long-run association. Granger causality test was used to determine the direction of the relationship. Fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares techniques were used to examine the long-run and short-run impact of socioeconomic determinants on child mortality. The findings from this study showed the significant impact of education, unemployment, and health expenditure, access to improved water and sanitation facilities, and income inequality on child mortality. Overall results showed that there is a negative association between education and child mortality, access to improved water and access to sanitation facilities and child mortality, and health expenditure and child mortality, but there is a positive association between unemployment and income inequality with child mortality. The rate of child mortality is still very alarming in South Asian countries.","401":"The purpose of the current investigation was to examine associations between final conversations (FCs; i.e., relational communication with a terminally ill individual from the moment of terminal diagnosis to death) with the outcome of personal growth (PG). A total of 236 individuals who had previously engaged in FCs with a deceased loved one participated in an online survey. Analyses revealed significant, positive associations between the six FCs factors (i.e., messages of love, messages of spirituality\/religion, messages of identity, everyday talk and routine interactions, difficult relationship talk, and instrumental death talk) with the PG factors. Implications are discussed along with limitations and future directions.","402":null,"403":"Physical activity has increasingly gained attention within palliative care. This article aims to explore how the idea of physical activity influences patients with advanced cancer and health-care professionals' interactions. The empirical material was gathered as part of an anthropological field study about palliative care needs among 16 patients with advanced cancer, consisting of observations and interviews with patients, relatives, and professionals. Two of the patient cases were analyzed, inspired by Goffman's theory, showing how patients and health-care professionals interact in relation to physical activity. The findings show that patients played roles either embracing physical activity or distancing it by postponement. Professionals played expert roles of duty and attachment, stressing the importance of physical activity. Thus, they accepted a minimum of physical activity when patients were close to death. Professionals regarded patients' absence of physical activity as a lack of desire to live; patients regard it as a way to live.","404":"In this article, I examine relational dynamics within a family who exchange letters after the experience of terminal cancer. The collected letters of a terminally ill husband and father to his children are presented as documents for growth. The letters are explored as a meaning making narrative of a family affected by loss and uncharted territory. As a participant researcher, I composed a letter to my husband 2 years after his death using autoethnography as a method of inquiry. Our children also created letters for their father 2 years after his death. Intentional references are made to the transformative value of letters as narrations of reflections, anxieties, and paradigm shifts. The value of family letter writing within terminal cancer is offered as collaboration, connection despite death, and re\/writing a future with a loving regard for shared stories.","405":"From the instance a person passes away, the funeral, mourning, and memorial ceremonies follow sets of religious principles and procedures in every society. However, at the same time, these ceremonies and practices are influenced by the cultural patterns that people endorse. Mourning practices among Muslims of Kashmir also derive from such a religious-cultural amalgamation. This study aims to highlight mourning practices from two standpoints: (a) the prerequisites of the Islamic tradition and (b) the way mourning is actually practiced in Kashmir. To compare the general mourning practices with the actual Kashmiri Muslim mourning practices, different secondary sources were used and in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 participants (6 women, 4 men, and 1 Islamic scholar). The study revealed that mourning practices followed by Muslims of Kashmir are influenced by traditions outside the religion of Islam.","406":"Previous studies have sporadically explored the effect of various bonds on the mental health of shiduers (i.e., parents who lost their only child). However, research has rarely classified different bonds to systematically describe their effects. This study administered a self-compiled questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the posttraumatic stress disorder Checklist, the Prolonged Grief Questionnaire, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, and the Adult Dispositional Hope Scale to 466 shiduers. The commemoration rituals that occur soon after the loss predict a lower level of posttraumatic stress disorder. Similarly, the commemoration rituals that occur on special days predict lower levels of depression and anxiety. In contrast, the continuation of commemoration rituals on ordinary days predicts higher levels of depression and prolonged grief. Support from family members and relatives, other shiduers, and nonshiduer friends are all beneficial to shiduers' mental health.","407":"The idea of keeping a body intact has been a major barrier that hinders people from making decision for posthumous organ donation or making consent for their deceased family member. The present research thus attempted to bridge the knowledge gap by conducting an exploratory study to identify the underlying beliefs, and a preliminary validation study to confirm the scale developed thereof. Nineteen university students participated in 5 semistructured focus groups; 115 participated in the exploratory factor analysis, while 96 in the confirmatory factor analysis. An 18-item scale, the Postmortem Bodily Integrity Concerns Scale was developed with 4 subscales: Filial Piety Beliefs, Worries of Organ Removal, Postmortem Mutilation Anxiety, and Detachment to Death. The corresponding measures were established and validated with acceptable psychometric properties and a model of good fit. The findings provided implications for the policymakers to devise plans in dealing with the postmortem bodily integrity issue.","408":"Significant disparity exists among non-Western and minority individuals in hospice and palliative care services. A cross-cultural approach that addresses the needs of these patients would decrease this disparity. This study reviews the literature on the experiences of patients from non-Western and minority cultural backgrounds in hospice and palliative care services to inform clinical practice by Western providers. The PubMed database was searched for qualitative studies on patient and family member experiences of end-of-life services among minority or non-Western cultural groups. Eighteen articles met eligibility criteria. The major themes identified include the following: communication and the flow of information, perceptions of hospice and palliative care, and compatibility with cultural beliefs. This review demonstrates similar themes across many non-Western and minority cultures when interacting with hospice and palliative care services. These findings emphasize the importance of a cross-cultural approach in a palliative care and hospice setting.","409":"Family caregivers of older persons with dementia have significant challenges across many domains. These reported problems encountered over their caregiving time are for many reasons, but what makes the caretaking difficult is complicated by both the unknown nature of the dementia disease and the dying trajectory. While there are studies, primarily from health-care professionals, of this dying process and the last few weeks of life for older persons with dementia, much less is known directly from the family caregivers' perspectives and experiences. This qualitative study of 30 caregivers of family members aged 65 years and older who died with dementia-related diagnoses used in-depth qualitative interviews conducted over a 12-month period and directed content analysis to understand the data. The study asked what physical, behavioral, and psychological changes they observed and experienced during their family members' last weeks of life. Three primary themes were identified around behavioral and psychological changes: (a) they become different people, (b) did not recognize caregiver, and (c) wandering and getting lost; and two primary themes identified physical decline: (a) system started shutting down and (b) drastically diminished self-sufficiency. Implications for families and professionals are reviewed and discussed.","410":"This article presents a magnification of Stage 2 of the Theory of Post-Homicide Spiritual Change, a three-stage grounded theory of spiritual change after homicide (Theory of PHSC). Having endured the disintegration of their belief systems in the immediate aftermath of murder (Stage 1), survivors turn in Stage 2 to a more extended process of grappling with a crisis of meaning. This Stage 2 process is presented within the framework of the meaning making model, with attention to spiritual meaning making and transcendental experiences. Findings can help service providers support homicide survivors throughout an intermediary stage of bereavement that is marked by a sense of stagnation and diminished well-being. By accompanying survivors through the difficult meaning making efforts that characterize this stage, providers can help position them to break free of intensive cognitive meaning making and gain forward momentum in Stage 3 of the Theory of PHSC and can focus on aspects of life that can help them successfully make meaning of their loss while positioning them to gain forward momentum.","411":"The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of current memorialization practices and their influence on grief due to bereavement and to explore ways of improving bereavement outcomes. The qualitative research design incorporated two phases, a scoping literature review, followed by in-depth interviews with eight service providers from the funeral, cemetery, and crematorium industries across Australia. The trend toward informal memorialization practices blurs the roles of community members and formal industry service providers. A public health approach to bereavement support that encompasses both groups is recommended as the most appropriate response to the evolving landscape. This approach focuses on building partnerships between industry service providers and other community organizations involved in end-of-life issues. We propose that reframing the role of formal industry service providers as educators and facilitators partnered within compassionate communities will support improved outcomes for the bereaved.","412":"This study explored the death narrative in the late Qing dynasty as expressed in Chinese newspapers in the 19th century. Using textual analysis, this study identified three themes regarding death and dying during this period: euphemism of death, definition of \"good death,\" and Western influence on the death narrative. The study results of death narrative in the 19th century indicate the historical root of perception of death among the current Chinese people, which could help the development of a culturally sensitive hospice services for Chinese people in China and other countries by suggesting language use, patients approaching, and mental health intervention for the service providers and policy makers.","413":null,"414":"Why are some dreams of the deceased experienced as comforting, while others are distressing? We propose that there are different types of dreams serving diverse functions. In particular, we considered three: processing trauma, maintaining a continuing bond, and regulating emotion. We also examined the impact of post-dream reactions on the bereaved's experience of their dreams. Participants were 216 individuals whose romantic partner or spouse had died. They provided reports of dreams of the deceased that were content analyzed and completed measures of grief intensity, posttraumatic symptoms, attachment style, internalized versus externalized continuing bonds, as well as questions about the death, and ratings of how they experienced the dream after awakening. Support was found for the three proposed functions, suggesting dreams of the deceased can actively facilitate adjustment to bereavement. In addition, there was evidence that post-dream reactions can impact both the perception of the dream and grief.","415":"This study aimed to investigate anxiety and fear of death created by the consciousness of death in professionals who frequently witness death and to determine variables related to the dimensions of mortality awareness. Data were gathered from 212 health-care employees, primarily those in emergency medicine and intensive care. Variance analysis was used to assess sex and experience groups using the Bonferroni post hoc test. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to determine the predictive relationships. Health-care employees' fear of death decreased with experience. No significant difference was observed between the experience groups in terms of conservatism values such as conformity, tradition, and security in the theory of basic human values. Empathy level was determined to be significantly predictive of the mortality awareness dimensions. These findings indicate a desensitization effect of witnessing the death, contrary to that predicted by the terror management theory.","416":"Suffering experiences are common phenomena in palliative care. In this study, we aim to explore the different patterns of suffering in palliative care. Adult palliative care patients were recruited from the University of Malaya Medical Centre. Suffering scores were charted 3 times a day for a week. The characteristics of the suffering charts were analyzed using SPSS. The patterns of suffering were analyzed using structural pattern recognition. A total of 53 patients participated. The overall trends of suffering were downward (64%), upward (19%), and stable (17%). Median minimum and maximum suffering scores were 2\/10 and 6\/10, with an average of 3.6\/10. Nine patterns of suffering were recognized from categorizing two key characteristics of suffering (intensity and fluctuation)-named S1 to S9. Understanding the different patterns of suffering may lead to better suffering management.","417":"This study was designed to promote enhanced self-efficacy and decreased stress levels for family caregivers at a hospice care hospital, thus increasing their quality of life. This is achieved through group flower arranging sessions. The objectives are to (a) enhance self-efficacy scores for family caregivers of Calvary patients, (b) decrease stress levels for family caregivers of Calvary patients, and (c) disseminate results to other hospices. The results show that the flower arranging sessions resulted in significantly increased self-efficacy and decreased stress and associated problems for the caregiver participants. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.","418":"This qualitative study examines the experiences of 16 Israeli high school homeroom teachers coping with the death of a student from their class. We used in-depth, semistructured, face-to-face interviews. Analysis of the findings revealed three key themes: (a) After their initial sense of shock and pain upon learning of the death of one of their students, the homeroom teachers were immediately asked to convey the bad news to their class. (b) The teachers experienced profound grief, had difficulty dealing with the student's absence, and invested resources in preserving the student's memory through various activities. (c) The teachers claimed that the experience affected their personal lives and stated that memories of it continued to surface long afterwards. Some found it difficult to function and even chose to leave the profession. The discussion raises the need for early assessment and planning in schools to address loss-related issues and provide support for teachers.","419":"Decision making is a complex task that involves a multitude of perspectives, constraints, and variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a process that has been used for several decades to support decision making. It includes a series of steps that systematically help Decision Maker(s) (DM(s)) and stakeholders in structuring a decision making problem, identifying their preferences, and building a decision recommendation consistent with those preferences. Over the last decades, many studies have demonstrated the conduct of the MCDA process and how to select an MCDA method. Until now, there has not been a review of these studies, nor a proposal of a unified and comprehensive high-level representation of the MCDA process characteristics (i.e., features), which is the goal of this paper. We introduce a review of the research that defines how to conduct the MCDA process, compares MCDA methods, and presents Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to recommend a relevant MCDA method or a subset of methods. We then synthesize this research into a taxonomy of characteristics of the MCDA process, grouped into three main phases, (i) problem formulation, (ii) construction of the decision recommendation, and (iii) qualitative features and technical support. Each of these phases includes a subset of the 10 characteristics that helps the analyst implementing the MCDA process, while also being aware of the implication of these choices at each step. By showing how decision making can be split into manageable and justifiable steps, we reduce the risk of overwhelming the analyst, as well as the DMs\/stakeholders during the MCDA process. A questioning strategy is also proposed to demonstrate how to apply the taxonomy to map MCDA methods and select the most relevant one(s) using real case studies. Additionally, we show how the DSSs for MCDA method recommendation can be grouped into three main clusters. This proposal can enhance a traceable and categorizable development of such systems.","420":null,"421":null,"422":null,"423":"This study has been conducted with the purpose of identifying the perceptions of palliative nurses about death and determining palliative care practices. We conducted qualitative interviews with 23 palliative care nurses in Turkey. Content analysis was used in the evaluation of the data. Three themes have been identified about perception of death. Furthermore, three themes have been identified about palliative care practices. It was concluded that the palliative nurses perceive death as a natural and inevitable process and that as long as their working period increases, they become desensitized. It was identified that the participants generally perform the following procedures in palliative care practices.","424":"This systematic review addressed the question whether the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement (DPM) accurately represents the bereavement experience, and whether DPM-based interventions are more effective than traditional grief therapy. Twenty databases were searched to identify publications related to the DPM between 1999 and June 30, 2016. Coded material included source, title, research design, research question(s), data source, measures, method, and outcomes. Of the 474 articles initially identified, 86 underwent full-text review, with 22 quantitative or mixed-methods studies included. The DPM accurately represents the bereavement experience and can be used to understand how bereaved individuals cope. Interventions based upon the DPM may be more effective than traditional grief therapy. Further research is needed to test both the model and intervention design, especially in regard to oscillation, with use of consistent measures between studies.","425":"Social expectations influence how we cope with loss and how people in our social networks respond to us. Wortman and Silver outlined Western cultural assumptions, or myths, about mourning, thought to influence judgments of one's grief response. In particular, the two myths hypothesized to affect social judgments about grievers' adjustment were related to (a) the intensities of the grief response and (b) the duration of the grief response. We assessed if these myths affected the attributions of potential support providers in a convenience sample of 510 Amazon Mechanical Turk community participants. The results indicated preheld expectancies that expressing and processing loss is important to recover from grief was related to attributions about the adjustment of spousally bereaved grievers in vignettes. However, any level of grief symptoms displayed in vignettes was associated with participants, indicating they would discourage expression of grief and distance themselves from the person grieving.","426":null,"427":"Since medical assistance in dying (MAiD) became legal in Canada in 2016, there have been concerns about vulnerable people feeling pressured to end their lives. It is important to understand what people in marginalized communities know and feel about MAiD in order to help prevent any pressure to hasten death and to prevent any barriers to accessing assisted death. This qualitative study explored the perceptions and experiences of MAiD and other end-of-life care options with 46 people who were illicit substance users, living in poverty, or who worked with marginalized people in these communities. Six broad themes were identified: the importance of family, friends, and community; the effects of the opioid crisis; barriers to accessing end-of-life care services; support for MAiD; the difference between suicide and MAiD; and what constitutes a good death. Findings from this research may be used to help inform future legislation, professional guidelines, and standards of best practice.","428":"The aim of this research is to investigate death anxiety of the people who live in Turkey and Denmark and have the same cultural background. Cross-cultural studies about death anxiety have been conducted within two different cultures. The goal is to fill the gap in the literature. In this context, participants' self-esteem and personality traits were also investigated. Death Anxiety Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and The Big Five Inventory were used in this study. Seventy-four people from Turkey and 67 from Denmark participated in this research. According to the results, people who live in Turkey have more death anxiety. There is negative correlation between self-esteem and death anxiety. Neuroticism of the personality traits has positive correlation with death anxiety.","429":null,"430":"This study examines the lived experiences of bereavement camp participants who return to camp as volunteer counselors. Participants in the study were eight bereavement camp counselors who once attended camp as bereaved participants. Using a qualitative case study design, the participants were interviewed by the researchers, and data collected from these interviews were analyzed using the constant comparison method. The findings revealed a variety of personal meaning-making themes and subcategories described by the study participants. These themes were compared between the bereavement camp camper experience and the returning bereavement camp volunteer experience. This analysis uncovered a personal growth development that facilitated a continuing progression for participants through their individual grief and growth process. Implications for the further development and staffing of bereavement camps using returning campers as volunteers and the enhanced therapeutic value these returning volunteers can provide to bereavement camps due to their own experience are discussed.","431":"Embodying companion animals as part of ourselves obliges a similar grief, when they die, to the anguish that follows the death of a human partner, relative, or close friend. Individual mourning may fail to assuage pain that is further intensified when the bereaved human lacks society's recognition not only of their grief but also of the intrinsic worth of their deceased animal companion. Such disenfranchised grief may lead to isolation and to withdrawal from social integration. However, diverse memorials recorded online, and reasons for their inclusion in cyberspace, are enabling validation of the lives of nonhuman animal companions by both isolated and more sociable pet-bereaved mourners.","432":"Across two countries and two languages, this research examined the multidimensional associations of suicide behaviors (i.e., life-time attempts, life-time communication of intent to others, life-time self-harming, life-time suicide notes, and current suicide ideation) and empirically relevant psychological risk factors (i.e., different facets of mental pain, perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and acquired capability), controlling for depressive symptoms. For the Portuguese sample, two underlying dimensions emerged: an ideation dimension and a behavioral dimension, and for the Canadian sample, three dimensions emerged: an ideation dimension and two behavioral dimensions that can be viewed as a splitting of the Portuguese second dimension. Results highlight possible cultural differences between the two countries and that suicide behaviors should be viewed as a multidimensional phenomenon not as a one-dimensional continuum.","433":"This study examined both the mediation effects of self-esteem and meaning in life for the relationship between gratitude and suicidal ideation in late adolescence. A total of 276 Taiwanese university students completed measures of gratitude, self-esteem, meaning in life, and suicidal ideation. Path analyses indicated that self-esteem and meaning in life acted as full mediators of the association between gratitude and suicidal ideation. The identified model also revealed a significant path from gratitude through self-esteem and meaning in life to suicidal ideation. A multigroup analysis found that the paths did not differ by genders. Implications for future research and limitations of the present findings are discussed.","434":null,"435":"John Bowlby's attachment theory has made a lasting contribution to scientific understanding of the nature and the impact of close interpersonal bonds, tracing their influence from early childhood through adulthood and into bereavement. The experience of separation and loss featured powerfully in Bowlby's account of the causes of mental health difficulties. He acknowledged many sources for his ideas. However, one potential intellectual force, namely, that of the eminent philosopher Bertrand Russell, is missing. The association between Bowlby and Russell is highlighted in this essay to illustrate how a monumental theory may emerge from ideas already around during a particular historical period. Scientific and personal features of their lives are explored to shed light on possible influence. Commonalities between their propositions about attachment are described as well as pertinent biographical details. Questions whether Bowlby was aware of Russell's writing on this topic and reasons why Russell's ideas were not acknowledged are considered.","436":null,"437":"As the national demand for donated organs continues to rise, the rate of registered donors within the United States has remained stagnant, creating a shortage of viable, transferrable organs. Lack of registered donors can be partially attributed to misconceptions about organ donation, which has led to a population less willing to register as organ donors. The utilization of educational interventions can begin to address common misconceptions and change attitudes to favor organ donation. A quantitative pretest, posttest survey design was utilized in order to assess effectiveness of an educational intervention within the college-aged population. Results suggest that educational interventions are effective in creating positive attitudes about organ donation in college-aged students.","438":"Stress is a commonly reported concern of individuals with chronical diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). This study sought to investigate the relationships between self-transcendence, death anxiety, and perceived stress among individuals with MS from Iran. A second aim of the study was to assess the buffering effect of self-transcendence in the relationship between death anxiety and perceived stress. Two hundred and fifteen participants with MS from four hospitals completed measures assessing self-transcendence, death anxiety, and perceived stress. Using structural equation modeling, death anxiety was found to be positively related to perceived stress. In addition, there was a negative relationship between self-transcendence and perceived stress. Results of the study suggest that self-transcendence is a buffer in the link between death anxiety and perceived stress for individuals with MS. The findings demonstrate the importance of self-transcendence in decreasing the effects of death anxiety on perceived stress and have clinical implications for health professionals.","439":"The aim of this study is to examine relationships between suicide and subjective well-being. Correlation and regression analysis are conducted on 81 countries' aggregate data from United Nation agencies. Generally, suicide is not significantly related to life satisfaction; or negative affect, or positive social emotion, but significantly negatively related to positive self-emotion, or positive interpersonal emotion. In preventing suicide, subjective well-being's affective aspect might play a more important role than its cognitive aspect, positive affect might play a more important role than negative affect, and the personal aspect of positive affect might play a more important role than the social aspect.","440":"This study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of a nursing support program developed in accordance with the Roy adaptation model that was applied in addition to routine nursing care during the treatment process of pregnant women for whom the medical termination decision. This study, which was conducted using a pretest-posttest design, was a prospective, single-blind, and randomized-controlled empirical study. In the experimental group, although the first and last assessment State Anxiety Inventory scores were higher than those in the control group after the medical termination nursing support program, there was no significant difference. Compared with the control group, there were positive differences in the Scale of Ways of Coping with Stress, Adaptation Assessment Form for Role Function Area, and physical complaints in the experimental group. At the follow-up assessment, the total Perinatal Grief Scale score was significantly higher than that in the control group.","441":"Child loss is the most traumatic loss a parent can experience, increasing their risk of negative outcomes such as complicated grief. Unexpected loss in the unfamiliar environment of the Emergency Department (ED) significantly increases this risk. Despite this knowledge, research on child loss in the context of the ED is scarce. An interpretive description qualitative research study was performed with eight parents (five mothers and three fathers) to examine their experience of unexpectedly losing a child in the pediatric ED. Data collection included interviews, demographic questionnaires, and field notes. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method and revealed four main themes: \"grief as waves,\" \"being the good parent,\" \"coping through the waves of grief,\" and \"the new normal.\" Improving understanding around child loss and implementing stronger support for parents, through communication, advocacy, and physical presence while in the ED, could greatly reduce parents' risk of negative outcomes.","442":"In this article, I argue that a holistic strategy is needed to ascertain how implicit bias, on the part of health-care providers, and structural impediments work together to produce significant barriers to access to medical assistance in dying for marginalized groups-particularly those experiencing intersecting or interlocking forms of identity-based oppressions. In doing so, I also make the case that this kind of primary, patient-centered, and institutional research could benefit from the insights of critical feminism and materialist feminist theory by highlighting and challenging inequalities, opening up debate, and exploring new forms of knowledge production. It also offers a way to shape future research of medical assistance in dying, as it relates specifically to the study of how overlapping forms of structural and interpersonal marginalization (e.g., implicit bias), inclusive of race, gender, class, ethnicity, dis\/ability, sexuality, and so on are expressed and experienced.","443":"Although considerable research efforts have focused on bereavement outcomes following loss, there are few studies which address the role of memorialization, particularly as it relates to formal service provision. Currently the funeral, cemetery, and crematorium industries are observing a steady decline in traditional and formal memorialization practices. This study aims to identify current memorialization practices and emerging trends, highlight key priorities for improving service outcomes for the bereaved, and understand the implications of changing consumer preferences for service provision. The study's qualitative research design incorporates two phases, a scoping literature review followed by in-depth interviews with eight service providers from the funeral, cemetery, and crematorium industries. A key finding is that the trend toward contemporary and informal memorialization practices blurs the lines between the role of consumers and service providers. There is a clear opportunity for service providers to engage in community education as a means of building supportive relationships with and improving service outcomes for the bereaved.","444":"Widowhood researchers have been increasingly interested in the construct of resilience and identifying factors which contribute to adaptive responses to conjugal loss. Available measures of general resilience were validated on nonwidowed samples and broadly lack face validity for use with widowed people. This article reports the development and validation of a resilience scale specific to widowhood, the Widowhood Resilience Scale. Initially, qualitative responses from 744 widowed people were analyzed and cross-referenced with existing literature on resilience to develop 49 items. The 49 items were tested on a sample of 1,188 widowed people, resulting in a 6-factor, 25-item scale.","445":"Death discourse provides interesting material to determine how societies and cultures cope with death and the sorrow of losing a beloved one. Several aspects can be analyzed: content, language, design, and so on. This article describes a diachronic bottom-up analysis of the metaphorical language in 150 epitaphs from Belgian cemeteries. The analysis allows us to determine whether attitudes toward death and the taboo to talk directly about it have changed. Based on the existing frameworks, 13 recurring metaphors were identified and analyzed. Their occurrences are linked to the period in which they were written and the age and the gender of the deceased. Epitaphs are a stable genre on all levels of analysis. The results indicate that people are still reluctant to talk in a straightforward way about death as metaphors with positive connotations prevail.","446":"This article analyzes suicidal behavior and how its inherent processes of death ideation can overlap with those seeking euthanasia. We present a literature review of three main events in suicide (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide) in different populations and evaluate implications for health-care practice and risk assessment taking into account the context of euthanasia. We ponder upon the motives behind suicide and its link with wish to die requests to hasten death. We discuss the possibility of the reversal of a wish to die as well as a potential process of differentiating between individuals who would maintain their wish and benefit from termination of life and others who would later change their minds.","447":"Despite the support with legislation in Turkey regarding extended autonomy and advance directive, there is no clear provision and sufficient practice on the subject. Turkish doctors and nurses are generally unfamiliar with the conception of extended autonomy or advance directive, which raises dilemmas in terms of life-support choice, and this situation can even affect clinical decision-making processes. This study investigated the awareness level about extended autonomy and advance directive in Turkey and assessed doctors and nurses' attitudes toward patient autonomy. This was a quantitative descriptive study. It was found that the 46.8% of the respondents supported the principle of extended autonomy in health service delivery. However, 53.8% of the respondents had poor knowledge regarding advance directive. Majority (77.9%) of the respondents indicated that the legislative arrangements should be made concerning the principle of extended autonomy and the advance directive, which is its field of application.","448":null,"449":null,"450":"A review of all 44 research reports published between 2000 and 2018 on bereavement program evaluation was undertaken to identify evaluation methods and assess their apparent efficacy. Bereavement program evaluations varied considerably, with multiple data collection methods per study common (61.4%) over single methods (38.6%). Among these evaluation methods, a self-devised questionnaire was most often used (59.1%), followed by qualitative interviewing (36.4%), and the use of 1 or more of 35 data collection instruments such as grief inventories or depression scales (40.9%). Evaluative data were usually only collected once (77.3%), typically around program completion. Formal bereavement program evaluation appears to be ad hoc and sporadic, and potentially unlikely to provide the type and quality of information needed to retain, improve, expand, or abandon programs. Evaluation method developments including evaluation standards are needed to ensure recipients and others benefit as expected from bereavement programs.","451":"This article elaborates on Robert Kastenbaum's death system analysis by explaining social change efforts among Ecological Death Advocates (EDAs), a diverse group of designers, scientists, spiritualists, and entrepreneurs who seek to develop more environmentally sensitive and humanistic alternatives to contemporary death management practices. Drawing from online and documentary data, we highlight EDAs claims about problems with conventional death management and the solutions they propose. Specifically, EDAs challenge hyperrationalized and professionalized death management practices by advocating for more ecologically benign approaches that link past traditions with new technological innovations to better align death practices with personal and community needs. We theorize EDA reform efforts as an aspect of \"death-system\" politics to carve out cultural, economic, and political space for alternative end-of-life decisions that better reflect broad ecological sensibilities and changing attitudes toward death.","452":"The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between death anxiety and depressive and anxiety symptoms among Norwegian and Turkish female psychology students. For this purpose, 304 participants were recruited, of whom 127 were Norwegian and 177 were Turkish. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 35 years. The Beck Depression Inventory, the trait anxiety subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Death Anxiety Scale were used to examine these relationships. The findings showed that death anxiety was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms in both countries. Furthermore, Turkish participants scored higher on both death anxiety and depressive and anxiety symptoms than their Norwegian counterparts. The findings encourage researchers to focus more on the relationship between death anxiety and depressive and anxiety symptoms in a cross-cultural frame.","453":"This study explores the nature of a therapeutic recreation-based bereavement camp for families whose child has died from serious illness. Open-ended surveys and interviews were conducted with parents attending a three-camp cycle over a 12-month period or a reunion camp. Thirteen parents completed open-ended surveys before and after each camp and six of these also completed interviews after the final camp. Six additional parents completed interviews after the reunion camp. Six staff working with families during the camps were also interviewed. Content analysis of surveys and thematic analysis of interviews revealed the aims, structure, and content of the camp. The findings suggest a model whereby shared experience allows for normalization and offers a nonjudgmental place to share stories, discuss difficulties come together as a family, and create a support network. These findings highlight the value of therapeutic recreation-based bereavement interventions for families whose child has died from serious illness.","454":null,"455":null,"456":"Ensuring use of valid and reliable scales for evaluating death anxiety that are relevant to the cultural context where they are applied is essential. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review of the psychometric properties of Templer's Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) across cultures. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, SID, and Magiran databases were systematically searched for studies published between 1970 and 2017 using Mesh terms. Two independent researchers used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and Checklist of Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy to evaluate study quality. Included studies were conducted in Iran, United States, Italy, China, Egypt, Spain, and Australia. Overall study quality was acceptable in 15 evaluated articles. However, findings demonstrated that two (one study), three (seven studies), four (four studies), and five factors (three studies) were extracted across the respective studies. Confirmatory concurrent validity was assessed in two studies. While Templer's DAS has stood the test of time as a commonly used index of capturing the conscious experience of death anxiety, there are psychometric inconsistencies in identified factor solutions across cultures. Findings emphasize the need for continued evaluation of how the DAS is translated in specific countries with assessment in relation to other death construct tools.","457":"This article presents the results of an experience of death education (DE) course with bibliodrama in Italian high schools, which focused on emotions and existential themes. The research analyzed the inability to recognize or describe one's own emotions (alexithymia), fantasy-proneness, and attitudes toward death in two different groups of students: one who took a course on DE (with 113 students) and another who did not participate in it (with 114 students). The use of a mixed method allowed this study to explore the quantitative results that the students indicated in the questionnaire and the qualitative open answers to the final question about how they had profited from this DE course. The results showed that the course had a positive effect, as the DE group significantly decreased alexithymia and negative attitudes toward death, particularly in fear and avoidance of death, making their representation of death less traumatic.","458":null,"459":"Online support groups are popular for peer support, particularly for uncommon or stigmatized topics including pregnancy and infant loss. We conducted a randomized, controlled, 6-week feasibility study of three groups: an anonymous BabyCenter.com loss support group, a closed Facebook loss group, or a control group. Intervention arm mothers were asked to sign on to their support sites for 6 weeks. Participants completed regular surveys, text message surveys after each log-in, and a final semistructured phone interview. Thirty women were randomized to each arm of the study. Women reported preference for anonymous groups and found it empowering to support others, although many noted an emotional cost to reading postings. Tracking usage online was a major issue despite multiple strategies to collect these data. This pilot demonstrated feasibility of a randomized trial for online perinatal support but noted a critical need for more reliable methods to track usage.","460":"Grave spaces within Yoruba (Nigeria) societies are not just ordinary symbols, and they constitute \"other place\" used to meet individuals' physical and social needs. This study examined how residential grave spaces within Yoruba social structure are used by them in meeting their day-to-day needs. Drawing from symbolic interactionism theory, and data gathered from Ekiti-Yoruba culture, this study investigates how community members define and utilize the place of graves from traditional to modern society in meeting their needs. Findings revealed that during the precolonial society, grave spaces served religious and endearment purposes. While still retaining these functions in modern era, the functions have increased to security, protections, and power play due to the hurdles posed by modernity. The article concluded that the practice may continue in spite of its opposition by policy makers and orthodox faiths.","461":"Parentally bereaved children and adolescents are at risk of developing psychological health problems. Evidence for a correlation between communication and broad measures of psychological health exists in other populations. The aim of this study was to examine associations between family communication and specific aspects of psychological health for children and adolescents following a parent's death from cancer using parent-proxy and adolescent self-reports. Parent-proxy reports for children and adolescents, and adolescent self-reports for Parent-Adolescent Communication, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and Prolonged Grief-13 child were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation. Parents rated communication as moderate in quality and reported good psychological health for children and adolescents. Adolescent self-reports indicated low-quality communication with their parent and poor psychological health. Significant associations between Parent-Adolescent Communication subscales and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire subscales were found for each group. Prolonged grief was associated with emotional problems but not communication for all three groups.","462":null,"463":"The aging population in the United States is predicted to become one fifth of the population by 2050. With that increase, more individuals in the country will be experiencing chronic health conditions and the need for care, with end of life (EoL) becoming more of a topic that needs to be discussed. This study aims to explore the ways adult children talk to their parents about EoL, death, and dying. We discovered six themes: protection, meeting needs, guilt and regret, control, family dynamics, and communication type. Each of these was prevalent in responses to how adult children cope, how they cared for their parent, and how hope played into the interactions. We believe these themes will be helpful in developing a quantitative scale to study EoL further and be practical in helping adult children cope following death of their parent.","464":"As digital outlets of expression become increasingly accessible, means of conveying grief and commemorating the deceased have migrated online. Online memorial websites such as UK-based Muchloved.com boasts thousands of Tributes created by the bereaved to remember the deceased. Many of these Tributes sketch out a rough picture of the person commemorated through text detailing their personal lives, professions, hobbies, and accomplishments, as well as photographs capturing intimate moments with family and community, and condolences contributed by family, friends, and community members. This article examines how stories of migration figure in this large pool of digital Tributes. We draw from Moncur and Kirk's \"emergent framework\" for the study of digital memorials by analyzing 17 Tributes on MuchLoved.com, which commemorated individuals who, according to these Tributes, migrated from one nation to another. We find that the practices and conventions of memorial-writing to commemorate first-generation immigrants perpetuate narratives of exceptionality.","465":"Hospice health-care professionals (HCP) evaluate and manage cancer pain in patient homes. This study explores HCP's perceptions of barriers that affect pain management for home hospice cancer patients. A convenience sample of 20 experienced hospice HCP were recruited from a regional hospice agency. Data were collected through two focus groups using semistructured interviews and analyzed using a constant comparative approach to generate themes. An unexpected finding revealed patient's religious and cultural beliefs about suffering and family caregiver's beliefs that patients deserve to suffer due to past actions are barriers to pain management in home hospice. Hospice HCP can identify patients at risk for suffering at the end of life. Interventions targeting spiritual suffering and needs are needed. Home hospice HCP have an ethical obligation to address undue suffering through family's withholding of necessary pain medications and should consider alternative placement when home is not suitable for a peaceful death.","466":"This article explores the relationship between grief and best friendship (BF) dynamics among adolescent girls. Based on a qualitative interview study with 10 Danish girls, findings suggest that bereavement affects friendship dynamics in ways that challenge the by-standing friend in succeeding with being and staying supportive. Through a thematic analysis, we identify 12 themes that cut across the case stories, all of which testify to the difficulties bereavement represent to friendship quality and maintenance. Among other issues, it seems like grief is contagious and the bereaved friend changes her way of responding to the by-standing friend in ways that disturb expectations, values, and virtues of BF among girls in adolescence. The general categories found to be characteristic for long-term BFs, that is, positivity, supportiveness, openness, and interaction are all affected by bereavement in adolescent BFs among girls.","467":"This study examined gender differences in mental health of bereaved parents related to the gender of deceased only child in China, an only-child society with traditional culture of son preference, using data drawn from the China Family Planning Survey on Vulnerable Households in 2017. The findings indicated that parents with deceased only child suffered from more negative mental health symptoms than nonbereaved parents. For only-child-death families, there were no statistically significant gender differences in mental health of parents, and the gender of the deceased only child was basically unrelated to maternal\/paternal mental health. Due to the implementation of one-child policy in China, both sons and daughters are highly prized and equally relied on by aging parents owing to the irreplaceability of the only child, which might moderate the effects of traditional culture of son preference on bereaved parental mental health.","468":"In the traditional\/religious context of the Iranian society, dream plays a very important role. To understand its role, the purpose of this study was to discover the role of dreams in the lives of the bereaved and to reconstruct semantics. In this study, the qualitative approach and grounded theory have been considered. In this regard, the bereaved, whom their loved ones were passed away at least 4 months and at last 4 years, were studied by deep interviewing until data saturation occurs. Therefore, the findings of this study revealed the dualism of dream\/awakening in the bereaved, which ultimately results in the deconstruction of the bereaved due to the spiritual interaction of the bereaved and the deceased.","469":"The concept of roles has been crucial to the theoretical understanding of the construction of the dying process and the subjective experience of dying. Talcott Parsons first outlined the sick role in 1951. Beginning in the early 1960s, the academic literature recognized that those with chronic illness do not fit the criteria for the sick role as Parsons defined it. Since the introduction of hospice and palliative care, a new intermediate role has been constructed by the medical system. This role has been designated the chronic sick role. Formally defining the intermediate role between the sick and dying roles will help alleviate the issue of role confusion and serves to define what is now a gray and liminal phase between sickness and dying.","470":"Kastenbaum and Aisenberg identified a phenomenon, wherein American subjects personified death in four distinctive figures: Macabre, Gentle Comforter, Gay Deceiver, and Automaton. Until recently, though, researchers did not attempt to answer the question, \"What specific aspects of the death experience can be attributed to each of those four personifications?\" To answer this question, the current qualitative research asked individuals to envision the causes, places, and contexts of death after imagining each personification of death. The results have revealed that people associated each personification of death with distinct causes, places, and contexts of death: Macabre-murder taking place outside the home, Gentle Comforter-peaceful death by old age at home, Gay Deceiver-death from heart attack, and Automaton-death from cancer in a modern hospital. This article also discusses unanswered questions, limitations, and directions to take its research in the future.","471":"This review gives an overview of treatments used to concurrently reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). For purposes of this review, emphasis is placed on locating and comparing literature on exposure- and nonexposure-based treatments. Across 14 studies, the overall findings suggest that treatments are generally effective in treating PTSD and PGD concurrently and that treatments incorporating exposure-based components performed similarly to those without exposure-based components. However, methodological limitations preclude the ability to draw firm conclusions about the added impact of exposure-based components in traumatic grief treatment. Future directions for research on concurrent treatments for PTSD and PGD are discussed.","472":"Families are struggling with many challenges in the final stages of patient life. It is important to understand what actions nurses do for the family of the end-of-life (EOL) patients. This study aimed to explain the main strategy of nurses' dealing with the family of the EOL patients. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Semistructured interviews were conducted on 32 nurses from hospitals in Tehran. Nurses used six measures of explaining the bitter reality, effective communication, management of violence, referral, consolation, and reinforcement. \"Contingency help\" was conceptualized as the main strategy. Nurses through \"contingency help\" were involved in solving the emotional, physical, financial, and spiritual needs of the family. Nurses will be able to apply the results of this study to the development of care policies for the family of the EOL patients.","473":"This article presents qualitative data to explore the experience of farming family members faced with accidental or suicide death and understand how this is experienced within the farming context. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 members of Australian farming families bereaved by suicide or accidental death. Qualitative data was thematically analyzed. Three interconnected themes were identified: acceptance of risk, normalization of death, pragmatic behavior patterns and connection to place. Bereavement and reconstruction of meaning following suicide or accidental death for farming families is influenced by the cultural, social, geographical, and psychological contexts of farming families. This article challenges traditional conceptions of suicide and accidental death as necessarily experienced as \"violent\" or \"traumatic,\" bereavement as experienced similarly across western cultures, and the reaction to suicide or accidental death as one that challenges people's understanding of their world and leaves them struggling to find a reason why the death occurred.","474":"Journalism has taken on a new form in the age of new media, allowing anyone to not only report the news, but to provide visual proof of it, uncensored and freely available. When this visual proof began to allow people to see death in its entirety, various communities began to form to not just view these videos but to also ensure their availability and continuation. This essay is about those communities and how they operate.","475":"Finding alternative ways to reconnect with the deceased is a common feature of bereavement. However, it is currently unclear how bereaved children or young people establish and develop a \"continuing bond\" with deceased family members. To investigate how bereaved young people continue bonds with deceased family members. A systematically conducted narrative review was conducted using six electronic databases: CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and BNI. Limiters were applied to peer-reviewed articles published in English. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Twenty articles were included in the review. Three overarching themes were generated: unintended connections, intended connections, and internalized connections. Bereaved young people establish a sense of connection with deceased family members through various means (e.g., unprovoked or spontaneous reminders, physical mementos, internalized memories). Some connections are unintended and occur spontaneously. However, other young people will specifically seek ways to remember the deceased to provide a sense of enduring connection. ","476":"Veterinary professionals are recognized as an important source of support for many veterinary clients, particularly during companion animal euthanasia and end-of-life care. While many veterinary professionals recognize the importance of their role, many also report feeling unsure about what methods of support are most effective. Furthermore, few evidence-based guidelines currently exist to inform veterinary professionals on the support of grieving clients. To begin bridging this gap, this study qualitatively explored how veterinary professionals currently report supporting grieving clients before, during, and after companion animal euthanasia. Findings suggest that veterinary participants in this study strive to be meaningful sources of support for grieving clients and employ an array of support practice to do so. However, opportunities exist for veterinary professionals to better explore clients' needs, expectations, and feelings as they relate to companion animal euthanasia, including offering more grief-related resources and access to professional counseling services.","477":"This article examines how hospice philosophy works in contemporary Danish hospice practice. The still sparse literature on Danish hospices indicates that hospice philosophy is influencing professional practice. In international palliative care literature, hospice philosophy is challenged for being overly normative in its ideal of the good death or on the other hand as threatened by the medical model. Drawing on the idea of hospice philosophy as providing meaning for everyday practice, this article explores how it is incorporated within the institutional order of contemporary Danish hospices. An ethnographic study was informed by participant observation and 49 interviews with professionals, patients, and families at three hospices in Denmark. The findings contribute to further understanding of the complexity of maintaining hospice philosophy in contemporary practice. Hospice practice works in an interpretive way with hospice philosophy to offer a \"lived\" philosophy and a means to an authentic death.","478":"This longitudinal nonheroic narrative study allows familiarity with personal and societal transitions in the self-identity of individuals with life-threatening cancer. The theoretical anchor is Bion's container-contained theory. Five interviews with a terminally ill hospitalized male in his 30s were conducted along intervals of between 6 and 8 weeks, up to 2 months before his death. Data were analyzed using the selection mechanisms method. Findings provide insights about the hospitalization experience, his grief, and disenfranchised grief. A rigid mode of container-contained relationships with clinicians created disenfranchised grief. Reflection and coherence among self-identities lead to inner strength and emotional growth despite the body's deterioration. Clinicians have a role in holistic identity transitions of individuals with cancer. Findings illuminate practical recommendations that clinicians may adopt to improve the experience of individuals suffering from cancer at the chronic and terminal phase of illness.","479":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to discover the coping strategies used by Spanish (European) women to cope with a pregnancy loss. Sixteen women with miscarriages and stillbirths were interviewed. All of the women were Spanish European. The mean age of the women was 35 years, and most were university graduates, married, employed, and with living children. Audio-recorded interviews and field notes were transcribed and then subsequently coded and analyzed in individual or team sessions. Construction and confirmation of the categories and related themes derived from the data was a collaborative process. Two themes emerged regarding the coping strategies used by women: talking and avoiding. This study expands the theoretical model \"Multicultural Model of Coping after Pregnancy Loss\" and guides health providers regarding interventions used in practice.","480":"Most people avoid talking about death with children even when required, as they are unsure at what age children start understanding the concept of death. Although this question has been researched in the west, it has not been answered in the Indian context. Therefore, this study was conducted in India with 25 children (14 females, 11 males; 3-5 years), using play and joint story construction method, along with semistructured interviews. Results indicated that majority of the children understood that everyone has to die, including significant people like their own parents (i.e., universality) and also, many children understood that death is final (i.e., irreversibility). However, only few children understood that all cognitive\/behavioral functions cease at death (i.e., nonfunctionality). In conclusion, only a small proportion of preschoolers seems to have had a mature concept of death.","481":"","482":"One of the most prominent features of the U.S. labor force is sex segregation among college majors and across career choices. Hegemonic cultural gender beliefs shape career choices and most men and women go into gender typical majors and occupations, even in death care industries. To better understand how cultural gender beliefs shape occupational choice and socialization, this article investigates the gendered pathways to funeral directing, an occupation historically male-dominated and currently feminizing. Using 21 interviews with mortuary science students, the findings indicate gender differences in the pathways to funeral work and highlight how occupational choice and socialization into funeral work is a gendered process.","483":"This article examines the experiences of family members when a loved one dies after police contact in the United States. It uses qualitative data from semistructured interviews with the bereaved families of 43 U.S. citizens who died after police contact and considers their experiences as covictims of homicide. It examines how they experience grief in the aftermath of such a death and considers Doka's concept of disenfranchised grief in evaluating how social norms affect their grieving process. It argues that individuals affected by deaths after police contact are often unable to grieve in a way that is socially legitimized. The article finds that disenfranchised grief has a racial dimension with regard to deaths after police contact with non-White families being deeply affected by it due to their position within society, the context in which their loved one died, and in terms of how the deceased was socially constructed.","484":null,"485":"Losing a loved one as a result of murder is a profoundly traumatic experience. This is even more precise with regard to children who have lost an immediate family member, such as a parent or a sibling. This experience may severely impact the children's social and emotional lives, their functioning, adaptability, and psychological and physical development. In the last few years, public and therapeutic awareness in Israel has been raised with regard to the effect of murder cases on the families of the victims. In 2009, the Israeli government approved an assistance program for families bereaved by homicide in Israel. This article focuses on the treatment of grieving children in the Arab community, which touches upon the violent nature of the murder, requires awareness, and broadens the knowledge of children's grieving processes, as well as religious, cultural, and social perceptions regarding death and treatment-seeking.","486":"Although most employees and business owners or operators will likely experience the death of one or more loved ones over their work lives, attention has not focused on how bereavement grief impacts the workplace. A study was conducted for foundational information. Data on the annual incidence of bereavement leaves and related matters were collected from a relatively representative sample of small, medium, and large Canadian organizations. Two of every three organizations had 1+ employees take a bereavement leave last year, with 3.2% of all employees taking a bereavement leave consisting of 2.5 days on average and often with additional travel and accommodation days. The findings suggest that more should be done by organizations to prepare for bereavement leaves and assisted work returns. This preparation is essential for the tsunami of bereavement grief in the years ahead as deaths increase rapidly in number with population aging.","487":"This article is an autoethnographic exploration of college faculty grief. Over a career, a college teacher is likely to encounter deaths of current and former students. The rich connections that can develop in a faculty-student relationship can make for strong grief. Issues that can complicate faculty grief include regrets that might be unique to faculty-student relationships and information about the deceased that the faculty member feels obligated to keep confidential and cannot mention while processing their grief with others. Faculty members may rarely have the benefit of attending funeral or memorial services for students and former students, but with the deaths of current or recent students, a faculty member is likely to have colleagues and students who knew the deceased with whom to talk. With deaths of students from long ago, a faculty member is likely to be limited to processing grief with people who never knew the deceased.","488":"This qualitative case study describes the end-of-life care for a physically healthy, although psychologically dying man. The letters of Countess Moltke to her husband who was sentenced to death and executed during the Nazi regime were analyzed content analytically. Three content clusters emerged, namely, Caring, Comforting, and Providing meaning, all of which were stimulated by Attachment to the dying person and by Expression of empathy, respectively. It is demonstrated that during the final 6 weeks, her care was well adapted to the course of his dying. The findings are summarized by the allegory of the dancing couple.","489":"There is a paucity of cross-national studies evaluating protective models for suicidal behaviors. Thus, using a behavioral framework, the purpose of this study was to examine whether higher levels of life-enhancing behaviors could mitigate or weaken the relation between depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors in United States and Pakistani college students. A total of 811 students (449 Pakistani and 362 U.S. students) participated in the study. Results indicated that the strength of the relation between depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors was stronger for U.S. students. In addition, the association between depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors weakened in the presence of high engagement in life-enhancing behaviors. This effect was comparable in strength for American versus Pakistani students. The results offer preliminary evidence for life-enhancing behaviors as a protective factor for suicide across unique cultural settings and may serve as a valuable area of focus for secondary prevention programs.","490":"This study investigates medical trainees' experiences with dying and death, by means of semistructured interviews. Nine medical students and nine residents reported a total of 114 experiences. The great majority of these experiences took place during the final year of medical school. The authors identified the latent characteristics, which illustrate an in-depth understanding of the significance of the described experiences. Three main themes emerged: circumstances of death, personal relationship, and one's own role. The age of the dying person, the extent of suffering, time frame and setting, and the patients' behaviors were factors that influence the perceptions of the experiences. The interviewees reported powerful emotional consternation by the patients' deaths with whom they had developed a close relationship. Failure, helplessness, and guilt were negatively associated perceptions of one's own role. This study illustrates the tension between emotional concern and professional detachment. It highlights the continuing existence of a physician image, in which control represents the key issue.","491":null,"492":"The goal of the presented research was to investigate if wisdom plays a mediating role in the relationships between meaning in life and the attitude toward death in the period of middle and late adulthood. A study was carried out that included 567 persons aged 40 to 75 years. Three measures were used: Personal Meaning Profile, Three-Dimensional Wisdom Scale, and Death Attitude Profile-Revised. The conducted analyses allowed the authors to confirm the mediating role of wisdom in the relationships between meaning in life and fear of death as well as death avoidance in persons during the period of middle and late adulthood.","493":null,"494":"Grief and bereavement are universal human experiences that do not discriminate based on sex, gender, or sexual orientation. Existing literature provides valuable insight into the bereavement experiences of persons who identify as heterosexuals, but much less can be found on persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender\/queer* (LGBT*). Given that the historical experiences of loss and personal characteristics such as interpersonal, familial, and social patterns of coping with grief are likely to influence the bereavement process, this study focused on the impact of partner bereavement on the interpersonal relationships and subsequent partnerships of the LGBT* bereaved. To this end, the purpose of this study was to use a mixed-methods approach to better understand how LGBT* persons described their experiences with partner bereavement and to identify what effect these experiences had on interpersonal relationships and subsequent partnerships.","495":"Coping affects somatic and psychological outcomes. This article explores narratives in a book, Kamikaze Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers, which report on the ways of coping used by each kamikaze participant before and during military service. The purpose of this study is to observe the possibility of a trend in coping strategies and consider how these trends inform us about other populations facing imminent death. This study analyzed data and extracted meaning from the narratives in the book (thematic content analysis). Within the thematic content analysis, the Ways of Coping scale was used, which describes the coping strategies people use when facing problems. The most frequently used coping strategies before they entered the military were \"Accept Responsibility,\" \"Endurance\/Obedience\/Effort,\" and \"Self-Control,\" while once in the military, they were \"Accept Responsibility\" and \"Endurance\/Obedience\/Effort.\" All the coping strategies used by kamikaze pilots appeared to focus on the passive self, which may be the type of coping in other populations facing death.","496":"Bereavement by suicide is a unique form of grief characterized by features such as stigma, shame, and rejection that may complicate the grieving process and place people at heightened risk for specific mental health disorders, suicide attempts, and dying by suicide. To better understand the unique support needs of the suicide-bereaved and how these can be met, this Australian study qualitatively explored the experiences of people bereaved by suicide. Fifteen individuals who had lost a spouse or partner or a family member to suicide formed three focus groups across different locations in Queensland, Australia. Analysis identified four dominant themes: changing support needs, difficulties navigating services, experiences of stigma and social isolation, and connecting with others. The results from this study provide a powerful insight into the experiences and specific needs of the suicide-bereaved and could inform further development of suicide bereavement support services.","497":"This study focuses on college students' experiences and beliefs, which affect attitudes toward assisted dying. Of 324 students, 35% wanted the option of assisted dying for a family member with a life-threatening illness. Results of multiple logistic regression indicate students who favored assisted dying were significantly influenced by having a family member die, experiencing hospitalization, thinking about end-of-life issues, and being comfortable with palliative care. Belief in an afterlife and being a caregiver were negatively associated with assisted dying. Students need to receive training in end-of-life care issues, as increasingly professionals will face such requests.","498":"A child's death is a traumatic life experience for parents. Health-care professionals (HCPs) have sought guidance on how to intervene with grieving parents, particularly with fathers. Having therapeutic conversations is an effective way for HCPs to support grieving fathers. In our previous study, fathers identified core beliefs that influenced their experience of grief and coping. In this article, the Illness Beliefs Model was integrated with the findings to provide a framework for interventions to create open conversations, ease fathers' suffering, and thereby help their spouse and family suffering as well. This article will guide HCPs to engage in therapeutic conversations to support bereaved fathers.","499":"Today every aspect of our life is published and shared online, including grief. The virtual cemeteries and social networks' use could be considered as a new modern mortuary ritual. Starting from the keyword stillbirth, 50 videos published on YouTube since 2008 have been analyzed qualitatively. The videos, 70% published by the mother, with an average length of 5.52 minutes, a mean of 2,429,576 views and 2,563 of comments, follow a sort of script: the second part with black and white photos, background music, and religious references. Could the continuous access to the child's technological grave encourage a complicated grief or be a support, given by the interaction with users, limiting the sense of isolation. The parent shows his or her own conceptions about death and, as a modern baptism, presents the child to the whole society. Videos keep child's memory alive and fuel a process of personalization and tenderness in the user.","500":null,"501":"The purpose of this descriptive study was to identify whether meaning reconstruction was associated with indicators of bereavement adaptation in 66 spouses and adult child caregivers of person's with Alzheimer's disease. A cross-sectional mixed-methods design was used. Hierarchical regression models were used to examine whether meaning making predicted grief, depression, and positive and states of mind in the sample. Qualitative interviews were conducted to gain further knowledge about ways in which Alzheimer's disease caregivers construct meaning during bereavement. The majority of participants reported experiencing positive aspects of meaning reconstruction. Benefit-finding and identity change contributed to reductions in grief, and benefit-finding contributed to positive states of mind. Being a spouse and female gender contributed to increased grief and depression. Bereaved caregivers who are at risk for high levels of grief should be targeted for grief therapy interventions that foster meaning making.","502":null,"503":"Social workers were introduced to funeral homes in China amid the transition and expansion of both the funeral home industry and the social work profession and are proving to play a valuable, though under-researched role in serving not just clients but also communities and funeral home staff. Funeral home social work fills gaps in after-death care and mental health and is distinct from palliative, hospice, end-of-life, and bereavement social work. Based on the experiences of funeral homes that employ social workers, this article argues that this innovation may bring new ideas to bridge some of the service gaps in after-death care in China and globally. This article outlines the support that will be needed from funeral homes, social work service agencies, and educational and research institutes to facilitate further development of funeral home mental health and social services and to promote the professionalization of funeral home social workers in China.","504":"Fatal work incidents result in an array of government responses, and in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, this may include the holding of coronial inquests. A common theme from the scant literature is that family members have a strong need to know how and why their loved one died. The inquisitorial nature of inquests suggests potential in uncovering this information, although little is known about families' experiences with these proceedings. Interviews with 40 bereaved relatives explored their views and experiences of inquests. Findings suggest that families, often frustrated with other investigative processes, want inquests to provide a better understanding of how and why the death occurred, uncover any failings\/responsibilities, and thereby move closer to a sense of justice being obtained for the deceased. Families identified problems perceived to impair the process and where improvements could be made to secure a more effective and meaningful institutional response to the fatality.","505":null,"506":"Bereaved parenting, a role that entails parenting surviving children after experiencing the death of a child, is a unique but understudied phenomenon within bereavement research. Not much is known about the impact of a child's death on this crucial familial role. An integrative review of literature of 20 studies across psychology, nursing, communications, social work, and family sciences was undertaken to determine the current state of science regarding bereaved parenting. Results revealed three influential contexts: the general context of parental grief and bereavement, described as traumatic and life-changing experiences; the personal context of the resulting parental changes and coping strategies; and the relational context of the subsequent parenting of surviving children, an experience characterized by periodic conflict between personal and children's needs, emotional fluctuations, challenges with levels of protectiveness and control, and a heightened sense of responsibility within the parental role. Discussion of results and implications for research are presented.","507":"This study explores experiences of pregnancy loss via a questionnaire completed by a convenience sample of 48 Australian cisgender heterosexual men. The questionnaire included measures of support following pregnancy loss, recognition of loss, perceived utility of help-seeking, perceived stigma attached to help-seeking, perinatal grief, and depression and anxiety. The questionnaire also included open-ended questions focused on help-seeking and support. Higher levels of grief were related to higher levels of both depression and anxiety. Perceptions about stigma were related to the perceived utility of help-seeking. While a majority of participants had accessed formal support services, feeling supported was unrelated to either grief or depression. Participants emphasized the utility of men's groups where members have experienced pregnancy loss, though barriers to support were also identified in terms of the unavailability of support or the perceived need to focus on a partner's loss.","508":null,"509":"This qualitative case study describes the dying process from a purely psychological perspective. The letters of Count Moltke, who was sentenced to death and executed during the Nazi regime, to his wife were analyzed content analytically. A work program of four self-imposed tasks emerged, namely first to avert the death sentence, second to prepare for the ideological and intellectual battle with the chairman of the court, third to support his wife in her anticipatory mourning, and fourth to achieve willingness for his dying by strangulation and for losing his life. Contrasting these findings with two cases of incurably ill men confirmed work and structure as the overarching way of coping. Religious coping is also of central importance. There was neither a linear trajectory nor a sequence of phases; rather, Moltke's dying process corresponds to a circular model. A consequence of the findings is outlined.","510":null,"511":"This study explored health-care workers' perception of patients' suicide intention and their understanding of factors leading to particular interpretations. Semistructured face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 health-care workers from a general hospital in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis. The health-care workers were found to have four types of perceptions: to end life, not to end life, ambivalence about intention, and an evolving understanding of intention. Factors leading to their perceptions of patients' suicide intention were patient demographics, health status, severity of ideation\/attempt, suicide method, history of treatment, moral character, communication of suicide intention, affective\/cognitive status, availability of social support, and health-care workers' limited knowledge of patients' condition\/situation. Insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes toward suicidal patients led to risk minimization and empathic failure, although most health-care workers used the correct parameters in determining suicide intention.","512":"The Strain Theory of Suicide and mental disorders proposes that psychological strains precede suicidal behaviors and psychiatric disorders. This study was designed to test the theory with a large sample of suicide notes collected from Tasmania, Australia. The content of 261 suicide notes was analyzed for the presence of four psychological strains. It was found that 39.6% of the 261 suicide notes had at least one of the four psychological strains, with aspiration and coping strains being the most prevalent. We then compared the ratings of psychological strains with ratings of thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness and found that the presence of aspiration strain and coping strain was associated with thwarted belonging, while aspiration and deprivation strains were associated with perceived burdensomeness.","513":null,"514":"Ecuador, located in South America, has a population of 16 million people. According to the National Institution of Statistics in Ecuador, every year 8 out of a 1000 individuals die due to various causes. Palliative care and hospice are relatively new concepts for the Ecuadorian society. In Ecuador people usually die at home, in hospitals, or in nursing homes. In 2012, the first Ecuadorian hospice was created. According to symbolic interactionism theory, research needs to study participants' world in order to understand the dynamic nature of human behavior. Symbolic interactionism proposes that human beings cannot be understood without the context of their interactions. Through an ethnomethodological approach, the following research aims to understand the way that individuals understand and describe death while in the local hospice in Ecuador. Results emerge from the introspection of real stories, field notes, participant observation, and informal conversations at the hospice. Based on a thematic analysis, the following study presents major themes that emphasize the dynamic process of creating meaning of death.","515":"Death, grief, and loss are common experiences for many individuals who identify as American Indian\/Alaska Native, yet decidedly little is known about the lived experience of grieving in this population. To address this gap in the literature, researchers conducted a qualitative descriptive study exploring ways of grieving among 20 elders residing on a North American Ojibwe reservation. Findings derived via thematic analysis illustrate the variety of ways these elders respond to death: living through it, responding in Western or non-Traditional ways, drawing comfort from spirituality, and grieving as a community. Implications for culturally appropriate grief support for AI individuals and communities are provided.","516":"How anxious are you about dying? According to Tomer and Eliason, this depends on various personal circumstances, which they identified in their model on death anxiety. This study aims to verify various aspects of Tomer and Eliason's theoretical model. We therefore collected data from 652 German participants about demographic variables, religiosity, life satisfaction, death acceptance, and death anxiety. We then conducted a path analysis in order to verify whether the empirical data supported the theoretical model. Our results demonstrate a very good model fit, indicating that the analyzed model is valid and can be maintained. Further mediation analysis demonstrates the specific relations of variables within the model and their influence on death anxiety.","517":"Despite calls for cross-cultural research, Minority world perspectives still dominate death and bereavement studies, emphasizing individualized emotions and neglecting contextual diversities. In research concerned with contemporary African societies, on the other hand, death and loss are generally subsumed within concerns about AIDS or poverty, with little attention paid to the emotional and personal significance of a death. Here, we draw on interactionist sociology to present major themes from a qualitative study of family deaths in urban Senegal, theoretically framed through the duality of meanings-in-context. Such themes included family and community as support and motivation; religious beliefs and practices as frameworks for solace and (regulatory) meaning; and material circumstances as these are intrinsically bound up with emotions. Although we identify the experience of (embodied, emotional) pain as a common response across Minority and Majority worlds, we also explore significant divergencies, varying according to localized contexts and broader power dynamics.","518":"South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and the most alarming suicide rate is among its elders. This study aims to understand the social, historical, and cultural context of the Korean older adults and examine suicide trends based on that understanding. The results show that the suicide risk increases with age, the male suicide rate outweighs that of females, and the suicide rate decreases with educational attainment. In addition, several suggestions for reducing elderly suicide rate are addressed, including differentiating the existing social services for elders by age and expanding suicide prevention programs beyond schools to communities so that all people in need can access them.","519":null,"520":"The article analyses how potentially conflicting frames of grief and family operate in a number of English funerals. The data come from the 2010 Mass-Observation directive \"Going to Funerals\" which asked its panel of correspondents to write about the most recent funeral they had attended. In their writings, grief is displayed through conventional understandings of family. Drawing on Randall Collins, we show how the funeral stratifies mourners into family or nonfamily, a stratification accomplished-by family and nonfamily-through both outward display and inner feeling. The funerals described were more about a very traditional notion of family than about grief; family trumped grief, or at least provided the frame through which grief could be written about; and perceptions of \"family\" prompted emotions which in turn defined family. The funerals were portrayed as a distinct arena privileging family over the fluid and varied personal attachments highlighted in both the new sociology of personal life and in the concept of disenfranchised grief.","521":null,"522":"The centrality of a loss to a bereaved individual's identity is associated with greater symptomatology, whereas meaning made of a loss is associated with positive outcomes. This article examines meaning made as a moderator of the relationship between event centrality and symptomatology. Our sample consisted of 204 bereaved undergraduate university students. Centrality was assessed using the Centrality of Events Scale, meaning made was assessed using the Integration of Stressful Life Experiences Scale, and symptomatology was assessed using the posttraumatic stress disorder Checklist-Civilian and Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised. Meaning made had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between centrality and both measures of symptomatology. At lower levels of meaning made, centrality had a strong and positive association with symptomatology; at higher levels of meaning made, this association became weaker. These results suggest that meaning made is the key to understanding how centrality affects bereavement outcomes.","523":"Research indicates that people maintain a connection with deceased loved ones, which can be healthy for the bereaved individuals. To maintain these bonds, people readily admit to communicating with the deceased. Although communication with the deceased shares similarities with traditional models of interpersonal communication, it is distinctly different. Interviews with 20 individuals revealed support for a model of transcorporeal communication, communication to people who do not maintain a physical presence. This communication includes the components of sender, inner representation of the deceased as receiver, message, feedback based on what the sender believes the deceased would say, and a metaphysical element. Implications of transcorporeal communication for griefwork are also discussed.","524":"This study explores how Danish students experience returning to school following parental bereavement. Eighteen focus group interviews with 39 participants aged 9 to 17 years were conducted. All participants had experienced the loss of a primary caregiver. Data collection was divided into two phases. In Phase I, 22 participants from four grief groups were interviewed 4 times over the course of a year. During Phase II, confirmatory focus groups were undertaken with the 17 participants. This article explores findings related to the four themes of initial school response, long-term support, challenges within the class, and academic challenges. The study found that (a) students struggle to reconnect with classmates following the return to school and often feel alone, (b) schools fail to have guidelines in place for what they are allowed to do if becoming sad the class, and (c) schools seem to forget their loss as time passes.","525":"The aim of this study is to provide comprehensive and current information on hospital practices following perinatal death. The provinces with the highest number of hospitals in Turkey were selected for the study. To collect data, the questionnaire form of Canadian hospitals maternity policies and practices survey was sent to the appropriate respondents in hospitals. The study showed that encouraging parents to have photos of the deceased baby and preparing a remembrance pack were the most problematic issues and were not available at the majority of hospitals. The most common supportive practices in hospitals were the opportunity to see the deceased baby, assisting with funeral options and autopsies, and support for completing the necessary legal documents. The result indicated that hospitals implement varied practices in assisting the bereaved parents. The study recommended developing hospital policies and practices related to perinatal death and supporting families during their loss and grief.","526":"Traditional models of palliative care are largely inaccessible to homeless persons, and their preferences regarding end-of-life care are poorly understood. The purpose of the present scoping review is to summarize the burgeoning gray and academic literature on end-of-life care for homeless persons. Five medical databases, seven social science databases, and four gray literature databases were searched, resulting in 57 relevant titles. Six themes emerged: (a) Characteristics of homeless persons who require end-of-life care; (b) preferences and concerns of homeless persons approaching the end of life; (c) the role of spirituality for homeless persons at the end of life; (d) barriers to care at the patient, provider, and institutional or structural levels; (e) inclusive models of palliative care; and (f) implications for policy and practice. Practitioners and homeless persons must negotiate many obstacles in the provision and receipt of palliative care. However, there is tremendous potential and opportunity to improve the quality of life at the end of life for this vulnerable population.","527":"This article investigates the emergence of a growing demand in the Netherlands: the wish of organ donor families and organ recipients to establish contact. Such direct contact transgresses both the anonymity and privacy long considered by many to be fundamental to organ donation. Legislation prescribes that privacy should be safeguarded, but the parties involved increasingly manage to find each other. Research is needed to provide insight into the ramifications of direct contact, which may inform mourning counseling and psychosocial support. Drawing on qualitative interviews with donor's relatives, we analyze the reasons for the desire to have direct contact. We seek to understand how meanings are constructed and contested through organs at the margins of life and death in the individualized and secularized society of the Netherlands. We find that relatives struggle with persistent restless feelings after postmortem organ donation and may develop a level of personal attachment and assign inalienability to human body parts.","528":"Prior research has found high levels of distress in parents who experience the death of a child; however, Romanian parents, whose experiences are influenced by the nation's shared historical trauma, have not been studied. This mixed-methods study found very high levels of distress in a sample of 237 bereaved parents in Romania, primarily women. Specifically, 89% of respondents scored above the clinical cutoff for trauma responses, 66% did so for anxious responses, and 82% did so for depressive responses. Qualitative analyses of respondents' narratives suggest that, through complex interactions between political, social, and medical systems, the lack of care after the death of a child seems to incite additional distress in parents. These findings warrant further exploration of traumatic grief in Romania, especially in the context of historical and political trauma, and of ways in which support can be provided to grieving parents in this unique cultural milieu.","529":"This article examines the function of music during contemporary funerals in the Netherlands. Using a performance-based approach, this article shows that music adds to the ritual dimension of contemporary funerals, by relating the music to the funeral itself, the deceased person's identity, and to emotions. Zooming in on the music that in contemporary personalized funerals is selected because it is-one way or another-related to the deceased, it will be shown that the lyrical content of this music is less important than social and emotional aspects. Theoretically, the concept of the musical eulogy is introduced as a hermeneutic tool to examine music in ritualized contexts.","530":"While relieving suffering is palliative care's primary aim, how palliative care providers navigate patients' nonphysical suffering in their day-to-day work and the impact of working with nonphysical suffering on the clinician have been understudied. This exploratory study aims to begin to fill this gap in the literature. Results revealed that palliative care clinicians face several challenges in their efforts to navigate patients' nonphysical suffering in their day-to-day work, including (a) the intangible nature of nonphysical suffering, (b) systemic barriers (e.g., lack of time and adequate resources), (c) clinician helplessness or suffering, and (d) a lack of education, training, and support for clinicians specific to their work with patients' nonphysical suffering. Study outcomes have the potential to improve frontline clinical care with patients and support and education for clinicians.","531":"Research has abundantly demonstrated a strong relationship between culture, religion, and the experiences of death, dying, and bereavement. Consequently, cultural competence and a religiously sensitive practice have become highly relevant to social policies and professional practice. However, our current knowledge of culturally competent and religiously sensitive end-of-life care is primarily context specific, with little space for generalizability. This article reports on findings from a qualitative comparative analysis of two nation-specific studies that examined religious literacy and cultural competency, respectively, among palliative-care professionals, drawing on similarities and attempting to identify further applicability of nation-centered knowledge. The study recognized six practice-based approaches in palliative and hospice care, when responding to cultural and religious or nonreligious identities of services users. These approaches intersect with each other via three organizational layers identified in the study: foundations, culture, and professionals. Each identified practice-based approach seems to be incomplete when working with individuals for whom religion, belief, and cultural identities are important. Change in practice is possible if all three organizational layers are considered simultaneously, while further research will shed more light about the benefits and challenges of each approach.","532":"Communication willingness has previously been identified as an important communication factor in influencing individuals' decisions to become an organ donor. Missing from this conversation is the role of communication apprehension about death and its impact on donation decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between communication apprehension about death, religiosity, religious affiliation, and donation decisions. Three hundred and thirty-three individuals participated in an online survey. Findings suggest that communication apprehension about death, especially communication avoidance about death, negatively impact donation decisions. In addition, religiosity and affiliation with a specific religion also negatively impact donation decisions. These variables were also predictors of organ and body donation. The findings show a need for more research on what prevents conversations about donation. In addition, the stark difference between organ donation likelihood and body donation likelihood underscores the need for communication scholars to examine communication about body donation.","533":"To comprehend grief, we need knowledge about the range of diverse reactions incorporated within it. While scientists have documented the phenomena and manifestations following the loss of a loved one in quite some detail, poets can add to our understanding by portraying these vividly, bringing the feelings to life. In this article, I map the array of grief reactions identified in scientific investigations. I then go on to give short, selective illustrations from poetry, ones that have enhanced my own understanding of grief. These choices are naturally influenced by my own preferences; I include those that I find personally appealing and evocative of the multifaceted manifestations of grief. My aim is to demonstrate the value of artistic representation for scientific comprehension.","534":"Large and increasing numbers of inmates with chronic and terminal illnesses are serving time, and dying, in U.S. prisons. The restriction of men and women to die in prisons has many ethical and fiscal concerns, as it deprives incarcerated persons of their autonomy and requires comprehensive and costly health-care services. To ameliorate these concerns, compassionate release policies, which allow inmates the ability to die in their own communities, have been adopted in federal and state prison systems. However, little is known about the content of compassionate release policies within U.S. states' department of corrections, despite recent calls to release incarcerated persons who meet eligibility criteria into the community. The current study provides an overview of compassionate release policies in the United States, which vary widely across the compassionate release process. Specific policy recommendations are made to assure the timely access and utilization of compassionate release among eligible incarcerated individuals.","535":"Presentation of epidemiological information about the absolute number of suicides has been used occasionally to increase awareness of the suicide phenomenon. This study investigated the effectiveness of absolute quantitative messages versus relative messages. An example of relative messages would be comparing the number of suicide deaths with the number of deaths by car accidents. Participants were randomly presented with absolute or relative messages regarding suicide. They were then requested to indicate the degree of severity they attributed to the suicide phenomenon, being the level to which they view the phenomenon as sufficiently important to mandate national intervention and resource allocation. Relative messages proved more effective than absolute ones in yielding greater perceived severity of suicide. Increasing public and policymakers' awareness of the suicide phenomenon could be aided by presenting information in relative terms.","536":"The main question addressed in this exploratory study was the following: What is the content of college females' journals about their deceased grandfathers? The method involved 35 undergraduate females keeping journals about their feelings toward their deceased maternal or paternal grandfathers for one semester. Their journal entries were open-ended in order to explore an under-utilized qualitative and narrative-based approach to studying granddaughter-grandfather relationships, from the granddaughters' perspectives. The results demonstrated that the maternal grandfathers were the most frequently written about. In addition, the journals revealed differences in content depending on how old the granddaughters were when their grandfathers died, and various forms of sadness were expressed in over 50% of the entries. It was concluded that additional developmental research is needed on the impact of having deceased grandfathers on granddaughters' and grandsons' memories and emotions.","537":"The present study examines how different chronic illnesses and mental illness comorbidity (chronic illness with complexity [CIC]) associate with components of advance care planning (ACP). We also explore the role self-perceived burden plays in the relationship between illness and ACP. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 305 elderly participants from the New Jersey End-of-Life study. Participants with diabetes and those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are less likely, while participants with CIC are more likely, to plan for the end-of-life. Participants with diabetes are less likely to make formal plans, whereas those with CVD are less likely to hold informal discussions. CIC is associated with increased odds of having an advance directive, but no other form of ACP. Self-perceived burden did not appear to be the gateway by which illness groups differentially engaged in ACP. Future research should investigate what aspects of illnesses drive ACP.","538":"This article examines the cultural sources of underreported suicide deaths in South Korea. It analyzes two sets of suicide data compiled by two different government agencies. Noting the considerable undercounting of suicide deaths compiled by the National Statistical Office, it explores how the underreporting is linked to the Confucian norm of familism. Despite an effort to improve the quality of official suicide data, a reform in the death system is needed in order to gather accurate data for a better understanding of the increased suicides as well as for the development of more effective suicide prevention and intervention strategies.","539":"This brief report used the mortality data to separately examine suicide rates of the six largest Asian American groups: Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. In 2000, Japanese American men (13.8 per 100,000) showed significantly higher suicide rate than Chinese, Indian, and Vietnamese American men (7.3, 4.0, and 6.1 per 100,000), whereas Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women (3.7, 3.9, and 4.3 per 100,000) showed higher suicide rates than Indian women (1.2 per 100,000). In 2010, Korean and Japanese American men (19.9 and 15.7 per 100,000) showed higher suicide rates than men of other Asian groups. Korean and Japanese American women (8.1 and 5.0 per 100,000) showed higher suicide rates than Indian and Filipino American women (1.5 and 1.8 per 100,000). The findings challenge the notion that Asian Americans are at low risk for suicide and underscore the importance of examining ethnic variation in suicide behaviors among Asian Americans.","540":null,"541":"This study aims to find out the time perception used in the denials in the last statements of 70 death row inmates, who were executed in Texas Huntsville Unit between 1982 and 2016. To accomplish this, the tenses in their last statements were specified, and their distribution was demonstrated on a horizontal timeline. Document analysis, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was utilized as the data collection tool of the study. The main data obtained from the results of the study suggest that the following 429 death row inmates out of 537 used their right for the last statement; however, 108 of them did not state anything. A total of 70 of the 429 death row inmates denied the crimes, of which they were convicted with execution, in their last statements. When the age range is taken into consideration, it is clear that the distribution of simple tenses and the distribution of compound tenses are very close to each other. The simple tense is used the least by the 60 to 70 age-group, whereas it is mostly used by 20 to 30 age-group. Considering their education level in addition to their age range, it is observed that the highest education level is that of the 60 to 70 age-group. The most frequently used tense in the last statements of death row inmates is simple tense; however, simple present tense is used as the most common tense overall. As the timeline progresses toward the future, expectations and affirmation exist in the meaning of the sentences.","542":"Thirty-nine hospice palliative care volunteers completed a survey examining (a) their beliefs about end-of-life phenomena (EOLP), (b) the impact of EOLP on their lives, and (c) their perceived needs for training to respond to them. Forty-nine percent of the volunteers either had personally witnessed an EOLP in their volunteer work and\/or had a patient or patient's family member report an EOLP to them. More than half of the volunteers strongly agreed or agreed that EOLP have influenced their religious beliefs and their spirituality in a positive way (53% and 59%, respectively). Eighty-nine percent of the volunteers indicated that they had never received any training about EOLP, and nearly all of the volunteers were interested in learning more about EOLP. After completing the survey, 59% of the volunteers shared stories about EOLP they had either personally witnessed or been told about. The most frequently reported experiences involved deathbed visions. The implications of these findings are discussed.","543":"The Oregon \"Death With Dignity\" Act (DWD Act) allows a terminally ill patient with 6 months to live to ask a physician for medication to end their life. To receive the medication, the DWD Act requires the patient to verbally request the prescription twice 2 weeks apart as well as in writing. Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have three main barriers to using DWD: (a) the ability to communicate their informed consent as the disease progresses further, (b) the possibility of dementia which may affect their decisional capacity, and (c) given the nature and speed of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, limited time is available for patients to self-administer the prescription and may rush the time line for the death. This article reviews the current knowledge and addresses the need for adjustments to existing law and recommendations for states considering a DWD law.","544":"Despite the high prevalence of suicide among people with disabilities, little research has explored suicide in the context of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system. We analyzed the responses of 27 VR counselors who responded to an open-ended qualitative prompt regarding their experiences with suicide training and competency. Key themes included a desire for more training on suicide and the experience of seeking and receiving suicide training and experience outside of VR. Responses also underscored the heavy emotional impact of working with suicidal clients, especially when one feels unprepared to do so. These results suggest that it is important to provide VR counselors with resources and training for addressing suicide in their client populations.","545":"This study aimed to compare the mental disorders, psychological factors, and suicidal intent between high- and low-impulsivity Chinese rural young suicides. Rural young women and men aged 15 to 34 years who died by suicide and various risk factors were examined. The data were obtained using psychological autopsy method with instruments as Dysfunctional Impulsivity Scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, Beck Hopeless Scale, Social Support Index, Coping Response Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Beck Suicide Intent Scale. Compared with low-impulsivity suicides, the high-impulsivity suicides were younger, had less mental disorders, owned less social support, scored lower on approach coping and higher on avoidance coping, and scored a lower score on the Suicide Intent Scale. Characteristics of high-impulsivity suicides differed significantly from low-impulsivity suicides in rural China. It was important to develop different prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the suicide rate in China.","546":"A convenience sample of 209 participants completed the Grief Pattern Inventory (GPI) together with the Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist (HGRC), the Integration of Stressful Life Events Scale (ISLES), and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Alpha coefficients of the GPI's intuitive and instrumental subscales were improved by eliminating low-performing items and empirically reassigning items from the GPI dissonant subscale. The two modified scales showed a near zero intercorrelation indicating they were independent constructs in this sample, a conclusion further verified by factor analysis. Both styles correlated with distress measures from the HGRC and correlated negatively with adaptation indicators from the ISLES, though the findings were stronger for intuitive grievers. MBTI findings revealed that intuitive grievers endorsed significantly more \"feeling\" in how processing occurs while grievers who preferred sensing\/thinking functions more often identified with the instrumental grief pattern. Implications of these findings for scholars and clinicians are discussed.","547":"Community health care should facilitate effective adaptation to widowhood. In South Africa, the primary health-care nurses, who are the first-line health-care services, seem to miss opportunities for identifying and effectively managing widows experiencing health risks. This study explored the health-support needs of widows. We purposively selected 12 participants, who were widows between 25 and 65 years old residing in an urban area of South Africa. Data were gathered during unstructured individual phenomenological interviews and analyzed using a descriptive phenomenological method. Widowhood is an embodied and intense emotional experience with a cognitive impact. Related to these experiences are widows' health-support needs. Widows have a need to be listened to and to be understood and cared for; attitudes and skills which require time and availability from primary health-care nurses. Widows expressed a need to engage in support groups, receive home visits, and receive health education from primary health-care nurses.","548":"This study explores self-esteem in suicide among young males with no earlier history of suicide attempt(s) or treatment in mental health services. The data come from an ongoing psychological autopsy study; 10 cases of young men aged 18 to 30, were selected to generate a phenomenologically based understanding of the psychological mechanisms and processes involved in the suicidal process. The analyses are based on in-depth interviews with 61 closely connected individuals, as well as suicide notes. We used Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. For these young men, the transition to young adulthood, a period of major life challenges, seemed to be associated with personal defeats. According to their significant others, the deceased seemed to have experienced intolerable discrepancies between their actual performances and their ideal self standards. Four themes emerged from the analysis: (a) striving to find a viable path to life as an adult man; (b) experiencing a sense of failure according to own standards; (c) emotional self-restriction in relationships; and (d) strong feelings of loneliness and rejection of self. Improved understanding of suicides outside the mental illness paradigm may have important implications for preventive strategies.","549":"This article presents an action research study that explores how a fifth-grade classroom of 10- to 11-year-old children in Cyprus perceive the concepts of grief and grieving, after an educational intervention provided space for discussing such issues. It also explores the impact that the intervention program had on children's emotions while exploring these concepts and illustrates how it affected their behavior. The findings suggest that the intervention had a constructive impact on children's understandings of grief and grieving along two important dimensions. First, the intervention helped children better define emotional responses to loss (grief). Second, children seemed to overcome their anxiety while talking about grief and grieving and were able to share relevant personal experiences. The study has important implications for curriculum development, pedagogical practice, and teacher training on death education.","550":"According to some specialists, ceremonial funeral practices are inclined to disappear, particularly as death is an object of repression in contemporary society. However, it seems that new forms of rituals are developing through modern technologies. Virtual tombs, memorial webpages, and the celebration of death anniversaries are now common currency on the Internet. Nonetheless, the overexposure favored by the Web seems to question traditional ways of \"living out\" one's grief, subjecting the living and the dead to a redefinition of concepts of time and space, and entailing new forms of interaction.","551":"In 2009, Lawrence Kutner, a character on television's House, M.D., unexpectedly committed suicide. A Facebook memorial group was created shortly thereafter in memory of the fictional character. A thematic analysis of fan postings on Kutner's Facebook memorial page revealed evidence of people experiencing parasocial grief as they displayed emotional expressions of grief, reminisced, and advocated for Kutner. Through thematic analysis, we discovered that elements of parasocial relationships, particularly parasocial breakups, were apparent as the members posted evidence of their grief over the loss of a television character. Moreover, this parasocial grief is likely to be disenfranchised, as the death of a television character is typically not recognized by others as a legitimate loss. This study also highlighted the role of social media as an outlet for grief as well as revealed confusion between fiction and reality resulting from social media.","552":"Despite the high rate of infant mortality in Ghana, few studies have explored the maternal experience of infant loss and the perinatal grieving process. As part of a larger study that interviewed 153 mothers with a sick infant, this 1-year follow-up study reinterviewed eight mothers from the original cohort whose infant died since the study began. Mothers were queried about mental health, coping, and cultural issues related to the loss. Mothers were often discouraged from speaking or thinking about the death due to fear of psychological harm and impact on fertility. Primary coping mechanisms involved seeking support within the community and accepting the loss as God's will. Mothers desired more communication from health-care providers at the time of death. Despite the cultural norm of silent acceptance in the face of perinatal loss, intense maternal grief and desire to mourn may allow more opportunities for health-care workers to support bereaved mothers.","553":"Grieving is manifested differently around the world depending on culture, social desirability, and social norms. Little is known about grieving patterns in Africa. As such, a study of the grieving patterns of young widows of the Banso tribe of the Cameroon was conducted. This examination used Doka and Martin's model of grieving styles as the lens for this research. This model delineates a continuum of grief styles: instrumental on one end, intuitive on the other, and blended in the middle. This study used the validated Grief Pattern Inventory to determine if young Banso widows in this sample are intuitive, instrumental, or blended grievers. The study employed a cross-sectional design. The results indicated that 47% of the participants were intuitive grievers and 41% were blended grievers. Policy, research, and clinical implications emerging from the results were presented.","554":null,"555":"The aim of this study was to provide empirical descriptions of responses to the death of a sibling to the sinking of the Sewol ferry in South Korea. 16 bereaved parents are interviewed regarding their surviving children's grief responses at approximately 2 years after the death. The surviving siblings described by the bereaved parents are 14 in total, including 8 teens in their 10s and 4 young adults in their 20s. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis method. The following themes emerged: (a) negative behavioral changes, (b) expressions of grief, (c) change in relationship with parents, (d) school adjustment problems, and (e) social changes. Unique aspects of the grief responses among the surviving siblings in this study are noted. Discussions and implications are provided based on the results.","556":"Completing an advance directive offers individuals the opportunity to make informed choices about end-of-life care. However, these decisions could be influenced in different ways depending on how the information is presented. We randomly presented 185 participants with four distinct types of advance directive: neutrally framed (as reference), negatively framed, religiously framed, and a combination. Participants were asked which interventions they would like to receive at the end of life. Between 60% and 70% of participants responded \"accept the special interventions\" on the reference form. However, the majority (70%-90%) chose \"refuse the interventions\" on the negative form. With respect to the religious form, 70% to 80% chose \"not decided yet.\" Participants who refused special life-sustaining treatments were older, female, and with better prior knowledge about advance directives. Our findings imply that the specific content of advance directives could affect decision-making with regard to various interventions for end-of-life care.","557":"During the 19th century, suicide rates increased in many countries. The press may have contributed to this increase, even though empirical evidence is lacking in this regard. We assessed suicide statistics within five territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1871 and 1910 and combined these data with a content analysis of suicide reporting in five newspapers, each appearing in one of the five territories. The analysis revealed a covariation between the quantity of reporting and the number of suicides within all five regions. Furthermore, the quantity of reporting significantly predicted the following year's suicides. Although the causal order of suicides and the quantity of reporting should be assessed with caution, evidence is consistent with the idea that the press may have contributed to the establishment of suicide as a mass phenomenon. The findings also support contemporary guidelines for journalists, especially the notion of avoiding undue repetition of suicide stories.","558":"This study examined clergy's use of 15 suicide prevention competencies. Four hundred ninety-eight U.S. Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant clergy responded to an online survey regarding their use of these competencies. Analysis of variance, backward stepwise regression, and principal components analysis were used to determine clergy group differences, predictors of use of competencies, and a parsimonious summary of competencies. Some respondents reported infrequent opportunities to develop these competencies. Respondents reported using general pastoral competencies more than suicide-specific competencies. Protestant clergy reported that their congregants watch over each other significantly more than Jewish clergy. Catholic and Jewish clergy reported significantly more competence in conducting suicide funerals than Protestant clergy. Contacts by suicidal people and number of hours of suicide-specific training predicted the use of more competencies. Competency components included postvention following a suicide, nonjudgmental attitudes, talking with a suicidal person, and pastoral care. Findings suggest that clergy may benefit from consultation and suicide-specific training.","559":null,"560":"A major gap in the extant research literature on suicide in Ghana is lack of a systematic study of patterns and trends in elderly suicides. To address the lack of scholarship on the topic, this exploratory, descriptive study presents the results of an epidemiological analysis of 40 media-reported suicides involving persons aged 60 years and older during the 2005-2016 period. Key findings are that the vast bulk of elderly persons who died by suicide were male, aged 60 to 65 years old, and of low income. The most common suicide methods were hanging and shooting with a firearm. Reasons for dying by suicide included lack of financial wherewithal, indebtedness, cuckoldry, sexual dysfunction, grief after the death of a spouse, and marital breakdown. A secondary aim of the research was to sensitize the Ghanaian public, medical services, and government about the extent, nature, and patterns of suicidal behavior in the elderly population. At present, many people in Ghana are not aware of elderly suicides as a social problem. For stakeholders, the findings of this study can assist in the design and implementation of policies and programs to alleviate the problem.","561":null,"562":"The collaborative assessment and management of suicidality (CAMS) serves as a framework for maintaining a collaborative relationship between the therapist and patient. This study used an original coding manual to examine responses to open-ended questions to better understand the ways in which therapists use CAMS collaboratively as well as their reasons for adhering (or not adhering) to certain aspects of the framework. Results suggest differences in treatment application based on therapist characteristics including amount of experience, intensity of training received, and experience of a patient suicide attempt. Implications of this research include informing therapists interested in using the CAMS framework about the specific ways in which implementation can be made collaborative. Further, this research helps to shed light on how experiencing a client's death by suicide can impact therapists' future work with suicidal clients.","563":"This article will employ a database from a large hospice provider with offices in 16 states to examine the impact of religious preference on hospice choice. Little work has been done on this issue, even though religion is the only social institution that specifically addresses the end of life. Hospice work, in particular, has drawn little attention despite it effecting millions of patients and their families. Of all the medical subspecialties, hospice is one of the most effected by society's views on death and religious views of dying. It is also the only government-funded medical service that requires religious support be made available to patients. Our hypothesis is that certain religious groups have a predisposition against end-of-life interventions and will be less likely to utilize hospice. This impacts a multibillion dollar a year industry that supplies hospice service to millions of patients, and our research points to one major religious group not accessing their hospice benefit at the same rate as other denominations.","564":"","565":"This article explores the public dying of journalist, writer, provocateur, public intellectual, and renowned atheist, Christopher Hitchens. It does so primarily through an analysis of television interviews given by Hitchens following his diagnosis with esophageal cancer in June 2010. Four key themes are identified as emerging from analysis of the interviews: (a) Hitchens' explicit sense of mission in challenging myths and superstitions surrounding cancer, dying, and death; (b) the personal experience of terminal illness and dying and the particular way (or style of dying) by which it is approached; (c) issues of regret and a life well lived; and (d) questions surrounding religion, the afterlife, and possibility of deathbed conversion. In light of the claim that ours is a culture in search of an ars moriendi, the article examines what we can learn from Hitchens' auto\/pathographic interviews (and writings) and the extent to which this rational-humanist, atheistic, and stoical style of dying provides a useable \"template\" for others nearing the end of life.","566":"The aim of this research was to determine the relation between death attitude and distress tolerance and aggression and anger. For this, 135 subjects among 7,535 professional and specialist members of the Iran National Library were selected using convenience sampling method. They replied to Death Attitudes Profile-Revised, distress tolerance questionnaire, and aggression questionnaire. The results showed that the attitudes of approach acceptance, neutral acceptance, and escape acceptance had positive relation to distress tolerance and negative relation to aggression and anger while the attitudes of fear of death and death avoidance had negative relation to distress tolerance and positive relation to aggression and anger. Furthermore, all death attitudes predicted distress tolerance. But only the attitudes of approach acceptance, escape acceptance, fear of death, and death avoidance predicted aggression, and only approach acceptance, neutral acceptance, fear of death, and death avoidance predicted anger.","567":"The literature lacks a consistent pattern on the relationship between attitudes toward death and dying across occupations and recreational pursuits. The present cross-sectional study categorized a group of individuals engaging in a high-risk recreational activity (i.e., skydivers) on the basis of experience and classified them into student, intermediate, and experts. There were more negative attitudes of death and dying among student skydivers compared with more experienced skydivers. It was also found that expert skydivers had more negative attitudes toward death and dying on some of the measures compared with the intermediate level experienced skydivers. It may be the case that factors such as perceived personal control, overconfidence, and metacognition may be related to these observed differences between the two more experienced groups of skydivers. The possibility of the factors playing a role in skydivers' attitudes toward death and dying should be taken into consideration in the training programs for skydiving.","568":"We examined the contribution of disability status to suicidality when accounting for depression and sociodemographic risk factors in 438 American adults, 82 (18.7%) of whom identified as having disabilities. Participants with disabilities had significantly higher depression scores and were more likely to be unemployed and unpartnered, all of which were also associated with increased suicidality. However, disability remained a significant predictor of suicidality even when depression and sociodemographic risk factors were accounted for in a linear regression. Other significant predictors of suicidality in this regression were female gender, depression symptoms, and family and friend suicide history; identifying as a member of a religion was a significant protective factor against suicidality. Our findings suggest that the contribution of disability to suicidality goes beyond that which can be explained by increased depression symptoms and sociodemographic vulnerability.","569":"This study examined Swedish suicide bereaved individuals' use of different resources in their grief work and how they value these resources. The material consisted of a web-based survey, which was analyzed with quantitative methods. The results showed that the psychosocial ill-health was severe among the suicide bereaved participants and that a majority used digital resources in their grief work. The propensity to engage in online support groups or memorial websites was not predicted by the severity of psychosocial consequences following the suicide. However, multiple regressions showed that higher online support group activity predicted more satisfaction with current psychosocial health, while memorial websites seemed to have the opposite effect. This study not only indicates that some digital resources, for example, online support groups, may be an effective way of coping with grief related to suicide loss, but also suggests that memorial websites may increase rumination and in this way cause emotional distress.","570":"A Massive Open Online Course, Dying2Learn, was designed to foster community death conversations and strengthen community awareness of palliative care and death as a normal process. This exploratory study used a pre-post prospective design to determine if participation in Dying2Learn and exposure to online conversations about death and dying resulted in any significant influence on death competence in 134 participants who completed the Coping-with-Death-Scale both at the beginning and end of the course in 2016. Death competence refers to a range of attitudes and capabilities people have for dealing with death. Results at the end of the course indicated that engagement in Dying2Learn led to significant improvements in death competence scores over time (medium-to-large effect size). The positive impact was greater for those who completed more of the course, and effectiveness did not depend on sociodemographic characteristics. In conclusion, this study found that an online learning platform in the form of a Massive Open Online Course could engage community members in meaningful social discussion about death and dying, and that exposure to these conversations was beneficial for all participants regardless of previous exposure to death. Further exploration is required to determine whether this change in death competence will have an impact on participant's behavior in the community regarding death conversations and preparedness.","571":"This study explored bereaved mothers' responses to the death of a child from cancer, with a focus on identifying adaptive and complicated grief reactions. To understand the unique meaning of their loss, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 mothers at two time points. Interpretative phenomenological analysis-guided by meaning-making theories of loss-revealed five master categories: the perceptions of the child's life with cancer and death from the disease, changed self-identity, coping style, developing an ongoing relationship to the deceased child, and the postdeath social environment. Each of these master categories and associated subthemes provided insights into the characteristics of the bereaved mothers' adaptive and complicated grief responses to their loss. Given all the mothers evidenced multiple forms or types of these responses over time, they could not be categorized as adaptive or complicated grievers. However, the varying proportions of each of these responses highlighted differences in overall bereavement adaptation.","572":"This article describes a novel application of Skills for Psychological Recovery (SPR)-a brief, early intervention developed by the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network-for families grieving the violent death of a loved one. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, SPR incorporates cognitive-behavioral skills-building modules to help survivors cope with trauma-related distress and posttrauma resource loss. The authors describe the intervention and illustrate the use of SPR for violent loss by presenting data from two cases involving a suicide survivor and a homicide survivor. Implications for future research are discussed.","573":"This qualitative group case study was ascertained to conceptualize theory on the topic of grief and emerging adulthood. A literature review proved no research to this specific experience. The aim of this study was to understand the suicide grief experience in this developmental stage. Based on the exploration of 150 suicide-bereaved emerging adults, participants in the Catholic Charities Young Adult Support Group expressed common themes related to the their unique grief experiences. Criterion sampling was used, as all these individuals voluntarily attended this group after losing a loved one to suicide. The methodology was observation and recording of oral data, and participants were asked to provide quarterly program evaluations. The analysis of data was recorded based on observed themes of statements made by participants. The conceptualized grief experiences that underpin this stage of development appear to work in opposition with grief tasks. This population would benefit from further research.","574":"All mental health professionals will inevitably serve clients who face the expected death of a loved one. Prominent theories on the grieving process tend to begin after a death or other loss has occurred. Many individuals experience anticipatory grief prior to the physical death. Participants in this study consisted of 120 adults who were anticipating the death of a loved one due to terminal illness. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the relationship between the positive disposition of proactive coping and two forms of growth. Both personal and posttraumatic growth were present to a significant degree, and proactive coping illustrated unique predictive power in personal growth. Social support was a significant mediator of proactive coping and growth and was determined to be an outcome of the assertive nature of this disposition. Implications for helping professionals who serve anticipatory grievers as well as directions for future research are discussed.","575":"Recent data on the inequities in mortality, health, and access to health services experienced by the Traveller community in Ireland show higher rates of death by suicide and other sudden causes among members of this marginalized minority group than in the general population. Psychological literature on bereavement suggests that traumatic deaths and multiple deaths within a close network may be more likely to lead to complicated grief reactions. The aim of this study is to add to our understanding of the effects of the differential mortality rate by exploring how grief is experienced within the Traveller community in the context of bereavement from multiple deaths or sudden deaths (including suicide). Data from three semistructured focus group interviews with a total of 10 Traveller Community Health Worker participants (nine female and one male) were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Two master themes organized the salient phenomenological aspects of the grief experience: Living with Tragic Loss and Communicating Tragic Loss. A picture emerged of individual and community-level loss that is extensive, profound, and enduring. The sequelae of deaths by suicide include difficulties in coping, a search for meaning, and a pervasive sense of fear. Silence, the embodied act of giving voice to tragic loss, and strategies for managing disclosure of tragic deaths with children were all strong themes which emerged from the analysis. This study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to generate a vivid picture of the lived psychological experience of grief as it is experienced by members of a minority group with above average rates of sudden and early deaths. This contributes to understanding the burden of health inequality in an underresearched population. Findings in relation to challenges in communicating with children about tragic deaths can be integrated into bereavement support resources.","576":null,"577":"The article is based on ethnographic observation and semistructured interviews with personnel in three European adult intensive care units. Intensive care is a domain of contemporary biomedicine centered on invasive and intense efforts to save lives in acute, critical conditions. It echoes our culture's values of longevity. Nevertheless, mortality rates are elevated. Many deaths follow from nontreatment decisions. Medicalized dying in technological medical settings are often presented as unnatural, impersonal, and undesirable ways of dying. How does this affect the way in which death is experienced by intensive care professionals? What might the enactment of dying in intensive care reveal about our cultural values of good and bad dying?","578":"Macro-level studies have shown that rapid increases in mortality can affect fertility rates. Parental death has also been linked to negative psychological and physical outcomes, reduced relationship quality, and making bereaved children attach more importance to their families. No prior study has examined whether parental death influences adult children's fertility at the microlevel. This study applies event history techniques to Swedish multigeneration registers listing 1.5 million individuals with micro data on mortality and fertility to investigate short-term (first birth risk) and long-term (childlessness at age 45) effects of parental death on adult children's fertility. The principal finding is that parental death during reproductive age affects children's fertility and this effect is mainly short term. The effects differ to some degree between men and women and depend on the stage of the life course in which the bereavement occurs. Younger individuals experiencing a parental death have a significantly higher first birth risk after the parental death compared with peers who did not experience a parental death. Individuals older than 23 who experience a parental death have no or lower first birth risk after the parental death compared with baseline. Men, compared with women, are more likely to end childless if they experience a parental death.","579":null,"580":"The number of parents who have lost their only child (PLOCs) has increased annually with the implementation of the birth control policy in mainland China. This study aimed to investigate the mental health status of PLOCs and the influence of social support and resilience. Study 1 recruited 100 PLOCs and 88 nonbereaved parents, and compared differences in depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Study 2 investigated the influence of social support and resilience on the mental health of PLOCs via a mediating model. Results indicate that PLOCs reported more anxiety and depression symptoms than nonbereaved counterparts. Perceived close family support, objective support, and resilience negatively predicted anxiety and depression. In addition, perceived close family support was found to influence mental health via resilience. The current findings reveal that losing an only child has long-term negative impacts on the mental health of PLOCs. However, perceived close family support and objective support can protect their mental health either directly or indirectly via resilience.","581":"The purpose of this study is to explore bereaved mothers' 2-year experiences of losing their only child in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Taking an interpretative phenomenological approach, this study interviewed six bereaved mothers four times (6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months) in Dujiangyan area in Sichuan Province. The findings suggest that these mothers' personal grief experiences evolved: initially, anger toward the cause of their children's deaths, following despair of meaningless life, guilt and regret, and finally yearning. Although their yearning and missing ebbed after 2 years, these mothers still had unresolved grief. These mothers also faced strained marital relationships and additional pressure from social interactions. This study illuminates that these mothers' personal grief experiences and their coping strategies corresponded to Chinese family and sociocultural context.","582":"This study investigates the subjective experiences of terminal cancer patients who expedite their corneal donation decisions. The percentage of cancer patients who donate their corneas postmortem is low in Taiwan. The reasons are complex and needs further exploration. A qualitative design using content analysis was used. A semistructured interview approach was adopted to interview cancer patients recruited from a cancer ward in northern Taiwan. The study findings show that the factors contributing to an aversive preference of cancer patients included the necessity to consider the emotions of family members, traditional perceptions, religious reasons, disease, and no reason at all. Most cancer patients maintain a negative stance toward corneal donation. The results obtained in the present study can be used as a reference for future in-service education and promotional efforts regarding corneal donation. Discussing cornea donation needs to become a routine end-of-life care discussion.","583":"Persons who come close to death but survive catastrophic accidents sometimes report very vivid experiences during times when their survival was in doubt, when they were believed to be dead, and during resuscitation efforts. This qualitative study builds upon existing research on near-death experiences (NDEs) by focusing on the oral accounts from a sample of individuals with large and life-threatening burns. The NDE accounts were obtained from burn survivors attending the Phoenix Society's World Burn Congress and are similar to reports by notable researchers ( Greyson, 2003 ; Moody, 1975 ; Ring, 1980 ) while reflecting the uniqueness of the individual survivor's experiences. Six major themes are reported. Counselors and health professionals need to be aware of and educated about NDEs as these experiences can have profound effects upon the individual. Patients who have had NDEs may need to discuss them but fear professionals will reject their stories as being crazy.","584":"After a hospice patient dies, hospice providers can experience a variety of emotional responses. While work has been done on social workers' and nurses' reactions to patient death, home health aides (HHAs) have been overlooked. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups and individual qualitative interviews with 14 hospice HHAs. Questions covered HHAs' grief responses and how they coped with grief. We found a high burden of grief reactions; many HHAs often developed very close patient relationships. HHAs also noted that they often started working with new patients almost immediately after a death, leaving little time to process the loss. However, HHAs found support from other HHAs, their supervisors, as well as family, friends, and spiritual practices to be helpful in coping with their grief. Future work should enhance support to HHAs around patient loss; for example, grief support may be embedded into hospice team activities.","585":"We explored parents' views of the trajectories of their adult children's eventual deaths from drugs with in-depth qualitative interviews from 11 bereaved parents. Parents reported great emotional distress and high financial burdens as their children went through death spirals of increasing drug involvements. These deaths often entailed anxiety-inducing interactions with police or medical personnel, subsequent difficulties with sharing death cause information with socially significant others, and longer term problems from routine interactions. Eventually, though, many of these longer term bereaved parents reported overcoming these obstacles and developing posttraumatic growth. Openly disclosing the nature of the death seemed to be an important building block for their healing.","586":null,"587":"Sexuality and intimacy, including contact, tenderness, and love, are important at every life stage. Intimate expression is especially vital at the end of life, when relationships with loved ones are time limited. Unfortunately, care providers often ignore the potential need for sexual expression, especially at the end of life. In this article, we consider current research on sexuality and end-of-life care and situate these two fields in an ecological framework. We explore how end-of-life sexuality and intimacy can be supported by practitioners in multiple nested contexts and provide suggestions for theoretically-driven interventions. We also provide reflexive considerations for practitioners.","588":"Little is known about the experiences of widowed men with dependent children. With such limited knowledge it is not clear how mental health professionals can assist this population. In this qualitative case study the researcher describes the experiences of ten widowed fathers from the Southeastern United States as they struggle with their new parenting responsibilities after the death of their wives and their children's mothers. The researcher used an inductive constant comparative method to reveal themes. The interview data revealed three themes: Ways to Cope, Concerns, and Newfound Respect. These themes and their subcategories are presented together with suggestions on how to assist widowers with dependent children.","589":"The study examines the perceptions of interfaith spiritual care, received through a volunteer hospice organization, by 10 individuals facing death and dying. Qualitative methodology based on the Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze the data. Four superordinate themes reflected meanings ascribed to spirituality and spiritual care in facing end of life: Vital Role of Spirituality in the End-of-Life Care, Definitions and Parameters of Spirituality and Interfaith Spiritual Care, Distinct Aspects of Interfaith Spiritual Care, and Unmet Spiritual Needs. The results expand an understanding of the role of spirituality and spiritual care as part of the hospice and palliative care through attention to individual perceptions and experiences, as well as to ways to expand attention to spirituality within the hospice care.","590":"To increase our understanding of the role gender plays in spousal loss, this qualitative study analyzes bereavement narratives of 33 recent widowers, aged 45-89 years, all of whom accessed the National Widowers' Organization website. In particular, we look at how these widowers' lives changed, the impact of changing gender norms, and coping strategies. To illuminate the temporal process evident in these narratives, we utilize Silverman's nonlinear characteristics of bereavement and the anthropological concept of liminality. In contrast to studies of widowers in earlier decades, our analysis reveals questioning and rejection of stereotypical masculine gender norms, a wide variety of creative responses to spousal loss, and the need for individualized support.","591":"Families of dying children are profoundly impacted by numerous interactions with health-care providers before, during, and after their child's death. However, there is a dearth of research on these families' direct, qualitative experiences with health-care providers. This study presents findings from interviews with 18 family members, predominantly parents, regarding their experiences with health-care providers during a child's terminal illness, from diagnosis to death. The importance of compassion emerged as a salient theme, manifested in myriad ways, and connected to participants' perception of caregiver presence in multiple domains. Families were likewise negatively affected by a wide variety of situations and behaviors that represented individual or institutional abandonment or nonpresence, and thus compounded the experience of loss. Specifics and implications for practice are explored.","592":"This narrative review explores the literature regarding the drama of dying from several academic perspectives. Three key themes were identified including \"The impact of blurred boundaries on roles and transitions,\" \"The orchestration of death and dying through time,\" and \"Contemporary dying and new machinery of control.\" This review reveals the manner in which tightly scripted dying roles serve the needs of the living to a greater extent than those of the dying, by ensuring the depiction of both dying and death as phenomena which have been brought under the control of the living, thereby countering death anxiety. An incongruence between the actual experience of dying and contemporary dying scripts is also highlighted. The authors argue that this incongruence is hidden from the broader societal audience through the maintenance of a dying role that demands serenity and acceptance, thus downplaying or even hiding the actual end-of-life experiences of the dying themselves.","593":"St Christopher's Hospice, London, was founded to provide specialist care to the incurably ill. We studied the dimensions of difference that set St Christopher's Hospice apart from hospital care of the dying, focusing on physical space and social organization. Material from 1953 to 1980 from the Cicely Saunders Archive was analyzed qualitatively. Through thematic analysis, quotes were found and analyzed using open coding. Five themes were developed. Themes identified were home\/homelike, community, consideration of others, link with outside world, and privacy. The hospice philosophy functioned as the catalyst for the development of the physical environment of St Christopher's Hospice. Taking Habermas' concept of lifeworld, it seems that, in contrast to acute care, the need for hospice to formulate their own lifeworld to support and fully engage patients was central. As lifeworlds are culture sensitive, this underlines the need for variation in design and organization of hospices around the world.","594":null,"595":"Losing a child or a spouse is described as the worst of experiences. However, it is not known whether older adults bereaved of a child, spouse, or both child and spouse experience these losses as among the most important negative events in their lifetime. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 1,437 older adults bereaved of a child, spouse, or both included in the southern part of the Swedish National Study of Aging and Care mentioned these losses when asked about their three most important negative life events. Gender differences in their choices of important negative life events were also explored. About 70% of those bereaved of a child or a spouse mentioned these losses as among their three most important negative life experiences. In the child-and-spouse-bereaved group, 48% mentioned both the loss of their child and spouse, while 40% mentioned either the loss of a child or a spouse. Gender differences were only found in the child-and-spouse-bereaved group, with a few more women mentioning the loss of the child but not the spouse, and the men showing the opposite pattern.","596":"The study examined the influence of training on first-year nursing department students' attitudes on death and caring for dying patients. Utilizing the experimental model, the study sample consisted of 81 first-year students attending the nursing department of a university. Death Attitude Profile-Revised and Frommelt Attitude toward Care of the Dying Scale were used for data collection. Data analysis included means, standard deviation, and t test for related samples. Student attitudes toward death were measured as 146.43 (16.741) and 152.75 (15.132) for pre- and posttraining, respectively. Student attitudes toward caring for dying patients were established to be 103.02 (7.655) during pretraining period and 111.02 (10.359) at posttraining period. The difference between pre- and posttests for mean attitudes toward death and caring for the dying patient was statistically significant. Study results determined that training was effective in forming positive student attitudes toward death and caring for dying patients.","597":null,"598":"As a result of recent economic changes in the United States and cultural changes among the population, the funeral industry has experienced a \"legitimation crisis.\" The objective of this research is to examine new advertising and marketing strategies engaged in by professionals in the funeral industry to respond to market and cultural changes that have affected both the funeral industry at large and the role of the funeral director as a participant in this industry. A meta-analysis of articles from issues of the industry trade journal American Funeral Director for the years 2008 through 2015 was conducted. Two major themes emerged from the data. First, that funeral home owners should respond to market changes by using their assets for diverse reasons and second that forms of community engagement can create feelings of goodwill that will increase usage and loyalty from families. Within each of these major themes, a variety of subthemes emerged from the data.","599":"The aim of this study was to identify the outcomes of parental bereavement and the changes in life experience that follow the traumatic death of a teenage child. The results of the study are aimed to assist counselors and educators who work with themes of grief and loss. From 17 in-depth interviews from parents bereaved by the Sewol ferry disaster of 2014 in South Korea, three main categories were found to capture the reality for parents after the sudden and traumatic death of a teenage child: (a) personal changes, (b) changes in close relationships, and (c) changes in social life. Recommendations for future research and potential implications were discussed.","600":"Several previous studies suggested that primary care physicians can provide important bereavement assistance to survivors of suicide, yet no study has investigated whether suicide-bereaved patients perceive their physicians as helpful. Contacting bereavement communities on social media, we collected online survey data from 146 bereaved respondents reporting suicides causing them severe emotional distress. Data analysis suggested that nearly half (48%) of the respondents encountered positive, help-offering responses from physicians, compared to 10% whose responses were deemed as negative. Analysis of our data suggested that loss survivors' perceptions of a physician's helping or reproachful responses were associated with differences in grief difficulties and mental health distress.","601":"Despite the high prevalence of suicide both overall and among people with disabilities in particular, little research has explored suicide in the context of the vocational rehabilitation (VR) system or in counseling support staff in general. We analyzed the responses of 14 VR support staff who responded to an open-ended qualitative prompt regarding their experiences with suicide training and competency. Key themes included a perceived lack of and desire for more training regarding suicide, seeking and receiving suicide training outside of VR, and a perceived lack of resources for working with suicidal clients. Responses also underscored the heavy emotional impact of working with these clients, especially when one feels unprepared to do so. These results suggest that it is important to provide VR support staff with resources and training for addressing suicide in their client populations.","602":"The purpose of this study is to explore the grief experiences of mothers after they lost their children in the 2008 China earthquake. Informed by the Dual Process Model, this study conducted in-depth interviews to explore how six bereaved mothers coped with such grief over a 2-year period. Right after the earthquake, these mothers suffered from intensive grief. They primarily coped with loss-oriented stressors. As time passed, these mothers began to focus on restoration-oriented stressors to face changes in life. This coping trajectory was a dynamic and integral process, which bereaved mothers oscillated between loss- and restoration-oriented stressors. This study offers insight in extending the existing empirical evidence of the Dual Process Model.","603":"Wartime deaths are traumatic and leave many grieving families in their wake. Yet, the unique, nuanced bereavement needs and experiences of those who remain are largely unknown. This Canadian, qualitative study examined the bereavement experiences of family of origin, bereaved during the mission to Afghanistan. The findings provide rich data on the predominant ways in which family members found and made meaning following the death and the ways in which military culture influenced the meanings made.","604":"Adjustment of Israeli Arab Muslim widows to the traumatic loss of their husbands was examined by comparing their reported ways of coping with those of married women of their community by means of the Two-Track-Bereavement Model. Participants included 93 widows and 86 comparable married women who were mostly middle aged and of middle class. We hypothesized that widows will express concurrently greater suffering and higher resilience to adverse life events compared with married women. It was hypothesized further that positive and close relations to a deceased husband will be reported by Arab widows as well as Arab married women. However, positive relationships of married women will correlate with their own coping supporting attributes, whereas positive relations of widows to their deceased husband will not be associated with their individual characteristics. Results indicated a fourfold factor structure of the bereavement and coping scale which differed from those obtained by Israeli Jewish women and generally supported these hypotheses. It appears that traumatic loss of a husband may enhance widows' resilience.","605":"A plethora of research exists about death and dying, particularly with regard to the prescriptive strategy on how teachers should address death in their classrooms. However, there is a gap in the literature about teachers' perceived preparedness to discuss a student's death in their classrooms. The following qualitative study used focus groups to explore teachers' experiences with and beliefs about death, dying, coping, student death, and preparedness to address student death in the classroom. Data were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Themes and subthemes for all research questions are presented and explained; some themes explored include teachers' views of death, death versus dying, initial and long-term coping, difficulties in addressing student death, the teachers' role after a student's death, feelings of being prepared versus unprepared to address student death in the classroom.","606":null,"607":"This grounded theory study gathered descriptions the bereavement experience for adults with intellectual disabilities (IDD) through the eyes and voices of a small sample of grief counselors. The counselors described bereaved adults with IDD as individuals who faced potentially heightened effects of the broken attachment bonds, increased risk of coping obstacles, long histories of unrecognized losses, and disenfranchised grief. The participants described bereaved adults with IDD (who sought treatment) as getting pushed to the sidelines to deal with their losses in isolation and confusion. It became evident that though there are many similarities between how all people cope with loss and how people with IDD cope with loss, differences exist. Subtle variations in the experience of loss and grief appear to be driven by culture and beliefs about disability and protection for those with IDD. The participants in this dissertation study contributed foundation data for a theoretical explanation of grief for adults with IDD grounded in data from bereavement counselors.","608":"The Wish to be Dead Scale (WDS) is a new scale to measure precursors to suicidal ideation, and the aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of a Farsi version of the WDS. The sample was a convenience sample of 145 Iranian female undergraduates and postgraduates selected from different faculties at Iran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Using a principal component analysis and a varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization, three factors were identified and labeled: (a) lack of purpose and usefulness in life, (b) lack of interest in living, and (c) fantasizing about being dead. The WDS had good inter-item and test-retest reliability and significant positive correlations with scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-10 and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and negative correlations with scores on the Adult Hope Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, the Love of Life Scale, the Life Orientation Test, and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. We conclude that the WDS may prove to be useful in clinical practice and research into suicide.","609":null,"610":"The aim of this research was to understand the characteristics of rural young suicides with major depression in China and the relationship of these events with Confucian values and negative life events. Our cases were 90 rural suicides with major depression with victims aged 15 to 34 years and living matched controls of the same gender, age (within 3 years), and county of residence. Confucian values appear to be a protective factor for men but a risk factor for women with regard to suicide with major depression. More attention should be paid to Confucian values in suicide prevention efforts.","611":"Advance care planning (ACP) is a method used for patients to express in advance their preferences for life-sustaining treatments at the end of life. With growing ethnocultural diversity in Canada, health-care providers are managing an increasing number of diverse beliefs and values that are commonly associated with preferences for intensive mechanical ventilation (MV) treatment at the end of life. This study aimed to identify and describe the approaches used by health-care providers to set advance care plans for MV with seriously ill patients from diverse ethnocultural backgrounds. Semistructured interviews were conducted with health-care providers from acute-care settings. Using a value-based approach in ACP was deemed an effective method of practice for managing and interpreting diverse beliefs and values that impact decisions for MV. However, personnel, organizational, and systemic barriers that exist continue to hinder the provision of ACP across cultures.","612":"This article deals with the issue of perceived social support among 40 bereaved parents who have lost a child in a terrorist attack in Israel. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the nature and quality of the formal and informal support that the parents received. The parents were interviewed using semistructured in-depth interviews. The content analysis revealed that alongside the positive aspects, the parents also emphasized the negative side of the encounter with the social environment. The positive aspects included feeling of appreciation for the assistance in the coping process. The negative aspects included a sense of abandonment and distress. The dialectic nature of the domain, together with a recognition of its importance, points to the need to reconcile between the desire on the part of the social environment to assist the bereaved parent on one hand and ways to implement it on the other hand.","613":"Burial rituals are symbolic activities that encourage the expression of grief as a positive way to heal while helping to confirm the reality of death. In the Caribbean, consisting of multiple distinct islands and histories of colonization, how individuals are buried on each island depends on the historical intermingling of the colonizer's Christian religion and African (spiritual) rituals. Each island has distinct burial rituals that are a blending of Christian and African religious or spiritual cultures. This article highlights the distinct burial rituals on the Caribbean islands of Barbados, Haiti, and Trinidad and how its historical past has shaped present burial rituals and its significance to the African Caribbean grieving processes.","614":"The aims of this present study were to explore the use and meaning of metaphors and images about aging in older people with a death wish and to elucidate what these metaphors and images tell us about their self-understanding and imagined feared future. Twenty-five in-depth interviews with Dutch older people with a death wish (median 82 years) were analyzed by making use of a phenomenological-hermeneutical metaphor analysis approach. We found 10 central metaphorical concepts: (a) struggle, (b) victimhood, (c) void, (d) stagnation, (e) captivity, (f) breakdown, (g) redundancy, (h) subhumanization, (i) burden, and (j) childhood. It appears that the group under research does have profound negative impressions of old age and about themselves being or becoming old. The discourse used reveals a strong sense of distance, disengagement, and nonbelonging associated with their wish to die. This study empirically supports the theory of stereotype embodiment.","615":"This study aims to examine perceptions and attitudes toward euthanasia among university students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees. Although the legalization and application of euthanasia are discussed commonly by health-care professionals and partially by lawyers, the ideas of other segments of society, especially university students, are taken place very rarely. The research was conducted descriptively to determine the ideas of 1,170 students at Kastamonu University from six different departments: arts and sciences, theology, tourism, nursing, school of physical education, and sports with using a questionnaire. Findings demonstrated that 73.2% of the students do not approve euthanasia. Also, it was found that there are significant differences depending on age, gender, department of study, income level, place of living, and the loss of kinsmen. This study serves as a resource for future research to understand the effects of sociodemographic characteristics on the decision of euthanasia.","616":"Self-compassion is gaining recognition as a resilience factor with implications for positive mental health. This study investigated the role of self-compassion in alleviating the effect of self-criticism on depressive symptoms. Participants were 147 urban, low-income African Americans with a recent suicide attempt. They were administered measures of self-criticism, depressive symptoms, and self-compassion. Results from this cross-sectional investigation showed that self-criticism was positively associated with depressive symptoms and negatively associated with self-compassion, and self-compassion was negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Bootstrapping analysis revealed that self-compassion mediated the self-criticism-depressive symptoms link, suggesting that self-compassion ameliorates the negative impact of self-criticism on depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that low-income African Americans with recent suicide attempt histories may benefit from interventions that focus on enhancing self-compassion. These results also highlight self-compassion as a positive trait with promise to improve people's quality of life and suggest that self-compassion-focused interventions are consistent with a positive psychology framework.","617":null,"618":"This study aims, first, to compare normative Islamic practices toward death and dying and actual practices of Moroccan Muslim women. Second, it seeks to compare the views and practices of middle-aged and elderly women. Qualitative empirical research was conducted with 30 middle-aged and elderly Moroccan Muslim women living in Antwerp (Belgium) and with 15 experts in the field. Our study shows that religious beliefs and worldview have a great impact on Muslims' practices surrounding death and dying. More specifically, practices are strongly shaped by their eschatological beliefs. The rituals are perceived as preparations for the hereafter, entailing purification of both soul and body, and demonstrate the belief in a continued existence of the soul. We found striking similarities between our participants' views and normative Islamic views. We did not find a more secular understanding of death and dying among the middle-aged women.","619":"Despite the increasing number of people being bereaved by suicide, little is understood concerning the experiences of those bereaved by suicide as they struggle to make sense of a loved one's death. The current study explored the experiences of four mothers who had been bereaved by suicide and the role of support groups in the meaning-making process following bereavement by suicide. Participants were interviewed and transcribed interviews were then analysed from an interpretative phenomenological perspective. Four main themes were identified: Continuing role of the mother; A never-ending quest; Finding sanctuary; and Rising up from the ashes. These themes relate to a range of emotions following bereavement by suicide, the meaning-making process, the social context and the role of the support group. Clinical implications are discussed in relation to these findings.","620":"This systematic literature review assesses the evidence regarding benefits of peer support services for bereaved survivors of sudden or unexpected death. Reports were included that addressed peer support services for adults who experienced death of a family member, close friend, or coworker. Of the 32 studies meeting all inclusion criteria, most showed evidence that peer support was helpful to bereaved survivors, reducing grief symptoms and increasing well-being and personal growth. Studies also showed benefits to providers of peer support, including increased personal growth and positive meaning in life. Several studies addressed the growing trend of Internet-based peer support programs, finding that these are beneficial in part due to their easy accessibility. Peer support appears to be especially valuable for survivors of suicide loss, a result that may be related to stigma and lack of support from family and friends experienced by many suicide survivors. The reviewed studies provide consistent evidence that peer support is beneficial to bereaved survivors.","621":"Several longitudinal studies show that over time the American public has become more approving of euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. Yet, these previous findings are limited because they derive from biased estimates of disaggregated hierarchical data. Using insights from life course sociological theory and cross-classified logistic regression models, I better account for this liberalization process by disentangling the age, period, and cohort effects that contribute to longitudinal changes in these attitudes. The results of the analysis point toward a continued liberalization of both attitudes over time, although the magnitude of change was greater for suicide compared with euthanasia. More fluctuation in the probability of supporting both measures was exhibited for the age and period effects over the cohort effects. In addition, age-based differences in supporting both measures were found between men and women and various religious affiliations.","622":"This study explores how medical students feel about caring for terminally ill patients as well as how their medical courses prepare them for addressing end-of-life (EOL) issues with patients. Four hundred and five Mexican medical students were surveyed through the Student Views on Death questionnaire. The vast majority of students (94%) felt that physicians should inform patients of their impending death. Most students said they felt comfortable talking with (61%) or examining (76%) terminally ill patients. However, only half the students actually talked with patients about death. Participants in our study were interested in learning about EOL medical attention, yet most considered themselves poorly prepared to offer this type of care to terminally ill patients. The study provides objective data on a topic that has scarcely been explored in Mexico, data that will be useful in designing educational activities to improve EOL medical training.","623":"This study examined the relationship between continuing bonds (CBs) among 50 bereaved youth (ages 11-17) and their bereaved adult caregivers, and predictors of CBs among youth. Results indicated there was not a significant relationship between caregiver CB and youth CB. However, significant relationships were found between youth bereavement symptomatology, their relationship to the deceased, and youth CB. Specifically, youth with higher levels of symptomatology and those who lost an immediate family member were more likely to maintain CBs. Results suggest the need for practitioners to incorporate grief symptomatology and CBs in assessment and intervention with bereaved youth.","624":"The present research examines the strength of terror management theory in an indigenous Indian context of religious fair called Magh Mela. It explores how elderly Hindu people deal with death anxiety through practicing Kalpvas in Magh Mela. The research explores the role of social detachment and self-esteem in coping with terror of death. Study 1, a field experiment on 150 Kalpvasis (practitioners of Kalpvas) confirms the significant role of social detachment as an adaptive strategy for coping with death terror. The role of self-esteem did not emerge in the study. Study 2, another field experiment on 62 Kalpvasis confirms results of study 1. Significant role of years of Kalpvas on fear of death shows importance of the religious practices in managing terror related to death. The relation of terror management theory and death anxiety thus follows a different explanation for more indigenous contexts.","625":"The death of a parent in a child's life is a significant risk factor for later mental and physical health problems. While much has been written about the surviving parent's functioning and its effects on their bereaved children, little work has been done to look into factors underlying this effect such as how the parent copes. The present study recruited 38 parent-child dyads from a community-based grief support center. Parent and child, independently, completed various measures of emotional functioning, including grief symptoms and coping such as social support and locus of control. The results indicated that parental coping did have an impact on children's grief symptoms. This represents a unique view of adaptation in bereaved children: Parental coping strategies can have an impact on the child, independent of the child's coping strategies. By focusing on parent coping, we have highlighted another possible pathway through which parental functioning affects children's grief.","626":null,"627":null,"628":"The purpose of this study is to explore the grief experiences of mothers after they lost their children in the 2008 China earthquake.

We argue Disney and Pixar depictions of EOL and death can provide critical opportunities for discussing death and dying processes with children and adults alike. A content analysis of 57 movies resulted in a total of 71 character deaths. These instances of death became the discourse used for analysis. The EOL discourse was coded based on five categories (character status, depiction of death, death status, emotional reaction, and causality). After quantitative analysis, the films were qualitatively analyzed. Four themes emerged from analysis, unrealistic moments, managing EOL, intentions to kill, and transformation and spiritual connection. Discussion of results, limitations, and directions for future research are included.","630":"There is almost no data on the role of social support and in general on posttraumatic growth among people who have missing family member(s) as result of war and who experience ambiguous loss. This study explores relationship between reported posttraumatic growth and perceived social support and social activism in community-based organizations dealing directly with issues of missing persons. Family members who reported higher levels of social support from family, friends, and important others reported significant higher levels of posttraumatic growth. Family members that reported being active in community-based organizations reported significant higher averages in posttraumatic growth scores in total and its subscales. Regression analyses indicates that factors associated posttraumatic growth were as follows: being active in community organization dealing with missing person's issues and higher levels of social support from friends and family. Findings provide insight for clinicians working with this population and psycho social experts working in postconflict contexts.","631":"We present study results regarding soldiers' willingness to conduct posthumous reproduction. Two hundred twelve Israeli soldiers filled in a questionnaire designed to examine their willingness to cryopreserve sperm and evaluate in which familial circumstances they would consent to posthumous reproduction. They ranked the desirability of 46 attributes of a potential mother and a life partner. Findings indicate a relatively high predisposition in favor of posthumous-assisted reproduction; the wishes of soldiers' parents had much more influence on soldiers' willingness to pursue this technology than those of a partner. Soldiers preferred \"feminine\" jobs for a potential mother that would allow her to dedicate herself to child-rearing. The desired traits of such a mother were rated similarly to partner preferences; however, significant differences were found in attributes that are most related to the potential mother's devotion to maternity. Interpretations of these findings are contextualized in relation to ethical and bereavement considerations.","632":null,"633":"No research drawing from Self-Determination Theory has investigated the bereavement experience of individuals or how motivation can help facilitate posttraumatic growth (PTG) following the death of a loved one. In two cross-sectional studies, university students completed an online survey. Study 1 investigated the contribution of global autonomous and controlled motivation in statistically predicting PTG above and beyond previously researched correlates. Study 2 explored the mediating role of cognitive appraisals and coping in explaining the relationship between global motivation orientations and PTG. Results indicated that in comparison to controlled motivation, autonomous motivation was positively related PTG, even after controlling for previously researched correlates. Mediation results indicated an indirect effect of global autonomous motivation on PTG through task-oriented coping. Collectively, these findings suggest the importance of incorporating motivation into models of PTG. Clinical implications of these findings are also discussed.","634":"Last statements have been a common practice as part of capital punishment as far back as the 1300s in Europe. In the United States, the first execution occurred in 1608, and currently, 32 states have the death penalty. In 1991, Missouri integrated death row inmates into the general prison population, which makes this population unique compared with other death row populations across the United States. This article is a qualitative study on the themes found in the last statements of 46 capitally punished inmates in Missouri from 1995 to 2011. The purpose of this study was to determine if capital punishment inmates being housed in the general population had an impact on an inmate's last statement prior to execution. Three domains emerged from these last statements: life, death, and execution. The most common theme identified was love while the least common theme was acceptance. The themes found in this research were consistent with previous studies which looked at inmates executed in Texas where inmates sentenced to capital punishment are separated from the general prison population. Implications, limitations, and future research areas are discussed.","635":"This article examines the views of persons living with AIDS about how they want to die and how they are planning for their deaths. Participants for the study were purposefully drawn from an HIV clinic in an urban town in Ghana. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 persons living with AIDS. Three preferences of death were identified by the participants. These include the desire for a quick death, death at home, and death without emaciating. Planning for death involved attending church and taking care of children. Inherent in the responses of the participants is the concern for cost of care, dwindling network of family carers, and stigmatization and shame. The article concludes that the government needs to provide support for home-based care, establish a pension for AIDS patients, support families to pay for the funeral expenses of their relatives, and scale up effort to reduce HIV\/AIDS-related stigma.","636":"Although Japan has a high suicide rate, there is insufficient research on the experiences of suicide-bereaved individuals. We investigated the qualitative aspects of the meaning reconstruction process after a loss to suicide. We conducted a life-story interview using open-ended questions with one middle-aged Japanese woman who lost her son to suicide. We used a narrative approach to transcribe and code the participant's narratives for analysis. The analysis revealed three meaning groups that structured the participant's reactions to the suicide: making sense of her son's death and life, relationships with other people, and reconstruction of a bond with the deceased. The belief that death is not an eternal split and that there is a connection between the living and the deceased reduced the pain felt by our participant. Furthermore, the narratives worked as scaffolds in the meaning reconstruction process. We discuss our results in the light of cross-cultural differences in the grieving process.","637":"Parents who experience the death of a child are at high risk for psychopathology. Because a large percentage of pediatric deaths occur in the pediatric intensive care unit each year, a follow-up meeting between bereaved parents and intensivists could provide essential emotional support, although some parents may not attend. The aim of this study was to explore demographic and medical factors that may distinguish between bereaved parents who attend a follow-up meeting with their child's pediatric intensivist and those who do not. Our analysis revealed that parents of children who died of trauma were less likely to attend a follow-up meeting with an intensivist. It is possible that symptoms of posttraumatic stress play a role in these findings. Enhanced efforts to identify other interventions for this specific subset of bereaved parents may be necessary.","638":null,"639":null,"640":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the characteristics of posttraumatic growth arising from losing an immediate family member to suicide in Korea. We used interpretative phenomenological analysis for data collection and analysis and conducted in-depth interviews with 11 participants in Korea to evaluate the positive changes subsequent to the suicide. Participants revealed positive outcomes in response to losing an immediate family member to suicide after suffering the \"most unimaginable pain\" including (a) \"Now I know what the most important thing in life is,\" (b) \"Warm and intimate relationships matter,\" and (c) \"Survivors of suicide's search for meaning.\" The implications of these findings and avenues for future research are discussed.","641":null,"642":"Research on the association between complicated grief (CG), hope, and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among bereaved youth is limited. Measures of CG, depression, hope, and PTG were completed by 85 youth (aged 7-18 years). Results indicated a strong positive relationship between CG and depressive symptoms, an inverse relationship between hope and depressive symptoms, and a moderate positive relationship between hope and PTG. There was no significant association between CG and hope or between CG and PTG. Higher levels of CG and lower levels of hope independently predicted greater depressive symptoms, but PTG did not. Results have implications for assessing positive outcomes in bereaved youth.","643":"In this article, we report on the structure and effectiveness of a grief management coaching intervention with caregivers of individuals with dementia. The intervention was informed by Marwit and Meuser's Caregiver Grief Model and considered levels of grief, sense of empowerment, coping, and resilience using five methods of delivery. Results indicate that the intervention had significant positive effects on caregivers' levels of grief and increased their levels of empowerment, coping, and resilience. The intervention was found to be effective across caregivers' characteristics as well as across five delivery modalities. Through description of this intervention, as well as outcome, this research contributes to the body of knowledge about caregivers' disenfranchised grief and ways to effectively address it.","644":"A total of 56 Japanese and 59 American survivor of suicide support group facilitators were asked to rank the mutual aid objectives of their groups following Shulman's scheme in terms of their frequency and importance. Both American and Japanese facilitators showed an emphasis on personal adaptation goals (such as helping bereaved feel less isolated in their grief or encouraging bereaved to share their coping with loss experiences) over collective goals (such as raising monies for more research on mental illness or trying to combat societal suicide stigma in their local communities). Differences were also noted with American facilitators evaluating helping with problem solving, sharing different ways of coping, viewing personal issues as societal problems, and advocating for promoting social change as significantly higher than the Japanese did. We believe some of these contrasts reflect differences in American and Japanese cultural values.","645":"In view of the general support for organ donation but low registration rate in Hong Kong, the present research attempted to understand the attitude-behavior inconsistency by identifying the underlying beliefs for organ donation through employing the theory of reasoned action. A qualitative approach using semi-structured focus groups was adopted and 19 students from three universities in Hong Kong participated; 10 constructs were identified: attitude, subjective norm, helping, continuation, contribution, body intact, distrust to the medical system, indifference to organ donation, negative affect, and family burden. Findings suggested that their attitudes toward organ donation were of both the cognitive and affective nature; subjective norm of family, friends, and people they respect were identified as influential to students' views on organ donation. The study provided insight in promoting organ donation, that the cognitive concerns about keeping the body intact, and the negative affects introduced should also be addressed.","646":"The aim of this study was to investigate maternal grief after losing a child in relation to forgiveness and posttraumatic growth. A sample of 60 grieving mothers from Slovakia completed the following battery: The Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, a modified version of the Enright Forgiveness Inventory, and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. The results showed a negative association between forgiveness and grief and a strong positive association between forgiveness and posttraumatic growth, which was not moderated by the time elapsed since the loss. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 mothers. The data were analyzed through Consensual Qualitative Research to gain deeper understanding of forgiveness and posttraumatic growth experiences after the loss of a child. Categories and subcategories are discussed.","647":"The debate about euthanasia is ongoing in several countries including Finland. However, there is a lack of information on current attitudes toward euthanasia among general Finnish public. The traditional model for predicting individuals' attitudes to euthanasia is based on their age, gender, educational level, and religiosity. However, a new evaluation of religiosity is needed due to the limited operationalization of this factor in previous studies. This study explores the connections between the factors of the traditional model and the attitudes toward euthanasia among the general public in the Finnish context. The Finnish public's attitudes toward euthanasia have become remarkably more positive over the last decade. Further research is needed on the factors that predict euthanasia attitudes. We suggest two different explanatory models for consideration: one that emphasizes the value of individual autonomy and another that approaches euthanasia from the perspective of fears of death or the process of dying.","648":"In recent years, the common and mundane dying has begun to take place in the public space of the Internet. Among the blogs about food, fashion, travel, and other joyful aspects of life, blogs about severe disease and dying have appeared. The aim of this article is to describe some characteristic features of a sample of cancer blogs and to discuss them in the light of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of the rationalization of death in modernity and theories about networked media, especially the theories about \"affective labor\" and \"ambient intimacy\" by McCosker, Darcy, and Pfister. It will then be argued that an affective communication is performed in and through these cancer blogs, where not only language but also the deficiencies of language-and what is called shared ineffability-might be valuable and meaningful (although not unproblematic) as part of a late modern approach to death, and in the practicing of the art of dying.","649":"With mounting empirical evidence that interpersonal closeness and conflict with the deceased prior to death are significant predictors of grief reactions following loss, accurate empirical examination of these two constructs is of high importance. Despite the utility of the Quality of Relationships Inventory (QRI) in numerous domains of research, the original instrument was not constructed with a predeath, mourner-decedent relationship in mind. Therefore, this study clarified the factor structure of a modified QRI focusing on major dimensions of the predeath relationship with the deceased-dynamics that could have strong implications for the survivor's bereavement trajectory. An exploratory factor analysis of 386 bereaved adults revealed two salient factors, deemed closeness and conflict. These results suggest that the modified bereavement version of the QRI, designated the Quality of Relationships Inventory-Bereavement version, is well positioned to advance research in thanatology, with possible limitations noted in the range of relationships to which it is applicable.","650":null,"651":"In literature, obituaries from different cultures and languages have been studied on different levels and from different perspectives. One of the popular research topics is the use of metaphors, since metaphors help to cope with death, which in modern society is still a taboo. This article presents a bottom-up, primarily qualitative analysis of the metaphors in 150 obituaries of sportspeople, published in online versions of newspapers\/magazines and on the Internet. As expected, the obituaries contain the traditional metaphors of death. Also more original, creative metaphors are introduced to describe death in a euphemistic way. Some of those have a link to sports but not systematically to the sport practiced by the deceased.","652":"The purpose of this study is to examine suicide trends in South Korea, which has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. The results show that the male suicide rate outweighs that of females, the likelihood of committing suicide increases with age, and that, in regard to marital status, nonmarried people are the most at risk. In addition, several methods of reducing suicide rates are identified: the wider use of social networks to reduce social burden, the development of a social atmosphere where aging is accepted as a natural process, and the development of protection factors within families.","653":"Clergy have a key role in suicide prevention but report being undertrained, perhaps because a model that captures the competencies needed to engage suicide in faith communities and how these skills develop has not previously been available. Using grounded theory, this study addressed this gap by generating a developmental rubric based on interviews with 19 Protestant clergy, which were analyzed using a constant comparative method and were checked by interviewees operating at the highest level of development. The final 10 dimensions described over four developmental stages are (a) knowing role as clergy, (b) listening, (c) confidence, (d) risk assessment, (e) referral, (f) self-care, (g) community building, (h) postvention: ministering to survivors, (i) conducting memorial services or memorial ceremonies, and (j) clergy guilt. Results are based on clergy's intuitive categories and provide a usable rubric for developing suicide prevention training for clergy.","654":"Several reports have indicated that grief and mental health outcomes of people bereaved by suicide vary by their relationship to the deceased. Parents who have lost offspring experience higher levels of distress than those with other relationships to the deceased. However, there are limited studies investigating the experience of parental bereavement by suicide, and further research is needed. The present study aimed to clarify the differences in grief reactions between bereaved parents and those with other relationships to the deceased in Japan and explore a statistical model of adaptation to the loss. In total, 105 bereaved participants completed a questionnaire covering grief reaction, meaning reconstruction, mental health, social context, and demographic variables. Parents scored higher on several grief reaction items and lower in sense-making than those with other relationships. In addition, path analysis showed that sense-making acted as a moderator in the experience of loss of offspring and grief reaction.","655":"Guest deaths are an inevitable aspect of the hospitality industry. In Study 1, participants read a vignette in which the previous guest died of natural causes, suicide, or homicide. Those who learned of a death (a) saw the room as less valuable, (b) opted to stay in a more basic room in which no death occurred, despite both rooms being offered for free, and (c) anticipated feeling uneasy when imagining an overnight stay. In Study 2, we investigated the persistence of this bias. Perceived room value and anticipatory well-being can be expected to return to baseline levels only many years after the death event. Similar to \"stigmatized properties\" in real estate, these data confirm an irrational and recalcitrant cognitive bias surrounding consumers' views of death-affected hotel rooms.","656":"The death of a loved one is ultimately a universal experience. However, conventional interventions employed for people suffering with uncomplicated grief have gathered little empirical support. The present study aimed to explore the potential effects of ayahuasca on grief. We compared 30 people who had taken ayahuasca with 30 people who had attended peer-support groups, measuring level of grief and experiential avoidance. We also examined themes in participant responses to an open-ended question regarding their experiences with ayahuasca. The ayahuasca group presented a lower level of grief in the Present Feelings Scale of Texas Revised Inventory of Grief, showing benefits in some psychological and interpersonal dimensions. Qualitative responses described experiences of emotional release, biographical memories, and experiences of contact with the deceased. Additionally, some benefits were identified regarding the ayahuasca experiences. These results provide preliminary data about the potential of ayahuasca as a therapeutic tool in treatments for grief.","657":null,"658":"This article uses grounded theory methodology to analyze in-depth interviews conducted with mourners who used social networking sites during bereavement. The social media mourning (SMM) model outlines how social networking sites are used to grieve using one or more of the following: (a) one-way communication, (b) two-way communication, and (c) immortality communication. The model indicates causal conditions of SMM: (a) sharing information with family or friends and (sometimes) beginning a dialog, (b) discussing death with others mourning, (c) discussing death with a broader mourning community, and (d) commemorating and continuing connection to the deceased. The article includes actions and consequences associated with SMM and suggests several ways in which SMM changes or influences the bereavement process.","659":null,"660":"This research aimed to explore the role of workplace responses in psychologists' adaptation to client suicides. Participants were 178 psychologists who completed an online self-report questionnaire which included both open and closed questions yielding qualitative and quantitative data. Fifty-six (31.5%) participants reported one or more client suicides. Mixed results were found in terms of perceived support from the workplace following a client suicide. Psychologists reported a need for more open communication in the workplace, peer supports, space to grieve, as well as opportunities to engage in a learning process. The findings have important implications for research and for understanding the role of the workplace postvention. It also raises the need for external support to be accessible for psychologists working in private practice.","661":null,"662":"Human-animal relationships are increasingly incorporated into families as a normal part of family life. Despite this, relationships with animals are often viewed as inferior to human relationships. This becomes problematic during times of loss and grief when members of a grieving companion animal owner's support system do not understand the salience of the relationship with the animal. Veterinary and other helping professionals need basic information about the experience of companion animal loss in order to help support and normalize the experiences of grieving companion animal owners. The present study qualitatively describes human-animal relationships and the subsequent loss and coping experienced by owners of beloved companion animals. Comparison with human and other types of loss and factors unique to companion animal loss are discussed, and practical applications for veterinary and other helping professionals are provided.","663":"This article explains the meaning of the phrase Death Cafe and describes what typically occurs at a Death Cafe gathering. The article traces the history of the Death Cafe movement, explores some reasons why people take part in a Death Cafe gathering, and gives examples of what individuals think they might derive from their participation. In addition, this article notes similarities between the Death Cafe movement and three other developments in the field of death, dying, and bereavement. Finally, this article identifies two provisional lessons that can be drawn from Death Cafe gatherings and the Death Cafe movement itself.","664":"It is a worldwide trend that more households are having pets or companion animals. Hence, there has been an increasing number of animal lovers experience companion animal loss bereavement. This form of bereavement has not been explored in Chinese societies. We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 31 animal lovers and recruited through convenience and snowball sampling in Hong Kong. Companion animal loss bereavement appears to share similar features to other forms of bereavement but also has its unique features. The intensity of grief seemed to be affected by factors like the strength of the human-animal bond, lack of empathy from closed ones, being married without children, and euthanasia decision. Although the bereavement was distressful for many of our participants, many of them gradually achieved personal growth from their loss experience. We have identified seven common themes from the interview data and through self-reliance, social-supported, or professional-supported coping behaviors, people bereaved by animal loss can achieve growth from their experience. This study shows that postbereavement growth is possible from pet loss bereavement when appropriate coping strategies are adopted by the bereaved but some professional help may be needed.","665":"Children whose parent died by suicide are a vulnerable and underserved population. This phenomenon will be described, as well as implications for practice and research. \"Double Whammy,\" a conceptualization of the overall experience of this marginalized group, emerged through two in-depth interviews from a phenomenological qualitative study with professionals who facilitate support groups for children bereaved by parental suicide. It was corroborated with current literature and practice experiences of the authors and their colleagues. Stigma was the largest contributor to the \"Double Whammy,\" and the following themes emerged as well: feeling isolated, feeling abandoned, and feeling responsible. The self-volition of suicide challenges how bereaved children make meaning and internalize feelings about the deceased parent, one's self, and others. Developmentally appropriate education about suicide grief, depression, and normalizing the grief process is pivotal in helping children to effectively cope and manage their feelings.","666":"This study was performed with the objective of determining hopelessness and perception of illness in cancer patients. This was a descriptive and regressional study. The study was performed between January and June 2014 on 105 outpatients at the oncology clinic of Manisa Government Hospital in Turkey's western. A patient information form, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the illness perception questionnaire were used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using the program Statistical Package for Social Sciences 15.0. Percentages, t test, Kruskal-Wallis, one-way analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation were used in the evaluation of research data. The hopelessness levels of cancer patients participating in the study were at a medium level. As patients' scores on the hopelessness scale and its subscales increase, so their illness perception scores also increase. The hopelessness levels of patients whose illness perception was good were lower; that is, as patients' hopelessness levels fell, their illness perceptions and view of their illness were affected in a positive way.","667":"Psychological adaptation following homicide loss can prove more challenging for grievers than other types of losses. Although social support can be beneficial in bereavement, research is mixed in terms of identifying whether it serves as a buffer to distress following traumatic loss. In particular, studies have not parsed out specific domains of social support that best predict positive bereavement outcomes. Recruiting a sample of 47 African Americans bereaved by homicide, we examined six types of social support along with the griever's perceived need for or satisfaction with each and analyzed them in relation to depression, anxiety, complicated grief, and posttraumatic stress disorder outcomes. Results of multivariate analyses revealed that the griever's level of satisfaction with physical assistance at the initial assessment best predicted lower levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder levels 6 months later, while less need for physical assistance predicted lower complicated grief at follow-up. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.","668":"The present study investigated whether gender differences in death attitudes could be attributable to social desirability, locus of control, and disgust sensitivity. A total of 238 university students completed the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale and the Revised Death Attitude Profile in addition to measures of social desirability, locus of control, and disgust sensitivity. Women scored higher than men on many of the fear dimensions and also on approach and escape acceptance. There were no gender differences on locus of control or social desirability, but women reported more disgust sensitivity than did men. Locus of control was unrelated to any death attitudes. Social desirability was associated only with less reported fear of premature death. Disgust sensitivity was associated with all death attitudes except neutral acceptance. Some but not all of the gender differences in death attitudes were no longer significant when controlling for disgust sensitivity.","669":"The \"modern\" or traditional funeral, as it is known in the funeral industry today, that includes embalming, casket, service, and burial in a cemetery, emerged as a result of four forces in American society: the Industrial Revolution, the Civil War, the emergence of a genteel code of conduct as a result of increased wealth in our society, and changing cultural views toward death. While the traditional funeral ritual remains the most popular funeral selection in the United States today, the industry is experiencing changes that are reshaping the death rituals and methods of body disposal. A meta-analysis of relevant news articles from 1987 through 2014 finds that these changes are occurring as a result of two general motivational themes: a Business-Related Motivation and a Consumer-Related Motivation, each with corresponding subthemes.","670":"This study presents the findings from in-depth interviews with 24 people from 15 families in Norway who lost their young son or daughter in a traffic accident. Their grief has several dimensions: the loss of a young life, the loss of life quality, the effect on family events and their meaning, and the new responsibilities brought onto family members. For each young fatality, many relatives and friends are affected with a wide range of emotional and socioeconomic consequences. Parents report that grief is more overwhelming during the first few years and never disappears, while over the years they slowly learn to cope with it. Here we especially highlight the role of traffic authorities and what professional actors can do to meet the bereaved with empathy and minimize negative effects.","671":"","672":"The study investigated the traumatic impact of the Dana 2012 plane crash in Lagos, Nigeria. Using a cross-sectional survey, the roles of quality of life (QoL) and impact of event were examined against death anxiety of the proximate inhabitants of the crash site. Result showed significant influence of QoL on death anxiety, with higher QoL participants manifesting higher levels of death anxiety. However, impact of the crash event and demographic indicators such as age, sex, pilot preference, and belief-in-life after death did not influence death anxiety of participants. It can be concluded from these results that the perception of higher QoL has a profound influence on death anxiety of people reminiscing mortality reminders no matter their age, sex, beliefs, and life preferences. It is recommended that anxious death-related experiences be prevented in all spheres of life in pursuit of safety and sound mental health of the people.","673":null,"674":"Long and complicated grief is a relevant factor contributing to the deterioration of the older adults' later life quality. In China, the unintentional consequence of the one-child policy has emerged. There, the group of older adults who lost their only child is called shiduers. The current study compared 42 older adults who lost their only child to 33 older adults who have a child, in term of their physical and mental health, and social support. The results confirmed the general deteriorating trend in those aspects of the bereaved Chinese parents' life after their only child's death. The results also revealed the impairments on the shiduers' physical, mental, and social aspects were significant, compared to the clinical diagnosis cutoff points used in Western countries. Unique policy and cultural characteristics are the main factors contributing to the severe impairment of shiduers. Results have implications for policy advocacy and practice intervention in specific cultural environments.","675":"Despite the fact that a large number of people are bereaved by suicide each year, the experiences of those bereaved by suicide are poorly understood. It has been suggested that a contributing factor in relation to this lack of understanding has been the use of quantitative methods, which may not be sensitive to the bereavement process and its thematic content. Therefore, the current article outlines a systematic review of 11 qualitative studies that address issues related to the bereavement process following suicide. The results indicate that those bereaved by suicide encounter a range of difficult feelings following suicide including blame, guilt, and emptiness and that these feelings are affected by participants' ability to make meaning of the event. The meaning-making process is a complex one that occurs within a difficult social context in which both those bereaved by suicide and members of the wider community struggle to interact with each other in a beneficial way. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","676":"Science and practice seem deeply stuck in the so-called stage theory of grief. Health-care professionals continue to \"prescribe\" stages. Basically, this perspective endorses the idea that bereaved people go through a set pattern of specific reactions over time following the death of a loved one. It has frequently been interpreted prescriptively, as a progression that bereaved persons must follow in order to adapt to loss. It is of paramount importance to assess stage theory, not least in view of the current status of the maladaptive \"persistent complex bereavement-related disorder\" as a category for further research in DSM-5. We therefore review the status and value of this approach. It has remained hugely influential among researchers as well as practitioners across recent decades, but there has also been forceful opposition. Major concerns include the absence of sound empirical evidence, conceptual clarity, or explanatory potential. It lacks practical utility for the design or allocation of treatment services, and it does not help identification of those at risk or with complications in the grieving process. Most disturbingly, the expectation that bereaved persons will, even should, go through stages of grieving can be harmful to those who do not. Following such lines of reasoning, we argue that stage theory should be discarded by all concerned (including bereaved persons themselves); at best, it should be relegated to the realms of history. There are alternative models that better represent grieving processes. We develop guidelines to enhance such a move beyond the stage approach in both theory and practice.","677":"Losing a parent prior to age 18 years can have life-long implications. The challenges of emerging adulthood may be even more difficult for parentally bereaved college students, and studying their coping responses is crucial for designing campus services and therapy interventions. This study examined the relationships between bereavement-related distress, experiential avoidance (EA), values, and resilience. Findings indicated that EA and low importance of values were correlated with bereavement difficulties, with EA accounting for 26% of the variance in the bereavement distress measure. In addition, reports of behaving consistently with values accounted for 20% of the variance in the resiliency measure. Contrary to hypotheses and previous literature, there were no significant relationships between the measures of EA and values. The results, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.","678":"This qualitative study examined the experience of grandparent death among 74 emerging adults enrolled in college. Guided by the life course perspective, the authors specifically explored (a) participant responses to the death, (b) how family systems were influenced by the loss of the grandparent, and (c) how grandparent death motivated life course transitions for emerging adults. The findings suggest that the death trajectory, level of attachment, the role the grandchild played in the family, as well as the coping style utilized affected participants' grief processes. This study underscores the importance of the grandchild-grandparent tie, how new death experiences create meaning and ritual, and how life course transitions are motivated when an older family member dies. Implications for providing support on college campuses when emerging adults experience grandparent death are highlighted.","679":"This article reviews the concept of postmortem identity, noting its relationships to other concepts such as relational trauma. Identity is a very fluid concept that can change even after an individual's death as new information becomes available or even as social values change. Such modifications of postmortem identity can affect the course of bereavement-complication reactions to loss.","680":"In a help relation with a suicidal person, the theoretical models of suicidality can be essential to guide the health professional's comprehension of the client\/patient. The objectives of this study were to identify health professionals' explanations of suicidal behaviors and to study the effects of professional group, theoretical intervention models, and patient suicide experience in professionals' representations. Two hundred and forty-two health professionals filled out a self-report questionnaire. Exploratory principal components analysis was used. Five explanatory models were identified: psychological suffering, affective cognitive, sociocommunicational, adverse life events, and psychopathological. Results indicated that the psychological suffering and psychopathological models were the most valued by the professionals, while the sociocommunicational was seen as the least likely to explain suicidal behavior. Differences between professional groups were found. We concluded that training and reflection on theoretical models in general and in communicative issues in particular are needed in the education of health professionals.","681":"The current study examined Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) experienced by bereaved pet owners in the United States, French-Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong following the death of their pet. Using qualitative methodology, we analyzed responses of participants who answered \"yes\" to a question about experiencing PTG and explored to what extent the cross-cultural responses mapped onto the five factors of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). For the U.S. sample, 58% of responses mapped onto the PTGI. For French-Canada, 72% of responses mapped onto the PTGI. For Japan, 50% of responses mapped onto the PTGI and for Hong Kong, 39% of responses mapped onto the PTGI. We also explored emergent categories related to PTG for individuals who have lost a pet and discerned the unique aspects for PTG across cultures.","682":"By employing the phenomenographic approach, the present study explored children's cognitive understanding of and emotional responses to death and bereavement. Participants included 52 Korean, 16 Chinese, and 16 Chinese American children ages 5-6. Thematic analysis of children's drawings and open-ended interviews revealed that most children associated death with negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, and sadness. The majority of children used realistic expressions to narrate death. The core themes from their drawings included causes for death, attempts to stop the dying, and situations after death. This study contributes to the literature by targeting young children who have been relatively excluded in death studies and provides evidence in the usefulness of drawings as a developmentally appropriate data collection tool. The findings also enrich our knowledge about children's understanding of death and bereavement, rooted in the inductive analysis of empirical data with children from culturally diverse backgrounds.","683":null,"684":"The experience of same-sex-attracted people who have lost a partner is neglected in the existing literature on bereavement. Previous research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and questioning (LGBTIQ) populations tends to focus on the loss of a partner to HIV-related causes, and there is scant research concerning non-HIV-related bereavement. The purpose of this article is to investigate the non-HIV-related bereavement experiences of same-sex partners and to address the potential complications of disenfranchised grief. Coping with the loss of a same-sex partner and the impact of bereavement on subsequent relationships are also discussed. Implications for counseling of bereaved same-sex-attracted individuals are drawn, and recommendations for future psychological research on the experience of bereavement are made.","685":"The new technologies have changed the rituals related to death: Creation of memorial webpages and of virtual tombs, celebration of death anniversaries are now common currency on the Internet. In spite of their disappearance among the living, the deceased continue to exist on the Web. They still receive messages from their relatives but also from strangers and are at the heart of discussions, prolonging their presence. New technologies have led to a new concept of time and of \"where life ends.\" Through the analysis of Facebook's accounts devoted to Turkish martyrs, this article aimed to describe the new funeral rituals seen on the Internet.","686":null,"687":"Grief and loss are universal experiences for all individuals and communities. The experience of a loss due to death and the bereavement process to follow are influenced by an individual's religious values and beliefs. In this article, we discuss the Sikh bereavement process in the United States.

Finally, we discuss implications for mental health clinicians and other providers of services that surround death and dying.","688":null,"689":null,"690":"This study aimed to explore the experiences, responses, and conceptualizations of sense of presence experiences in bereavement in terms of family meaning-making. A case study framework was chosen, using group and individual interviews and ethnographically derived observations in a father-bereaved family in the south of England. Interview data were analyzed by applying both phenomenological and social constructionist perspectives to the same data set. It was observed that there was a division between the mother, who had derived much personal benefit from sense of presence experiences, and the children, who dismissed the experiences as incompatible with their own worldviews and how they made sense of their father's death.","691":null,"692":"Advance care planning (ACP) is a critical part of long-term health-care planning, as no one knows when the ability to make personal medical decisions may be impaired. Many assume ACP is only necessary for older adults or those with life-threatening health conditions; however, there are growing discussions about healthy, young adults also engaging in ACP, as they too suffer from unexpected medical events that limit their ability to make medical decisions. The current study examined the reactions of college students following the completion of their advance care plans and then sharing these plans with friends and family. The students reported that while completing their advance care plans created many emotions, they found the experience to be valuable and facilitated conversations with family and friends about end-of-life care that may not have occurred otherwise.","693":"In spite of growing bereavement literature, the meaning of the lived experience of parental bereavement is not well understood. This article presents selected findings from a Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological study which aimed to describe the lived experience of bereaved parents who experienced the death of a child due to cancer. Conversational interviews were conducted with six parents who experienced the death of a young child due to cancer at least one year prior to participation. The nature of parental bereavement was revealed to be a new state of being into which parents enter immediately after the death of a child and which has no end point. Findings will equip health professionals and others who work with bereaved parents with a deeper understanding of the meaning of parental bereavement.","694":"In a sample of 419 college students, intrinsic religiosity scores, but not extrinsic religiosity scores, contributed significantly to the prediction of current suicidal ideation. Religiosity was a protective factor for suicidal ideation in women but not in men and in European American students but not in African American students. The assessment of suicidal risk, therefore, may require different sets of scales depending on the sex and ethnicity of the client.","695":"This study examined the concept of and attitudes toward death of university students and evaluated the efficacy of the death education courses offered by different universities in Hong Kong. The study adopted a pretreatment and posttreatment comparison approach in assessing the efficacy of the courses. The same set of instruments, Death Attitude Profile-Revised and Semantic Differential Ratings of Life and Death, measuring students' views of and attitudes toward death were administered to the students twice, once at the start of the courses and another at the end. Results of the pretreatment survey also served to depict the current state of students' views and attitudes. The target students comprised two groups: those taking the relevant courses and those not; this latter group served as a comparison group in assessing the treatment group's behavior. The achieved sample included 368 students who responded to both the pre- and posttreatment surveys, of which 134 had attended the relevant courses. The results indicated that the students had a more negative views on death as compared with that of life. Findings also suggested that the death education courses had significant and positive impact on the students, that is, viewing death more positively than before, having less fear and avoidance confronting death. However, the impact differed depending on the gender as well as death experience of the student.","696":"We concluded in a recent study that a \"one size fits all\" approach typical of group interventions often does not adequately accommodate the range of situations, life experiences, and current needs of participants. We describe how this limitation informed the design and implementation of an individually-delivered intervention format more specifically tailored to the unique needs of each bereaved person. The intervention comprises one of three interrelated studies within Partners in Hospice Care (PHC), which examines the trajectory from end-of-life care through bereavement among cancer caregivers using hospice. The PHC intervention employs an initial needs assessment in order to tailor the session content, delivery, and sequencing to the most pressing, yet highly diverse needs of the bereaved spouses\/partners. Although an individually-delivered format has its own challenges, these can be effectively addressed through standardized interventionist training, regular communication among staff, as well as a flexible approach toward participants' preferences and circumstances.","697":"Human services professionals will undoubtedly work with the dying and bereaved populations at one time or other. Yet, they are poorly prepared to do so since death education, that is, lessons about the human and emotional aspects of death, its implications, and subsequent bereavement issues, is often not part of their curriculum. This nonequivalent comparison group study (N = 86) examined death fear and death anxiety among human services students before and after receiving death education using the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale. The results showed a statistically significant decrease in death anxiety among the group of students who participated in death education compared to those who did not.","698":"This is the first systematic review of the evidence on the prevalence of self-blame, guilt, and shame in bereaved parents. A search of PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed, and Science Direct resulted in 18 studies for the period 1975 to 2013 which the authors have appraised. Self-blame, guilt, and shame are common in bereaved parents, albeit to varying degrees, with differential relationships to sex, and diminishing over time. There is some evidence that guilt and shame predict more intense grief reactions and that self-blame predicts posttraumatic symptomology, anxiety, and depression in bereaved parents. Heterogeneity of the studies and numerous methodological concerns limit the synthesis and strength of the evidence and the generalizability of the findings. Self-blame, guilt, and shame are commonly experienced by bereaved parents. Awareness of these affective states may assist clinicians in the identification of bereaved parents who are at a higher risk of developing adverse psychological outcomes. Overall, self-blame, guilt, and shame have received very little attention in the bereavement research, leaving many unanswered questions. Implications for practice and recommendations for future research are discussed.","699":"Two studies examined African Americans essays on coping with violent and nonviolent death and fading affect bias. Essays from 101 African Americans were coded for psychological resolution (resolved or unresolved) and for type of death (violent or nonviolent). Linguistic analyses were used to examine the experience of loss and coping methods. Religious coping was important for nonviolent death events while social support and emotion (e.g., crying) were themes that emerged for violent death events. For unresolved violent death events, dissociation was a common theme. The perceived change in the emotional intensity of the events was examined and revealed that the negative emotion showed evidence of substantial fading. Overall, these results suggest religious coping, social support and sharing enhance coping among African American participants. These processes can help negative affect associated with death events fade, allowing for psychological resolution, healing, and resilience.","700":"Criminal death incidence of women varies between developed and developing countries, and it has become a common public problem in almost every country. We do not have any data about femicide cases published in Turkey until today. In our study, we tried to call attention to femicide cases. In our study, we evaluated 141 cases of female homicides with an interval of 10 years between January 1996 and May 2005, retrospectively. Data retrieved were statistically evaluated using chi-square test. Most of the cases were between 21 and 35 years of age. Spouse murders are usually witnessed during the process of divorce. Establishment of institutions which will ensure the security of women during this period is of paramount importance. If we protect women during divorce and separation proceedings, we can prevent femicide cases. We also think that laws may be strengthened for protecting women who are vulnerable at such times.","701":"Ms B's in United Kingdom and Ms P's in Finland choices in life when dealing with acute ventilator-assisted tetraplegia were analyzed by means of Viktor E. Frankl's existential analysis\/logotherapy. The freedom of will to existential meaning and to worth in one's suffering realizes in the attitudinal change the person chooses or is forced to adopt when subject to severe circumstances. Life becomes existentially meaningful relative to inescapable suffering by the completion of three values: creative, experiential, and attitudinal values. If the search for meaning on these paths is frustrated or obstructed, a person's will to meaning transforms into existential frustration along with an existential vacuum and feelings of despair emerge and harm the person's will to survive. However, a person's frustrated meaning in life, when subject to unavoidable severe conditions, can be averted and redirected by applying the basic tenets in an existential analytic\/logotherapeutic approach to the extreme situation.","702":"Kastenbaum and Aisenberg have suggested that persons can cope with the impact of death and dying by altering their understanding of what each means to them as well as by changing their behavioral responses to such experiences. The present study's purpose was to develop a reliable and valid measure to assess an individual's particular death perspective based on Kastenbaum and Aisenberg's distinctions between overcomers and participators. The Death Perspective Scale developed here assessed the extent to which individuals utilize either an overcoming or participating approach to (a) assigning meaning to dying and death and (b) behaviorally responding to death-related experiences. Based upon the data collected from 168 adults varying by age and gender, findings suggested that both overcoming and participating could be reliably assessed, correlated with measures of death anxiety and death attitudes, and varied reliably (p &lt; .05) by age and gender, wherein such differences were for the most part consistent with predictions by Kastenbaum and Aisenberg espoused over 30 years ago. Findings here suggested that overcomers reported more fear of death and dying and were less accepting in this respect, while participators reported fewer death-related fears and were more accepting. Women and older adults were more participating, while men and younger adults were more overcoming, though such effects varied depending upon whether meaning versus response to death was considered. The consistency between the present findings and the predictions Kastenbaum and Aisenberg suggests that while person's orientations to death and dying seem to transcend sociocultural change, empirically based efforts to better understand how our death system impacts persons need to move forward.","703":"This study aimed to explore how the life history of suicide victims with no history of treatment in mental health care or of attempted suicide seemed to presdispose them to maladaptive perfectionism. The study is part of an ongoing psychological autopsy study. It aimed to produce a phenomenological understanding of the vulnerability to suicide related to perfectionism, based on the life history of six male suicide victims aged 22 to 58. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyze the interview data of 41 key informants. Three main themes emerged: (a) exposure to high expectations combined with little recognition and warmth; (b) reduced ability to cope with failures and weaknesses; and (c) fear of emotional rejection. Together these themes illustrate that feelings of shame, mainly resulting from an unfulfilled need for attachment, a desire for love and recognition may relate to maladaptive perfectionism, which influences the suicidal process. The results may have important implications for suicide prevention programs.","704":"Disease-directed therapy near death is a growing trend among persons living with late-stage cancer. As a sociocultural phenomenon, cancer-directed therapy (e.g., chemotherapy) when given for very advanced disease is a process that offers questionable benefits and portends further suffering, but also suggests potential for growth and transcendence. Theories and concepts drawn from cultural anthropology, sociology, and existentialism illustrate how contextual factors contribute to the creation of a \"liminal space\"; the latter part of the cancer trajectory where living and dying can overlap. When applied to clinical practice, this theoretical framework gives the patient, family, and health care provider a way of \"unmasking\" a period of transition during terminal illness when aggressive disease-directed care continues to be provided. The liminal space may function as an existential plane; a gateway or threshold with inherent potential for psychospiritual development during the final stage of life.","705":"This study investigated Japanese undergraduates' attitudes toward a fellow student whose parent has died by suicide. One hundred thirty-four participants responded to four versions of a brief fictional case describing a male undergraduate whose father had died. These presented fictional cases described the cause of the death as being suicide, cancer, AIDS, or murder. Results indicated that participants had more negative attitudes toward the suicide survivor student than the nonstigmatized death (cancer) survivor. Further, results indicated that participants viewed suicide survivors as more to blame for the death and had a more negative image of them than of the other stigmatized death (AIDS and murder) survivors.","706":"Since the borders between natural life and death have been blurred by technique, in Western societies discussions and practices regarding death have became infinite. The studies in this area include all the most important topics of psychology, sociology, and philosophy. From a psychological point of view, the research has created many instruments for measuring death anxiety, fear, threat, depression, meaning of life, and among them, the profiles on death attitude are innumerable. This research presents the validation of a new attitude scale, which conjoins psychological dimensions and philosophical ones. This scale may be useful because the ontological idea of death has not yet been considered in research. The hypothesis is that it is different to believe that death is absolute annihilation than to be sure that it is a passage or a transformation of one's personal identity. The hypothetical difference results in a greater inner suffering caused by the former idea. In order to measure this possibility, we analyzed the correlation between Testoni Death Representation Scale and Beck Hopelessness Scale, Suicide Resilience Inventory-25, and Reasons for Living Inventory. The results confirm the hypothesis, showing that the representation of death as total annihilation is positively correlated to hopelessness and negatively correlated to resilience.","707":"Fifty thousand children die annually in the United States. No best practice standard exists regarding what services should be offered by children's hospitals to grieving families. We sought to identify the bereavement services most commonly offered, the departments primarily responsible for their dissemination, whether resources differ based on the patient's diagnosis or place of death, and whether the services offered are adequate. A 13-item anonymous online survey was emailed to 201 pediatric chaplains using the Pediatric Chaplains Network email list. Seventy respondents (34.8%) participated. Respondents described offering a variety of resources, but 47.8% of respondents believe the resources provided are not adequate. Increased staff and financial resources, and more consistency in services provided, were cited as needing improvement. The breadth and depth of bereavement services varies among children's hospitals. More studies are warranted to define the optimal approach to care for families grieving the loss of a child.","708":"Although several studies have looked at the phenomenon of online memorialization, online involvement of those bereaved by suicide (suicide survivors) remains an under-studied area. The current study analyzed 250 memorials dedicated to those who died by suicide on two memorialization Web sites: Faces of Suicide and Gone too Soon. The majority of the memorials was posted by family members of the deceased and had a format of a letter or an obituary. Though the memorials were written for both males and females of all ages, 80% of the messages were written for young males. Fourteen themes were identified, ranging from sadness and expressions of love and other grief reactions of the bereaved, to acknowledgment of suicide and search for reasons for the death. Some of the bereaved wrote about their motives for posting an online memorial. Future studies should determine the impact of involvement in online memorialization on the grief process of suicide survivors.","709":"In order to evaluate the role of cause of death on the grief responses of parentally bereaved young and middle-aged adults, 400 individuals completed measures assessing their experiences and feelings surrounding the loss of a parent. Respondents included 247 young adults and 155 middle-aged adults. Cause of death was categorized as acute or anticipated with 209 participants reporting the parent's death as acute, while anticipated death was reported by 191 individuals. Results suggested that gender of the adult child and age level of the participant were important factors contributing to the grief response, and women were found to have more difficulty adjusting to the loss of a parent as well as demonstrating a more intense grief response. Young adults were found to be more impacted by the loss of a parent than were middle-aged adults. Those who were single or separated were similarly more impacted versus those who were married, where more young adults were single\/separated and more middle-aged adults were married. Cause of death was only mildly influential in influencing responses to parental loss and did not interact with other studied variables. These results point to the importance of support from others in coping with a parent's death as well as for the counseling of bereaved persons who may be at risk for difficulties in coping with the death of a parent and enable a more precise understanding of individual grief processes across the adult lifespan.","710":"A philosophical hermeneutic study was conducted as part of the first author's doctoral research to understand the meaning of children's cancer camps for the child with cancer and the family. Twenty family members from six families were interviewed in order to bring understanding to this topic. This article will detail the finding related to the experience of grief that often accompanies a cancer diagnosis, and how camp seems to allow children and families to understand their grief differently. The interesting thing about this particular cancer camp is that families of children who have died continue to attend the camp yearly, and there are events to memorialize the many children known to all the campers who no longer attend camp. This is not a grief camp but a cancer camp where grief is allowed presence as it necessarily has to in the world of childhood cancer.","711":"A dataset of 73 variables was complied on 345 serial killers, 31 of whom who engaged in cannibalism. A distinction was made between those who engaged only in cannibalism, those who engaged in necrophilia, and those who engaged in both or neither. Those who engaged in both cannibalism and necrophilia were the most psychiatrically disturbed and deviant, but those who engaged in only cannibalism were more disturbed and deviant in their actions than those who engaged in neither behavior.","712":"Disenfranchised grief is experienced when a mourner's grief response is socially invalidated, unacknowledged, or discouraged. When the circumstances of death or the emotional reactions of the griever violate social norms, empathic failures can occur within the bereaved individual's support systems. This study used conventional content analysis, an intensive and inductive qualitative research method, to analyze the experience of one African American woman who lost her only son to homicide, a particularly distressing and marginalized form of loss. Results elucidate both the empathic failings and resiliencies within the social systems of this griever and emerged from the perspectives offered by the bereaved mother and her primary supporter. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.","713":"While end-of-life issues are increasingly gaining more attention, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) continue to receive significantly less consideration in research, education, and clinical practice compared with the general population. This is a growing concern especially since the sheer number of persons aging with IDD is expected to double in the next 17 years. Furthermore, policies are shifting to reflect a preference for home and community-based services as an alternative to institutionalization, and it becomes evident that adult day services (ADS) may be ideal settings for receipt of end-of-life care, especially among individuals with IDD. However, end-of-life care and advance planning most commonly occur in long-term care settings for the general population and have historically been less of a priority in ADS and residential services for people with IDD. This article discusses the attitudes of, and collaboration between, ADS and end-of-life providers for aging adults including persons with IDD and explores how ADS may be a great pathway for delivering end-of-life care to the IDD population. Implications and recommendations will also be examined.","714":"We investigated the relationships of grief and depression to cancer caregiving in early bereavement. We began with three expectations: (a) each outcome would reflect different situational predictors, (b) grief would be more directly related to such predictors, and (c) components of grief would relate differently to the caregiving context and depressed mood. We conducted telephone interviews with family caregivers of incurable cancer patients from two hospitals. A total of 199 family caregivers were interviewed at the time of the patient's diagnosis and reinterviewed 3 months after the patient's death. Results showed grief severity was predicted by caregiving circumstances, but bereavement depressed mood was largely unrelated to caregiving. Grief was the main predictor of depressed mood and mediated almost all other effects. We conclude that while grief may trigger depression, the dissimilar connection to context means that the two emotional states should not be equated based purely on similarity of expression.","715":"For each of eight literature-identified conceptual dimensions of mortality awareness, questionnaire items were generated, producing 89 in all. A total of 359 participants responded to these items and to questionnaires measuring health attitudes, risk taking, rebelliousness, and demographic variables. Multivariate correlational analyses investigated the underlying structure of the item pool and the construct validity as well as the reliability of the emergent empirically derived subscales. Five components, rather than eight, were identified. Given the item content of each, the associated mortality awareness subscales were labeled as legacy, fearfulness, acceptance, disempowerment, and disengagement. Each attained an acceptable level of internal reliability. Relationships with other variables supported the construct validity of these empirically derived subscales and more generally of this five-factor model. In conclusion, this new multidimensional measure and model of mortality awareness extends our understanding of this important aspect of human existence and supports a more integrative and optimistic approach to mortality awareness than previously available.","716":"Three principles that guide the bioethics movement in the United States and other Western societies apply to the approaches of death and dying in both the United States and Turkey. These three principles, Autonomy, Beneficence, and justice, are reflected in the practices of people in both countries. The issue of autonomy is of greater concern to those in the United States, while decisions are made entirely with family and physician involvement in Turkey. Beneficence and Justice can be identified as ethical issues in both countries. Similarities with end-of-life experiences are linked by faith-based beliefs of Islam and Christianity. Differences in sociocultural influences, such as policies about advance directives in the United States, account for differences in end-of-life decision making. This article examines the spiritual, cultural, legal, and political factors that inform the experience of people in Turkey and in the United States when death is at hand.","717":"This study reports the development of a measurement scale, The Nurses' Involvement in Patients' Dying and Death Scale (NIPDYDS), which fully captures the experiences of nurses caring for patients' dying and death. Potential items were extracted from narrative data gathered systematically and comprehensively from in-depth interviews with nurses engaged in caring for patients' dying and death. Factor analyses revealed four factors, consisting of 40 total items, with two factors related to the positive aspects of the experience (Deep involvement in facing dying and death and Increased competence in facing dying and death) and two factors related to the negative aspects of the experience (Uncertainty and difficulty dealing with dying and death and Accustomed to dying and death). Validity and reliability of the scale were found to be acceptable. The factorial structure of the NIPDYDS was contrasted to Frommelt's (1991) FATCOD (The Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale), and the usefulness and limitations of the NIPDYDS were discussed.","718":"This study investigated the level of support for voluntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia under three conditions of suffering (pain; debilitated nature of the body; burden on the family) experienced by oneself, a significant other, and a person in general. The sample consisted of 1,897 Thai adults (719 males, 1,178 females) who voluntarily filled in the study's questionnaire. Initial multivariate analysis of variance indicated significant group (oneself, significant other, person in general) differences in level of support for voluntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia and under the three conditions of suffering. Multigroup path analysis conducted on the posited euthanasia model showed that the three conditions of suffering exerted differential direct and indirect influences on the support of voluntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia as a function of the identity of the person for whom euthanasia was being considered. The implications of these findings are discussed.","719":"Nurses' attitudes toward caring for dying patients have an impact on the quality of the care provided. Education can improve knowledge and attitudes toward end-of-life care. No validated tool that measures such attitudes is available for Italian nursing students. The aim of this study was to translate the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale (FATCOD) Form B from English into Italian and to establish its validity and reliability within an Italian population of students. A two-stage design was used. Stage I adapted the original version of the tool and tested it for content validity through a multistep process. Stage 2 tested its psychometric properties by analyzing internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity. The convenience sample consisted of 465 nursing students from all the universities of one Italian region. Measures of stability showed a very good overall (0.87) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The discriminating capacity of the scale was adequate with good values of asymmetry and kurtosis for most of the items. Good internal consistency was found. The six factors derived from the factor analysis are the following: Fear\/Malaise, Communication, Relationship, Care of the family, Family as Caring, and Active Care. FATCOD Form B-I is a valid, reliable, and acceptable tool for evaluation of attitudes toward end-of-life care in Italian students. It measures six specific dimensions that should be highlighted during health care student education and training.","720":"This study explores the socio-cultural perception of death among Turkish people. For this reason, 210 published lament epics written by Turkish folk singers across all of Turkey concerning deaths between 1955 and 1975 were selected for analysis. These epics were published on single pages and were sold. The statistical analysis based on detailed content analysis was done at the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels. The results of the study provide a full picture of perception of cases of death in Turkish society. These results show Turkish society is especially sensitive to cases of death at young age and to the murdered. Further, a clear perception of the working of fate is encountered in deaths resulting from disaster and accidents; but the desire for vengeance is recorded in those laments concerning martyrs and the murdered. The statistical data show that most commonly cited reasons for death after road accidents, were a consequence of relationships with the opposite sex and from a sense of honor. ","721":"To test the psychometric properties of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) among Chinese high school students. The reliability and validity of SIQ were analyzed with data of 505 high school students in Jinan, China. The Cronbach's coefficient alpha of SIQ was above 0.95 and the Cronbach's coefficients alphas of SIQ when each item was deleted were relatively stable. The convergent validity analyses showed that there were statistically significant correlations between SIQ total scores and DSD total scores by gender. Exploratory factor analysis produced four factors of SIQ. The SIQ has a high level of reliability and validity and should be a reliable measure for suicide ideation in Chinese high school students. ","722":"Unresolved, complicated, prolonged, or traumatic grief can have detrimental effects on mental and\/or physical health. The effects of traditional grief counseling, with its focus on the client's acceptance of separation and integration of loss, are unclear. Within the model of continuing bonds, however, grief resolution includes an ongoing relationship between the living and the deceased. Spontaneous and induced experiences of after-death communication (ADC) have been shown to be beneficial in the resolution of grief by demonstrating these continued bonds. Presently, many bereaved individuals are experiencing assisted ADCs by receiving readings from psychic mediums and though little is known about the effects of this selfprescribed treatment option, anecdotal reports and exploratory data posit a positive outcome. This article aims to inform those who work with the bereaved about the relationships between grief, spontaneous, induced, and assisted ADC experiences, and the continuing bonds paradigm. Suggestions for future research are also included. ","723":"This study investigated mothers' experiences surrounding stillbirth in the United Kingdom, their memory making and sharing opportunities, and the effect these opportunities had on them. Qualitative data were generated from free text responses to open-ended questions. Thematic content analysis revealed that \"stigma\" was experienced by most women and Goffman's (1963) work on stigma was subsequently used as an analytical framework. Results suggest that stillbirth can spoil the identities of \"patient,\" \"mother,\" and \"full citizen.\" Stigma was reported as arising from interactions with professionals, family, friends, work colleagues, and even casual acquaintances. Stillbirth produces common learning experiences often requiring \"identity work\" (Murphy, 2012). Memory making and sharing may be important in this work and further research is needed. Stigma can reduce the memory sharing opportunities for women after stillbirth and this may explain some of the differential mental health effects of memory making after stillbirth that is documented in the literature. ","724":"The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of grief among American and Arab female undergraduate students, the effects of their grief, and risk of prolonged grief disorder. A total of 471 female undergraduate students, 308 (65.4%) from the United Arab Emirates and 163 (34.6%) from the United States, completed a survey about their grief experiences. Students experiencing a significant loss also completed the Prolonged Grief Disorder Questionnaire. Findings revealed that overall approximately 38.4% (n = 181) of all 471 students experienced the loss of a significant person in their lives within the past 24 months; a similar percentage was found in each sub group. Students reported various grief effects with American students experiencing more effects related to sleep, relationships, academics, physical well-being, religion\/spirituality, and outlook on life than Arab students. Only a small number (10, 5.52%) of students met the criteria for prolonged grief disorder; however, most students were female Arab students. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are provided.","725":"Caregivers are particularly vulnerable to experience intense levels of distress following the loss. The aim of this prospective pilot study is to determine the incidence of prolonged grief disorder symptoms among caregivers. A total of 73 bereaved families responded to the Prolonged Grief Disorder Evaluation Instrument (PG-13) at 6 and 12 months following their loss. The incidence of prolonged grief disorder at the first assessment was 28.8%, and it decreased to 15.1% at the second assessment. The prevalence of prolonged grief disorder declined significantly over time (p = .041). In the second evaluation, six bereaved individuals continued to meet criteria for a diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder, 15 remitted, and 4 new (incident) cases emerged. The important differences in values that occur after 12 months suggest time is important in distinguishing between those at risk for persistent distress and those whose grief symptomatology will decrease with time.","726":"This study examines the burgeoning phenomenon of Facebook memorial pages and how this research about online social networking environments can contribute to the existing literature related to Klass, Silverman, and Nickman (1996) continuing bonds thesis. I argue that memorial pages constitute a new ritualized and public space for maintaining these continued bonds and that individuals exhibit several types of bonding interactions with the deceased. I conducted a content analysis on a purposively selected sample of 12 public Facebook \"pages\" where I coded 1,270 individual Wall postings. Analyses demonstrated that many individuals routinely used these Walls to continue their relationships with the deceased. Findings revealed several Wall posting categories, \"guidance from beyond and reunion with the deceased,\" \"messages and visitations from the deceased,\" and \"conversations with the deceased,\" which I then combined under a central thematic heading of \"paranormal copresence.\" There were 267 Wall postings coded under \"guidance and reunion,\" 26 for \"messages and visitations,\" and 340 for \"conversations,\" with the total of 633 Wall postings under the central thematic heading of paranormal copresence. This research highlights how individuals have transcended the limitations of time and physical space in relation to traditional bereavement behavior and rituals and how data found on public websites, such as Facebook, can be used to further theorize bereavement and to demonstrate continue bonds between the living and the dead.","727":"This study investigates peer interaction and peer support for parentally bereaved children and adolescents. Using data from an extensive study of bereaved families in southeastern Michigan, previously transcribed semistructured interviews on peer relationships from a sample of 35 parentally bereaved children aged 6 to 15 were qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative method. This analysis explores peer interaction in the context of parental loss, revealing the nearly ubiquitous desire of bereaved children to be perceived as \"normal\" and maintain their social life as it was before the death, the avoidance of bereavement-related peer interaction, the nature of and possible reasons for the relative lack of peer support, deliberately hurtful peer behavior, the multiple functions of peer support, and the value of close friends in bereavement.","728":"The article sheds light on the way the author's scientific views and endeavors in the field of dying, death, and bereavement over 40 years in Germany have been influenced by the work of Robert Kastenbaum. Reconstructing the passage of time, the early years (i.e., the second half of the 1970s), a middle period (i.e., the 1980s and 1990s), and the later years (i.e., from the turn of the century to the present) are outlined. In an anecdotic fashion, two personal encounters with R. Kastenbaum are reported. The article concludes with showing\\consensus and dissention in various respects and finally recounts the author's admiration for this outstanding scholar. ","729":"T. S. Eliot's profound poetic insight says it all: \"We shall not cease from exploration\/And the end of all exploring\/Will be to arrive where we started\/And know the place for the first time.\" Nothing is static. Nothing is \"new,\" and yet \"knowing it for the first time\" as Eliot suggests, is the precious paradox that refutes the idea that we must break our bonds with the dead in order to heal. Long before the \"continuing bonds\" term was coined, the arts-literary, visual, musical-have been grappling with the ongoing relationships between the living and the dead. This article illuminates provocative examples of this communication from the expressive side of human nature and offers commentary intended to stimulate further observation and reflection. ","730":"In most times and places, the focus of continuing bonds is on the well-being and activity of the dead that are linked to the well-being and activity of the living. In this article we describe continuing bonds across cultures by focusing on the dead. Three relationships between the living and the dead organize our thinking. First, the family dead in which living and dead offer help to each other. Second, the hostile dead that threaten the well being of the living. Third, the political dead in which the living enlisting the dead in political conflicts, and the dead motivate the living to battle on their behalf. Shifting the focus this way allows us to see that continuing bonds play important roles in larger narratives as well as in individual and family narratives. ","731":"Robert Kastenbaum was a man who helped reintroduce issues related to death, dying, and bereavement to academic, clinical, and general discourse. This article, devoted to an encounter with the observance of mourning custom and ritual in the Jewish tradition, continues the dialogue in this journal that Bob founded. The article utilizes the Two-Track Model of Bereavement to address the Jewish tradition's structuring of the loss experience. After a brief introduction, I present a schematic presentation of some of the issues operant in grief and mourning for the believer. This is followed by two responses to loss that portray the pain of loss in the tradition. The article goes on to consider the Jewish time cycle of response to loss-from preburial Aninut, to Shiva, the first week, to Shloshim, the first month, to Shanah, the first year, to the expectations for encounters across the life cycle. The Yizkor and Kaddish are also considered. In the Jewish tradition, alongside attention to what level of functioning to require of the bereaved, there are lifelong opportunities to re-work and maintain connection to the memories, associations, narratives, and experiences that comprise the psychological organization of the continuing bond and relationship to the deceased.","732":"Kastenbaum's work had a strong developmental perspective. In fact, one of his first pieces explored the ways that adolescents experienced death. This article continues Kastenbaum's developmental perspective by considering the ways that a personal sense of mortality generally develops in adulthood as mid-life adults face the deaths of parents and peers as well as the inevitable signs of senescence. ","733":"End-of-life experiences go by various terms, including near-death experiences (NDEs), death bed visions, death bed phenomena, death bed coincidences, and nearing death awareness. Death bed escorts is the term applied to the vision of deceased family members or friends who inform the dying person that they will be accompanied in the transition from life. In this article, I examine the subject of NDEs and death bed escorts, starting with the rich body of work provided by Robert and Beatrice Kastenbaum. A subject of some interest to Robert Kastenbaum, he explored this frontier in his many writings on dying, death, and bereavement. Ever the pioneer and having made the ultimate transition, he may yet be exploring new frontiers.","734":"This article is a review of Robert Kastenbaum's 1979 essay entitled \"Healthy dying: A paradoxical quest continues.\" It begins with a summary of the arguments and challenges in the original essay. This is followed by an evaluation of his original claims in the light of contemporary insights in modern public health history and empirical studies of near-death experiences and death bed visions. The recent development of health promotion in palliative care is described in relation to these developments and Kastenbaum's early question about the paradoxical quest for health while dying is again posed against this background. Given our modern understanding of \"health\" in current global health policy and debates, it is argued that \"healthy dying\" is no paradox. Instead, the pursuit of health at the end of life represents a realistic modern desire to compress morbidity, minimize unnecessary suffering, and enhance quality of life at this time.","735":"This article reflects on the development and impact of the International Workgroup on Death, Dying and Bereavement's (IWG) pivotal document on The Assumptions and Principles Underlying Standards for Terminal Care. It was at the Ars Moriendi meetings in Columbia, Maryland that the author first met Bob and Bunny Kastenbaum. The meeting led to the development of IWG and the first task of this group was the development of the \"Standards\" document. The initial document reflected the pioneering work already being done by Kastenbaum and others on the committee and then was formative in the development of other documents such as the National Hospice Association Standards. Participants in the original workgroup were asked for their reflections on the significance of the document and the literature was surveyed to assess the impact of the \"Standards\" document on the field. ","736":"This article focuses on Robert Kastenbaum's seminal concept of the societal death system. Beginning with conflicting claims that America is a death-denying society versus a death-accepting society, the article reports Kastenbaum's definition and description of the death system in American society and sets forth the seven functions and five elements or components of that death system. Next, the article notes Kastenbaum's further claim that \"All cultures, past and present, have had death systems.\" Finally, two basic lessons are drawn from the foregoing: (1) Kastenbaum's concept of the death system provides a robust framework to explain the networks societies interpose between their members and death, focusing in particular on a more or less integrated and dynamic network within American society whose functions and components are not difficult to recognize in the ways in which they organize many aspects of the lives of individuals who live within that society; and (2) It is preposterous to assert without qualification that America is a death-denying society when there are so many activities and components within that society that are in whole or in part related to death, i.e., although it may be true that many aspects of the contemporary American death system appear to seek to remove death from the mainstream of life, there is ample evidence to indicate that American society as a whole and individuals within that society both accept and deny death simultaneously. ","737":"The three pieces in this section introduce the Festschrift celebrating the works and influence of Omega: Journal of Death and Dying's founding editor, Robert Kastenbaum. Robert Fulton, an early Associate Editor of the Journal begins with some personal reflections on Kastenbaum. Klass and Doka then describe the nature of the Festschrift. A closing coda by Robert Kastenbaum's wife, Beatrice Kastenbaum, reminds us of the person behind the work. ","738":"","739":"The death of a child can be an overwhelming experience for parents. Hospitals are often the first place to get information or to seek services, yet little is known about what types of bereavement services, information, or support are typically available. This study was designed to identify types of bereavement support offered to parents whose child died at a pediatric hospital, to ascertain who provides support and to see how those services are institutionally organized and funded. The investigation gathered data using an online, custom-designed survey completed by bereavement providers at 122 of the 188 pediatric hospitals invited to participate. This article summarizes the ways hospitals follow-up with families, from provision of educational materials to a menu of support services including memorial services, counseling, and community referrals. ","740":"The current systems of care for dying persons, the people caring for them, and the bereaved operate in ways that frequently lack sufficient sensitivity to their needs. We describe a new model for dying, death, and loss that adopts a public health approach. Specifically, we describe a deliberative process that resulted in a charter for a public health approach to dying, death, and loss. Modeled after the World Health Organization's 1986 Ottawa Charter, our charter includes a call to action. It has the potential to bring about significant change on local, societal, and global levels as exemplified by four projects from three countries. Public health and end-of-life services and organizations need to form partnerships with the community to develop a public health approach to dying, death, and loss. Learning from each other, they will affirm and enhance community beliefs and practices that make death part of life. ","741":null,"742":"The Hutterites are a closed ethnoreligious community whose funeral traditions have remained unchanged for centuries. Few researchers have had the opportunity to study this unique group. This study is an ethnographic exploration into the experience of child death and ritual on a Hutterite colony utilizing participant-observation and interviewing. Three recurrent themes emerged: ritual\/tradition, spirituality\/faith, and social cohesion and integration\/group identity. Observed rituals are situated within the broader framework. While some aspects of the response to death may resemble those of mainstream culture, a deeper evaluation of descriptive and structural specifics reveals some important differences. Most of the cultural contrast is contained in concrete social enactment of death rituals, shared identity, and the immutable faith in God at the center of the Hutterite mourning process. These factors may help account for the low rates of mental disorders seen among Hutterites, even following traumatic events, and would be worthy of further investigation. ","743":"The current cross-cultural study investigated grief reactions of bereaved individuals following the death of a pet. We used qualitative methodology to compare, analyze, and report responses of U.S. and French Canadian participants to the last open-ended question on our online pet loss survey. We explored the degree to which our data illustrated pet loss as disenfranchised grief and asked whether there are differences and commonalities in the expression of grief between the two samples. Four major themes emerged: lack of validation and support; intensity of loss; nature of the human pet relationship; and continuing bonds. Findings confirm that, for both the U.S. and French Canadian participants, pet loss is often disenfranchised grief and there are ways to facilitate expressions of grief. Many participants wrote that the survey was therapeutic. Our survey allowed participants to express their grief in an anonymous, safe way by serving as empathic bridging and a willingness to help others. ","744":"The present study aimed to determine attribution of mental disorders in suicide occurrence. By a cross-sectional study, all suicide records (n = 5188), between 1993 and 2009 in Ilam province, were investigated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was adopted. Totally, 27.5% of the suicides occurred due to mental disorders. This was significantly higher in males (29.3%), individuals born in 1996 (44%) and 1990s (30.3%), those aged 30 years and above (33.2%) and suicide attempters (28.3%), respectively and separately. The risk of suicide due to mental disorders was observed for females (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.74-0.97), those born in 1994 (OR = 2.82, CI = 1.27-6.24), completed suicides (OR = 0.81, CI = 0.68-0.97) and the age group 25 to 29 years old (OR = 0.82, CI = 0.66-1.01). Suicide due to mental disorders was higher among males compared to females, the rate of which was directly proportional to attempted suicide and age. It is therefore recommended that health educations be seriously carried on targeted groups. ","745":"The anniversary of the loss of a loved one is known to induce negative emotions, which for some can be significant. The present study examined the incidence of suicide around the time of such anniversaries using data from the Queensland Suicide Register for the years 1998 to 2008. There were statistically significant increases in suicide events immediately after the loss of a loved one and around the anniversary of the loss. Limitations of the study are noted. ","746":"Increasingly, individuals are bonding and maintaining relationships online. These digital representations of ourselves allow us to connect with others in ways previously not possible. One behavior that is growing in online presentations of self is grieving after the death of an individual in our social network. This work investigates the outcomes of online grieving from a transcorporeal communication model perspective, and draws conclusions on the outcomes of online grief behaviors. ","747":"Research suggests that older Blacks tend to prefer more aggressive treatment as they transition toward the end of life. African and Afro-Caribbean immigrants and their offspring are the fastest growing segments of the Black population in the United States. With the increasing population of Black older adults, the cost of end-of-life care is rising. This article presents a review of the literature on the end-of-life preferences of Afro-Caribbean older adults. Findings suggest that Afro-Caribbean older adults make end-of-life decisions with a significant emphasis on family structure, religion\/spirituality, cultural identity, migration, and communication. Concerns regarding the meaning of end-of-life preparation and hospice are often viewed in ways that differ from that of healthcare providers. Future research is needed to investigate this process in the Afro-Caribbean older adult subset. ","748":"Terror Management Theory has been utilized to understand how death can change behavioral outcomes and social dynamics. One area that is not well researched is why individuals willingly engage in risky behavior that could accelerate their mortality. One method of distancing a potential life threatening outcome when engaging in risky behaviors is through stacking probability in favor of the event not occurring, termed probabilistic thinking. The present study examines the creation and psychometric properties of the Probabilistic Thinking scale in a sample of young, middle aged, and older adults (n = 472). The scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency reliability for each of the four subscales, excellent overall internal consistency, and good construct validity regarding relationships with measures of death anxiety. Reliable age and gender effects in probabilistic thinking were also observed. The relationship of probabilistic thinking as part of a cultural buffer against death anxiety is discussed, as well as its implications for Terror Management research. ","749":"This article, a qualitative exploration of the experiences of subsequent children, endeavors to clarify common issues and experiences of this population. Subsequent children, also known as subsequent siblings, are children born after the death of a brother or sister. For this study, 25 adult subsequent siblings participated in semi-structured interviews. Few researchers have written about this population, and much of what has been documented was researched from single case studies, or from very small samples. This study aims to explore the commonalities of the unique experience of being a subsequent child. Themes which emerged include various replacement child dynamics, impaired bonding with parents or altered parenting as a result of the loss, family grief and its repercussions, meaning making and spiritual questioning, fantasies about the lost sibling, disenfranchised and unresolved grief, taking on a caregiver role, and survivor guilt. The implications for clinical practice are presented. ","750":"The wish to die in older people who are tired of living and the possibilities to organize death are currently being discussed within the debate on self-determination and physician-assisted suicide. Until now insight into the experiences and thoughts of people who are tired of life but not suffering from a severe depression or a life-threatening disease is lacking. Studies focussing specifically on this topic are rare. This review provides an overview of this research area in its infancy. The existential impact of age-related loss experiences play an important role in developing a wish to die. Other influencing factors are: personal characteristics, biographical factors, social context, perceptions and values. Further research to experiences and motivations underlying these specific age-related wishes to die and the existential impact of the loss-experiences seems necessary to deepen the understanding of this group of older people and for the development of policy and good care. ","751":"In his works, Caligula and L'Etranger, Albert Camus created two characters, Caligula and Meursault, who rejected the possibility of their mortality. They considered themselves immortal. In accordance with Freud's argument in \"Our Attitude Towards Death,\" their unconscious denied their death. ","752":"This study sought to explore the phenomenon of peer counseling in suicide bereavement by addressing the question, what are the lived experiences of suicide survivors who become peer counselors? Participants were 15 individuals bereaved through suicide who had been volunteering with others bereaved in the same manner. This research employed the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach to provide a detailed description of participants' journeys that went from experiencing the suicide of a loved one, to the decision to become a peer counselor, to, finally, providing support to other survivors. The findings suggest that participants understand the provision of peer counseling as a transformative process. Being a peer counselor means actively challenging the silence around suicide by speaking out about suicide-related issues and offering other survivors a safe space to share their stories. The broader implications of these findings for suicide postvention research and clinical practice are addressed. ","753":"The current study examined the relationship between Physician Assisted Suicide (PAS) attitudes and interpersonal risk factors of suicidal desire as outlined by the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (Joiner, 2005). It was hypothesized that both thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness would be positively related to PAS acceptance. Results indicated that thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness predicted significance of favorable attitudes toward PAS in a college sample. Results suggest that attitudes toward PAS may be influenced by the experience of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness and provide a clear rationale for the study of these variables in populations more apt to consider hastened death. Future work regarding the application of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior in hastened death research is discussed. ","754":"This study explores the impact of bereavement on a group of older women with intellectual disabilities who have lived in a congregated residential setting for most of their lives. Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, staffs' experiences of supporting individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disabilities through grief are examined. Data analysis revealed five super-ordinate themes. The findings indicate that recognizing grief in this group is complex, and secondary loss frequent. Carers and relatives may overprotect and disenfranchise their grief which is often expressed through changes in behavior and there may be a time lag before these expressions of grief are noticed. Religious practice and rituals were found to be helpful in coping and adjusting to loss. Carers are important advocates for supporting service users who are grieving, thus information on how grief is processed in elderly individuals with intellectual disabilities has implications for training and educating staff in supporting vulnerable adults. ","755":"Although the parent-child relationship is significant throughout life, many changes occur as children grow, particularly during young adulthood. Parental loss and resulting grief during adulthood is likely influenced by many variables, including age, gender, relationship quality, and sex roles. In the present study, parentally bereaved adults completed measures assessing parental involvement, personal grief and adjustment, and sex role preferences. Analyses of covariance indicated that gender of the bereaved child was significant in predicting some aspects of grief, wherein females were more strongly impacted by the loss of a parent, irrespective of that parent's sex. However, the interaction of sex of parent and sex of child was also significant, suggesting that maternal loss may be particularly difficult for daughters. Results suggested that women may have a stronger emotional experience of grief and maintain closer bonds with a deceased mother. This may result from deeper emotional connections, feeling excluded by age peers, or vulnerability for rumination. ","756":null,"757":"Hospice bereavement services, though often overlooked in hospice research, are an important area of study due not only to the potential value of bereavement support but also the emphasis placed on such services by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Moreover, access to these services is seldom understood or researched. Therefore, using the patient public use file of the 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey, we explored the relationships between patient, informal caregiver, and agency characteristics as well as discharges from hospice to gain perspective into bereavement service access to informal caregivers. Findings suggested that death at discharge from hospice may be an important moderator variable between access to hospice bereavement support and many other factors. However, even under controls for death at discharge, two agency characteristics remain significantly associated with access. Bereavement access tends to be more likely in agencies that provide only hospice care as opposed to other services, and in micropolitan agencies. Furthermore, death at discharge is less likely among African Americans, suggesting the value of enhanced culturally-appropriate and more targeted hospice care and hospice bereavement support for this population. Future research should explore the strategies used to effectively deliver bereavement services and how these strategies may benefit from targeted and culturally sensitive approaches. ","758":"The purpose of this study is to test a conceptual model that aims to clarify the relationship between religious commitment and death anxiety. This model contains the following hypotheses: (1) people who affiliate with Conservative Protestant congregations will be more likely to attend worship services; (2) people who go to church more often will be more likely to feel they belong in their congregations; (3) those who feel they belong in their congregations will be more deeply committed to their faith; (4) individuals who are more deeply committed to their faith will be more likely to forgive others; (5) people who forgive others are more likely to feel they have been forgiven by God; and (6) individuals who feel they are forgiven by God will experience less death anxiety. Data from a nationwide survey of older Mexican Americans provides support for each hypothesis. ","759":"The complex family environments in which a suicide death had previously occurred were explored in a qualitative study of narratives of suicide-bereaved participants. The participants searched for reasons why the suicide occurred in their family. Family patterning stories and the context of the environment in which the suicide death occurred provided an additional depth of meaning into the relational aspects of the family. Fractured families emerged as an important theme. Shared in the narratives were stories of conditions within the family that may have contributed to vulnerability towards persistent negative feelings about their lives, their family, and their future. The study also identifies the strengths of family culture that led to resilience in the suicide bereaved. These stories highlight the importance of support for those bereaved by the suicide of a close family member and the issues that places people in vulnerable situations that perhaps may explain the increased risk of suicide for those bereaved family members. ","760":"Through data gathered from interviews with cold case homicide survivors, this article reveals the important role of religion and faith in the aftermath of an unsolved murder. Using qualitative methodology, the author highlights the lived experiences and personal journeys of cold case homicide surviving family members, who are often a forgotten and an overlooked segment of victims. Qualitative data suggests that these cold case homicide survivors found religion to be critical in the aftermath of their loved one's murder. Specifically, survivors indicated their faith was fundamental in coping with the homicide and provided hope for anticipating a resolution in their cases. From these intimate, personal survivor accounts, scholars and practitioners can begin to develop future research and programs that are specifically designed to highlight the role of religion in moving forward after an unsolved murder. ","761":"Consolation is grief's traditional amelioration, but contemporary bereavement theory lacks a conceptual framework to include it. The article begins to develop that framework. The article argues that grief is inter-subjective, even at the biological level. Consolation and grief happen in the same inter-subjective space. Material from the histories of several religions sets the article in a cross-cultural and historical environment. The article examines consolation in interpersonal relationships, and then moves to consolation in cultural\/religious resources that range from the literal image of God as an idealized parent to the abstract architecture of Brahm's Requiem. The most common consolation in the histories of religions comes within continuing bonds that are accessed in a wide variety of beliefs, rituals, and devotional objects. The article closes by briefly drawing the connection between consolation and faith. ","762":"Terminal lucidity, the unexpected return of mental clarity and memory shortly before the death of patients suffering from severe psychiatric and neurologic disorders, has raised the curiosity of numerous physicians and laypersons in the past. However, this peculiar phenomenon has received little attention in the recent decades. In previous publications, we have presented overviews of cases of terminal lucidity in various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In this article, we highlight terminal lucidity in persons with mental disabilities, and focus on one of the most remarkable cases that have been reported. We provide biographical background information about the two principal witnesses who reported this case. It concerns the death of Anna Katharina Ehmer, a 26-year-old woman with severe mental disabilities who lived in an institution for people with mental disorders, and who had allegedly never spoken a single word during her life. Yet, she was reported to have sung dying songs for a half hour before she died. The case was reported by the head of this institution and by its chief physician. We consider it difficult to evaluate the authenticity of the case definitively in retrospect. Nevertheless, there are similar cases and a variety of other anomalous brain-related findings we consider worth investigating. Studies into such anomalous cases might improve our concepts of human brain functioning and of mental processing in persons with mental disabilities, and might be of special value for the dying, the bereaved, and caretakers.","763":"Despite some scientific research on suicide as one of the most serious social and mental health problems in Iran, there is still lack of research on the effective structural and socio-familial factors contributing to the issue in Iran. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effective variables conditioning suicidality while also establishing a synthetic model. Three hundred-fifty university students (165 males, 185 females) were randomly chosen from Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran. The participants were asked to complete a package of self-report questionnaires including subjective socioeconomic status (SES), feeling of anomie, perceived parental control, and suicidality. The results show that all correlations among variables are significant. For testing the theoretical model, results of standardized regression coefficients suggest that SES has direct effect on suicidality and indirect effect via anomie and parental control. In addition, parental control has direct effects on suicidality and indirect effect via anomie as well. The findings confirm the expected paths hypothesized among variables which are consistent with the theories of Durkheim, Merton, Kohn, and Agnew. It implies that the development of suicidality takes place within socioeconomic context through the influence of parental control and feeling of anomie.","764":"This article presents qualitative interview data from the research project \"Grief Support Groups in Norway\" (2009-2011). The aim of this part of the study was to investigate grief group participant's experiences, benefits, and satisfaction with the grief group. Positive aspects were to meet with peers, share thoughts and feelings, normalization, exchange advice and information, and share hope. On the negative side were unfulfilled needs or expectations, additional personal stress, and unsatisfactory structure, organization, and leadership. Importantly, lack of screening caused bereaved with complicated grief to participate in groups that were non-therapeutic, leaving them with insufficient help. Also, group leaders were not always considered knowledgeable of group processes and impacts of different organizational and structural factors on groups. Conclusively, participants' needs and expectations should be considered when planning and organizing groups, in order to conduct helpful groups and increase the experience of a positive outcome.","765":"Managing grief and difficult emotions related to end-of-life (EOL) care is an often under-recognized part of the work of resident care aides (RCAs). In this interpretive analysis we explore the shared and socially constructed ideas that 11 RCAs in 1 Canadian city employ to make sense of death and the provision of EOL care. RCAs spoke of personal challenges involved in witnessing death and experiencing loss, as well as helplessness and frustration when they could not provide quality EOL care. RCAs invoked \"consoling refrains\" to manage grief, including \"such is life,\" \"they are better off,\" and \"they had a full life.\" To manage guilt and moral distress, RCAs reminded themselves \"I did my best\" and \"I experience rewards.\" Though these ideas help RCAs, some may need to be reframed through coaching and mentorship, to prevent unintended negative effects on care or the reproduction of ageist beliefs more broadly.","766":"Complicated Grief (CG) is a prolonged, impairing mental health condition affecting about 7% of the bereaved. CG may be especially prevalent in older adults. Though evidence-based treatments for CG have been developed, little is known about support-seeking in older adults with CG. This study used the descriptive phenomenological approach to explore the CG support-seeking process. In-depth interviews were conducted with 8 CG-positive older adults who had completed participation in a randomized clinical trial of CG treatment. Five primary themes arose: observing that grief was causing a great deal of distress and impairment; grief not meeting expectations of what grief \"should be\"; an important influence of social relationships on support-seeking; lack of effectiveness of grief support groups and\/or care from mental health professionals prior to study enrollment; and strong reactions to the label of CG. Themes may hep inform efforts to engage older adults with CG in effective care.","767":"This study investigated the association between therapist trainees' death anxiety and their preference for \"objective\" (i.e., quantitative and rational) over \"subjective\" (i.e., experiential and symbolic) theoretical orientations. In this correlational investigation, 303 clinical psychology and counseling trainees at a Midwestern school of professional psychology completed instruments assessing their fear of personal death and their endorsement of superordinate dimensions of psychotherapy orientations. As hypothesized, trainees who reported higher levels of death anxiety displayed a stronger preference for objective over subjective orientations, a relationship that was found in post hoc analyses to be particularly salient for male trainees. These findings suggest that trainees' death anxiety, and their attempts to control it, could influence their choice of a theoretical orientation. Potential implications for training institutions are discussed.","768":"Three series of suicides were examined for evidence of clustering: suicides on the Hong Kong subway (1979-1989), suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge (1999-2009), and suicides in the Wayne County Jail (1967-1992). The inter-suicide intervals were examined for their fit to a random Poisson distribution and found not to differ significantly, indicating that there was no evidence for clustering.","769":"Previous research reports examining the relationship between attitudes toward dying, death, and involvement in death-related occupations have provided mixed findings as no clear pattern has been identified. Examination of the relationship between attitudes toward dying, death, and recreational activity has not received much attention. The current study examined attitudes toward dying and death of older men categorized into four groups defined by recreational activities. The groups included skydivers (high death risk), nursing home residents (high death exposure), volunteer firefighters (high death risk and high death exposure), and a control group. The analyses found that skydivers reported the least fear of death, while nursing home residents reported the highest level. In addition, skydivers and firefighters had higher death acceptance scores than nursing home residents and the control group for the confrontation dimension, whereas skydivers had higher death acceptance scores than all groups, and firefighters were more accepting of death than nursing home residents for the integration dimension.","770":"Based on the results from the qualitative part of the study \"Grief Groups in Norway\" conducted in 2009-2011, this article focuses on grief group participants' recommendations for good or ideal grief groups. Participants have insightful observations about grief groups and how they can be improved, and taking their point of view seriously is one important way of ensuring that users of such group get an optimal experience from joining such groups. Using their experiences to adjust the structure and function of the groups, one can allow for practical solutions for organizations that have difficulties starting up grief support groups, for example, in areas where the population density is low. A major finding in this study was that grief group participants stressed the importance of thorough information before and at the start of grief groups. This concerned information about the aim, structure, organization, and possible effects and limitations of group participation.","771":"This bioethics analysis of trapped civilians in the World Trade Center (WTC) on September 11, 2001, is based on a review of materials in the public domain. Death and dying experiences are divided into three major groups: sudden death, of which there was virtually no suffering or foreknowledge; deaths in which there was a maximum of 102 minutes of suffering; and death by falling or jumping, in which an autonomous decision may have been exercised as a palliative approach. A content analysis of publicly available records of this event reveals many types of end-of-life decisions were being made within the 102-minute time frame from aircraft impact to collapse. Many WTC occupants experienced intensified suffering directly consequent to unprepared emergency dispatchers and inaccurate instructions. Truthtelling and appropriate end-of-life dialogues could have reduced loss of life, suffering, and led to qualitatively improved dying experiences.","772":"Andrej Marusic suggested that it might be useful for therapists to assess the wish to be dead in clients, a preliminary step in the pathway to suicide. The aim of the present research was to develop a brief scale to measure the wish to be dead. Two samples of undergraduate students were administered a brief 10-item scale to measure the wish to be dead. The scale had moderately good test-retest reliability and internal consistency (as measured with Cronbach alpha). Scores on the wish to be dead scale had modest correlations with a history of suicidal ideation and attempts and with scores on a scale to measure obsession with death. The wish to be dead scale, therefore, appears to measure a state of mind different from suicidal ideation and obsession with death, has adequate psychometric properties (reliability and validity), and may prove useful for clinical practice and research.","773":"The study explored ways that therapeutic work can be done with bereaved families in the Zimbabwean, African cultural context. The study used stories that families provided about their losses. These narratives were explored as ways to inform therapeutic practice. Findings were that a focus on solutions is valuable as an adaptive intervention and might prove to be one of the most effective means by which a number of people in Zimbabwe learn to cope with grief and adapt after the death of loved ones.","774":"A total of 39 very experienced clinicians and researchers worldwide responded to a survey consisting of both structured and open-ended questions on complicated grief in children. The questions assessed their opinion on: a) what constitutes complicated grief in children; b) whether to develop a diagnosis for children as suggested for adults and, if so, would adult criteria be sufficient for children; and c) other aspects of normal and complicated grief in children. The analyses showed that the professionals struggled with defining complicated grief in children, although they agreed that the major defining aspects were intensity, duration, and longevity of reactions. They identified traumatic and delayed or inhibited grief as major types, and also agreed that adult criteria were inappropriate for children.","775":"According to the Dual Process Model of coping with bereavement (DPM; Stroebe &amp; Schut, 1999), adjustment to bereavement involves a flexible oscillation between two types of coping strategies: loss-oriented (LO) and restoration-oriented (RO). This model postulates that extremely anxious or avoidant attachment disturbs the oscillation process by focusing more on one type of strategy, either LO or RO. The present study examined this assumption. We recruited 321 bereaved individuals who had lost a romantic partner. Our results showed that less negative appraisal of bereavement-related stressors, as well as higher use of RO strategies, mediated the link between attachment avoidance and low severity of grief reactions. However, the DPM variables were not found to mediate the link between attachment anxiety and elevated grief reactions. We discuss how these results provide an empirical basis of the DPM.","776":"Social and behavioral scientists have increasingly attended to the contexts and motivational dynamics underlying parricidal events. These efforts notwithstanding, most research has focused on adolescent or adult male offender populations. One largely neglected area of study is that of adult female offender parricide. The present study utilizes archival records to examine the contexts and sources of conflict that gave rise to adult female offender parricides in the late 19th century. Three general themes emerged, representing the primary contexts behind adult female offender parricide: (1) abuse and neglect; (2) instrumental, financially-motivated killings; and (3) expressive killings, often during the course of arguments. Each of these contexts is explored.","777":"The arts, in their multiplicity of forms, have shown to be of benefit to patients in healthcare settings and their family members. Benefits can include expression, relaxation, and distraction. Arts @ the Bedside, an initiative of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York Hospice Care, sought to train hospice volunteers with an art background, or interest, to safely and confidently introduce the arts in a variety of mediums to hospice patients and families. Monthly trainings sessions, led by professional artists, were offered to volunteers. Volunteers who participated in six or more trainings received a \"Certificate of Completion.\" The number of volunteer art visits, session reports, and the impact on volunteers were recorded. Qualitative data suggests that patients, staff, and volunteers gain from the introduction of the arts in home hospice care.","778":"The University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCCC) Grief and Loss Program provides supportive care services during bereavement which is considered part of the care continuum. This program received 50 death notifications per month upon project initiation and currently receives approximately 125 per month. Initial program evaluation was conducted via a pilot survey of bereaved parents as well as verbal and written evaluations from the transdisciplinary staff of Patient and Family Support Services. Grief support prior to evaluation included mailings, phone calls as indicated, poorly attended bereavement support groups, and limited staff support. Based on program evaluation, grief support continues through the use of mail\/e-mail and phone calls to those at risk for complicated grief Three to four gatherings per year are offered rather than monthly support groups, and connections to community resources are provided. The Comfort And Resources at End of Life (C-A-R-E) program was implemented to support and educate staff. Next steps include further program evaluation and potential research to examine best practices for the bereaved.","779":"As society has become increasingly inquisitive about complementary therapies, various sectors of the medical community have begun to incorporate complementary therapies into their practice, studying their impact on client health and effectiveness in treating specific symptoms. This article describes the design and initial findings from a 1-year review of the implementation of massage and Reiki therapies on patients in a small hospice and palliative care program in central Connecticut. Over the course of 1 year, 114 massage sessions were provided to 52 different patients, all of which included Reiki. After completion of these sessions, patients were evaluated for changes in symptoms such as pain reduction, ease in breathing, stress\/anxiety reduction, and increased relaxation, with the results being predominantly beneficial.","780":"Although bereavement programs in hospice and palliative care settings are known to produce positive outcomes for family members after the death of a loved one, currently there is a clear lack of services offered through long-term care (LTC) facilities, where older adults often reside prior to their death. The purpose of the present article is to present an initial bereavement program called We Care that focused on providing additional support for family members who experience a death of a loved one while in a LTC facility. Goals for the program include: 1) providing ongoing contact with the family for 1 year, and 2) offering a bereavement group. The program's model is explained, with highlights of obstacles experienced and suggestions for future programs.","781":"Songs from the Heart is an annual palliative care and outreach\/support project done in partnership with the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Henry Joyce Cancer Clinic and Gilda's Club Nashville. It is a two-evening songwriters' workshop and concert that gives cancer survivors, family members and healthcare professionals the opportunity to tell their story about cancer through the art of music in a safe therapeutic environment, It is a unique project through the art of music helping others of all ages and from all walks of life find healing and hope; as well as an opportunity to give back to others. A professional singer\/songwriter and a social worker co-facilitate the two-evening songwriters workshop. Two musicians perform songs the workshop songwriters have written at a community wide concert. Those who have participated in Songs from the Heart have communicated through the workshop evaluations that this experience has been life changing and a unique opportunity in being able to: explore and express their deep felt emotional feelings and thoughts; release their creative juices; ability to be alone with the group, yet feel included as a whole; express their journey through music; and benefit from being involved with others affected by cancer who have had similar difficulties. Others who have attended the concert or listened to the CD have expressed the significant impact these songs have had on their lives and their journey with cancer.","782":"Collaborations in palliative care have helped to create a framework and identify preferred practices so the field of palliative care can grow. Teamwork designed in a transdisciplinary style is desired and provides whole-person, sensitive, and comprehensive care. In applying the basic key concepts and evidenced-based knowledge of palliative care, this article details one palliative care department's effort to create change, enhance the delivery of care, and build their palliative care practice. Creating collaborations and building partnerships were fundamental outcomes to improve the palliative care practice, increase transdisciplinary teamwork activities, and enhance the delivery of care in this organization.","783":"While palliative care is best delivered in an interdisciplinary format, courses teaching the interdisciplinary approach to palliative care are rare in healthcare education. This article describes a graduate-level course in palliative care for students in nursing, pharmacy, social work, and gerontology taught by faculty from each discipline. The overarching goals of this course are to convey core palliative care knowledge across disciplines, articulate the essential contribution of each discipline in collaborative care, and to define interdisciplinary processes learners need to understand and navigate interdisciplinary palliative care. Learning outcomes included increased knowledge in palliative care, enhanced attitudes in practice and application of skills to clinical practice settings, increased ability to contribute discipline-specific knowledge to their teams' discussions, and a sense of increasing confidence in participating in the care of complex patients, communicating with families, and contributing to the team as a member of their own discipline.","784":"The Hispanic and Latino populations have increased nationwide. Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the United States. This increase in population will have an impact on all service areas, including hospice and palliative care. The goal as service providers is to remove barriers to care in order to increase opportunities for all the people residing in the communities. This project addresses the impact of the Hispanic and Latino populations in Pasco County, Florida, and the need to develop Latino outreach programs that will inform, educate, and provide culturally sensitive services which will decrease the barriers of communication and accessibility for Hispanics and Latinos who are in need of hospice and palliative care. The new outreach program, named Nuestro, which means \"ours\" in Spanish, is designed with this purpose in mind. The project's goal was to increase service by 200%; the outcome after 2 years was an increase of services by 900%.","785":"This article presents attempts to improve the quality of spiritual care offered to palliative care patients by educating nursing and other staff about spiritual screening with the goal of increasing referrals to a board certified chaplain. Attention to patients' spiritual identity and spiritual needs upon admission and throughout a hospitalization through either a formalized screening tool or provider awareness and sensitivity can assist patients in naming their needs, thus triggering a referral to a board certified chaplain or other spiritual counselor. Along with a spiritual care plan based upon assessment of spiritual needs and resources facilitates the healing process.","786":"This project examines the effects of spiritual care on chronically ill and aging populations and those who care for them by studying the development of a comprehensive Pastoral Care Program at Episcopal Communities &amp; Services (ECS), a nonprofit that owns two Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC) in Southern California (in 2010 ECS operated three communities). The study includes the vision, methodology, and specific steps taken to implement this spiritual care program and methods to measure its efficacy. Data is analyzed from satisfaction surveys conducted the year before the program's introduction and surveys taken 2 and 4 years after the institution of the Pastoral Care Program, along with anecdotal findings. Results indicated that spiritual awareness and satisfaction increased throughout the resident population after the Pastoral Care Program's establishment and that satisfaction levels continued to improve as the program developed over time. This study suggests that spiritual support (both religious and nonreligious) is a vital factor in well-being and quality of life at the end of life and that transdisciplinary palliative care is needed in long-term care settings to address spiritual and psychosocial needs.","787":"Research has demonstrated that limited dialogue in end-of-life (EOL) care can negatively impact decision-making and place of death. Furthermore, when vulnerable populations are faced with EOL cancer care, they experience issues resulting from previous gaps in services attributed to sociocultural and economic issues that influence EOL care. These conditions place an additional burden on disadvantaged populations which can cause distress, especially as disparate conditions continue to persist. Little is known about Latinos' psychosocial concerns that lead to distress in EOL care. The objective of this study is to explore Latinas' experiences with life-limiting cancer conditions to identify the EOL care concerns that impact their dying experience. This study used a phenomenological approach to explore the EOL care concerns of 24 Latinas receiving treatment for metastatic cancers in a public sector healthcare system in Los Angeles, California. In-depth interviews were recorded and transcribed, and qualitative analysis was performed using Atlas.ti software.","788":"When a person consents to have a ventricular assist device (VAD) implanted in one's heart, the intention is to extend life toward a new heart or toward more time. Complications may develop followed by frequent hospital admissions-most often in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting-rendering a transplant a distant reality and to discontinue the device means certain death. Emotional support for patient and family is critical. Regardless of the original goal for the device, palliative care provides assistance in communication, goal setting, and symptom management and yet its consultation is often more for brink-of-death care than end-of-life care provided at the time of diagnosis of a life-threatening disease such as heart failure. This study examined the recent deaths of hospitalized patients with VADs and the use of the palliative care service. Understanding the benefit and timing of palliative care for VAD patients-particularly in the ICU setting--may improve the end-of-life experience for patients, families, and healthcare providers.","789":"The goal of this project was to examine the uniformity of the hospital's delivery of psychosocial and spiritual care for the families of patients being evaluated for brain death. A retrospective chart review encompassing one calendar year was conducted. After conferring with physicians and staff, a strategy was developed to capture information on patients who were diagnosed with brain death. Following evaluation of the information gathered, a proposal was introduced and hospital procedure revised. Triggers were put in place to ensure consistent offering of psycho-spiritual transdisciplinary services to the families of patients who are undergoing evaluation for brain death.","790":"An intervention was conducted, aimed at providing residents in internal medicine with communication skills to address end-of-life issues with patients. Residents participated in two 1-hour educational sessions designed to teach a communication protocol, enhance listening skills, and to provide practice in effective communication in a safe, small-group format. An anonymous on-line survey assessed the effectiveness of the intervention. Twenty-five residents completed the intervention. There was a trend toward increased comfort level in addressing end-of-life issues among residents who completed the intervention, versus a comparison group. Residents who completed the intervention reported that using the words \"death\" and \"dying\" with patients and families was an important teaching point.","791":"Dignity Therapy (DT) is an intervention designed to lessen existential suffering as death draws near. DT has a growing evidence base, with positive outcomes for patients and their family members; however, it is not yet widely available in community settings. The purpose of this project was to translate DT into clinical practice in a cancer center in the midwestern United States. DT was provided to 10 patients with metastatic cancer who completed baseline and post-intervention measures of depression, existential distress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with the intervention. DT was found to be feasible and acceptable to the majority of patients and their families. DT outcomes will be presented, along with suggestions for clinicians who are interested in offering DT in their practices.","792":"Confronted with the complexities inherent in delivering palliative care, effective collaboration with referring staff becomes vital. Based on the evaluation of the physical and psychosocial concerns of patients, the goal of palliative care is to craft interventions that maintain quality of life in the face of increasing symptoms and deteriorating functional status. The project's goal was to increase the appropriateness of referrals to palliative care by the primary services in the hospital. The aim was to achieve this by developing a process to assess patient functioning in critical psychosocial and functional areas, and providing this data to referring medical staff to educate them on the contribution of palliative care to symptom control and patient quality of life. The findings show that referrals to palliative care have increased over 100% from a broader range of services since initiating this project. Assessment data has been collected on 165 patients and outcomes are discussed.","793":"New York-Presbyterian Hospital\/Weill Cornell Medical Center is a large academic medical center that provided minimal, if any, bereavement support to families and loved ones of patients who died in the hospital. A comprehensive bereavement program was developed and implemented which included sending condolence cards to family members and friends, follow-up phone calls to screen for complicated grief, individual counseling, bereavement support groups, community referrals, and an annual memorial service for families and staff to provide an opportunity for shared mourning during the grieving process.","794":"Care for African-American patients and families at the end of life presents a unique challenge to healthcare providers. Providers need to be culturally and historically competent to effectively serve persons with a long history of distrust of the white-dominated healthcare system. Effective means of addressing outreach, access, and service issues for this community need to be twofold. They must focus on those who deliver the care and those who receive it. This twofold focus inspired the education and community outreach that were key elements in this ACE Project. The resources of the Duke Institute on Care at the End of Life (ICEOL), particularly their APPEAL curriculum, was key to strengthening end-of-life care in the internal culture of Abington Memorial Hospital and the community they serve.","795":"A large community-based oncology practice developed a pilot project to enhance staff and patient awareness of the benefits of palliative care, advance care planning, and earlier intervention with patients with advancing disease. The results were ongoing implementation of palliative care conferences at all sites, greater numbers of referral to hospice, lessened chemotherapy given in the last 2 weeks of life, and the hiring of two social workers as a result of needs identified. Staff reported greater satisfaction with interprofessional communication.","796":"Hospice of Sacred Heart, an agency of PeaceHealth Oregon, experienced a dramatic increase in its census beginning in 2007. The spiritual care team noticed the number of referrals was decreasing while the census was increasing. A quality improvement initiative was conducted, including a staff survey, an education program about spirituality and the role of chaplains on interdisciplinary teams in the hospice setting, and an audit of the chaplain's daily allocation of time. These actions resulted in an increase in the use of spiritual care services by patients and staff and the addition of two full-time, benefited chaplain positions.","797":"This project offers encouraging evidence of the impact of providing companionship and compassionate care to actively dying Veterans. Veteran-centered care serves as a guide for volunteer program objectives including goals based on measuring outcomes of volunteer visits offered to Veterans, frequency of visits to those desiring volunteer involvement and documentation of goals on the resident plan of care. Forty-eight Veterans were admitted to the Palliative Integrated Care (PIC) Unit during the project review period with a median length of stay (LOS) of 7 days, ranging 1-50 days. Goals were met for Veterans with LOS &gt; 3 days; however, it was more challenging to meet the needs of Veterans with shorter stays. Data for this project were collected over a 6-month period. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responding to the needs of end-of-life Veterans who do not have family or friends readily available through the No Veteran Dies Alone initiative.","798":"This article reflects a project to create, refine, and use a palliative care specific spiritual assessment, with the intent to implement its use for both an inpatient Palliative Consult Service (PCS) and a Spiritual Health Service (SHS) team. Extensive meetings with these services to confirm a shared understanding of the use of this spiritual assessment to facilitate communication with PCS through consistent language about the patient's story, suffering, spirit, and sense-making. Following a pilot phase of using this palliative care spiritual assessment, five presentations were shared with the SHS team to explore using this assessment. Although the SHS team decided not to use its content, these presentations spurred dialogue toward what was to become a SHS standardized documentation process, eventually called data, intervention, outcome, plan (DIOP).","799":"As a response to the increasing numbers of Veterans utilizing the Veterans Affairs (VA) Contract Home Hospice Program, and with growing awareness of the increased stress at end-of-life, the social work leadership of the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center implemented a unique approach to support Veterans and their families. The role of a grief\/bereavement counselor was added to enhance the VA Contract Home Hospice Program, to assess the needs of the Veterans and family caregivers, and to create a program in response to these findings. A three-prong module evolved encompassing: Anticipatory Mourning Support for both the Veteran and caregiver\/ family; Caregiver Support; and Bereavement Support. The components of this module are described along with findings in each module.","800":"A growing body of research and clinical reports support the benefits of utilizing animal-assisted therapy (AAT) as a complementary, transdisciplinary treatment intervention in medical settings. However, fewer articles are found demonstrating AAT's use in palliative care settings. This article is a study of the effects of AAT in palliative care situations, presenting one anecdotal clinical vignette. In this way, the efficacy of this technique in decreasing patient pain, thereby increasing patient quality of life, and lowering staff stress levels may be illustrated.","801":"Family caregivers often suffer higher levels of physical and emotional distress when caring for a chronically or terminally ill family member. Providing this kind of care to a loved one at the end of life contributes to increased stress, health problems, and a decreased quality of life. The Hospice Caregiver Support Project provided support services to caregivers identified by the hospice social worker as needing this support and\/or assistance. Results from the project show that offering additional services relieved caregiver stress by allowing the caregiver time away from their caregiving role and reducing feelings of guilt and worry, and increased hospice social worker satisfaction with their ability to respond to the needs of hospice patients and caregivers.","802":"A transdisciplinary team is an essential component of palliative and end-of-life care. This article will demonstrate how to develop a transdisciplinary approach to palliative care, incorporating nursing, social work, spiritual care, and pharmacy in an acute care setting. Objectives included: identifying transdisciplinary roles contributing to care in the acute care setting; defining the palliative care model and mission; identifying patient\/family and institutional needs; and developing palliative care tools. Methods included a needs assessment and the development of assessment tools, an education program, community resources, and a patient satisfaction survey. After 1 year of implementation, the transdisciplinary palliative care team consisted of seven palliative care physicians, two social workers, two chaplains, a pharmacist, and End-of-Life Nursing Consortium (ELNEC) trained nurses. Palomar Health now has a palliative care service with a consistent process for transdisciplinary communication and intervention for adult critical care patients with advanced, chronic illness.","803":"In 1948, Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the modem hospice movement, established a core principle of palliative care, Total Pain, which is defined as physical, spiritual, psychological, and social suffering. In 2009, a consensus panel (Puchalski, Ferrell, Virani, Otis-Green, Baird, Bull, et al., 2009) was convened to address the important issue of integrating spirituality in palliative care, which led to renewed efforts to focus on spiritual care as a critical component of quality palliative care. This project is a combination of advocacy for the importance of spiritual care, training chaplains, seminarians, community clergy, and healthcare professionals in palliative care, and creating a spiritual care curriculum which can be self-taught or taught to members of transdisciplinary teams.","804":"This article describes the creation and development of a sustainable, community-supported children's bereavement camp. Numerous grief camps were examined prior to the project development. The project development was guided by the S.M.A.R.T. (S--Strategic\/specific; M--Measurable; A--Achievable\/attainable; R--Realistic; and T--Time-framed) stratagem to direct steps toward the development of the bereavement camp. Outcome measures included program participation, as well as evaluations completed by campers, family members, and volunteers. Camp attendance continues to grow, with 48 children the first year and an average of 65 the following 3 years. According to post-evaluation surveys, campers were able to integrate back into school with a decrease in stress and an increase in their ability to verbalize their grief, share feelings and begin to trust others. One child \"got her sparkle back\" according to her grandmother. Several campers commented that camp allowed them to see themselves as normal children. The goal of Camp Healing Hearts was that campers would laugh again, and they are.","805":"Psychologists, social workers, and spiritual care professionals report inadequate preparation to maximize their effectiveness in advocating for institutional reform to meet oncology patients' diverse bio-psychosocial-spiritual and cultural needs. This article provides an overview of the ACE Project, a National Cancer Institute, 5 year, R25-funded transdisciplinary palliative care education program designed to enhance the advocacy and leadership skills of 301 competitively selected psycho-oncology professionals. ACE Project participants identified an institutional goal, refined their goals during the course and received mentorship and support throughout the subsequent year. Participants were invited to return to a Reunion Conference in year five to report on their activities, network, and share the results of their change efforts. A subset of 28 ACE Project participants contributed to this OMEGA special issue. Participants' goals primarily focused on strategies to improve clinical care through program development and improvements in palliative care education within their institutions. The results of this transdisciplinary leadership skills-building program for psycho-oncology professionals affirm the feasibility and perceived need for the program. See the ACE Project website (http:\/\/www.cityofhope.org\/education\/health-professional-education\/nursing-education\/ACE-project\/Pages\/default.aspx) for additional program information. ","806":"","807":"How do healthcare professionals classify or characterize human beings: how do they identify and define a patient or in the case of this study a dead person? Healthcare professionals are fairly regularly exposed to human beings dying. Part of their duty is to postpone death but, death being inevitable, they regularly lose the fight. This study aims to determine how healthcare professionals classify human beings by asking only 1 question, and allowing respondents to provide 5 answers of their own making (\"You are exposed to a dead person, victim of a car accident. Apart from name and surname, what are the 5 questions you would ask?\"). Thereby, it is hoped to avoid both conflicts with responsibilities of healthcare professionals and predetermining the answers. As described above, one self-administered open question related to a very short story had to be answered anonymously and was asked by e-mail. As a result of the analysis, a number of stereotype question sets were obtained through the answers of the respondents. The stereotype questions and derived thought concepts provide an insight into the awareness and (prioritized) values of healthcare professionals in Turkey. In the replies, questions related to the personal background of the dead (such as age, marital status, and parenthood) had the highest frequency, while questions of professional relevance followed with medium frequency. A question relating to the consent of the deceased to organ donation was almost never asked. It is suggested that any potential educational material for healthcare personnel should be reviewed in order to increase awareness of relevant issues.","808":"The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of peer supporters of a bereavement intervention for grieving parents and how the program should be developed further. The intervention included: a support package for grieving parents, peer supporters' contact, and healthcare personnel's contact with parents. The sample included 16 peer supporters. Data were collected via open-format questionnaires and telephone interviews and analyzed by content analysis. Peer supporters perceived the intervention and its viability as mostly good. Parents' willingness to receive support and peer supporters' good resources were important for the follow-up contact. However, the peer supporters' resources were insufficient to meet parents' unexpected needs. Continuous training and systematic supervision of peer supporters is needed. Study results suggest that support interventions aimed at grieving families need a greater number of male supporters, as fathers hope to receive more support from their male counterparts. Inter-organizational cooperation in supporting parents is important and must be further developed.","809":"When a baby has died during pregnancy, the first encounter between mother and child occurs when the baby is already dead. Despair, emptiness, and grief characterize the encounter, which is also a gradual farewell to the child and the planned future for the family. This study describes mothers' experiences of the farewell of their stillborn baby at discharge from hospital. Twenty-three mothers from different parts of Sweden, who suffered stillbirth, were interviewed. Semi-structured questions were used and the replies were analyzed using content analysis. The mothers describe the separation from the child when leaving hospital as unnatural and that the separation ruins the motherhood they felt during pregnancy. Five categories were identified: unnatural to leave the baby; going home empty-handed; access to the child; security and insecurity in the separation; to let go. The overarching theme that we recognized from these responses we have formulated as: You don't leave your baby. Leaving the baby at the hospital goes against the biological instinct to care for and protect the offspring. Routines for a dignified goodbye including designating a deputy guardian into whose arms the mother can place the baby can help to facilitate the separation. The possibility of leaving the baby in the arms of someone known to the parents should be an option for parents who choose to take farewell of the child at the hospital. The place and time for the farewell should be decided on by the parents, taking the baby home for a personal farewell could be an alternative.","810":"More people are turning to the Internet to communicate about dying, death, and grief experiences. This theoretical article explores the ethical dilemmas, challenges, and opportunities presented to researchers interested in exploring how death and grief are communicated online. Weaving together the literatures of computer-mediated communication and thanatology (dying and death), we discuss the ways in which many common ethical dilemmas uniquely manifest related to death and grief. We also explore the emotional impact studying death and grief online has on researchers and the importance of thinking about researcher emotions on scholars who study these issues. We end with recommendations of how to move forward in the dialogue about ethics and studying death and grief online.","811":"This article describes a preventive intervention to promote resilience of parentally bereaved youth. This intervention includes separate but concurrent programs for youth and caregivers that were developed to change empirically-supported risk and protective factors. We first discuss the risk that parental death confers to youth mental health and social adaptation outcomes. Next, we discuss the theoretical framework underlying this program. After describing the content and structure of the program, we describe the results of an experimental field trial and discuss directions for future work.","812":"This article argues that much can be learned about the ways in which individuals grieve through a careful analysis of the presentation of loss in creative fiction, especially in terms of unconscious and uncensored responses presented indirectly through figurative language and structural patterns. It takes Bob Dylan's collection of songs about the anguish caused by lost love, Blood on the Tracks, as an example. An examination of the songs included in, and some rejected for, the album reveals developing responses to grief resulting from relationship breakdown, including the search for the absent one and for reconciliation; the intrusion of deep pain into everyday situations; the problem of infidelity and guilt; the attempt to reach a more detached perspective; the consequences of the pain becoming unbearable; and the attempt at a kind of closure. Taken together, the songs reveal how complex and contradictory responses to the agony of loss can be.","813":"Little is known about the psychological phenomenology of death. Reported across known history and in all cultures by those who have died or been close to death, NDEs challenge objective-mechanistic models by suggesting the phenomenology of death may involve a variety of complex psychological processes. This article discusses three notable characteristics of the NDE--loss of the fear of death, psychological sequelae, and complex conscious abilities--supporting this claim. The implications these have for advancing societal understandings of death are discussed, and their pragmatic application for professions where death is frequently encountered, such as palliative care, is addressed.","814":"The predictive validity of the Reactions to Loss Scale (RTL) was assessed in two studies (N = 185 and 170) of college students who reported a recent loss and their feelings about and preoccupation with the loss. Across a 9-week interval, participants reported an increase in positive feelings about the loss event and a decrease in negative feelings, regret, and preoccupation with the loss. The Positive Reappraisal Scale of the RTL predicted increased positive feelings and a reduction of regret. Avoidance scale of the RTL predicted higher levels of regret and the Loss of Control scale predicted higher levels of negative affect (Study 2). This longitudinal data supports the validity of the Reactions to Loss scale and supports the value of assessing positive, resilient responses to a loss.","815":"It is commonly believed that the value of art and other creative works increases after the death of the artist. In an attempt to examine this so-called death effect we presented a short story to N = 431 undergraduate students asking how much money they would hypothetically spend to purchase a literary work. We experimentally manipulated: 1) whether the author died or moved after publishing a short story, and, 2) the gender of the author. Participants randomly received one of four possible biographical descriptions about the author. We predicted that participants would offer higher purchase prices and subjectively evaluate the work more positively when they believed the author was dead. Results were consistent with this hypothesis perhaps reflecting a certain reverence for the dead. We also found that evaluations of the story were more favorable when the purported gender of the author matched that of the participant.","816":"This article explores medical students' experiences and coping strategies when confronting patient loss in their 3rd and 4th years of their programs. Much of the literature on the impact of patient losses focuses on physicians. This article joins a handful of works aimed at how medical students experience and cope with patient loss. In-depth interviews with 20 medical students provided rich descriptions of their varying experiences coping with death. Consistent with previous work, students experience substantial emotional stress coping with patient deaths, though some were more difficult to bear than others, such as when the dying patient was a child or when treatment errors could have contributed to deaths. Common coping mechanisms included talking through their emotions, thrusting themselves into continuing their rounds, crying, participating in infant death rituals, and turning to religion. When deaths occurred, senior personnel who exhibited empathy toward the deceased and tolerance toward the students' emotional responses were lauded and made the process easier. Also emotionally daunting, in many instances, was dealing with the families of dying patients. Most of the students did not view death as a failure, contrary to much earlier literature, except in instances in which human error or decision making may have played a part in causing the death of a patient.","817":"This study examined health\/mental health status, family functioning, and resiliency among a sample of bereaved parents (N = 503). Participants were recruited from an online support community to complete an online survey instrument (response rate = 51.75%). The questionnaire contained an array of self-report instruments, such as the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Family Assessment Device (FAD), as well as open-ended questions. Many respondents scored over the clinical cut-off for the HSCL-25 (51.3%, n = 258) and IES-R (42.3%, n = 213). IES-R scores were negatively correlated with years-since loss (r = -0.24, p &lt; .05). In narrative responses, participants described a wide range of deeply impactful mental and physical health problems. The results indicate significant clinical distress in this sample of bereaved parents, with many reporting enduring psychological, familial, and health consequences following the death of a child.","818":"Obituaries do not only announce the death of a significant other but also provide insights into how a society deals with death according to the norms governing the rituals of individuals within that society. This study aimed at investigating possible differences between German and Dutch obituaries, specifically in terms of visual and textual elements, information about the deceased, and funeral ceremony-related information. Data used to address the research questions were the contents of 240 German and 240 Dutch obituaries published in 10 different newspapers (6 in Germany, 4 in The Netherlands). Results of this study show that statistically significant differences between German and Dutch obituaries exist. While German obituaries use illustrations more than Dutch ones, Dutch obituaries provide more information, in general, than their German counterparts. The types of deceased-related information on German and Dutch obituaries also vary significantly. Moreover, Dutch obituaries provide more funeral ceremony-related information than German obituaries.","819":"This study investigated the association between therapist-trainees' death anxiety and their preference for \"objective\" (i.e., quantitative and rational) over \"subjective\" (i.e., experiential and symbolic) theoretical orientations. In this correlational investigation, 303 clinical psychology and counseling trainees at a Midwestern school of professional psychology completed instruments assessing their fear of personal death and their endorsement of superordinate dimensions of psychotherapy orientations. As hypothesized, trainees who reported higher levels of death anxiety displayed a stronger preference for objective over subjective orientations, a relationship that was found in post-hoc analyses to be particularly salient for male trainees. These findings suggest that trainees' death anxiety, and their attempts to control it, could influence their choice of a theoretical orientation. Potential implications for training institutions are discussed.","820":"This study examined the distinctly gendered experiences of young widowers. Using qualitative longitudinal data from the 1960's Harvard Bereavement Study, we evaluated the interview transcripts of 19 widowers (median age = 38) who had been interviewed 3 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 months, and 2-4 years after the wife's death. Our findings indicate that the off-time spousal loss ruptured the ontological security that marriage provided and created two types of difficult situations for the widowers. Coping with deep sadness and grief, the men divulged their unspoken dependency on their marriage and on their late wife. They also struggled as single fathers, especially if they tried to singlehandedly care for their children. Becoming an off-time widower in the 1960s compelled the men to reclaim their masculine identity. Men's identity-rebuilding strategies involved promptly returning to work, and many men began dating and repartnering to recoup the normalcy of being married.","821":"In the aftermath of suicide, grief becomes a multi-faceted experience. Traditionally, this grief was silenced where the shame attached to suicide invalidated a person's need for expression. Even now, it can be difficult for people to fully articulate their grief, let alone find an empathetic audience. How do we examine this grief to more clearly hear the voices of the bereaved, and to better understand how to support those who are grieving a suicide death? Indeed, the ripple of suicide grief touches more than those traditionally considered to be impacted by the death. Whole communities can be affected and it cannot be presumed that researchers do not have their own lived experiences of suicide bereavement. In this way, the newly-opened discourse around the experience of suicide grief needs to be dissected within more practical and appropriate research. A balance needs to be created in research where the voices of grief can be included but the experiential context understood and respected.","822":"This qualitative study aimed to explore therapists' experiences of loss. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 6 therapists and the data were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. Three master themes emerged from the analysis: (a) the grieving therapist, (b) hindrances in grieving, and (c) the impact of loss on therapeutic work. Therapists talked about their grief and elaborated on how they coped with their bereavement. Hindrances in their grief were reported, emerging both from others' stance and from their own. Participants found that their experience of loss was related to both challenges and advancements in their therapeutic work.","823":"Parents who have experienced the death of a child from cancer have unique bereavement needs. This study evaluated the possibility of instituting a home-based bereavement visit from the oncology team following a child's death. Parents completed a brief anonymous questionnaire measuring preferences regarding visit logistics and content. The majority (84%) of the 31 participants agreed that a home-based bereavement program is desirable. Qualitative analysis of parental comments revealed common themes including processing grief, practical suggestions for visit, recognition of individual differences, perceived risks and benefits of visit, connections with medical staff, and unmet needs for support. In conclusion, a home visit program may satisfy needs for additional support while alleviating barriers to other types of bereavement care.","824":"Health professionals, researchers, and philosophers have debated extensively about suicide. Some believe suicides result from mental pathology, whereas others argue that individuals are capable of rational suicide. This debate is particularly poignant within illness communities, where individuals may be suffering from chronic and incurable conditions. This article engages with these issues by presenting the accounts of 20 individuals with Huntington disease (HD), a fatal degenerative condition, and 10 informal caregivers (e.g., spouses). Suicide is a leading cause of death amongst people with HD, with an incidence rate many times higher than the general population. In contrast to the majority of the academic literature on HD suicidality, study participants did not connect suicide with mental pathology. Instead, they perceived suicide as a response to the realities of living with HD, such as prolonged physiological degeneration and the need for long-term intensive health care. These findings are subsequently discussed in relation to the rational-pathological suicide binary.","825":"Serial killers have always fascinated society. A serial killer is typically defined as a perpetrator who murders three or more people over a period of time. Most reported cases of serial killers come from the United States and Canada. In India, there are few reported cases. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first Indian case in the literature. The present case is of a 28-year-old man, Surinder Koli. The Department of Forensic Medicine &amp; Toxicology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delphi handled the forensic study. We present a most unique psychological investigation into the mind of a serial killer.","826":"Cultural traditions at the end of life solidify societal members. As the world becomes more globalized, socio-economic factors affect how traditional practices are expressed, and the role and toll they make on modern societies. This article examines the contemporary Akan funeral practices in Ghana. Akan lineage members, from birth through puberty, marriage, maturity, old age, go through various rites of passage that bond them culturally and spiritually to others in society. One such ritual is funeral celebration. Funeral celebration, an old practice, has always been at the heart of public social events of Akan people. However, the changes in Ghanaian Akan funerals over the past 4 decades, and their impact on the people, make this an important topic. The article describes the Akan belief of life after death, the respect accorded to the dead, the prestige associated with successful funeral celebrations, and socio-economic factors that continue to shape Akan funeral practices. Socio-economic impact and the resulting challenges are discussed.","827":"A growing body of evidence has pointed to the stressful experience surrounding surrogate decision-making on behalf of incapacitated patients. This study (N = 59) asked surrogates to speak about their experiences immediately after having made a life-sustaining treatment decision. Grounded theory analysis revealed four themes: (1) the emotional impact of the decision-making process on the surrogate; (2) the difficulty of watching a loved one's health deteriorate; (3) the importance of having a Living Will (LW) or other written\/verbal instructions; and (4) the reliance on spirituality as a means of coping with the surrogate experience. Findings of this study suggest that engaging surrogates at the time of patient admission may be essential in order to clarify patient preferences and strengthen communication between surrogates and the interdisciplinary healthcare team.","828":"While complicated grief has been addressed in part through some recommendations for modifications in the upcoming fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there remain reasons for substantial concern about its scope therein and within clinical practice. The authors issue a call to the field, reiterating that complicated grief is complicated and cannot be confined to just one syndrome or disorder. Continued research is urged, and specific caveats are identified for exploring the complex dimensions of loss and grief. The authors advocate for ongoing dialogue about and investigation of various potential forms of complicated grief.","829":"The homicidal death of a loved one is horrific. Dying from homicide can be more sudden, frightening, and stigmatizing than natural dying and may be followed by a sub-type of prolonged grief complicated by vivid narrative reenactment of the dying, intense feelings of remorse, and nihilistic despair. After a literature review of grief after homicide, the author clarifies the salient narrative themes of homicidal dying and their specific effects on trauma and separation distress. A preliminary model is then developed and illustrated in a therapy case outlining a technique (imaginative exposure) to diminish the disabling fixation of reenactment imagery, remorse, and despair.","830":"Despite his prominence as a leading contemporary social theorist, Zygmunt Bauman's long-term writing on the cultural theory of death and dying has largely been overlooked in the sociological literature of death and dying, particularly in the United States. Bauman uniquely theorizes how we survive death-anxieties today: Contemporary, liquid modern culture has engaged us in ceaseless pursuit of the unattainable consumer sensation of bodily fitness as a way to suppress and thus survive our death-anxieties. Bauman also argues that the prevalence of this cultural formula to survive death-anxieties has simultaneously increased, more than ever before in social history, the volume of individual responsibility for restlessly coping with existential anxieties in the societies of consumers. While unique and insightful, his theoretical argument has a limitation; largely succeeding Freud's classic view of mortality, Bauman's contemporary theory may lead us to neglect potentially important social, cultural, and historical variations in how mortality has been understood.","831":"This study examined the relationship between affiliation with one of three denominations within Judaism representing a conservative-liberal continuum of Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism. The criterion for affiliation was burial in a cemetery maintained by these denominations. Longevities of married congregants born 1850-1910 were compared, controlling for birth year. Orthodox Jews had the shortest life spans (77 years); Conservative and Reform Jews had very similar life spans (80.7 years). Differences in years of survival of husbands after death of a spouse did not differ significantly. Reform widows survived longest (16.5 years) after death of a spouse. Conservative and Reform widows did not differ significantly from one another.","832":"Scholars have noted that communication helps maintain relational continuity despite physical absence; yet, the specific role of communication in continuing a relationship with the deceased has not been analyzed. In this study, messages directed to the deceased on Facebook memorial group walls were examined to explore how grieving individuals utilize Facebook memorial groups in order to make sense of the death of a loved one and reconnect with the deceased. Using a grounded theory approach, message topics and apparent grief-related functions served by messages were identified and characterized. Initial observation revealed that grieving individuals wrote to the deceased as if the deceased could read the messages, which is a unique type of communication. The communication written to the deceased individuals appeared to serve two functions for those writing the messages: (1) Sensemaking; and (2) Continuing Bonds, or upholding relational continuity, with the deceased.","833":"This study compared the written memorials on websites posted by survivors of suicide with those written by people who had lost a significant other from natural causes, using a computer program, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Thirteen significant differences were identified and, in addition, 13 differences that approach significance. Memorials written by survivors of suicide had longer sentences and used longer words. They had more death-related words, fewer references to the self or to the deceased (\"you\"), and more words reflective of anger and sadness. The results suggest the deaths from suicide had a more profound impact on the survivors than the natural deaths and results in greater emotional distress.","834":"Botswana, a country in sub-Saharan Africa, has been in the midst of an HIV\/AIDs pandemic that has halted its previously lengthening life expectancy trend. However, one group to escape immediate effects on falling life span is the oldest old age group (&gt; 80 years). Their roles in the community due to the pandemic, however, have changed. Place of death is an important consideration in end-of-life care for older adults, and one which has been well studied in the Global North. The purpose of this article is to determine where Botswana's oldest old die (home or hospital), and to see whether cause of death, gender, or residence in a city, town, or rural area is associated with place of death. We use death certificate data from 2005 and 2006 to describe where the oldest old Batswana (the name for the people of Botswana) died, home or hospital. Two-thirds died at home. The mean age at death was 88.46 (+\/- 6.21) years; more were female (56.9%); and of known causes of death, cardiovascular disease was the leading cause (16.8%). Most stated causes of death (62.4%) were listed as \"unknown.\" Most oldest-old Batswana died in rural areas (70.1%), and in rural areas, proportionally more oldest old died at home compared to cities and towns. On multivariate analysis, being a woman &gt; 80 years of age at death predicted home death. Future longitudinal study needs to determine preferences of place of death and the quality of death of Batswana &gt; 80 years, especially women.","835":"Many childhood deaths in the United States occur in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and parents have special needs in this death context. As an interdisciplinary research team, we discuss conceptual and design issues encountered in creating a new instrument, the Bereaved Parent Needs Assessment-PICU, for assessing parents' needs in this setting. Using a qualitative approach, our team previously explored how the culture and related ways of providing care in one urban Midwestern children's hospital PICU affected parents' bereavement needs and experiences. We describe using this qualitative foundation in the development of a new quantitative instrument to more widely validate and measure bereaved parents' needs around the time of a child's death across multiple PICUs. We highlight a series of issues that warrant consideration in designing a research instrument for this vulnerable population including setting and context, format and content, temporality, recruitment, and content expertise.","836":"Effective evidence-based intervention for traumatic bereavement is one of the current major research issues in the field of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents. The \"Writing for Recovery\" group intervention is a new treatment approach developed by the Children and War Foundation for traumatized and bereaved children and adolescents after disasters. The purpose of this project was an empirical examination of this intervention with 12- to 18-year-old war bereaved Afghani refugees. Eighty-eight war bereaved Afghani refugees were screened using the Traumatic Grief Inventory for Children (TGIC). From those with the highest total score, 61 were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n = 29) or control group (n = 32). The experimental group received six sessions of group training on 3 consecutive days in their school. The difference of TGIC scores between the experimental group in pretest and posttest was significant (p = 0.001). Results of analysis of covariance also showed a significant effect of Writing for Recovery on the experimental group (p &lt; 0.001). It is concluded that \"Writing for Recovery\" is an effective group intervention for bereaved children and adolescents after disasters.","837":"Prior studies conducted in the area of Advance Care Directive document completion in African Americans have primarily targeted the elderly who are either institutionalized in skilled nursing facilities or are members of faith communities. Few studies have been done concerning barriers to Advance Care Directive document completion that include non-elderly African Americans. The purpose of this study was to identify the common barriers to advance care directive document completion across generations of African Americans ages 25-84. Using convenience sampling among various Baptist denominations of the African-American faith community of Buncombe County, North Carolina, 40 individuals ranging in age from 25-84 participated in multiple focus group sessions. Findings revealed participants shared three common barriers: 1) surrogate decision-making, 2) lack of education concerning advance care directive discussions and completion, and 3) fear and denial. Also revealed were barriers that varied across generations: 1) fatalism, 2) mistrust of the health care system, 3) spirituality, and 4) economics.","838":"This article describes research that was conducted to articulate interventions with families experiencing grief. Using an interpretive methodology framed by philosophical hermeneutics allowed for a depth of understanding of these therapeutic conversations. The research findings offer explanations of the role of time in relation to grief, particularly the timing of interventions, and describe the significance of working with multiple family members during therapeutic interventions. This research was unique in that it approached grief counseling with a family focus, the participants were interviewed for this study several years after the therapeutic encounter, and the underlying theoretical framework for the interventions focused on grief as a lifelong, life-changing experience, rather than a finite, pathology-laden event.","839":"Data analyzed in this article is part of a study conducted to explore grief support groups in Norway. Participants that fulfilled the criteria of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) were compared with participants that did not in order to explore whether they differed on satisfaction and experiences with participation. To allow for comparison, a subsample of 22 participants that fulfilled the criteria of PGD were drawn from the total of 262 participants. Demographic and loss-related variables were analyzed to explore factors associated with PGD. Fulfillment of PGD was then analyzed to explore the group's effect on life quality and overall satisfaction. The main finding is that participants who fulfill the criteria of prolonged grief are in general less satisfied with the groups and report less positive effect on life quality. We also found age- and gender-differences regarding fulfillment of PGD, with older bereaved women especially at risk of developing symptoms of PGD.","840":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe processes and strategies used by women to cope after pregnancy loss. Twenty women with a history of involuntary pregnancy loss were interviewed. All of the women were in the last month of a subsequent pregnancy, married or partnered, and most were EuroAmerican or Asian American and had completed college. Taped interviews, fieldnotes, and analytical notes were transcribed then subsequently coded and developed in individual or team sessions. Construction and confirmation of the categories and related themes derived from the data was a collaborative process. Three themes were revealed that described the coping behaviors used by the women: being myself, connecting with others, and avoiding and pretending. The core concept of connectedness and coping after involuntary pregnancy loss was further validated in this study. The purpose of this study was to describe processes and strategies that facilitate coping for 20 women, pregnant subsequent to an involuntary pregnancy loss (IPL). Involuntary pregnancy loss (IPL) refers to miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, fetal deaths, and stillbirths (Van &amp; Meleis, 2003). This current study was designed to replicate two prior qualitative studies, with African-American women, by the author (Patterson, 2000; Van, 2001). Based on the author's previous work, a theoretical framework entitled \"A Model of Living with Grief after Pregnancy Loss\" was constructed (Patterson, 2000). For the current study, a more diverse sample was used to potentially expand the applicability of the Model of Living with Grief after Pregnancy Loss to women who are of races other than African American.","841":"Past research has shown that traditional Chinese death beliefs, which mostly consisted of superstitious thoughts, are related to death anxiety. However, other studies have shown that superstitions may help people cope with uncertainty and, therefore, reduce uncertainty-induced anxiety. The role of superstitions, whether related to heightened death anxiety or reduced death anxiety, is unclear. This study attempted to address the knowledge gap by examining the relationships among superstitions and Chinese death beliefs on death anxiety in the Chinese context. One hundred twenty-four undergraduates in Hong Kong completed measures of superstition (R-PBS), death anxiety (MFODS), and Chinese death beliefs scale. Superstition was found to be predictor of death anxiety, as expected. With superstitions highly prevalent in Chinese societies, the study has practical implications in end-of-life care, bereavement support, and death education in the Chinese context.","842":"This article considers the role that music plays in contemporary UK funerals and the meaning that the funeral music has for bereaved families. It is based on findings from a recently completed study of 46 funerals funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council. Music contributes to the public ceremony and the personal existential quest of the bereaved. It is important to both the content and process of the contemporary funeral, an event of deep cultural significance in our response as individuals and communities to death and the loss of a significant relationship. There is evidence that for many people, the music chosen and used also evokes and conveys their spirituality. Spirituality may not be intrinsic to the music but spiritual experience may result from the meaning that the music has for that particular person.","843":"This qualitative study is the follow-up to a quantitative controlled study which showed a decrease in childhood traumatic grief and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in parentally bereaved children participating in a bereavement camp. The purpose of this study was to identify the healing components of this camp model. Semi-structured interviews with 19 children and 13 parents\/guardians were conducted 3 to 9 months after participation in the bereavement camp. Therapeutic Interventions and Traditional Camp Activities emerged as themes. The themes are discussed in relation to previous research as are limitations of the study and the implications for theory, practice, and future research.","844":"Islamic tradition tends to present death rituals in a quite univocal way, as the actual ritual practice shows to be far more diverse and flexible. This study focuses on the particular ritual of the cleansing of the deceased as it is practiced by a variety of Muslims in a small town context in The Netherlands. The presented vignettes are drawn on qualitative research data from interviews and (participant) observations. They are presented to draw attention to the different contexts that shape the religious and ritual practice of a variety of Muslims in The Netherlands. To develop an eye for this common praxis, it is important not only to be aware of the religious dimensions but also of the social dimensions. By offering insights into the actual practices it aims to offer tangible leads to professionals for a more tailor-made care for Muslim patients and their relatives.","845":"Scholars sometimes stress that it is important to know the individual meaning of suicide and the cultural meaning of suicide, but the meaning of these terms remains unclear. The present article discusses this problem and suggests that the individual meaning of suicide is best based on the motives for suicide, while the cultural meaning of suicide is best rooted in the lay theories of suicide in which the members of cultures and subcultures believe.","846":"Sudden deaths leave families in crisis and interacting with many professionals from notification through to burial. Whether to view the deceased is often central to discussion. Practice guidelines have evolved over time regarding where, when, how, and why viewing should or should not occur. Unfortunately, there is much contradiction in existing recommendations and a marked absence of a supporting evidence base for the practice of viewing itself, and the influence of this practice on the overall bereavement process. Using a qualitative approach, this study explored the perspectives and experiences of the suddenly bereaved with respect to: viewing or not having viewed; whether or not their viewing experiences have impacted on their bereavement process; and explored particular aspects of their experience such as interactions with various professionals. Results of this study are clustered and presented under three core themes: viewing specifics; intrapersonal responses; and professional interactions.","847":"This study is aimed at identifying central themes of bereavement. A qualitative approach was employed in the analyses of interviews with 22 bereaved parents. The analyses yielded four central issues or themes of bereavement, each with its own set of sub-themes or categories, as the narrative demanded. The first of these themes, pertaining to the life of the family before the death of a child had taken place, was named the risk factor. Circumstances leading up to the death, surrounding the death, the cause of death, and the events following the death were coded as bereavement circumstances. The grief reactions codes were divided into categories of emotional, physical, behavioral, relational, spiritual, and cognitive reactions, as described by the participants. Finally, the mourning codes described the mechanisms employed by the participants in their attempts to survive and continue living after the death. These findings can be used in the training of support workers and the development of bereavement interventions.","848":"This article emphasizes the importance of studies which look at changes and similarities in mourning over time. It argues that relevant evidence can come from creative fiction as well as from other sources, provided that this is analyzed rigorously in terms of structures and patterns. As an illustration of this approach, it examines the evidence in recurring features of Shakespeare's plays that his writing was deeply and lastingly affected by the death of his only son Hamnet, a twin, at the age of 11, and identifies five motifs which support this interpretation: the resurrected child or sibling; androgynous and twin-like figures; a growing emphasis on father-daughter relationships; paternal guilt; family division and reunion. The article suggests that this approach could be applied to other instances where a body of creative writing shows traces of overt or buried grief.","849":"Preliminary data on the test criteria of the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Orientation Toward Dying and Death Inventory (MODDI-F\/chin) are presented. Data from a sample of Hong Kong college students (N = 256) revealed internal consistencies of the eight subtests between .68 and .91, on the whole favorable shape of frequency distributions, and evidence of construct as well as differential validity of the instrument. The use of the full set of 47 items is recommended for the time being.","850":"Many indigenous African religions, specifically that of the Yoruba of Nigeria, the Bamana and Malinke of Mali, and the Nuer of southern Sudan, are characterized by a system of spiritual beliefs surrounding the life and death of twins. Separation by death poses an extreme threat to the soul(s) of twins, and many rituals and customs designed to sustain the spirit of surviving twins are widely practiced. Despite twin loss being overlooked in Western psychological studies of grief, recent research and in-depth interviews of bereaved twins clearly identifies the unique nature of losing a twin, and the importance of acknowledging this distinction in the surviving twin's ability to cope with the death. The spiritual practices of the Yoruba, Bamana, Malinke, and Nuer are conducive to dealing with the specific nature of twin loss. They take into account the uniqueness of the twinship experience, and provide material for reflection on healing approaches outside the traditional parameters of psychology.","851":"This article examines how varieties of the continuing relationship to the deceased child are associated with life functioning among bereaved parents. The research employed a longitudinal design utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research methodology. Six bereaved parents who lost sons in war and who had extensive interview material and research protocols spaced 10 years apart were selected for this study. Half had improved over time and half had not improved or deteriorated. Analyses of the ongoing relationship to the deceased focused upon: (a) perceptions of the deceased and (b) nature of the ongoing relationship to the deceased son. On perception, parents who improved tended to describe their sons in very favorable terms. The parents whose condition remained static or deteriorated tended to describe their sons less positively, and with superficial and shallow descriptions. Regarding the nature of the ongoing relationship, parents whose condition improved over the years describe a close and significant relationship with the son. We conclude that while the relationship to the son continues for all the bereaved parents, it is how the deceased is recollected that is associated with the direction of bereavement outcome.","852":"In Thailand spirit houses are often established at places of fatal accidents, but these are generally anonymous. Personalized roadside memorials for accident victims are rare. This article analyses three roadside memorials, located on main roads in northeastern Thailand, in a comparative framework. Like in the contemporary West, such memorials commemorate a suddenly and violently killed person, but manifest a dynamics very different from that of Western roadside memorials: rather than private and temporary, these are permanent shrines, in which the spirit of the deceased is worshipped and supplicated by members of the public. The spirits and their shrines tend to become incorporated into the popular Thai magico-religious complex. While the literature offers a binary distinction between formal public monuments and informal, private and temporary (roadside) memorials, it is suggested that the informal, but public and permanent memorial shrines in Thailand exemplify a third type of edifices to commemorate the deceased in road accidents.","853":"Using religious orientation paradigm, this twofold study examined the relationship between euthanasia attitude and religiosity, and compared single-item and multi-item scales of euthanasia attitude. Three hundred students were asked whether they view euthanasia as moral. In addition, participants completed the Euthanasia Attitude Scale (EAS) and Religious Orientation Scale-Revised. Results indicated that intrinsic religiosity was the strongest correlate of negative attitudes toward euthanasia. This type of religiosity explained additional variance when added to the two types of extrinsic religiosity (social, personal), but the reverse was not the case. The fairly strong correlation of intrinsic religiosity with the EAS provides evidence of construct validity for the EAS and proved it to be a better measure for assessing euthanasia attitude, rather than the single-item scale.","854":"Students enrolled in health profession courses require grief education so that, upon graduation, they are able to meet the needs of clients living with loss and grief. We investigated grief and loss education in six Australian university programs--medicine, nursing, counseling, psychology, social work, and occupational therapy--drawing from course documents and face-to-face interviews with key staff and final-year students. Only the counseling course included a dedicated grief and loss unit. The nursing, medicine, and occupational therapy courses emphasized end-of-life issues rather than a breadth of bereavement experiences. The social work course taught grief as a socially-constructed practice and the psychology course focused on grief and loss in addiction. Several factors influenced the delivery of grief education, including staffing, time, placement opportunities, student feedback, and needs of each profession. The study provides an indication as to how future health professionals are prepared for grief and loss issues in their practice.","855":"When a student dies in a school setting many school professionals step in and offer grief services to the students affected. In the classrooms, teachers are expected to step in and help the students grieve; however, equivalent support for teachers seems to be lacking. This study explored the lived experiences of teachers who experienced the unanticipated death of a student. From the analysis, the following themes emerged: (a) releasing feelings, (b) resources (c) lost academic time and redirection, and (d) honoring the memory. The results of this study reinforce the need for training for school teachers to help them better cope with the death of a student. Particularly, school professionals are called on to be proactive in creating a model to have in place to actively support teachers dealing with the grief and loss of a student.","856":"While the nature of their experience is unknown, hospice workers may unconsciously strive for encounters with death as a way of healing themselves and preparing for death. The purpose of this case study was to explore the psychological experience of hospice workers, whose repeated encounters with death may affect their own psyche. The study integrated psychobiographical and hermeneutic methods. Personal growth was conceptually defined as a process of turning inward and integration of personal experiences into a larger reality. The elements supporting personal growth were present in 53 to 88% of the 17 hospice workers of the sample. The emerging themes were interconnectedness, suffering and sacrifice, and birth and rebirth. Caring to the dying becomes practice for one's own death and a form of renewal in the life of the hospice workers.","857":"There is no part of human existence that loss and grief do not reach, and the workplace is no exception to this. This article is therefore concerned with some of the implications of loss and grief in work settings in general and for workplace leaders in particular. By way of example, it explores in particular the needs of bereaved caregivers returning to work and the potential for stigma to emerge in relation to employment and bereavement. Central to the article is an argument in favor of the need for change within the workplace, specifically within the structures and systems that support bereaved caregivers returning to work. This article critically reflects on the leadership management challenge of supporting bereaved caregivers returning to, or seeking, work and addressing the problem of stigma in relation to employment and bereavement. Some structural and policy changes are highlighted to assist employers and bereaved caregivers faced with this situation.","858":"Historically, death took place at home where family held vigil around the dying patient. Today, family presence is an important feature of death and dying in hospital settings. We used hermeneutic phenomenology to explore experiences of being present at the hospital death of a loved one. We conducted in-depth, face-to-face interviews with 78 recently bereaved next-of-kin of veterans who died in 6 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers in the Southeast United States. Two major themes emerged: 1) \"settling in,\" characteristic of the experiences of wives and daughters in the initial phase of the patient's hospitalization; and 2) \"gathering around,\" characteristic of the experiences of a wider array of family members as the patient neared death. An in-depth understanding of experiences of next-of-kin present at the hospital death of a loved one can increase staff awareness of family's needs and empower staff to develop policies and procedures for supporting family members.","859":"The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) is an important tool for measuring impulsivity in suicide research. This study aimed to assess psychometric characteristics of Chinese version of BIS-11 in suicides and controls of rural China. Data of 200 pairs of suicide cases and living controls were collected by psychological autopsy method. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of BIS-11 were 0.936 for suicides, and 0.892 for living controls. Convergent validity analysis demonstrated a significantly positive correlation between the scores of BIS-11 with the scores of Beck Hopelessness Scale and Trait Anxiety Inventory. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the BIS-11 structure was basically suitable in rural China. With its high reliability, few items in BIS-11 may need a modification in order to further improve the construct validity of this instrument for suicide research in rural China.","860":"Multiple bereaved adult children, as siblings, have rarely been studied. We expand the paradigm of bereavement research to explore the ways that two sisters describe the experience and meaning of the death of their elderly father. The two sisters each participated in two separate qualitative ethnographic interviews, followed by standard qualitative analyses of the transcribed narratives. The findings yield contrasting perspectives of the sisters' disparate views of their family, of their father, and their views of each other, that provide insight into the complexity of the sharp differences in their reactions to their father's death. Their views of their father's death reflected their particular relationship with their father, their non-shared experiences over the life course, and their personal world views. Differences and contradictions in the views of multiple siblings can broaden our understanding of bereavement and of the processes central to parent-child ties at the end of life.","861":"This study aims at investigating whether a gratitude induction procedure can reduce death anxiety and promote emotional well-being. Ninety Chinese undergraduate students were randomly assigned into one of three experimental conditions: gratitude, hassle, and neutral. In each condition, participants were instructed to spend 15-20 minutes to reflect on past events and to write up to five events of the designated category. Subsequently, they responded to measures of death anxiety and affect. Results showed that those in the gratitude condition reported much lower death anxiety than those in the neutral or the hassle group. However, gratitude had no effect on positive or negative affect. The findings suggest that the effect of gratitude may be specific to death anxiety, which does not occur in the context of the enhancement of overall emotional well-being.","862":"In The Netherlands, the number of body donor registrations has been increasing for several years. Body donors are people who register at an anatomical institute to donate their entire body, after death, for scientific education and research. Although only 0.1% of the Dutch population is registered as a body donor, this is sufficient to realize the anatomical demand of about 650 bodies annually. Due to the recent rise of registrations many anatomical institutes have (temporarily) stopped registering new donors to prevent a surplus of bodies. Based on a large body donor survey (n=759) and in-depth anthropological interviews with 20 body donors, we try to give an explanation for the rising registration numbers. We argue that the choice for body donation in contemporary, individualized Dutch society is an autonomous way to give meaning and sense to life and death outside the framework of institutionalized religion.","863":"The aims of this study were to analyze the relationships between death attitudes and perceived emotional intelligence in a sample of nursing students, and to determine whether there are differences between different academic years with regard to both emotional intelligence and death attitudes. The participants were 243 nursing students. They all responded voluntarily and anonymously to a questionnaire that assessed the following constructs: fear of death, death anxiety, death depression, death obsession, and emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and mood repair). Students' scores on fear of death of others subscale (p &lt; .05) decreased significantly across the 3 years of the nursing degree program and increased significantly on emotional clarity (p &lt; .05), a dimension of emotional intelligence. The multiple linear regression analyses confirmed the predictive value of attention, clarity, and mood repair regarding levels of fear of death of others. The importance of including emotional skills training and death-education programs as part of professional nursing curricula are discussed.","864":"The concept of a \"good death\" reflects an individual's positive perceptions of and expectations about death. What constitutes a good death varies based on factors such as sociocultural norms, time, space, and even individual characteristics such as age, culture, and health status. Kehl (2006) maintained that this definitional ambiguity has impeded the implementation of measures intended to appropriately assist the dying because it has been difficult to determine what clinical evaluations and caregiving practices should be used to provide patients with more than \"a good death\" as it is medically defined. Thus, a more comprehensive and systematic conceptual understanding of this concept is urgently necessary.","865":"A child's adjustment to the death of a parent is greatly influenced by the surviving parent's ability to attend to his or her own grief-related needs, to create and sustain a consistent and nurturing environment, and to encourage the child to express distressing or conflicting thoughts, feelings, and fantasies about the loss. Yet, the surviving parent's grief often compromises their ability to parent consistently and empathically. This article will illustrate how, by providing a holding environment for whole families, clinicians can help parents to facilitate children's grief reactions and, thus, mitigate long-term adverse mental health outcomes. Family Matters programs, designed and implemented in a community agency, use a holistic approach to family support and treatment in a milieu setting. Combining therapeutic work with surviving spouses and bereaved children supports children's grief while facilitating newly single parents as they adapt the structure of family life. When clinical work with families begins before the ill parent dies, the clinicians may build a relationship with the dying parent, prepare the child and surviving spouse for life after loss, and support continuity in family culture. We introduce a curriculum for simultaneously supporting bereaved children and parents, present a series of common challenges faced by surviving parents, and suggest avenues for intervention research.","866":"One of the main responsibilities of teachers is to help individual students cope with life difficulties such as grief following a death. However, very little research explores teachers' views on death, dying, and how they handle grief and loss in schools. This study aims to explore university teachers' knowledge and attitudes on dying, death, and death education. Fifteen university teachers were recruited using a qualitative method. This study reveals that most teachers' views on death and related issues are largely affected by their death experiences, religious beliefs, professional background, and the mass media. Although they have a general negative response toward death and dying, some teachers begin to affirm their meanings of life and death. Most teachers agree that they do not feel adequate about managing and teaching on life and death issues, so they strongly support including death education in the formal programs in Hong Kong.","867":"Suicide and homicide are among the leading causes of death for young African-American men; however, little is known about how family members cope with these types of deaths. This exploratory phenomenological study examines the traumatic loss and coping experiences of a purposive convenience sample of 12 immediate African-American surviving family members with a combined experience of 13 deaths, 8 suicides and 5 homicides. Novel aspects of suicide and homicide survivor phenomenon were identified, including Survivor Responses and Reactions, Coping Strategies, and Survivor Service Needs. The implications for research and for those providing services to surviving African-American families are discussed.","868":"Two studies are reported which explore romance as a means of terror management for participants with secure and insecure attachment styles. Mikulincer and Florian (2000) have shown that while mortality salience increases the desire for intimacy in securely attached individuals, the insecurely attached use cultural world views rather than close relationships to cope with fear of death. Study 1 used the romantic belief scale to compare the effects of attachment style and mortality salience on the cultural aspects of close relationships and showed that the only the insecurely attached were more romantic following mortality salience. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated that this difference was not simply due to lower self-esteem in the insecurely attached. The additional inclusion of the Relationship assessment questionnaire failed to provide any evidence that the securely attached were affected by the mortality salience manipulation, even on a more interpersonal measure.","869":"The assessment of suicide risk in institutionalized older people has received less attention in comparison with those not institutionalized. The studies carried out show contradictory data on the prevalence of risk in this population group. The current work estimates the prevalence of suicide risk through a Bayesian analysis and studies the risk factors of this behavior in a group of 110 institutionalized older people. A prevalence of 38.4% is obtained, and an association between suicide risk and the factors depression and perception of health. The results indicate to us the necessity for actions directed at decreasing the suicide rate in geriatric homes.","870":"Two aspects of the concept of disenfranchised grief are examined: its binary assumption that grief is either enfranchised or disenfranchised; and its emancipatory agenda that grief should not be socially regulated. Focusing on the mourner's relationship to the deceased, we argue that social norms about the legitimacy of bereavement are not binary (yes-no), but are scalar or hierarchical, or even more complex still. We report on a tool for identifying hierarchies of loss, and describe the hierarchy identified by this tool in one British study. If norms about loss are not binary but hierarchical, how has disenfranchised grief--which claims to be a theory of norms--become an uncontested concept within bereavement research and clinical practice? We point to its rhetorical value in the postmodern politics of grief and its seductive emancipatory symbolism within the clinic; its value both for clinical practice and for empirical research into bereavement norms, however, may be limited.","871":"In this article, we reviewed results of research on near-death experiences (NDEs) over the past 3 decades and examined the effect of viewing the hour-long 2002 BBC documentary The Day I Died: The Mind, the Brain, and Near-Death Experiences on accurate knowledge about near-death experiences among advanced undergraduates at a southwestern university. In a quasi-experimental research design, the experimental group completed a 20-item questionnaire before and after viewing the documentary (n = 66; 45 females, 21 males), and the waitlist control group completed the questionnaire as pre- and posttest before viewing the documentary (n = 39; 36 female, 3 male). The two groups' scores at pretest were not significantly different (p &gt; .05). Group by occasion repeated measures ANOVA revealed the experimental group's posttest scores moved significantly in the direction of correctness with a large effect size (p &lt; .001; eta2 = .56), whereas waitlist control group posttest scores remained similar to pretest scores. We discuss two exceptions to the effectiveness of the documentary and recommendations for educators using it as well as for future research.","872":"From the magnificent to the mundane to the sublime, grave inscriptions serve as remembrances of the dead and provide concrete evidence of the thoughts and values of the day. In this study, 1,214 grave inscriptions (N = 1,214) dated 1900 to 2009 were examined for evidence of secularization and changes in attitude toward death. Using set criteria, the researchers categorized grave inscriptions in terms of language used (sacred\/secular) and acceptance of death (acceptance\/other). Binary logistic regression models revealed significantly more use of sacred language and significantly less acceptance of death over the past 110 years. Findings from these analyses suggest that: (a) secularization may not be as pervasive as thought, particularly with respect to death; and (b) as death has become increasingly medicalized and marginalized, society has grown less accepting of the finitude of life. These findings are further discussed in light of the continued evolution of death memorials.","873":"The aim of this study was to identify and describe resilience qualities in families after losing a child. Questionnaires, including an open-ended question, were utilized to collect data independently from the parents and siblings of the deceased in 89 Belgian families. The results indicate that family strengths in general, and commitment to the family in particular, helped the families' adaptation after the loss. In addition, the adaptation process after the loss was aided if the family members viewed the crisis as a challenge. Both the siblings and the parents indicated that the extent to which a family experienced support from the community was directly related to family adaptation after the loss. Redefining the situation and utilizing social support from friends and family were underlined as effective family coping strategies. The findings could be used in interventions to promote family resilience, thereby affirming the reparative potential of families.","874":"Six clinical psychologists were interviewed regarding their experiences with client suicide. Interviewee's responses offered the following insights: (a) all their experiences met the criteria for prolonged grief; (b) the respective work settings significantly influenced the clinician's recovery process; and (c) male clinicians (in contrast to female respondents) reported no personal impact from the client's suicide. Finally and surprisingly, all participating psychologists did not question their clinical skills after the suicide, citing rather their understanding of the client's choice to suicide being outside of their control. Implications for clinical training, practice, and research are addressed.","875":"This comparative survey contrasted 571 parents who lost children to various death causes: 48 to drug-related deaths and overdoses, 462 to suicide, 24 to natural death cases, and 37 to mostly accidental death cases. Groups were compared in terms of grief difficulties, mental health problems, posttraumatic stress, and stigmatization. Results did not show any appreciable differences in these respects between the suicide bereaved parents and those losing children to drug-related deaths. However, when the suicide and drug-related death survivors were specifically contrasted against accidental and natural death loss cases, a consistent pattern emerged showing the former group was consistently more troubled by grief and mental health problems than the latter two sub-groups. These differences remained when controls of time since the loss and gender differences were employed as covariates. These findings suggest that the powerful and intense stigma against drug use and mental illness, shared among the public-at-large, imposes challenges in healing of immense proportion for these parents as they find less compassionate responses from their significant others, following their losses.","876":"In the era of managed care, evidence-based practice, and short term, solution focused interventions, clinicians in agency based settings generally do not have the luxury of long-term contact with bereaved children. Although a substantial, yet controversial, literature argues that children cannot fully resolve early loss until adulthood, limited attention is given to how children's understandings of early loss shift as their cognitive capacities mature. This article argues the emotional experience of grief shifts: 1) as children grapple with both normative life changes and the tasks of mourning, and 2) as their cognitive and emotional development allow them to understand and question aspects of their deceased parent's life and death in new ways. This article will present an overview of longitudinal and cross-sectional research on the long-term impact of childhood grief. We then suggest the ways bereaved children and adolescents revisit and reintegrate the loss of a parent as their emotional, moral, and cognitive capacities mature and as normative ego-centrism and magical thinking decline. To demonstrate these ideas, we draw on the case of a parentally bereaved boy and his family presenting across agency-based and private-practice work over the course of 14 years. This case suggests the need for coordinated care for children who are moving beyond the initial trauma of parental loss into various stages of grief and reintegration. While the loss of a parent is permanent and unchanging, the process is not: it is part of the child's ongoing experience. (Worden, 1996, p. 16).","877":"This study aimed to understand the current inclinations toward depression and compulsion for members of four different religious groups, and to predict religious beliefs along the suicide path through analyzing the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts for members of these religious groups. Participants in this cross-sectional study, which adopted purposive sampling, were members of Christianity, Catholicism, Buddhism, and Taoism in northern Taiwan. In the case of suicide experiences, suicides among people one knows, and tendency toward compulsion and depression, there are statistical differences between the four religions. According to the results, some people with suicidal tendency will attend religious activities; therefore, we predict that religious beliefs play an important role in suicide prevention.","878":"Participants' perceptions of psychological autopsy interviews were investigated in post-conflict Northern Uganda. Data were derived out of their responses in the debriefing session after the formal interviews. These responses were subjected to Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The majority of the participants were positive about the interview as reflected in the two broad themes: positivation of the situation through the possibility of helping others and opportunity for personal development through sharing. To some few participants the interview aroused guilt, self-reproach, and anger and reactivated painful memories. As regards suicide postvention, the findings implied that not much has been done to help the bereaved by suicide in this region, and few resources for such efforts are currently available. However, the bereaved are ready to contribute toward the fight against suicide in their communities. Hence, it is argued that a community-based mental health and Primary Health Care approaches should be encouraged in this context.","879":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to further examine the lived experiences of families that faced the sudden loss of a child. Six mothers that had previously participated approximately 9 years ago in the study entitled \"The Lived Experience of the Unexpected Death of a Child\" were interviewed. All of the mothers were Caucasian and had achieved a high school or greater level of education. Taped interviews and field notes were transcribed for data display. Together, two raters completed data reduction and coding for theme identification and categorization. Six themes were revealed that described helpful coping behaviors used by the mothers: positive beliefs, faith beliefs, everlasting love, pleasant remembrances, social engagement, and staying connected. Two themes, avoidance and rumination, described the behaviors that did not help the mothers cope with their loss. Finally, answers to the questions regarding acceptance and healing time were also revealed.","880":"The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) is being revised. A proposed revision hotly debated is to remove what is known as the exclusionary criterion and allow clinicians to diagnose a person with a major depressive episode within the early days and weeks following a death. The Executive Committee of the Association for Death Education and Counseling (ADEC) commissioned its Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) to examine the debate over removing the exclusionary criterion and provide a written report. The DSM-IV-TR classifies bereavement as a clinical condition that is not a mental disorder. The exclusionary criterion states that within the first 2 months of the onset of bereavement a person should not be diagnosed as having major depression unless certain symptoms not characteristic of a normal grief reaction are present. We note these symptoms when discussing the exclusionary criterion. In the report we identify the features that comprise the exclusionary criterion, examine reasons (including research conclusions and clinical concerns) given for retaining and for eliminating the exclusionary criterion, offer extensive comments from experienced licensed clinicians about the issues involved, discuss diagnostic and treatment implications, and offer specific recommendations for ADEC to implement.","881":"Following perinatal loss, a type of ambiguous loss, bereaved couples struggle with and experience distress due to various forms of ambiguity. Moreover, the juxtaposition of their grief with society's minimization often disenfranchises them from traditional grieving processes. The purpose of this study was to explore sources of ambiguity and disenfranchised grief related to perinatal loss. Audio-taped interviews with 13 bereaved couples at 2, 6, and 13 months following the death of their fetus or infant were analyzed. Several categories of ambiguity and disenfranchised grief emerged, pertaining to: (a) the viability of the pregnancy; (b) the physical process of pregnancy loss; (c) making arrangements for the remains; and (d) sharing the news. This study uncovers the many sources of ambiguity and disenfranchised grief that bereaved couples face in interactions with family, friends, society, and healthcare professionals. These insights may inform healthcare professionals in their attempts to ease distress related to perinatal loss.","882":"Online grief communities represent relatively new forms of peer support. However, the degree to which they are helpful for individual grieving processes is unknown. To date, no research has evaluated the type or quality of support exchanged in online grief communities. To begin to address these questions, this study analyzed 564 messages from internet grief websites to: (1) classify the type of helping skills used, and (2) extract themes contained in the content of the messages. Messages selected for analysis were the first response to an original post, assuming they would be the first effort to provide support to a grieving individual. Results revealed a majority of responses contained self-disclosure. Themes in the messages suggested provision of more than \"one-way\" support; messages themes also included exchanging hope for the future by sharing one's own story, validating the grief experience, providing resources, and exchanging psychosocial support. Clinical implications and research recommendations are discussed.","883":"Support groups are often used to help individuals cope with challenging and unusual life circumstances through narration. Yet, little is known about specific meta-communication within a support group setting and in what ways these interactions may benefit participants. This study uncovers narrative themes that were expressed during a series of support group meetings specific to bereaved parents. Three central narratives were revealed in the analysis including the death story narrative, coping\/negotiating narrative, and connecting through communication with others narrative. This research underscores the vital outlet that the support group serves for participants and the communicative means by which subjective healing can occur.","884":"The field of bereavement and grief has been expanding to recognise the potential for growth following the loss of a loved one. This study sought to examine the effect of the relationship to the deceased and perceptions of the severity of the trauma on dimensions of posttraumatic growth. Participants were 146 people who had lost either: a) a first degree relative, b) a second degree relative, or c) a non-related friend. Results demonstrated that both severity and the relationship to the bereaved differentiate posttraumatic growth outcomes. For example, participants who had lost a first degree relative reported higher levels of growth than those who had lost a second degree relative. Consistent with previous research in general trauma populations, the more severe the loss was rated, the higher the levels of growth. Implications for practice are discussed.","885":"This article explores, using Wilensky's Model of Professionalization, the emergence of professional organizations within the thanatology. The authors review the history of four organizations--The Foundation of Thanatology, Ars Moriendi, The Forum for Death Education and Counseling (now the Association for Death Education and Counseling: A Thanatology Organization [ADEC]), and The International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement (IWG). The authors speculate on some of the reasons that the first two failed while IWG and ADEC remain viable-while noting challenges that these remaining thanatological organizations will experience as they seek to continue to stay relevant.","886":"Drawing on George Ritzer's sociological concept of McDonaldization, this article explores the transformation of burial practices in Kuwait. It is argued that traditional, religious, and private ways of dealing with death have been modernized using the fast-food model of McDonald's. This article examines Islamic teachings on burial and how that model has been applied to the traditional Muslim funerary services, including cemetery management, grave excavation, funeral prayers, burial, and condolences, to make them more efficient vis-a-vis more profitable. Based on personal observations and random interviews, the study finds that the state bureaucracy in Kuwait has made burial rituals more efficient, standardized, calculable, and controlled. Furthermore, several associated irrationalities are also considered. Findings suggest that some individuals may not be happy with these changes but there is no popular resistance to McDonaldization of the burial practices, probably due to the authoritarian and welfare nature of the State of Kuwait.","887":"Examination of 1,051 completed suicides from an Australian state showed that 33% left a suicide note. Those leaving a suicide note were more involved in interpersonal conflicts (including divorce), were less often psychiatrically disturbed, and were less likely to be under medical supervision. The large number of differences suggests that it may not be possible to learn about suicide in general from a study of suicide notes alone.","888":"Gall et al. (2005) developed a framework for spirituality by adapting and applying the transactional model of stress and coping, which is an interactive and fluid process spurred by a stressor involving spiritual appraisal, person factors, spiritual connections, spiritual coping behavior, and meaning-making impacting well-being. The components of the framework are examined through five cancer survivor narratives. The results showed that the components of the framework were experienced by the survivors, for example, various spiritual problem-solving styles were used, indication of spiritual connections to nature, others, and the transcendent. Meaning-making was common as they faced the life-threatening disease which often altered their worldview. The spirituality of the participants is reflected in the spiritual framework and the framework embraces these survivor experiences. This study has limitations due to its qualitative nature and small sample size.","889":"In this article we conduct a textual analysis of memorial websites created by mothers who have experienced a loss due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Using an online Internet ethnographic approach, we reviewed a series of 20 sites in an attempt to analyze the motivations of the site creators as manifested in their online projects. We spent time on the sites, moving through all facets of them, following links, and experiencing them the way a visitor would encounter them. In this virtual exploration we uncovered personal narratives, community building, religious imagery, and numerous examples of social networking. We also analyzed guest books in order to understand who visits these sites and their reasons for doing so. We conclude that development of these sites are a process that helps some mothers in their grief and gives them a focus and activity that is helpful and perhaps healing. More importantly perhaps is the potential for community building and networking that this type of activity allows. As an extension of a real-world memorial such as a gravesite, a virtual mourning space provides more in the way of these types of communications. Our work suggests that memorial websites constructed by SIDS parents help in meaning and identity reconstruction after loss.","890":"I evaluate the extent to which ethnic disparities in advance care planning reflect cultural and religious attitudes and experience with the painful deaths of loved ones. Data are from a sample of 293 chronically ill older adults who are seeking care at one of two large medical centers in urban New Jersey. Blacks and Hispanics are significantly less likely than Whites to have a living will, a durable power of attorney for health care (DPAHC), and to have discussed their end of life treatment preferences. Multivariate analyses reveal that the Black-White gap in advance care planning is largely accounted for by Blacks' belief that God controls the timing and nature of death. The Hispanic-White gap is partially accounted for by the belief that one's illness negatively affects one's family. Ethnic disparities are starkest for living will and DPAHC use, and less pronounced for discussions. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.","891":"The Taiwan Quality Indicator Project (TQIP) is a quality management program that measures and monitors the healthcare quality of hospitals in Taiwan. This paper examines the impact of TQIP participation on hospital productivity growth with the application of the Malmquist productivity change index based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). Analyzing operations data from 31 TQIP regional hospitals over the period 1998-2004, we find that TQIP hospitals improved their productivity in the post-TQIP period. This improvement is attributable to quality change and relative efficiency progress. The simultaneous enhancement in both quality and relative efficiency coincides with the philosophy of total quality management (TQM) spirit, and confirms the efficiency improvement and quality assurance functions of TQIP.","892":"Given the growing number of elderly persons in society and concerns about their health and well-being, the aim was to review the available literature on their death anxiety, and to explore features of this experience among a small sample of older men and women in care facilities. In both the review and empirical parts of this study, components and correlates of death anxiety were investigated. The review revealed limited research focus on death anxiety among the elderly, particularly among those in institutions, but suggested both components and correlates for inclusion in our empirical study. Results showed that, among our elderly participants in an assisted living facility (N = 49; age range: 60-96 years), there were higher levels of fear for others and of the dying process than for fear of the unknown. Notably, among the correlates identified, fear for significant others was associated with poor physical health; fear of the dying process was related to low self-esteem, little purpose in life, and poor mental well-being. Gender differences in death anxiety were found: women showed greater fear for the death of loved ones and for the consequences of their own death on these loved ones, than did men. These patterns are discussed in the light of concerns about the welfare of elderly persons; scientific implications are also considered.","893":"Through the exploration of 12 continuing bonds expressions (CBE), this current study investigated the grief reaction and continuing impact of the death of a pet. Thirty-three individuals were interviewed to determine the degree of connection maintained with the deceased pet and how that affects their coping. Findings emphasize that the majority of respondents frequently maintain ongoing meaningful ties with their deceased pet through the use of CBE such as fond memories, rituals, dreams. The findings suggest that it is not the number of CBE but the degree of adaptability that is significant. The importance of recognizing the unique, total experience of those grieving the death of a pet is addressed. Implications for those working with and supporting those in grief are included. Future directions for research are described.","894":"Music is a common feature of funerals, both in terms of sacred music and also secular music when a funeral is personalized to the individual who has died. Drawing on data from research exploring Scottish funeral practices, this article examines some of the ways in which music can be used during a funeral. It suggests five specific uses of music in the funeral context: the use of music as a means of control; the use of music as a means of inclusion and exclusion; music as a source of collective activity; music as a means of creating or shifting emotion; and music as a means of evoking the memory of the deceased person. These uses of music are described and discussed, and suggestions made for further research exploring the use of music in funerals.","895":"This is an interview-based study of 102 families and their observations of the last weeks and days of a dying family member. Forty-one families reported hearing about \"visions,\" \"hallucinations,\" or \"dreams\" from their dying loved one before their death. Of these 41 mixed cases, 37 cases demonstrated classic features of deathbed visions-reports of seeing dead relatives or friends communicating to the dying person. This article reports a content analysis of these 37 cases in order to identify the major psychosocial themes that seem to be conveyed by these kinds of experiences. Six major themes are identified. These themes are: support, comfort, companionship, reunion, prognosis, and choice and control. Implications of these themes are discussed in relation to their role in providing significant support for the psychological morale and social well being of dying people.","896":"The article outlines the issues that the internet presents to death studies. Part 1 describes a range of online practices that may affect dying, the funeral, grief and memorialization, inheritance and archaeology; it also summarizes the kinds of research that have been done in these fields. Part 2 argues that these new online practices have implications for, and may be illuminated by, key concepts in death studies: the sequestration (or separation from everyday life) of death and dying, disenfranchisement of grief, private grief, social death, illness and grief narratives, continuing bonds with the dead, and the presence of the dead in society. In particular, social network sites can bring dying and grieving out of both the private and public realms and into the everyday life of social networks beyond the immediate family, and provide an audience for once private communications with the dead.","897":"After the Reformation, English clergymen debated the efficacy of funeral eulogies. Some believed they flattered the deceased and might be seen as prayers for the dead. Because the bereaved wanted to hear about the goodness of their beloved, most preachers gave eulogies, some in a generalized form for Godly imitation, not expressing the deceased's individuality. Samuel Hieron, a Puritan preacher, refused to give eulogies. In two that were printed, he used Biblical texts lauding the lives of Paul and Dorcas, making it possible for the grief-stricken to believe he was comparing the deceased to them. In the third, he used a text about a Worldling, angering the deceased's daughters, who believed he claimed their father had died a wicked man. Hieron prepared the sermon for publication to deny their charges but died before it appeared. His experience indicates parishioners expected to participate in decisions about how funeral services were conducted.","898":"As part of the National College Grief Study, college student bereavement experience was examined specifically in a Christian university climate. Sex, year in school, and closeness to the deceased were measured in terms of academic and mental health outcomes and resources utilized. Females reported more mental health problems when close to the deceased, and seniors were less likely than first year students to utilize personal support resources of family and religion. During close losses, students experienced more mental health problems and negative social outcomes, but they did not access more resources. Recommendations for university personnel and suggestions for further research are given.","899":"To explore how people experience grief and what factors are perceived as facilitating successful grief work, a survey was distributed to people who had completed a grief recovery course. The results showed that emotions, cognitions, physical expressions, and behaviors all characterize grief, but that emotions are the most central component. The course brought relief and was regarded most favorably by those having at least 1 year between the grief trigger event and participation in the course. Writing a letter in which course participants express their feelings to the loss object was perceived as the most successful aspect of the course. The letter might help with grief recovery by bringing aspects that have not been dealt with into conscious awareness.","900":"This study operationalizes and assesses the percentage of \"good deaths\" achieved among Chinese cancer patients in a palliative care program, the profile of these patients, the relationship between patients with a good death and psychosocial factors, and the differences in background factors, and physical and psychosocial conditions between patients who experienced a good death and those who did not. Clinical data mining was the research method used. Records of deceased cancer patients between 2003 and 2005 in a palliative care unit were the sole data source. Good death was operationally defined as the patient's record indicating no pain (physical) or anxiety (psychological), and having open and honest communication with family (social) in the final assessment by the Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS) just before death. Using these criteria, about one-fifth of patients (21.5%; 137 out of 638) experienced a good death. Those with a good death were significantly older and were in palliative care longer. Their records also indicated lower levels of constipation, insomnia, oral discomfort, and family anxiety at their first and at their final STAS assessments. Good death was positively associated with recorded indicators of fullness in life, caregivers' acceptance and support, and negatively with reported feelings of upset about changes in the course of their illness. The results heighten awareness among social workers and other healthcare professionals about the value of good death in patients in palliative care. This empirically-based awareness can foster professionals' ability to set intervention objectives to help patients in palliative care achieve this universally accepted goal.","901":"Nestled in more than 5,000 acres of farmland in rural South Dakota, one Hutterian colony flourishes with more than 23 families and a population of 115 people. Very little is known about the ways in which Hutterites experience traumatic infant and child death on the colony. No research studies to date have explored this topic. This is an ethnographic study that utilized extended observations of the group and both individual and group interviewing in order to create a cultural portrait specifically focusing on Hutterites experiencing traumatic child death. Observations were organized into five thematic categories: 1) details of the actual death experience; 2) emotional and physical reactions to the loss; 3) familial and communal response; 4) coping and rituals; and 5) spirituality. The role of communal mourning, ritualization, and spirituality in creating a healing milieu for bereaved families is discussed.","902":"The purpose of this research was to construct a short scale to assess the death distress construct, that is, death anxiety, death depression, and death obsession as derivatives from the already existing scales. A sample of 630 volunteer undergraduates responded to scales of death anxiety, death depression, and death obsession. A Pearson correlation matrix was computed using the 51 individual items of the three scales. A forced three-factor principal components analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation was carried out. Eight items with factor loading &gt; 0.5 on each scale was determined. The eight items with highest factor loadings on Factor I were with \"Death obsession,\" whereas the Factors II and III were labeled: \"Death anxiety,\" and \"Death depression.\" Their alpha reliabilities ranged from 0.83 to 0.93, indicating high internal consistency. One week test retest reliability ranged between 0.76 and 0.91, indicating temporal stability. A single high-loaded factor of death distress was disclosed, demonstrating the discriminant validity of the death distress construct and scale. Women obtained a significantly higher mean scores on all three factors. It was concluded that the aforementioned three factors were sufficiently independent to justify their use in assessing partially distinct sub-constructs as sub-components of the generic high-order factor of death distress, with empirical and clinical implications.","903":"Thanatology is a recent field that contemplates death studies and employs an interdisciplinary approach to practice. This science emerged in a historical context marked by intense social, economic, and political changes that contributed to the concept of death being excluded from social life. This literature review aims to outline the history and evolution ofthanatology in Western society, delineating the contextual circumstances that led to its origin and drawing special attention to current works on death education. In our post-modern society, the call for studies in the field of thanatology appears to be increasing. However, although there have been significant contributions and promising research is underway, there are still many questions to be answered.","904":"The emphasis in disaster situations is on preserving life, and this goal is both appropriate and laudable. There is a risk, however, that the needs of people who are dying can become lost when there is a sudden surge of people needing acute intervention. There are significant ethical considerations inherent in society's prioritization of care needs across the acute, rehabilitative, and palliative spectrum in general, let alone in a disaster situation. These ethical conundrums are not the focus of this article. Rather, we anchor our discussion on the assumption that care needs are equally valid, and our purpose is to explore the issues that impact the provision of quality end-of-life care in nursing home settings for those who require this care when a disaster occurs. Nursing home residents, in particular, are at heightened risk for experiencing negative disaster-related outcomes due to compromised physical or mental health that requires skilled nursing care. Moreover, within the already vulnerable nursing home population are many people who are receiving palliative end-of-life services when a disaster strikes. Education and training in end-of-life services for nursing home staff, disaster emergency responders, and other lay people is vital to build capacity for adapting the delivery of these services in disaster situations in the interest of equity and human rights. Given the present lack of guidance in the literature as to what end-of-life care looks like when adapted to the context of disaster response, there is also a pressing need for research to inform this discussion. The purpose of this article is to draw attention to this topic and highlight some of the critical issues, gaps, and opportunities.","905":"This research tested hypotheses concerning attachment, social support, and grief responses to the loss of animal companionship. Participants whose companion cat or dog had recently died (N = 429) completed the Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Inventory of Complicated Grief, and the Multidimensional Health Profile-Psychosocial Functioning questionnaires. Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were found to be positively associated with respondents' grief, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. Social support was found to be negatively associated with these outcomes as well as with attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. In multiple regression analyses, attachment anxiety incrementally predicted grief, anxiety and somatic symptoms, attachment avoidance incrementally predicted grief and depression, and social support incrementally predicted all outcomes. Interaction effects of attachment and social support in relation to outcomes were not found. The present study's implications and limitations are discussed, as are directions for future research.","906":"Close personal relationships are very important in our lives. Our closest relationships help us regulate our bodies and minds and contribute importantly to our sense of wellbeing (Hofer, 1984; Mikulincer, Orbach, &amp; Iavnieli, 1998; Sbarra &amp; Hazan, 2008). Losing a close attachment is usually one of the most difficult experiences we ever have. Bereavement often leaves us dazed and confused about how to understand the loss and navigate the future. Acute grief takes us out of our ongoing life and focuses our attention on our deceased loved one. Grief is finely tuned to each loss situation with a pattern and course that is unique to each person and each relationship.","907":"Research has demonstrated that placement of permanent feeding tubes to provide artificial nutrition is more common among non-white populations, but there is a scarcity of research regarding why those differences may exist. The purpose of this study is to describe and understand community members' attitudes toward tube feeding and end-of-life decision-making. Four focus groups were convened in Greenville, NC. The 28 focus group participants were 11 African American and 17 Caucasian community members between ages 51 and 81. Two focus groups were held with Caucasian participants and two with African-American participants. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and qualitative analysis was performed using NVivo software. Seven themes resulted from the analysis of the transcripts. They included: \"A feeding tube is,\" \"Food is important,\" \"They want to do the right thing,\" \"To make a rational decision,\" \"There are worse things than death,\" \"There's a lot of good things,\" \"It's out of my hands.\" There were more commonalities than differences in the views of African Americans and Caucasians on perspectives on tube feeding and elders with dementia. An unexpected emphasis was placed on the importance of food as a symbol of caring. Families tend to be oriented toward personal fidelity to the elder and the symbolic role of feeding in fulfilling that fidelity.","908":"Many parents turn to picture books and storybooks to help explain issues surrounding death and dying to their young children. In addition to dealing with topics such as death, funerals, memories, and grief, a number of the books also mention the concept of heaven and what our loved ones might experience after they die. This article uses qualitative research methods to analyze 49 children's storybooks that touch on the existence of heaven or a spiritual afterlife. Results show that heaven is portrayed in a simplistic fashion, as a place high in the sky with bright lights, angels, and clouds. Even as heaven is presented in a relatively simple way, there are also patterned differences in depictions of the spiritual afterlife depending upon whether the decedent in the book was a family pet, a child, a parent, or a grandparent. The article concludes with a discussion of how these depictions of heaven and the afterlife might help young children cope with death-related grief.","909":"A family member who is present when a loved one is dying in a hospital setting may be profoundly affected by interactions with others in that setting, including the dying person. Interaction shapes how one experiences a loved one's death and dying. Framed in relational dialectics theory, this qualitative case study describes dialectical contradictions I experienced in the context of my grandmother dying in a hospital setting. Personal journals were analyzed, with three primary dialectics being identified: certainty-uncertainty, control-lack of control, and autonomy-connection. Understanding dialectical contradictions experienced by a family member when a loved one is dying in a hospital setting could lead to enhanced support services for family members.","910":"Although cremation is an increasingly popular method of body disposal, there is little research on ash disposition, particularly the decisions and negotiations underlying the process. Americans who have recently encountered the cremation of loved ones for the first time have not been studied at all; the present research describes 87 of their cremation experiences. Adults who were actively involved in cremation and ash disposition decisions were interviewed about these processes at every stage, from the decision to cremate through the performance of final rituals for their dead. Results detail family and friends' active negotiations over cremation and ash disposition, the surprises they encountered, and the personally meaningful rituals they created for their loved ones. As in other emerging postdeath rituals, the enactment of individualized rituals for the dead was seen as a positive experience; accordingly, most participants preferred to be cremated and honored through nontraditional rituals themselves.","911":"","912":"Avoidance can be adaptive and facilitate the healing process of acute grief or it can be maladaptive and hinder this same process. Maladaptive cognitive or behavioral avoidance comprises the central feature of the condition of complicated grief. This article explores the concept of experiential avoidance as it applies to bereavement, including when it is adaptive when it is problematic. Adaptive avoidance is framed using an attachment theory perspective and incorporates insights from the dual process model (DPM). An approach to clinical management of experiential avoidance in the syndrome of complicated grief is included.","913":"The intent of this study was to examine if length of caregiving was associated with older widowers' adjustment to bereavement and to identify factors, based on principles underlying the Dual Process Model of Bereavement, that might mitigate the potential adverse effects of time spent caring. Two-hundred men over the age of 60 and in the second year of bereavement were identified from death records of older women who had died within a 12-month period. Interviews lasted about 2 hours and focused on widowers' experiences surrounding their wives' deaths along with questions about social support, health, retirement, and other demographic information. The Bradburn Affect Scale was used to measure positive and negative affect. Restoration-oriented coping, such as starting new relationships and activities were measured. These variables included extent of family contact, number of friends, having a confidante, involvement with neighbors, and participation in sports and clubs. Time since death and demographic variables were used as controls. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted on positive and negative affect after which potentially moderating effects were analyzed. Results indicated that the most important influences on negative affect were time since death, ethnicity, and participation in clubs while for positive affect the most significant factors included length of caregiving, number of friends, and having a confidante. Although no interaction effects were significant, patterns emerged. Implications for applying the DPM with older bereaved men are made.","914":"The Dual Process Model (DPM) of Coping with Bereavement identified two oscillating coping processes, loss and restoration (Stroebe &amp; Schut, 1999). The utility of the model is investigated in two studies. In the first, we carried out secondary analyses on a large-scale qualitative study that we had conducted previously. In the second, we conducted a small-scale study specifically examining the DPM. In the first study we re-examined the interviews for Loss- (LO) and Restoration-Oriented (RO) Coping and examined whether these were associated with psychological adjustment. The results showed that those adjusting well reported the stressors New Roles\/Identities\/ Relationships and Intrusion of Grief significantly more. Those adjusting less well reported the stressors Denial\/Avoidance of Restoration Changes and Distraction\/Avoidance of Grief significantly more. In the second study, we asked participants about four RO stressors of the DPM: Attending to Life Changes; New Roles\/Identities\/Relationships; Distraction from Grief; and New Activities. These data showed that not all participants experienced all aspects of RO Coping. In particular, participants had diverse views about the utility of Distraction from Grief as a coping mechanism. The article concludes by discussing the challenges of testing the DPM empirically.","915":"This study was designed to test the effectiveness of the Dual Process Model (DPM) of coping with bereavement. The sample consisted of 298 recently widowed women (61%) and men age 50+ who participated in 14 weekly intervention sessions and also completed before (O1) and after (O2) self-administered questionnaires. While the study also includes two additional follow-up assessments (O3 and O4) that cover up to 14-16 months bereaved, this article examines only O1 and O2 assessments. Based on random assignment, 128 persons attended traditional grief groups that focused on loss-orientation (LO) in the model and 170 persons participated in groups receiving both the LO and restoration-orientation (RO) coping (learning daily life skills). As expected, participants in DPM groups showed slightly higher use of RO coping initially, but compared with LO group participants they improved at similar levels and reported similar high degrees of satisfaction with their participation (i.e., having their needs met and 98-100% indicating they were glad they participated. Even though DPM participants had six fewer LO sessions, they showed similar levels of LO improvement. Qualitative data indicate that the RO component of the DPM might be more effective if it is tailored and delivered individually.","916":"The Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement (DPM; Stroebe &amp; Schut, 1999) is described in this article. The rationale is given as to why this model was deemed necessary and how it was designed to overcome limitations of earlier models of adaptive coping with loss. Although building on earlier theoretical formulations, it contrasts with other models along a number of dimensions which are outlined. In addition to describing the basic parameters of the DPM, theoretical and empirical developments that have taken place since the original publication of the model are summarized. Guidelines for future research are given focusing on principles that should be followed to put the model to stringent empirical test.","917":"","918":"A number of studies have investigated the relationship between suicide and perfectionism but none to our knowledge have been based on studies of completed suicides. This article aims to provide important insight into the potency that certain profiles of perfectionism can claim in the path to suicide by presenting three case studies from a U.K. study of student suicide. Collectively, these case studies provide theoretical support for existing frameworks and are consistent with other literature which emphasizes those forms of perfectionism that engender severe self-criticism and self-doubt and fear of failure as most destructive.","919":"The experience of death and dying is very different in the 21st century than it was in the 19th. A number of societal changes in the latter part of the 19th and early part of the 20th centuries served to remove contact with the dying and the dead from everyday experience. This article examines four of these changes: 1) falling death rates, 2) the rise of hospitals, 3) the rise of funeral directing as a profession, and 4) the rural cemetery movement. It is proposed that these changes produced an unjustified optimism with regard to the prolongation of life.","920":"This article explores the concepts of unmourned and disenfranchised grief as a way to understand the experiences of adult children of Nazi perpetrators, who grew up with cultural norms of grieving alone or in silence. The scholarly literature on descendants of Nazis reflects a group unlikely to warrant empathy or support from others because of the stigma surrounding their family's possible involvement in the Holocaust atrocities. This article uses, as a case study approach, the testimony given by Monika Hertwig, the adult daughter of a high ranking Nazi, who appears in the documentary film, Inheritance. From the perspective of disenfranchised grief, defined as grief that is not socially recognized or supported, the article links Monika's testimony with existing research from in-depth interviews with other descendants of Nazis to suggest that, as a group, they lacked permission to grieve their deceased parents, acknowledgment of their grief, and opportunities to mourn. Based on the theory that the effects of grief can be transgenerational, the disenfranchisement experienced by the \"children of the Third Reich\" does not have to pass to subsequent generations if opportunities for mourning are made possible and some resolution of grief occurs. Studies have shown that ongoing dialogue groups between Holocaust survivors and descendants of Nazis provide opportunities for mourning to both groups.","921":"This article reports on the sampling and recruitment challenges, as well as the strategies used to address them in the Living After Loss (LAL) project, a bereavement intervention study conducted in Salt Lake City and San Francisco comparing two 14-week group conditions with follow-up. We encountered three major challenges: 1) difficulty determining eligibility for some potential participants who were contacted, 2) locating and recruiting nonwhites, and 3) unavailable phone numbers for approximately one-third of those we attempted to contact. Despite these challenges, we achieved a 42% response rate with a sample size of 328 participants comprising 15% nonwhite. Eighty-five percent of the participants completed all of the follow-up data points. Leading factors in participants' decisions to join and remain in the study were 1) opportunities to obtain help and support, 2) to potentially help other bereaved individuals, 3) to contribute to research, and 4) their on-going interactions with a professional, empathetic, and culturally sensitive project staff. Effectively focusing recruitment efforts and carefully and systematically training research staff were among the most effective strategies we employed and therefore suggest for those planning similar investigations.","922":"Examination of the theory base for bereavement and loss is currently just beginning for adults with intellectual disabilities (ID). Yet, as life spans increase for individuals with ID, these adults experience more and more loss and bereavement events. Practitioners, especially grief counselors, are finding it increasingly critical for them to understand best practice principles for working with bereaved adults with ID in their daily work. Practitioners also are asked to guide families and care providers regarding grief and death education. This article provides counselors and other professionals with a review of existing bereavement intervention research for adults with ID. Practice recommendations are made on three levels: informal support; formal intervention; and community education.","923":"Spousal death is one the most stressful life events that seriously affects the psychological well being of widowed. This study examined the mediating effects of social and personal religiosity on the psychological well being of widowed elderly people. The sample for this study was comprised of 1367 widowed and married elderly Muslims from Malaysia. Psychological well being, religiosity, and physical health were measured using WHO-5 Well being Index, Intrinsic Extrinsic religiosity scale, and a checklist of 16 physical health problems, respectively. Data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version-13). As expected, bivariate correlation analysis revealed that widowhood is statistically and negatively associated with psychological well being. Results of multiple hierarchical regression analyses and Sobel test showed that only the indirect effect of widowhood through personal religiosity was statistically significant (Sobel = -2.79, p &lt; .01). Sobel test for social religiosity was not significant (Sobel = -1.54, p &gt; .05). The results of this study confirmed earlier studies, which found that widowhood negatively affects psychological well being of elderly people. Overall, the findings show that the potential solace provided by religiosity can decrease the negative effects of widowhood on the psychological well being of widowed elderly people.","924":"Few studies have examined the bereavement experiences of African-American teen girls who have mourned the loss of friends due to homicide. This qualitative study examined such bereavement experiences with a sample of 20 African-American teen girls, ages 16-19, living in a large northeastern U.S. city. Meaning making, adolescent developmental theory, ideas regarding traumatic loss, and resilience provided a framework to understand how these teens coped with the tragic loss of a friend. The teen girls in this study demonstrated resilience in their ability to adequately \"move on\" with their lives. They remained achievement oriented and sustained meaningful relationships with family, valued friends, and others. Early, metaphysical, and motivational meaning constructions contributed to the teens' resilience.","925":"Despite its popularity, few attempts have been made to empirically test the stage theory of grief. The most prominent of these attempts was conducted by Maciejewski, Zhang, Block, and Prigerson (2007), who found that different states of grieving may peak in a sequence that is consistent with stage theory. The present study aimed to provide a conceptual replication and extension of these findings by examining the association between time since loss and five grief Indicators (focusing on disbelief, anger, yearning, depression, and acceptance), among an ethnically diverse sample of young adults who had been bereaved by natural (n=441) and violent (n=173) causes. We also examined the potential salience of meaning-making and assessed the extent to which participants had made sense of their losses. In general, limited support was found for stage theory, alongside some evidence of an \"anniversary reaction\" marked by heightened distress and reduced acceptance for participants approaching the second anniversary of the death. Overall, sense-making emerged as a much stronger predictor of grief Indicators than time since loss, highlighting the relevance of a meaning-oriented perspective.","926":"Studies assessing the impact of relationship quality and social support on marital bereavement have typically focussed on depressive symptoms as the major (and often only) bereavement outcome. Although sadness and depression are important symptoms of grieving, they are neither the only nor necessarily the most important ones. We argue that in addition to measures of depression, grief measures need to be used in assessing bereavement outcome. However, grief measures do not only assess reactions that are specific to bereavement such as yearning, but also general responses that grief shares with other critical life events (e.g., anxiety, shock, anger, intrusive thoughts, and despair). We would expect marital quality to only affect yearning for the loved one who died, but not other more general grief reactions. In contrast, experiencing support from family and friends, though unlikely to reduce yearning, might ameliorate these general grief symptoms as well as depression. Using data on widows from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study, a large-scale prospective study of older couples, we assessed the relationship between marital quality and social support with depression and grief on the death of a spouse. Consistent with hypotheses, social support but not relationship quality was associated with depression and general grief reactions. In contrast, relationship quality but not social support was associated with yearning. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","927":"Socrates' death, as portrayed by Plato, and commonly accepted, is seen as the virtuous choice of a philosopher of death in preference to ignominiously evading an unjust verdict of the jury. Xenophon's portrayal, the only other contemporaneous account, shows Socrates as being tired of life, seeing nothing worthwhile in hanging on to a continuously declining life, and deliberately choosing death. In more recent years I. F. Stone has discussed in depth the political context surrounding the trial of Socrates. In this article I discuss the various personal factors, his awareness of aging, his vision of declining relationships with others, his marriage and family life, the political context of the times, and his disbelief in democracy, at a time when the Athenian democracy had only recently been restored, but was still under threat by the oligarchs; and the influence of his daimon, a personal spirit who spoke to him only when opposing an action he was considering. The sum of these various factors presents a fuller and more complete picture of Socrates' choice of death over life.","928":"An existential crisis may occur in cancer patients when they realize that their death may be imminent. We explore the ways in which patients deal with this crisis, in which the meaning of life itself is at stake. In dealing with an existential crisis, it is important to have the courage to confront the loss of meaning and security. Then, a new sense of meaning may emerge which is essentially a receptive experience of connectedness with an ego-transcending reality, such as mankind, nature, or God. This reduces existential fear and despair and leads to acceptance of \"life-as-it-is\", including its finitude. The article concludes with implications for healthcare workers.","929":"The most common tools for assessing grief and loss focus on death-related loss. The Reactions to Loss Scale (RTL) broadens the scope of bereavement measures to include reactions to non-death losses. The population targeted by this measure, emerging adults (college students), commonly experiences a myriad of both death-related and non-death losses. The validity of the Reactions to Loss Scale (RTL) is investigated in 4 studies. Factor analysis of the 65-item RTL (N=564) identified 3 subscales, each demonstrating good reliability. In the first 3 studies, the RTL was found to be related to depression, anxiety, negative affect, and positive measures of satisfaction with life, happiness, and positive affect. In Study 4, prospective data was utilized to evaluate predictive validity. These data found that the RTL was predictive of longitudinal changes in negative affect, perceived social support, satisfaction with life, and positive feelings about the specific loss.","930":"Psychological adaptation following homicide loss is challenged not only by the violent nature of the death itself but also by the bereaved's relationships with would-be supporters. Recruiting a sample of 54 African-American homicidally bereaved individuals, we examined perceived and actual support, the size of the support network, family versus non-family support, and number of negative relationships to gauge the role of social support in bereavement outcomes such as complicated grief, PTSD, and depression. Results of quantitative assessments revealed that size of available network, quantity of negative relationships, and levels of grief-specific support were correlated with bereavement outcome. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research on the role of social support in adaptation of African Americans to traumatic loss are discussed.","931":"When using data envelopment analysis (DEA) as a benchmarking technique for nursing homes, it is essential to include measures of the quality of care. We survey applications where quality has been incorporated into DEA models and consider the concerns that arise when the results show that quality measures have been effectively ignored. Three modeling techniques are identified that address these concerns. Each of these techniques requires some input from management as to the proper emphasis to be placed on the quality aspect of performance. We report the results of a case study in which we apply these techniques to a DEA model of nursing home performance. We examine in depth not only the resulting efficiency scores, but also the benchmark sets and the weights given to the input and output measures. We find that two of the techniques are effective in insuring that DEA results discriminate between high and low quality performance.","932":"Death is a subject seldom studied in school and often misunderstood and feared by many people. Children often learn about death from their family and mass media. From the literature review on dying, death, and death education, it may be concluded that people are generally ignorant about the issues of death and dying. There is a need to investigate what young people, such as university students, know about death and dying, and their attitudes toward them. Eight university students were recruited for this study. Most participants have had death experiences. They seldom talked about death and loss. Some of these experiences were quite pleasant but some of them were not. Most participants addressed the need to have \"life and death\" education in schools at their young age. Such a need is further supported by the incidents of two participants who attempted suicide unsuccessfully when they encountered a life problem which they could not solve.","933":"By examining the experiences of death anxiety and attitudes toward personal deaths among members of a citizens' movement, the Grave-Free Promotion Society (GFPS), this study considers the applicability of the view that culture and high self-esteem serve as defenses against death anxiety in Japan's changing society. The GFPS promotes the scattering of ashes over the conventional interment of cremated remains in a family grave. GFPS members often lack descendants to care for a family grave, the neglect of which is thought to endanger the deceased's peaceful rest. By returning the dead to nature through ash scattering, the GFPS provides an alternative strategy of managing its members' posthumous well-being. GFPS members often report that their choice of ash scattering has reduced their anxiety about their personal deaths and improved the quality of their lives. Based upon these findings, this study offers some suggestions for increasing cultural sensitivities of test instruments commonly used to examine death anxiety among older persons for use in a Japanese context.","934":"A change in the pattern of movement of her unborn baby could be indicative that the baby might die. To study mothers' experiences during the time prior to receiving news that their baby has died. Interviews with 26 mothers. Premonition that something had happened to their baby, a sense based on a lack of movements were experienced. Six categories describe the mother's insight that the baby's life was threatened: not feeling in touch with their baby; worry feeling something is wrong; not understanding the unbelievable; wanting information; and being certain that their baby had died. The overarching theme \"There is something wrong\" was formulated. The mother could not understand the unbelievable: that the baby had died in utero. Mother's should be cautioned to trust their insights and seek medical advice if they are concerned over the lack of movement from the unborn baby. ","935":"Nearly half a million foreign aid workers currently work worldwide, including over 140,000 missionaries. During re-entry these workers may experience significant psychological distress. This article positions previous research about psychological distress during re-entry, emphasizing loss and grief. At present there is no identifiable theoretical framework to provide a basis for assessment, management, and prevention of re-entry distress in the clinical setting. The development of theoretical concepts and frameworks surrounding loss and grief including the Dual Process Model (DPM) are discussed. All the parameters of the DPM have been shown to be appropriate for the proposed re-entry model, the Dual Process Model applied to Re-entry (DPMR). It is proposed that the DPMR is an appropriate framework to address the processes and strategies of managing re-entry loss and grief. Possible future clinical applications and limitations of the proposed model are discussed. The DPMR is offered for further validation and use in clinical practice.","936":"Terror Management Theory (TMT) research often asks respondents to describe their personal death. This exposure enables the testing of hypotheses regarding defenses (\"buffers\") against the anxious awareness of death. Curiously, though, the respondents' narratives are not analyzed or reported. The present study offers a qualitative analysis of 209 college student narrative responses provided for this purpose by TMT researchers Jeff Greenberg and Nathan Heflick. The narratives are reviewed with attention to affect (adjectives), semantic structure, and theme. Many responses are marked by anxiety, but sorrow is also pervasive. Individual differences in response substance and structure invite further exploration. It is suggested that our understanding of the response to personal death threat could be enhanced by encompassing sorrow as well as anxiety within the same conceptual framework. Several specific hypotheses and suggestions are offered.","937":"Despite the escalating interest in grief interventions, there is a clear misalignment between contemporary grief research and grief counseling practices, and this disparity may limit intervention effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews with 19 grief counselors revealed their current practices of grief counseling. The counselors' descriptions of grief and their grief counseling practices were diverse and many were influenced by classic grief theories and the grief work hypothesis. The grief counselors described negotiating several issues and dilemmas in their work and provided recommendations for achieving greater exchange between research and practice. The findings have the potential to inform the delivery, efficacy, and relevance of grief counseling in Western Australia.","938":"Regression models of cross-national differences in social and economic predictors of per capita alcohol consumption and gender-specific cirrhosis mortality rates are developed for 13 European countries, first using 1970-1984 (period 1) data and then replicating with 1995-2007 (period 2) data. Regression analysis finds that stronger alcohol control policy laws and income inequality are highly significant predictors of consumption in both periods. Further, results show that alcohol consumption is a significant predictor of male mortality rates in both periods, while it is significant only in the second period for female cirrhosis mortality rates. Psychological well-being is a significant predictor for male and female cirrhosis mortality rates in both periods.","939":"This study assessed a range of benefits from participation in a brief existential intervention consisting of a semi-structured videotaped interview with cancer patients and their families designed to illuminate a life legacy for the family (the Life Tape Project [LTP]). Results indicated the majority reported intervention-specific benefits, especially in the areas of symbolic immortality (passing on personal values and philosophy), self-reflection and growth, and improved family cohesion and communication. Participants, particularly those who had perceived their cancer as a threat of death, serious injury, or threat to their physical integrity, and responded with intense fear or helplessness, also reported more general reductions in mood disturbance, improvements in aspects of well-being (including overall quality of life), satisfaction with the understanding they received, and enhanced cancer-related posttraumatic growth. In short, the LTP is a brief, inexpensive, existential intervention that can yield broad positive psychosocial changes for a majority of participants.","940":"Using Berger and Luckmann's thesis (1966) on the social construction of reality as rationale, this research analyzes the death drawings of 946 university students enrolled in a Death and Dying course between 1985 and 2004 to investigate the basic constructs elicited by the word \"death\": dying, moment of death, after death, after life, and bereavement. Consistent with earlier research, gender, race, religion, and religiosity proved to be significant factors. As expected, personal experience with grief was strongly correlated with drawings focused on bereavement. In contrast to earlier studies, fear of death was not significantly related to a particular construct. Implications for research, education, and counseling are discussed.","941":"Guided by a stress process conceptual model, this study examines social and psychological determinants of complicated grief symptoms focusing on family conflict, intrapsychic strains, and the potential moderating effect of care quality and hospice utilization. Relying on data from 152 spouse and adult child lung cancer caregiver survey respondents, drawn from an ancillary study of the Assessment of Cancer CarE and SatiSfaction (ACCESS) in Wisconsin, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine determinants of complicated grief. After controlling for contextual factors and time since death, complicated grief symptoms were higher among caregivers with less education, among families with lower prior conflict but higher conflict at the end-of-life, who had family members who had difficulty accepting the illness, and who were caring for patients with greater fear of death. Additionally, hospice utilization moderated the effect of fear of death on complicated grief. Findings suggest that family conflict, intrapsychic strains, and hospice utilization may help to explain the variability found in complicated grief symptoms among bereaved caregivers. Implications for enhancing complicated grief assessment tools and preventative interventions across the continuum of cancer care are highlighted.","942":"Much of the work of grief lies in the ways the bereaved learn to maintain connection to the deceased in their lives, while living alongside the physical absence of them. The theory of an Internalized Other Interview is that we carry within ourselves impressions, memories, beliefs, assessments, doctrines, and codes of those who have shaped our lives through relationship. This internalized community of commentators is active in our lives on a day-to-day basis, but when someone dies, their active voice in the dialogue is shifted to a perceived inactivity. However, I argue that, despite the physical absence of the other, the voice continues to resonate and interact in our formation of our worlds. How our loved ones live on inside us influences who we are in the world and in our bereavement. As a result of our research and clinical work, I have come to believe that the active interviewing of the deceased person as internalized in the bereaved can have powerful and healing effects. In this article, I share the results of the research related to this intervention, describe the history located in Internalized Other Interviewing, and offer a transcription of an Internalized Other Interview with a young man and his family who recently lost both his brother and father.","943":"The purpose of the present study was to investigate attitudes toward suicide and suicide prevention among psychology students in Ghana by means of a qualitative analysis of open-ended questions about causes of suicide and how suicide best can be prevented. The students mainly saw the causes as intra-personal and almost all of them believed that suicide can be prevented. The results indicated a huge impact of religion on the attitudes toward suicide as well as some lack of distinction between their religious and professional roles and responsibilities.","944":"Few studies directly address vulnerable populations' motivation for participating in research. Often motives are expressed spontaneously and typically given post-interview. This article investigates motivation for research participation among informants who have been bereaved by suicide. Informants were specifically asked for their motivation either prior to, or directly after the interview. Four categories of motivations were identified: (1) Helping Others, (2) Venting, (3) Insight, and (4) Just Because. Sixty percent of informants gave more than one motivation. The majority was altruistically motivated; they hoped that by taking part they could play a role in helping to prevent suicide, improving services for the bereaved or moving research forward. Close family members were more likely to be motivated by a desire to help others than more distant family members. Findings are discussed in the context of suicide-related bereavements. Information about research participation as beneficial to others should be given parallel to that of possible strain.","945":"A phenomenological study was conducted to understand the lived experience of spousal bereavement from the perspective of young Canadian widows. Five themes emerged following inductive analysis of interview transcripts conducted with five women who were under the age of 45 at the time of their husband's death: (a) \"Losses\"; (b) \"Who Am I?\"; (c) \"Staying Connected through Memories\"; (d) \"Living through the Firsts\"; and (e) \"Support Systems.\" Increased understanding from the perspective of the bereaved women, along with strategies and interventions for those working with this group of women, may provide health care professionals with skills to better assist this client population.","946":"Bioethics and public policy literature suggests that socially marginalized populations may be at increased risk for overuse of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) were it to become more accepted. Yet the attitudes of socially marginalized populations toward PAS have not been widely studied. The present study surveyed a sample of men in a substance abuse recovery program. Participants completed a PAS attitude questionnaire and a religiosity measure. Support for PAS was fairly evenly split, with 52.2% indicating general opposition to PAS and 46.9% indicating general support. Greater religiosity was associated with more negative attitudes toward PAS. Higher educational level was associated with more acceptance. Overall attitudes toward PAS were considerably more negative than those of Dr. George Domino's (2003) general population sample.","947":"This is an interview-based study of 104 families and their observations of the last weeks and days of a dying family member. Forty families reported \"unusual experiences and behaviors\" from the dying person in their last period of life. Thirty of these dying persons displayed behavior consistent with deathbed visions-interacting or speaking with deceased relatives, mostly their dead parents. There were six cases of reported premonitions of death and five possible confusional states with one patient reported to have had both a deathbed vision and confusional experiences. Socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, occupation, or cause and place of death were not found to be significant. Hindu patients appeared to be more likely than Muslim patients to report these experiences. Use of opiates (or not) did not appear to influence reports. The findings are discussed with reference to past studies of deathbed visions as well as their implications for the future pastoral care of dying people and their families.","948":"Conducting qualitative interviews with seriously ill individuals about end-of-life issues is challenging for interviewers seeking to understand the problems, processes, and experiences individuals undergo when faced with death and dying. Although all qualitative interviewers face issues of building trust and obtaining answers to their research questions, these issues are exacerbated for interviewers of end-of-life issues due to the challenges of debilitated participants, sensitive subject matter, and heightened emotionalism. The purpose of this article is to offer field-tested techniques to tailor basic interviewing practices for discussions of end-of-life issues with seriously ill individuals. Use of tailored techniques facilitates the comfort of both interviewer and participant and enhances the probability of obtaining complete and accurate data, which in turn can improve the effectiveness of subsequent programs, policies, and clinical practice based on research findings.","949":"This research evaluated the efficacy of a psycho-educational Internet self-help tool to educate and support recently (1-6 months) bereaved individuals. The goal of the website was to help users normalize their grief to enhance their adaptive adjustment. A randomized controlled trial evaluated the gains in social cognitive theory constructs and state anxiety. Compared to the control group (N = 34), treatment participants (N = 33) reported significant multivariate gains (eta-square = .191). Significant program effects were obtained on all three outcome measures: attitude (eta-square = .177), self-efficacy (eta-square = .106), and state anxiety (eta-square = .083). These findings suggest the potential efficacy of an Internet-based grief support tool to enhance adaptive adjustment of the bereaved.","950":"With tougher sentencing laws, an increasing number of individuals are finding themselves spending their final years of life in prison. Drawing on a sample of 327 women over the age of 50 incarcerated in five Southern states, the present study investigates the relationship between numerous health variables and the Templer Death Anxiety Scale (TDAS). Qualitatively, the article also provides personal accounts from inmates that serve to reinforce death fears when engaging the prison health care system. Participants reported a mean of 6.40 on the TDAS indicating a substantial degree of death anxiety when compared to community samples. Both mental and physical health measures were important indicators of death anxiety. Qualitative information discovered that respondents' concerns about dying in prison were often influenced by the perceived lack of adequate health care and the indifference of prison staff and other instances of penal harm.","951":"A community survey of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was conducted in 2004 to understand knowledge, attitudes, and preferences about end-of-life (EOL) care and to generate conversations about these topics. Questionnaires were sent to 5,000 randomly selected households, with a return of 1,042 (21%). Most respondents said preparation for EOL is very important, yet far fewer had taken steps to ensure their EOL wishes would be known or met. These disparities are examined, with recommendations for future research and public policy. Bivariate analyses revealed significant differences by age, sex, education, marital status, and religiosity. Community studies are important for baseline understanding, evoking conversation, and setting goals for change. Public education is needed to strengthen understandings of hospice care, and professional education is needed to raise awareness about practitioners' roles in resolving discrepancies between what people want and what they get at end of life.","952":"This article presents findings from a study on the impact of a child's death on parents. We explored the prominence and adaptiveness of parents' continuing bonds expressions, psychological adjustment, and grief reactions. A qualitative case study methodology was used to describe six cases. Participants were classified into two groups based on scores on the Inventory of Complicated Grief. Commonalities in themes on the Continuing Bonds Interview and projective drawings were assessed. Those in the Non-Complicated Grief Group reported internalization of positive qualities and identification with the deceased child as a role model, whereas participants in the Complicated Grief Group did not report these experiences. In addition, the drawings of those in the Non-Complicated Grief Group were evaluated as more adaptive than those in the Complicated Grief Group.","953":"Due to the severity of the risks involved in violation of ethical principles with research of American Indian populations, more attention in literature is needed on the topic. This article reviews discussions of ethical and methodological issues, uses Muscogee Creeks' responses from the author's prior study (Walker, 2008; Walker &amp; Balk, 2007) as an example and application, and specifically focuses on the research of death and bereavement. The article provides ethical reflection and recommendations for designing death and bereavement research as an outsider to the culture, as well as for building trust with participants in American Indian populations.","954":"Brain death is a relatively new concept that became topical as a result of organ transplantation. Debate about this concept is currently continuing. This study was carried out to determine the attitudes of physicians toward brain death and to examine the effect of religion and education on the issue. Eight-hundred physicians who were randomly selected from 6 different cities in Turkey were questioned: 23.7% of physicians do not regard brain death as real death; 76.8% of relatives of these physicians' patients said that they have difficulty in understanding brain death. The reason for this is that brain death is an artificial concept created to meet the needs of organ transplantation. However, physicians are of the opinion that the attitudes toward death and brain death can be changed by education. In conclusion, the authors suggest that the brain death issue must be discussed by physicians, other professionals in Turkish society, and the general public so to reach a better concensus.","955":"Using mortality data derived from tombstones in two Midwestern cemeteries, we compared the \"widowhood effect\" (decreased survival following the death of a spouse) among Jews and Catholics. Jewish men and women were both more likely to die sooner after the death of their spouses compared to Catholic men and women. Life table survival analysis indicated that the median number of years of survival following widowhood for Catholic and Jewish men were 7.7 years and 5.0 years, respectively (p &lt; .01). For Catholic and Jewish women, it was 11.0 and 9.5 years, respectively (p &lt; .01). Interpretations were offered in terms of Bowlby's attachment theory.","956":"The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of childhood traumatic grief (CTG) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in parentally bereaved children and compare scores between those who had lost a parent to a sudden\/violent death and those who had lost a parent to an expected death. A sample of 158 parentally bereaved children ages 7-16 completed the Extended Grief Inventory (EGI); 127 of those also completed the UCLA PTSD Index. A large number of children were experiencing CTG symptoms at moderate and severe levels. There was no significant difference in EGI or UCLA PTSD Index scores between the two types of losses. Findings are discussed in relation to trauma theory, research on parentally bereaved children and implications for practice.","957":"Terror Management Theory (TMT) has been revitalizing the traditional study of death anxiety since its introduction in the 1980s. Melding the perspectives of existential philosophy and social science, TMT has stimulated a varied and often creative program of empirical studies. There are methodological limitations to be noted, however, along with a cultural bias, and the neglect of other significant encounters with death in which terror is not the dominant concern. The should or should-not of terror management is viewed from functionalistic and death system as well as TMT perspectives. Suggestions are offered for adaptive responses to primal terror.","958":"Experiences and symptoms emanating from the bereaved person's body are commonly considered to be psychosomatic reactions to loss. The lingering of such experiences is thought to reflect a maladaptive coping style that needs to be addressed to access the psychological pain underlying the symptoms. In this interpretive, phenomenological study of 15 family members in seven families who lost a child to sudden, unexpected death, stories of embodied grief are explored to further understand the grieving body. The findings of this study illuminate the many ways parents experience their grieving body and they underscore the importance of witnessing and acknowledging stories of the body in clinical work with bereaved parents who are learning to live in a world without their beloved child.","959":"The purpose of the study was to compare spiritual beliefs and practices between nurses and health care social workers based on their involvement with dying patients. Exposure to the dying was identified by two indicators: the percentage of terminally ill patients in the provider's care and the work environment. On the basis of the literature, differences were expected between the two types of professionals and the three degrees of involvement with the dying. Nurses were expected to have a higher spiritual perspective than social workers; and health care providers with high involvement in care for the dying were expected to hold the highest levels of spiritual beliefs. Contrary to expectations, no differences in spirituality were found between nurses and social workers; both groups exhibited medium levels of spirituality. Furthermore, health care providers who were highly involved with dying patients had the lowest spiritual perspectives. Tentative explanations of these unexpected results are presented and discussed.","960":"Little user-knowledge has been documented on the experiences of young suicide bereaved with psychosocial assistance and therapy. Thirty-two adolescents who had lost a close family member or friend by suicide participated in a research project by filling in questionnaires and participating in focus group interviews. The article explores the young people's experiences with and wishes for help from psychologists, and shows that the young bereaved do not receive the psychological assistance they wish for and need. The shortcomings are discussed in relation to the organization, form, and contents of the help. In order to reach youth with adequate assistance in an extreme life situation, it is worth listening to their opinions about how they want to be approached in the wake of a suicide.","961":"Should pathological grief be viewed as a nosological category, separate from other forms of mental diseases? Diagnostic criteria for \"Prolonged Grief Disorder\" (PGD) have recently been specified by Prigerson and her coworkers. We interviewed a total of 40 widows who had lost their husbands during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. We assessed Major Depression using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and prolonged grief reactions with the PG-13. In order to examine the distinctiveness of the two syndromes we performed a multitrait correlational matrix analysis using modified versions of Generalized Proximity Functions (GPFs). 12.5% (n = 5) of the sample fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of PGD; 40% (n = 16) met criteria for Major Depressive Episode. The two syndromes were strongly associated. No discriminant validity was found between the two constructs suggesting that PGD may rather be an appearance of depression than a separate nosological entity.","962":"With a diverse sample of 462 parent survivors of their child's suicide we explored the association of the personal growth subscale of the Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist (HGRC) with mental health problems among longer-term survivors. In this article we offer additional validation for this scale's association with longer-term survivorship and reduced grief difficulties. We also demonstrate its negative relationship with mental health problems. In addition, we explore the demographic correlates of personal growth, which are likely to enable some survivors to experience personal growth sooner than others. Overall, the findings suggest that personal growth represents an important part in the process of healing after suicide loss.","963":"Little knowledge has been documented on the experiences of young suicide survivors, how they are coping with schooling and what kind of support they think they need. Thirty-two adolescents who had lost a close family member or friend by suicide participated in a research project by filling in questionnaires and participating in focus group interviews. The article explores the young people's experiences with and wishes for help from the school, including teachers and school nurses. The results show that the young people struggle with concentration and learning new material. Although many are satisfied with care and support while at school, the young bereaved do not receive all the assistance they wish for and need. In order to adequately support young suicide survivors to continue schooling, it is worth listening to their opinions about how they may be approached.","964":"This qualitative, collective case study involves interviews with 27 members of the Muscogee Creek Tribe to explore spirituality as related to death and bereavement. Results yielded that Creeks are generally open to the existence of inexplicable supernatural events. Creek spirituality encompasses awareness of spiritual beings, both good and bad. Participants believed that spirits exist alongside people and can send and receive messages from people to guide and inform them. Creeks have ongoing, though not constant, relationships with loved ones and others who have died. Spiritual attunement can occur at every point in the life cycle but seems to be especially astute in children and animals. Results are discussed in terms of continuing bonds and meaning making perspectives.","965":"This study attempts to explore the attitude toward death, which ranges from fear of death to its acceptance, held by students of one of the universities in Hong Kong. It also tries to examine the relationship between their attitude toward death and their ratings of life and death. Another aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a death education course offered in that university. It is found that the present death attitude of Hong Kong university students is not satisfactory and that it has been significantly improved after students took a death education course.","966":"Historical accounts and previous research have shown that bereaved individuals often report seeing, hearing, or feeling the presence of the deceased. We examined such encounters in the context of the grieving, mourning, and healing processes. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 individuals who reported a post-death encounter following the death of a loved one. Phenomenological analysis showed that participants went through an interpretive process in which they attempted to make sense of their experiences. The encounters profoundly affected the participants' beliefs in an afterlife and attitudes toward life and death, and had a significant impact on their grief. Finally, post-death encounters had a healing effect on the participants by contributing to a sense of connectedness with the deceased. We conclude that health care professionals and counselors should be educated about post-death encounters so that the bereaved can share their experiences in a supportive and understanding atmosphere.","967":"The continued bonds between bereaved individuals and the deceased are central to the process of mourning. One challenging form of continuing bond is that in which the mourner senses the actual presence of the deceased--i.e., seeing one's deceased husband at the kitchen counter. Some see this experience as a sign of pathology while others see it as a normal, healthy aspect of grief and mourning. Twenty-one social workers shared their experiences in addressing this issue with clients. Despite conceptualizing this experience in a variety of ways, they all grounded their interactions with clients around this issue on the fundamental social work value of respecting the client's dignity and experience. Their experiences and insights may be useful to other practitioners.","968":"This article explores ways in which siblings and child friends are represented as being involved in death and loss experiences. These representations are taken from 51 selected examples of death-related literature designed to be read by or with children. The main goal is to ask how these youngsters respond when confronted by the death of a sibling or child friend. How do they act when they are on their own, with each other, or with adults? This is important because these representations of children coping with death-related situations can serve as partial role models for the youngsters who read these books, either on their own or with a companion adult. And when adults are involved in reading, discussing, or examining books of this type, they can gain some insights into the world of children as portrayed by these authors, insights that adult readers might not otherwise have had, insights about how children respond to death-related situations, what they need, and how they might be helped.","969":"The twofold objectives of the present study were (a) to examine sex-related differences on the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety (ASDA) in seven Arabic and Western countries, and (b) to compare the mean ASDA scores among Arabic samples (Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Syria) with Western samples (Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A total sample of 2978 volunteer undergraduates participated in this study. They resided in their countries of origin and responded to the scale in their respective native-speaking languages. Sex-related differences on the ASDA were statistically significant in all countries (except the United Kingdom), with women having higher mean scores than their male peers. It was found that all the Arab samples, except the Lebanese men, had significantly higher mean ASDA scores than their Western counterparts. These differences might be explained either in the light of higher emotionally responsiveness of the Arab samples, differences in individualism and collectivism and in secularism in the countries, and the lower per capita income in the Arab countries except in Kuwait.","970":"Over 200 Australian, American, and British Non-Government Organizations send aid workers overseas including missionaries. On re-entry, they may suffer psychological distress; however, there is little research about their psychosocial issues and management in the family practice setting. Research suggests loss and grief as a suitable paradigm for family practitioners dealing with psychosocial issues. The aim of this study was to explore loss and grief issues for adult Australian missionary cross-cultural aid workers during their re-entry adjustment. Mixed methods were used and this study reports the qualitative method: semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 participants. Results were analyzed using framework analysis. Themes of re-entry loss and grief were identified with sub-themes of multiple varied losses, mechanisms of loss, loss of control, common grief phenomena, disenfranchised grief, and reactivation of past grief. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. Findings of this study suggest that loss and grief is an appropriate paradigm for the management of these workers in the family practice setting. Further research is needed to enable appropriate care.","971":"Scholarly writing on voodoo death is reviewed. Criticisms that voodoo deaths in indigenous societies have never been well documented are refuted with cases medically documented in developed nations. The work of Cannon and Richter on sudden death in animals is reviewed and dismissed as irrelevant for understanding voodoo death. The role of starvation and dehydration is discussed, and it is suggested that the given-up\/giving-up hypothesis best fits the phenomenon of voodoo death. Hypotheses for future research are suggested.","972":"The suicide rate on religious and public holidays was examined for 133,699 suicides for Hungary for the period 1970-2002. For both men and women, more suicides were committed on Monday, while fewer were committed on the weekends. More suicides occurred on New Year's Day than expected. On Christmas Day and on Easter Sunday and Monday, suicides were less frequent only for men, a result consistent with Durkheim's theory. There was less evidence for Gabennesch's broken promise effect on the days after the holidays. National holidays had no impact on the frequency of suicide.","973":"Information on tombstones from a large cemetery in New York State were analyzed for gender discrimination. Criteria for gender bias were indications of familial relationships, absence of surnames, and absence of maiden names combined with surname for married women. Overall, females were far more likely to be identified in terms of familial relationships and were far less likely to have their married surname included on their gravestone. However, when the data were divided into 50 year epochs, it was apparent that identification of women in terms of familial relationships had become far less common and indication of surnames had become more common over the last 150 years. There was also a slight trend for women to have both their maiden and surnames on their grave markers.","974":"The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the level of death anxiety among a national sample of United States funeral directors with varying levels of death exposure, age, and sex. Utilizing the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale (MFODS), the results showed a significant, but weak negative relationship between levels of death anxiety and the participants' reported number of funerals attended per year. The correlation between death anxiety scores and the number of reported embalming cases performed yearly was, however, not significant. We found a significant negative correlation between death anxiety and age in both men and women funeral directors. The difference in the death anxiety scores between men (n=166) and women (n=38) funeral directors was not significant. There was a significant negative correlation with age in both men and women in several fears of death including fear of the dying process, fear for significant others, and fear of premature death. The significant negative correlations were stronger for women than men across all three subscales. Results, direction for further research, and implications of the findings for mental health workers are discussed.","975":"Using the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, we examined posttraumatic growth in a sample of 50 adolescents and young adults who had experienced parental death in childhood or adolescence. Longitudinal relations were examined between baseline measures of contextual and intraindividual factors and scores on the posttraumatic growth subscales (i.e., New Possibilities, Relating to Others, Personal Strengths, Spiritual Changes, and Appreciation of Life) six years later. Controlling for time since death, threat appraisals, active coping, avoidant coping, seeking support from parents or guardians, seeking support from other adults, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems were significant predictors of posttraumatic growth. The implications of these findings for research and clinical practice are discussed.","976":"The positive psychology movement has created more interest in examining the potential value of experiencing positive emotions (e.g., humor, laughter, and happiness) during the course of bereavement. This study of 292 recently widowed (5-24 weeks) men (39%) and women (61%) age 50 and over examined both the perceived importance of and actual experience of having positive emotions in their daily lives and how they might impact bereavement adjustments. We found that most of the bereaved spouses rated humor and happiness as being very important in their daily lives and that they were also experiencing these emotions at higher levels than expected. Experiencing humor, laughter, and happiness was strongly associated with favorable bereavement adjustments (lower grief and depression) regardless of the extent to which the bereaved person valued having these positive emotions.","977":"Domino's Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ) was administered in three different answer formats. The original answer format used by Domino produced the highest reliabilities for five subscales. Correlates with measures of religiosity and manic-depressive tendencies indicated that the original format and a full Likert-type format gave similar results.","978":"There have been few reports on the effect of suicide death on family members' attitudes toward suicide. In order to estimate the extent to which suicide death affects attitudes toward suicide among family members of suicides, data of 264 informants from a case-control psychological autopsy study were analyzed. The results showed that there were no significant differences in attitudes toward suicide, measured by the General Social Survey's (GSS) four questions, between informants of suicides and informants of living controls, between family members of suicides and family members of living controls, or between family members of suicides and non-family members of suicides. Our findings did not support the hypothesis that suicide death affects the attitudes toward suicide in suicides' family members. However, some factors were found to be related to the pro-suicide attitudes measured by the four questions included in the GSS.","979":"In this study, 2,894 participants rated attitudes toward their favorite public figure on the Celebrity Attitude Scale. It was noted whether each figure was alive or dead, and a panel of four independent judges assessed each in terms of their moral conduct and physical attractiveness. Dead figures appealed less and were subject to lower \"intense personal\" celebrity worship, and death was unrelated to \"borderline pathological\" and \"deleterious imitation\" celebrity worship. Physical attractiveness was positively related to overall celebrity worship and \"intense personal\" celebrity worship, but negatively related to \"borderline pathological\" and \"deleterious imitation\" celebrity worship. Moral conduct was associated negatively with \"deleterious imitation\" celebrity worship. Results are discussed briefly in terms of their implications for research on physical attractiveness and \"copycat suicide\".","980":"This study examines the reliability and validity of Internet research in bereavement. Recent literature demonstrates an increased interest in utilizing a more convenient, inexpensive, and rapid Internet method to collect data and recruit bereaved participants. For researchers, the Internet offers the possibility to learn more about grief from the growing online community of bereaved people. To explore the possible use of Internet tools in bereavement research, this study compares online survey method with traditional paper-and-pencil method in grief assessment. One group of bereaved adults (N = 84) was recruited and completed the survey by mail, and another group of bereaved adults (N = 262) was recruited and completed the same set of questions via Internet. The collected data were analyzed to identify both similarities and differences between the two samples' responses and the psychometric characteristics of the Core Bereavement Items inventory (CBI; Burnett, Middleton, Raphael, &amp; Martinek, 1997). Significant differences were found between the two samples in relation to time since loss, cause of death, and relationship to deceased, demonstrating a greater variability in the Internet sample. Other demographic characteristics, as well as the grief and meaning making scores, did not differ significantly. In addition, no relevant differences were found in the psychometric properties of the CBI. These findings suggest that the Internet-based methods can be a suitable and valid alternative to more traditional paper-and-pencil methods.","981":"This article deals with the following two questions: In very old age, which are the main sources of bereavement? And what are the consequences of such losses on health and on relationships? The findings are based on the complete set of data compiled in the course of the Swiss Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on the Oldest Old (SWILSOO), which provided a 10-year follow-up of a first cohort (1994-2004) and a 5-year follow-up of a second (1999-2004). The data revealed that, in very old age, the great majority of the dear ones who died were either siblings or close friends. Taken as a whole, the bereaved suffered a marked and lasting increase in depressive symptoms, together with a short-term deterioration in their functional status; those bereft of a spouse or a child saw their functional status worsen and exhibited enduring depressive symptoms but they also benefited from support in the form of increased interaction; those bereft of siblings only suffered from a mild, short-term deterioration in functional status; those who had lost a close friend suffered a very significant increase in depressive symptoms. In the medium term, most of these effects disappeared, lending weight to the claim that the survivors manage to cope with the misfortunes of life.","982":"This study examined the end-of-life challenges, concerns, and care preferences of terminally ill elders and their family caregivers, with a focus on areas of congruence and incongruence. Ten elders and 10 family caregivers participated in separate, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews. Data analysis included team coding and thematic analysis, guided by an a priori set of categories based on the study questions. Shared challenges and concerns included experiencing decline, managing pain and discomfort, and living with uncertainty. There was also congruence regarding end-of-life care preferences, specifically the importance of quality care, treatment with dignity and respect, and avoiding unnecessary life-sustaining treatment. Areas of incongruence included the elders' difficulties in accepting dependence, their fears of becoming a burden, and desire to be prepared for death. Family caregivers were most concerned with providing adequate care to meet the elders' physical and spiritual care needs. Open family communication was associated with greater congruence. The authors discuss implications of these findings for research and intervention.","983":"This study examines online obituary pages at nine major U.S. daily newspapers seeking to understand how these sites use new technologies, and how they publicly portray people's lives and deaths. These mainstream dailies provide a forum, and potentially large audiences, for mourners who send messages to the dead, express emotion, and tell stories. They also facilitate connections between readers and build new kindsof virtual communities. This represents a departure from traditional obituary content. Indeed, the \"cyber obit\" now allows the bereaved to help frame the death stories and build the memorials, liberated from the linear, non-interactive formats of the past. This study builds on work of bereavement scholars as well as literature in journalism and mass communication.","984":"Bereaved individuals often experience profound social pressure to conform to societal norms that constrict the experience of grief rather than support it. This article explores grief in Western society through an analysis of the underlying structures and values that are a part of this social system, utilizing the lens of critical theory. Critical theory examines social norms and conditions in order to identify and expose oppression in various contexts. This article examines the social rules that govern the expression of grief, the role of attachment, social pain, and shame as potent forces that promote compliance with social rules, and the ways that the underlying assumptions and values in Western society shape how bereaved individuals are expected to react. Implications for clinicians who work with terminally ill or bereaved individuals are then reviewed.","985":"Death preparation is an important process as it can help the elderly to achieve ego integrity at the last stage of their lives. This study aims to explore how the ethnic Chinese elderly in Singapore approach issues related to death and dying, and to identify factors that influence death preparation. Descriptive surveys with semi-structured interview questions were used. Eight ethnic Chinese older adults, recruited through purposive sampling, were interviewed. Additionally, 4 adults with a deceased parent were also interviewed to validate and complement the earlier identified themes. Results show that the current generation of Chinese elderly in Singapore do not seem to be averse to talking about issues related to death, and those who find it unnecessary to prepare for death seem to be associated with, among other factors, lesser financial assets and a strong belief in filial piety. With increasing affluence and dissolving traditions, it will be beneficial to draw the attention of the current generation of mature adults on early preparation at the final stage of the lifespan.","986":"Cluster analysis was performed on a diverse group of 69 non-clinical grievers whose loved ones died between 12-40 months prior to the study. Based on psychometric measures of both bereavement distress and growth, three distinct clusters emerged: High Grief (high distress-low growth; n = 16); High Growth (low distress-high growth; n = 32); and Low Impact (low distress-low growth; n = 21). Discriminant function analyses showed that the High Grief cluster differed robustly from the other two groups on several measures of grief adaptation and coping; the differences between the High Growth and Low Impact clusters were less pronounced. High Grief participants sought grief counseling significantly more often whereas the Low Impact grievers preferred medicinal help for symptoms if they sought any professional assistance at all. When High Growth participants sought counseling, they seemed to focus on growth-oriented dimensions rather than mere symptom relief. Of the 11 participants who sought grief counseling for their loss, 10 (91%) found the experience to be helpful. Findings are discussed in the context of meta-analytic studies of the effectiveness of grief counseling.","987":null,"988":"This study examines all documented information regarding the final days and death of Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), in an attempt to determine the most likely cause of death of the American poet, short story writer, and literary critic. Information was gathered from letters, newspaper accounts, and magazine articles written during the period after Poe's death, and also from biographies and medical journal articles written up until the present. A chronology of Poe's final days was constructed, and this was used to form a differential diagnosis of possible causes of death. Death theories over the last 160 years were analyzed using this information. This analysis, along with a review of Poe's past medical history, would seem to support an alcohol-related cause of death.","989":"This study analyzes attitudes about treatment of the terminally ill among a group of first-year undergraduate students--a cohort that was in high school when intense publicity and extensive political and judicial involvement in the Terri Schiavo case occurred. Data for the study were collected by structured personal interviews with 201 randomly selected, first-year students in the first half of fall semester, 2005. Students clearly make distinctions in the propriety of active euthanasia, passive euthanasia, and physician-assisted death. Presented with a situation of a terminally ill patient in considerable pain, 65.1% of the students supported or strongly supported withdrawal of life-sustaining technology (passive euthanasia), 34.3% supported the physician providing the means of death to the patient (physician-assisted death), and 28.3% supported the physician actually administering a lethal injection (active euthanasia). A review of the literature of correlates of euthanasia attitudes in a variety of samples produced five potential types of influences: 1) general philosophical and religious beliefs; 2) fears about one's own death and dying process; 3) amount of information about and exposure to the issue of euthanasia; 4) characteristics of the community in which one lives; and 5) certain personal background characteristics. These categorical types produced 19 specific variables that were potentially related to euthanasia attitudes. The strongest predictor of attitudes varied among the three types of euthanasia, but political party affiliation had the most overall influence. Students self-identifying as Democrats were more likely than those self-identifying as Republicans to support euthanasia.","990":"The aim of the present study was to examine predictors of death anxiety in U.S. funeral directors\/embalmers who were part of a larger study (n = 234). Backward stepwise multiple regression was conducted to determine whether or not spirituality, intrinsic religiosity, extrinsic religiosity, and denial predicted levels of death anxiety. Results indicated that spirituality along with age of the participants accounted for 19% of the variance of death anxiety, R2 = .190, R2(adj) = .180, F(2, 168) = 19.64, p &lt; .001. Intrinsic religiosity, extrinsic religiosity, and denial were not significant in the regression model. Several items, however, in the model had a significant positive correlation with each other at the .01 alpha level including spirituality with intrinsic religiosity (r = .63) and age (r = .21), and intrinsic religiosity with denial (r = .22) and age (r = .24). Other variables correlated negatively with one another at the .01 alpha level. Namely, death anxiety with spirituality (-.38), intrinsic religiosity (r = -.36), and age (-.28); spirituality with extrinsic religiosity (-.22); intrinsic religiosity with extrinsic religiosity (-.45); and extrinsic religiosity with age (r = -.19). Limitations of the study and implications for practice were discussed.","991":"The primary aim for this research was to explore the overlap and differences between the concepts related to secondary traumatization: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), secondary traumatic stress (STS), compassion fatigue (CF), and burnout (BRN). A secondary aim for this research was to examine the impact of secondary traumatization and some of the personal and professional elements that affect how pediatric healthcare providers experience PTSD, STS, CF, and BRN. An online survey was sent via e-mail to numerous list serves for healthcare providers who had worked on PICU, NICU, or PEDS units within the last year. The analyses revealed that a significant overlap existed between the terms of STS, PTSD, BRN, CS, and CF for PICU, NICU, and PEDS providers. However, a hierarchical linear regression revealed a significant amount of unique contributions to the variance in CF based on each of the measured concepts. Despite previous literature that indicates that the terms STS and CF can be used interchangeably, the two most prominent measures utilized in the assessment of CF and STS are actually capturing at least some unique elements. Given these results, future researchers should examine and conceptualize the difference in etiology, prevalence, symptoms, and treatment efficacy for CF and STS as separate but related entities and then return their focus to understanding secondary traumatization in healthcare providers.","992":"Islamic countries display lower suicide rates compared to the other countries of the world. Since most studies dealing with the relationships between Islam and suicide have focused on the extent of the problem and not the underlying mechanisms, the focus of this brief communication is to provide a rather more in-depth discussion regarding the mechanism of this relation. It also covers issues which may have an adverse effect on suicide within Islamic countries and consequently tries to sketch a path ahead in the area of suicide research within the Islamic countries.","993":"To know the level of death anxiety using the Templer Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) (1970) (Ramos's Spanish adaptation, 1982)) we chose subjects older than 65 years (N = 227) to study, on one hand, the existing relation between cognitive-affective reactions toward death and the perception of the passing of time and, on the other, a group of variables which include the place of residence, age, gender, life reflection, health disorders, psychological problems, religious aspects, and socio-demographics features. To undertake this, a questionnaire was administered in which the participants answered according to their degree of agreement to several alternatives. The data indicates, by means of an analysis of variance, significant differences between these variables and death anxiety, with the exception of the religious aspects and civil state.","994":"Although considerable social science research has explored religiosity and death anxiety, and many have theorized that religion comforts the dying, with speculations on the mechanisms by which religion comforts, very little research has asked people who were actually dying to discuss religion. This article reports on answers given by 38 hospice patients to the questions: Is religion a comfort to you? How does religion comfort you? This study found that religion, when it comforted these dying people, did so by offering a relationship to the dying, by giving the hope of life after death, through identifications, and through the assurance of cosmic order. The authors suggest theoretical perspectives accounting for these functions.","995":"A qualitative study explored beliefs about active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) in a sample (N = 18) of medical practitioners and nurses from Australia, where AVE is not currently legal. Four behaviors relating to AVE emerged during the interviews: requesting euthanasia for oneself, legalizing AVE, administering AVE to patients if it were legalized, and discussing AVE with patients if they request it. Using thematic analysis, interviews were analyzed for beliefs related to advantages and disadvantages of performing these AVE behaviors. Medical practitioners and nurses identified a number of similar benefits for performing the AVE-related behaviors, both for themselves personally and as health professionals. Benefits also included a consideration of the positive impact for patients, their families, and the health care system. Disadvantages across behaviors focused on the potential conflict between those parties involved in the decision making process, as well as conflict between one's own personal and professional values.","996":"A major concern for the pioneers in death education at the college level was the need to recognize those students who enrolled in the course in order to get help with death related issues, primarily suicidal thoughts and unresolved grief. Despite anecdotal evidence of these at-risk students, this concern has yet to be addressed adequately. This may be due in part to the paucity of empirical evidence. The authors bring over 30 combined years of experience in teaching death education at the university level. They have their own anecdotal stories. They also have empirical evidence. This article addresses the question of why students take death education courses in college by examining data collected from death education classes over a span of 20 years and 3 decades (1985-2004). The results document the magnitude and consistency of the at-risk student. The authors discuss the precautionary steps they take and call for a renewed discourse on ethical considerations in death education.","997":"Scales to measure helplessness and hopelessness were found to have good reliability and were significantly correlated with suicidal ideation in both Turkish and American respondents.","998":"Cross-cultural comparisons of norms derived from research on Death Anxiety are valid as long as they provide existential validity. Existential validity is not empirically derived like construct validity. It is an understanding of being human unto death. It is the realization that death is imminent. It is the inner sense that provides a responder to death anxiety scales with a valid expression of his or her sense about the prospect of dying. It can be articulated in a life review by a disclosure of one's ontology. This article calls upon psychologists who develop death anxiety scales to disclose their presuppositions about death before administering a questionnaire. By disclosing his or her ontology a psychologist provides a means of disclosing his or her intentionality in responding to the items. This humanistic paradigm allows for an interactive participation between investigator and subject. Lester, Templer, and Abdel-Khalek (2006-2007) enriched psychology with significant empirical data on several correlates of death anxiety. But all scientists, especially psychologists, will always have alternative interpretations of the same empirical fact pattern. Empirical data is limited by the affirmation of the consequent limitation. A phenomenology of language and communication makes existential validity a necessary step for a broader understanding of the meaning of death anxiety.","999":"This research investigates the knowledge and myths regarding suicide among students in Israel, and examines whether they are affected by ethnic origin, gender, and religiosity. A random sample of 450 undergraduate students from two colleges was asked to fill out the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ). Knowledge was measured by five SOQ items (alpha = 0.57) and myths of suicide by 20 SOQ items (alpha = 0.67). The level of Israeli students' knowledge about suicide is generally good (X = 3.21; SD = 0.58). There are significant differences, however, between the Jewish (n = 266) and Arab (n = 154) students in knowledge about basic facts of suicide in Israel [(X Arabs = 3.04; X Jews = 3.32; t (419, 0.95) = 4.63, p &lt; .001)]. Although both groups share the same educational milieu, the Arab students tend more to believe that suicide rates are higher in Israel, and even more so among people of Asian African origin and minorities. They also perceive suicide by shooting to be the most popular suicide method. There are also significant differences between those groups with respect to their belief in suicide myths [(X Arabs = 2.91; SD = 0.40; X Jews = 3.17, SD = 0.41; t (419, 0.95)= 6.31, p &lt; 0.01)]. Arabs tend more to relate suicide to lower religious affiliation, mental illness and chronic tendency, and to believe that the victim's relatives know nothing about the coming suicide. No significant differences were found based on religiosity or gender. Discussion focuses on the influence of the different cultural characteristics of lifestyle and the social control systems among Jews and Arabs in Israel on perceptions toward suicide.","1000":"One source people can rely on for clues on how to grieve a loss is through accounts of such experiences reported in the mass media. This research examines how grief has been reported at one newspaper of record for the U.S.: The New York Times. Using theories of social construction and the sick role, this exploratory study attempts to observe whether grieving is portrayed by media as a social problem, particularly as a health or medical issue which can be treated and cured, and also discusses those who are not identified in the mourner role in newspaper reports.","1001":"Triangulation is a comparative strategy for examining data that strengthens qualitative and multi-method research. Despite the benefits of triangulation noted in the research methods literature, few concrete models for operationalization of protocols exist. Lack of documentation of explicit triangulation procedures is especially true in the area of bereavement research. This article describes how an interdisciplinary research team implemented a triangulation protocol in a study of the needs of bereaved parents. Triangulation enabled the integration of diverse data sources, methods, and disciplinary perspectives. These processes yielded a more meaningful typology of bereaved parents' needs than would have otherwise been possible. Extending the use of triangulation will enhance multi-faceted understandings of bereavement.","1002":"Taken among parents who sustained the loss of a child to suicide this study explores the participation of parents in Internet support groups, comparing their demographic and loss-related characteristics (N = 104) to other parent survivors participating in face-to-face support groups (N = 297). Contrary to expectations that Internet affiliates would be concentrated in under-served rural areas, we found similar levels of urban, suburban, small city and rural residents in both Internet and face-to-face subsamples. Bivariate and multivariate analyses suggested several important factors contributing to interest in Internet grief support including: 24\/7 availability and opportunities to invest more time into this type of support group experience. Compared to their face-to-face group counterparts, Internet affiliates experienced greater suicide stigmatization from their families and other associates. Unable to find ready comfort and support from their personal communities, Internet users-and especially highly depressed survivors-sought and obtained valuable help from the Internet support resource.","1003":"The purpose of the study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Collett-Lester Fear of Death Scale in a Nigerian population. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among medical students using the Collett-Lester fear of death questionnaire, demographic variables were also obtained. A total of 175 students completed the questionnaire. Reliability score was good and convergent validity was also good. We concluded that the scale has good validity and reliability score among this population.","1004":"Few empirical studies have explored the grieving process among different ethnic groups within the United States, and very little is known about how African Americans and Caucasians may differ in their experience of loss. The purpose of this study was to examine the African-American experience of grief, with particular emphasis on issues of identity change, interpersonal dimensions of the loss, and continuing attachments with the deceased. Participants were 1,581 bereaved college students (940 Caucasians and 641 African Americans) attending classes at a large southern university. Each participant completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised, the Continuing Bonds Scale, and questions regarding the circumstances surrounding his or her loss. Results revealed that African Americans experienced more frequent bereavement by homicide, maintenance of a stronger continuing bond with the deceased, greater grief for the loss of extended kin beyond the immediate family, and a sense of support in their grief, despite their tendency to talk less with others about the loss or seek professional support for it. Overall, African Americans reported higher levels of complicated grief symptoms than Caucasians, especially when they spent less time speaking to others about their loss experience. Implications of these findings for bereavement support services for African Americans were briefly noted.","1005":"The present article examined differences in personifications of personal and typical death as a function of attitudes about death. Ninety-eight students enrolled in psychology classes were randomly assigned to personify death as a character in a movie depicting either their own deathbed scene or the deathbed scene of the typical person prior to completing the Death Attitude Profile-Revised. The results supported the conceptual distinction between attitudes about personal death and death in general. Participants in the personal death condition personified death more frequently as a gentle-comforting image and less frequently as a cold-remote image than did participants in the typical death condition. The results also further validated the relation between personifications of death and death attitudes. Across both conditions, participants who selected the grim-terrifying image reported more fear of death and death avoidance; whereas, participants who selected the cold-remote or robot-like images reported more neutral acceptance.","1006":"A child's age, cognitive ability, and exposure to death in the environment have been documented as major factors affecting the formation of a mature death concept. The present study investigated the relationships between these three factors (age, cognitive ability, and death experience) and children's understandings of death, as well as the relationship between mothers' communicative competence and children's understandings of death. Thirty-seven children (ages 48-96 months) completed three cognitive tasks and answered four dichotomous questions about death. Their mothers (N = 37) responded in writing to 16 questions about death that children are likely to ask. Results showed significant relationships between age and understanding, between seriation ability and understanding, and between death experience and understanding. There was no statistically significant relationship between maternal response competence and children's understandings of death. Implications are discussed.","1007":"Clinical professionals working in end-of-life (EOL) contexts are frequently relied upon to address questions of meaning with dying and bereaved persons. Similar to the gulf between researchers and practitioners besetting the larger healthcare community, the voices of EOL practitioners are often underrepresented in the empirical literature. This study aimed to further the dialogue in the field of thanatology by surveying and describing the therapeutic approaches that EOL practitioners most commonly report using to facilitate meaning-making. A total of 119 practitioners from a range of EOL disciplines were surveyed to write about their intervention strategies for helping clients\/patients make sense of loss. Overall, participants discussed using 23 different therapeutic approaches that comprised three overarching categories: 1) presence of the helping professional; 2) elements of the process; and 3) therapeutic procedures. Importantly, the results also indicated that practitioners from the different EOL occupations are converging on many of the same strategies for promoting meaning-making. Implications for future research on evaluating the effectiveness of meaning-making interventions are also discussed.","1008":"Death is the end of life. But Muslims believe death is an event between two lives, not an absolute cessation of life. Thus religiosity may influence Muslims differently about death. To explore the impact of religious perception, thus religiosity, a cross-sectional, descriptive, analytic and correlational study was conducted on 150 Muslims. Self-declared healthy Muslims equally from both sexes (N = 150, Age range--20 to 50 years, Minimum education--Bachelor) were selected by stratified sampling and randomly under each stratum. Subjects, divided in five levels of religiosity, were assessed and scored for the presence of maladjustment symptoms and stage of adjustment with death. ANOVA and correlation coefficient was applied on the sets of data collected. All statistical tests were done at the level of 95% confidence (P &lt; 0.05). Final results were higher than the table values used for ANOVA and correlation coefficient yielded P values of &lt; 0.05, &lt; 0.01, and &lt; 0.001. Religiosity as a criterion of Muslims influenced the quality of adjustment with death positively. So we hypothesized that religiosity may help Muslims adjust to death.","1009":"The cross-sectional study was administrated between April and September 2006. Participants are doctors, nurses, and midwives. Between these dates we met only 750 health staff (doctor, nurse, and midwife). Six hundred thirty-two of them responded to our questionnaire, 122 of them were in Manisa city, and 510 of them in Erciyes. We sought to identify variables that contribute to euthanasia attitude, including demographics, in order to demonstrate Turkish doctors', nurses', and midwives' attitudes toward euthanasia and to compare their attitudes in this regard. The data was collected by a two-part questionnaire. The first part included questions about the health personnel; the second part comprised the euthanasia (Medical Staffs Attitude toward Euthanasia) scale. The scale was developed by the researcher to measure the attitude of healthy staff euthanasia. The SPSS was used to analyze the data. Student t-test, ANOVA, Mann Whitney U, and Kruskal Wallis were used to evaluate the data. Thep value 0.05 (95% confidence interval) was accepted as significant. In our study, professional groups are compared with all the factors but there is a significant difference only between social cost and professional groups.","1010":"This article presents resources and strategies for the infusion of diversity and social justice themes into an undergraduate death and dying course. The intent is not to replace or dismiss existing thanatological insights and debates, but rather to widen the cultural perspective to bring these insights and debates into conversation with multiple ways of perceiving and understanding. The article covers definitions, goals and rationales, challenges in identifying and developing appropriate resources, and overall course design. It also explores readings, audiovisual materials, class activities, and pedagogical approaches to foster: student engagement with diverse world-views and experiences; understanding of \"cultural competence\" in various fields; awareness of the impact of race, class, gender, etc., on access to resources and care; commitment to activism for social justice; and exposure to many forms of resilience, meaning-making, and creative healing.","1011":"Mourning is a natural response to loss. In the late eighteenth century and throughout the nineteenth century, in England and France, the bereaved was expected to follow a complex set of rules, particularly among the upper classes, with women more bound to adhere to these customs than men. Such customs involved wearing heavy, concealing, black costume and the use of black crepe veils. Special black caps and bonnets were worn with these ensembles. Widows were expected to wear these clothes up to four years after their loss to show their grief. Jewelry often made of dark black jet or the hair of the deceased was used. To remove the costume earlier was thought disrespectful to the deceased. Formal mourning culminated during the reign of Queen Victoria. Her prolonged grief over the death of her husband, Prince Albert, had much to do with the practice. During the succeeding Edwardian rule, the fashions began to be more functional and less restrictive, but the dress protocol for men and women, including that for the period of mourning, was still rigidly adhered to. When World War I began, many women joined the workforce. Most widows attempted to maintain the traditional conventions of mourning, but with an increase in the number of casualties, it became impractical for them to interrupt their work in order to observe the seclusion called for by formal mourning etiquette. Never had the code of mourning been less strictly applied than during this period. The mourning outfits of the time were modest and made of practical materials. Little jewelry and few other accessories were used. Certain aspects of traditional mourning were still followed, such as the use of jet beading, crepe trim, and widows' caps. However, the hemlines fell above the ankle, the veil was used to frame the face instead of cover it, and the v-neckline left the chest and neck bare. During the following decades, gradually the rules were relaxed further and it became acceptable for both sexes to dress in dark colors for up to a year after a death in the family.","1012":"The objectives of this article are to discuss the various types of behaviors associated with grief and bereavement, and to examine the relationships, consequences, and outcomes of bereavement practices among the various religious and ethnic groups in the English-speaking Caribbean Islands of Jamaica, Trinidad, Grenada, and Barbados. The rituals associated with death and grief differs across cultures and is greatly influenced by religious beliefs and traditions. How these rituals are played out depend on the culture of origin and level of acculturation of the various groups into mainstream society. In the Caribbean region, expressions of grief represent religious and cultural traditions that may have a significant impact on social relations, particularly in multi-ethnic and multicultural societies. In the English-speaking Caribbean Islands of Jamaica, Trinidad, Grenada, and Barbados, mourning follows the patterns of traditional religious practices which have remained consistent over time. While families and friends may offer social support before and after burial or cremation, the social aspects of bereavement may also have implications for inter-group relations. Insights into bereavement practices and what it holds for ethnic and religious groups in contemporary Caribbean are presented.","1013":"This article describes the experiences of women in Northern Ireland who have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth. Pregnancy loss encompasses several dimensions of loss for women, loss of the future, loss of self-identity, and the loss of anticipated parenthood. The study explored how women emotionally responded to loss and the care they received from medical staff. Burial arrangements for the remains of the baby are also explored. The methodology adopted a narrative approach based upon in-depth interviews with 23 women who attended pregnancy loss self-help groups. The women's narratives highlight their emotional responses to loss, the medicalization of perinatal grief, and burial arrangements. Women felt that their experience was emotionally negative in that they had been subjected to a rationalizing process of medicalization. The primary focus for the women was on the need to recover space for their emotions and seek acceptance and recognition of the validity of their grief. The study demonstrated that the women's response to being marginalized led them to make sense of their experiences and to create spaces of resistance to medicalization. The way in which women placed emotion at the center of their narratives is taken to be a powerful indicator that the support they require from professionals should take account of the meanings they have constructed from their experience of loss.","1014":"A single misfortune may be seen as just that, or may be interpreted as Zeno the Stoic did, as a \"sign\" of cosmic proportion (zenoizing), which paradoxically provides a missing meaning structure. This article presents two studies testing out this new variable (zenoism): in Study One (n = 233), we explore the moderating effects of religiosity and gender on zenoism, depression, demoralization, and suicidality. In Study Two (n = 137), we explore these same moderating effects on zenoism, fear of dependency, value of life, and favorability toward physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Results indicate: 1) men and non-religious respondents (especially men) zenoize more than women and religious respondents; 2) non-religious respondents, (especially men) are more generally favorable to PAS and more suicidal; 3) Zenoism is negatively related to depression, demoralization, and value of life for non-religious respondents, and for men; 4) Zenoism is positively related to favorability toward PAS toward one's self and overall suicidality; and finally 5) general and self-specific favorability toward PAS are distinct, but both relate to overall suicidality.","1015":"In a community-based bereavement writing group, patterns of metaphor emerged and helped the group members identify and deal with particularly challenging aspects of death and grief, including taboo subjects such as abuse and suicide. The metaphors show how a bereavement writing group functioned to address the needs of people coping with different kinds of grief effectively and efficiently. Analysis of the specific metaphors suggests why figurative language enabled the group to bond quickly and strongly, delve into the complex emotions death elicits, and integrate experiences of loss and grief safely and productively. The patterns of metaphors the group produced in their writing about death and grief are discussed in terms of bereavement processes, and the topics the group used to elicit the figures of speech are presented for further refinement and use.","1016":"The effect of art on suicide risk has been a neglected topic in suicidology. The present article focuses on what is probably the best known song concerning suicide, Gloomy Sunday, the \"Hungarian suicide song.\" An analysis of historical sources suggests that the song was believed to trigger suicides. It was, for example, banned by the BBC in England until 2002. The alleged increase in suicides in the 1930s associated with the playing of the song may be attributed to audience mood, especially the presence of a large number of depressed persons as a result of the Great Depression. The influence of music on suicide may be contingent on societal, social, and individual conditions, such as economic recessions, membership in musical subcultures, and psychiatric disturbance. Further research is needed on art forms, such as feature films, paintings, novels, and music that portray suicides in order to identify the conditions under which the triggering of suicides occurs.","1017":"The study was an empirical examination of the relation of personality proneness to \"problematic social emotions\"--envy (Dispositional Envy Scale), jealousy (Interpersonal Jealousy Scale), and shame and guilt (Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2)--to maternal grief (Perinatal Grief Scale-33) following miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death, or infant\/child death. The 441 women who participated in the study were enrolled from the Website, e-mail contact lists, and parent support groups of an organization that offers information and support to bereaved parents. All four problematic emotions were positively correlated with maternal grief. Envy, jealousy, and guilt made significant unique contributions to the variance in maternal grief. Overall, time lapse since the loss and the four problematic emotion predispositions explained 43% of the variance in maternal grief following child bereavement.","1018":"This study explores the phenomenon of legacy as a component of the aging experience among women. Against a backdrop of prior focus on transmission of material possessions as the primary form of legacy, the concept is critically examined in developing an expanded, theoretically and empirically grounded perspective. In-depth interviews with 38 women, ranging in age from 31 to 94 and representing diverse marital, parental, and health statuses, reveal multiple dimensions of leaving a legacy in terms of content, creation, and transmission. Through the stories of the participants in this study, legacy emerges as a means of passing on the essence of one's self, in particular one's values and beliefs. Legacy is a method of leaving something behind after death and making meaning of the end of life. The desire to leave a legacy is manifest in many different ways dependent on the individual and their culture. While the idea of legacy is often couched in terms of material possessions, it appears that passing on values and beliefs is more important to older adults.","1019":"This study analyzes the difficulties that poor parents faced when they lost an adult child to AIDS in Togo. The death of a child is believed to be more distressful to parents compared to the death of a spouse. Evidence also suggests that parental grief is more lasting and may be the most complicated form of grief. Furthermore, the roles played by the deceased child in the lives of the parents also affect the parental grieving process. For instance, in low income regions where parents tend to be socio-economically challenged and where filial obligations are culturally expected, losing an adult child who provided material and financial assistance to parents will be more disastrous. Four kinds of difficulties were identified: financial and social difficulty, psychological difficulty, caregiving difficulty, and disclosure difficulty. The socioeconomic status of the parents made these issues all the more taxing, as respondents were grieving not only the loss of their children to AIDS but also the loss of financial providers. Policy implications of the findings are discussed.","1020":"Research on end-of-life treatment preferences has documented robust racial differences, with African-Americans preferring more life-prolonging treatment than Whites. Although little research has attempted to explain these racial differences systematically, speculation has centered on religiosity. We examined a dimension of religiosity frequently invoked in end-of-life research-guidance by God's will-as a potential mediator of racial differences in such treatment preferences. Three hundred African-American and White men and women aged 60 or older participated in a 35-minute telephone interview that elicited preferences for four common life-prolonging treatments in each of nine health scenarios. The questionnaire included the five-item God's will (GW) scale, a health conditions checklist, a depression measure, and sociodemographic questions. GW mediated racial differences at least partially for most treatments and in most health scenarios. Implications are discussed for understanding end-of-life treatment preferences and why races tend to differ.","1021":"Focus groups conducted with grieving people pose special challenges. However, this method can be successfully used in bereavement research especially when group interaction is central to the research aim. This article builds on key articles discussing ethical, methodological, logistical, and analytical issues in conducting focus groups with vulnerable populations (Owen, 2001; Seymour, Bellamy, Gott, Ahmedzai, &amp; Clark, 2002). For bereaved people, vulnerability stems from heightened potential for harm by virtue of participation in sensitive, personal exploration of death-related experiences. We discuss reasons for selecting focus group methods and our experiences with planning and implementing focus groups with bereaved people. Issues found to be highly salient in our work include: team composition, participant recruitment, creating the environment, starting and ending the group, language and listening, managing emotional discussions and time, and analytic considerations. Recommendations are made for effectively using focus groups to generate new knowledge in bereavement research.","1022":"This study focused on assessing the psychosocial effects of the long standing, high intensity, and guerrilla-style of warfare among displaced children in Southern Darfur. The goal was to better understand the etiology, prognosis, and treatment implications for traumatic reactions, depression, and grief symptoms in this population. Three hundred thirty-one children aged 6-17 from three IDP Camps were selected using a quota sampling approach and were administered a Demographic Questionnaire, Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index, Child Depression Inventory, and the Expanded Grief Inventory. Forty-three percent were girls and 57% were boys. The mean age of the children was 12 years. Results found that children were exposed to a very large number of war experiences with no significant differences between genders for types of exposure, including rape, but with older children (13-17 years) facing a larger number of exposures than younger children (6-12 years). Out of the 16 possible war experiences, the mean number was 8.94 (SD = 3.27). Seventy-five percent of the children met the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, and 38% exhibited clinical symptoms of depression. The percentage of children endorsing significant levels of grief symptoms was 20%. Increased exposure to war experiences led to higher levels of: (1) traumatic reactions; (2) depression; and (3) grief symptoms. Of the 16 war experiences, abduction, hiding to protect oneself, being raped, and being forced to kill or hurt family members were most predictive of traumatic reactions. Being raped, seeing others raped, the death of a parent\/s, being forced to fight, and having to hide to protect oneself were the strongest predictors of depressive symptoms. War experiences such as abduction, death of one's parent\/s, being forced to fight, and having to hide to protect oneself were the most associated with the child's experience of grief. In addition to Total Grief, Traumatic Grief, Existential Grief, and Continuing Bonds were measured in these children. Although trauma, depression, and grief often exist as co-morbid disorders, the mechanisms and pathways of these is less understood. In this study we used Structural Equation Modeling to better understand the complex interaction and trajectories of these three symptoms evolving from war exposure and loss. This study is the first of its kind to assess the psychosocial effects of war experiences among children currently living in war zone areas within Sudan. It identifies some of the most prevalent war-related atrocities and their varying impact on the children's psychological well-being and overall adjustment. Implications for planning mental health interventions are discussed.","1023":"Caring for an elderly spouse with dementia places a heavy burden on spousal caregivers and often results in chronic depression. Little has been written about change in depression caregivers experience from before to after the death of the spouse with dementia. This longitudinal study examines change in depression of spousal caregivers that occurs following death of the dementia patient. Two theoretical models, the Relief and Stress Models, are discussed in terms of caregiver depression after the death of the dementia-patient care-recipient spouse. These two theoretical models were tested using longitudinal data from the National Institute on Aging sponsored Health and Retirement Study. Both male and female spousal caregivers report an increase in depression after the death of the dementia-patient care-recipient spouse. As time passed following the spouse's death, the conjugally bereaved husbands showed a decrease in depression while the conjugally bereaved wives continued to report increased depression.","1024":"Development of information technology has created new opportunities and challenges in suicide prevention, research, and clinical practice. This article presents an overview of the wide range of telecommunication-based suicide prevention approaches. Interventions using the Internet, telephone, and videoconferencing are discussed, including crisis intervention, referral, and support, suicide risk assessment, psychotherapy for individuals at risk, and online-based suicide prevention training and education. Research regarding effectiveness of telecommunication-based suicide prevention in various demographic and clinical populations is reviewed, as well as concerns regarding this type of intervention. Future areas of research and development in the use of telecommunication media in prevention of suicide are discussed.","1025":"The \"moment of death,\" once a dominant concept in preparing for a \"good death\", has been eclipsed by a focus on the wider concept of the \"dying trajectory\". However, findings from interviews with 25 bereaved individuals suggest that dying loved ones' final moments may still be experienced as highly significant in their own right. In some accounts the dying individual's final moments did not feature or made little impression, either because the survivor was not present, or there was no obviously definable moment, or because other, usually medical factors, such as whether to resuscitate the person, took precedence. However, in six cases such moments were constructed as profound, special, and memorable occasions. These constructions are explored in relation to achieving a good death, the dying trajectory as a whole, and making sense of the bereavement experience. Their implications for sociological theories of identity and embodiment are also considered.","1026":"A key theme in the bereavement literature is the recognition that every grief experience is unique and dependent on many variables, such as the circumstances of the death, characteristics of the bereaved individual, their relationship with the deceased, the provision and availability of support, and a myriad of sociocultural factors. Concurrently, there are corresponding efforts to define \"normal\" grief and delineate it from \"complicated\" grief experiences. The discord between these two potentially opposing statements remains a paradox evident within the three major tensions within the thanatological literature--the dominance of grief theories, the medicalization of grief, and the efficacy of grief interventions. Three recommendations for moving beyond the paradox are discussed--the provision of improved grief education for service providers, the bereaved, and the wider community; the conduct of research that emphasizes the context of grief and is relevant to service provision; and the examination of current grief interventions.","1027":"Previous studies have tried to account for the uniqueness of gender ratios in Chinese suicide through physiological and psychological differences between men and women, and the means employed in the fatal act. From the point of view of the socio-psychological traits, this study examines the effects of religion (religiosity), superstition, and perceived gender inequality among Chinese women on the degree of their suicide intent. A four-page structured interviews were performed to the consecutively sampled serious attempters of suicide hospitalized to emergency rooms immediately after the suicidal act in Dalian areas, China. Both univariate analyses and the multiple regression model have found that the higher the degree the religiosity and superstition on metempsychosis, the stronger the suicide intent Chinese women had. The perceived gender inequality is positively correlated with suicide intent, and it is especially true for Chinese women. The socio-psychological traits and traditional culture values and norms have important impacts on suicide patterns in Chinese societies.","1028":"Possible relationships between bereavement and religiosity to death anxiety levels of adolescents were investigated. Scales measuring religiosity, bereavement, and death anxiety were incorporated into one questionnaire. Two hundred and twenty-six adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 participated in the study based in urban and rural private schools within Manitoba. Females exhibited significantly higher death anxiety levels than did males; differences between the death anxiety levels of adolescents having a no-previous-death-experience death and those who had experienced a familial death were not significant; while religiosity levels were significantly higher for students attending religion-based schools, the relationships between measurements of religiosity and death anxiety were weak. Grief due to bereavement was the major factor in determining death anxiety for the adolescent.","1029":"This article explores the effects of a death sentence and execution on the children of the accused. Insight into the unique bereavement of this population is provided, while contributing to the literature on death and dying. The experience of losing a father to death row and eventual execution is compared to the wider population of children with incarcerated parents and it is determined that children of death row inmates contend with a much more complicated grief process, one that has gone largely unstudied. This article contains a brief discussion of disenfranchised grief and nonfinite loss, two theories that, we argue, shape the children's grief process. The results section of the article uses qualitative data gathered from 19 children to explore the role that nonfinite loss and disenfranchised grief share in the nature of their bereavement. Our discussion focuses on the impact of stigma and violence on the grieving process. Following a discussion of the unique challenges confronting the children of death row inmates is a discussion of the implications that their experience has for practice.","1030":"Our first goal is to link empirical measures of three theoretical explanations of marital status differences to the variation in male and female standardized suicide difference coefficients SSDCs in 12 developed countries, circa 1960. We include predictors of Durkheim's social integration hypothesis, Gibbs and Martin's concept of marital status integration, and norms on suicide acceptability. All three are significantly related to variation in male and female SSDCs. The second goal is to examine how our empirical indicators impact age-specific differences in the male minus female SSDC--differences that vary by age in all 12 of our study populations. The strongest predictor of these differences is the male minus female difference in the percent married.","1031":"A bereavement ritual observed during anthropological fieldwork in Peru gives basis to this article which asserts that bereavement has become an incomplete rite of passage. The article reviews the role of ritual and rites of passage, examines other anthropologic examples of death and bereavement rituals, and identifies the lack of post-funeral ritual for many bereaved individuals in the United States. While funerary rituals which end with the funeral and burial of the dead are helpful in providing immediate structure for the bereaved, they are not congruent with the long-term emotional needs and reconstruction of meaning within grief. The author acknowledges value of both private ritual and reunions of the community of mourners, and recommends that bereavement counselors and\/or the funeral industry offer to help bereaved construct a \"ritual of remembrance and new meaning\" after time has allowed them to move along in meaning reconstruction processes of making sense, finding benefits, and identity change.","1032":"Adults in this exploratory study usually recalled that their childhood imaginary companions faded away or were dismissed as other options for social interaction became more appealing. However, eight participants reported that their IC had died. Analysis of these deaths offers a glimpse of the child's talent for transitional thought processes that navigate between the emerging constraints of logic and the continuing appeal of fantasy. It is suggested that young children are testing the limits and possibilities of what it means to be \"real\" at the same time they are trying to puzzle out \"alive\" and \"dead.\"","1033":"","1034":"This article expands an earlier model of the tasks of grieving (1990, [1995], [2001]) by building on science based findings derived from research in attachment theory, neuroscience, interpersonal neurobiology, and childhood traumatic grief (CTG). The proposed treatment model is a prescriptive approach that spells out specific tasks to be undertaken by children suffering traumatic grief under the direction of a therapist who is trained in trauma-informed therapy approaches and draws heavily on the empirically derived childhood traumatic grief treatment model developed by Cohen and Mannarino (2004; Cohen, Mannarino, &amp; Deblinger, 2006). This model expands on their work by proposing specific tasks that are informed by attachment theory research and the interpersonal neurobiological research (Schore, 2003a, 2003b; Siegel, 1999). Particular emphasis is placed on developing a coherent and meaningful narrative since this has been found as a crucial factor in recovery from trauma in attachment research (Siegel, 1999; Siegel &amp; Hartzell, 2003).","1035":"The grief that certified nursing assistants (CNAs) experience following the deaths of nursing home residents has received scant attention in past research, particularly from an empirical standpoint. The purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate the grief experiences of CNAs in the nursing home setting and to identify and evaluate factors that may mediate or exacerbate grief. Participants (N=136) from 12 nursing homes completed self-administered surveys. Regression analyses revealed that CNAs with lower levels of perceived disenfranchised grief reported higher levels of personal growth, while CNAs with greater fear of death and those who experienced fewer deaths on the job reported higher levels of complicated grief. Practitioners and future researchers may benefit from these findings through the construction and implementation of interventions aimed at effectively enfranchising the grief experiences of this important group of healthcare workers.","1036":"The families of death row inmates experience grief and loss issues that have been neglected by scholars and clinicians alike. The issues found in this population are unique and require our understanding. The present study uses the concepts of disenfranchised grief and nonfinite loss to uncover the pain experienced by the children and other family members who have a loved one on death row. Kenneth Doka's (1989) concept of disenfranchised grief is utilized to bring attention to the ways in which the circumstances surrounding an execution leave the family members of those condemned to death outside of the \"grieving rules\" that exist in the United States. Family members are disenfranchised from their grief, as society does not socially validate their pain. The loss that they feel is also nonfinite (Bruce &amp; Schultz, 2001) in that it is continuous and denies the families all of the hopes, dreams, and expectations that they had for their loved one who now sits on death row. The qualitative interview method was utilized by the authors of this study to gather data from 26 family members of death row inmates who are incarcerated along the East Coast of the United States. The reactions of this group of family members are varied and complex, yet they include the following common responses: social isolation due to stigma and their own feelings of criminalization, intensified family conflict between family members who grieve differently from one another, diminished self-esteem, shame, diffused and specific feelings of guilt, and a chronic state of despair. This study explores virtually untapped terrain. An examination of the microlevel effects of the death penalty on families provides insight in to the area of death and dying, especially as it is related to disenfranchised loss and nonfinite grief. In addition, this study provides insight into the death penalty and its effects.","1037":"The study investigated how two distinct perspectives apply to the role of gender in parents' memorials on The Compassionate Friends (TCF) electronic bulletin board; cyberspace as merely a mirror of societal gendered patterns of bereavement, and cyberspace as a medium or context in which societal gendered patterns of bereavement are neutralized. Data were evaluated to determine to what extent gender differences exist concerning instrumental versus intuitive styles of bereavement. Analytic categories used in assessing gender differences in parental bereavement style included the following: invoking spirituality, directing messages to the deceased, artistic expressions, and special powers accorded to the deceased. With some exceptions, the findings supported the perspective emphasizing the gender neutralizing aspects of cyberspace parental bereavement for the population studied.","1038":"Newspaper obituaries are important mourning rituals that announce the deaths of individuals and share their life stories with others. Obituaries also provide insight into the societal values and attitudes of the day. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether factors such as gender and age were related to age-inaccuracy in obituary photographs and whether the level of age-inaccurate photographs has increased over time. Obituary photographs were analyzed from The Cleveland Plain Dealer for the years 1967, 1977, 1987, and 1997 (N = 400). Results indicated that obituary photographs of women (p &lt; 0.001) and of older adults (p &lt; 0.001) were much more likely to be age-inaccurate. Analysis also revealed a consistent upward trend in age-inaccurate photographs over time (p &lt; 0.05). The findings from this study indicate that society's bias toward youthful appearance has persisted and grown over time, particularly in the case of older women.","1039":"This article explores the art of letter-writing, specifically to our beloved dead, as a form of autoethnographic research, pedagogy, and care work. As university teachers and qualitative researchers in palliative and end-of-life care, we review the literature and history of epistolary communications with the deceased, as a prelude to writing our own letters. John writes to his long-dead mother and Dorothy to her recently deceased spouse Patrick, each letter followed by a reflective dialogue between us. Through this dialogue, we highlight the potential application of this art, or handcraft, to formal and informal palliative care, and the implications for practice, pedagogy, policy, and research. We propose that such direct, non-mediated, communications can offer a valuable form of healing for bereaved people. The therapeutic potential of letter writing and the abundance of literary and popular culture exemplars of responses from the dead are also largely unexplored in death education and research.","1040":"End of life decisions, such as physician-assisted suicide (PAS), have continued to be controversial as health care policy, moral, and individual health care issues. This study considers knowledge of end of life options and death attitudes as predictors of attitudes toward PAS. Data were gathered from approximately 300 adults through a mailing sent to a household research panel. Validated measures of attitudes toward PAS, knowledge about that state's assisted suicide laws, demographics, and attitudes toward death as measured through the Death Attitude Profile-Revised (DAP-R) were collected and analyzed. The data indicate that attitudes toward PAS are a function of knowledge of end of life options as well as death attitudinal factors.","1041":"This study presents an exploration of significant coping strategies for Chinese widowers' healthy adjustment to conjugal loss. The informants, 17 Chinese widowers, were asked to share strategies they have adopted to achieve healthy adjustment to spousal loss. The results reveal that loss-orientation coping, consisting of: 1) emotion-focused coping; 2) social coping; and 3) meaning-focused coping, was the key strategy in dealing with challenges posed by the past. Restoration-orientation coping, consisting of: 1) problem-focused coping; 2) social coping; 3) future-focused coping and 4) meaning-focused coping; was the key to managing challenges posed by present and future needs. It is hoped that insights from this study will inform social workers' practice with Chinese widowers experiencing poor adjustment to conjugal loss.","1042":"This analysis explores associations between differing death circumstances and the course of bereavement among a sample of 540 bereaved parents. Comparisons were made between parents whose children died by suicide (n = 462), those losing children from other traumatic death circumstances (n = 54), and others whose children died from natural causes (n = 24). Results were mixed, showing suicide survivors with more grief difficulties and other mental health problems on some criteria, though most findings showed no substantive differences between these subgroups. Results also showed, in the first years after loss, repeated suicide attempts and prior negative relationships with the decedent were associated with greater grief difficulties. However, as more time passed, all death circumstance differences were overshadowed by the importance of the time span since loss. This data also suggested that between 3 and 5 years usually marks the turning point, when acute grief difficulties accompanying a suicide loss begin to subside.","1043":"The role of the Internet in facilitating and preventing suicide is reviewed. Two online suicide prevention programs are described: SAHAR in Israel and Befrienders worldwide. Examples are provided of crisis intervention by e-mail. Finally, some caveats are presented based on experiences with crisis intervention by telephone.","1044":"The purpose of this study was to describe how Black adolescent males understand \"second-line\" (musical processions) and \"regular\"\/traditional funeral rituals in New Orleans following the violent deaths of significant persons in their lives. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 Black males between the ages of 12 and 15 using descriptive phenomenology methodology. Findings revealed that these participants understood death as a cause for celebration, remembrance, and unity related to their experiences with the second-line ritual. Three elements of the life world of Black teenage males were descriptive of second lines, including: a) observed locations of second lines; b) dancing to good music; and c) observed messages conveyed through t-shirts. Participants provided gender-based descriptions of perceived spoken and unspoken rights in grieving at the two distinct rituals. Related to their second-line experience, the teens reflect on ways in which they wish to have their deaths ritualized.","1045":"In 1970, Psychology Today published the \"You and Death\" questionnaire, a 75-item instrument designed by Edwin Shneidman of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in consultation with Edwin Parker and G. Ray Funkhouser of Stanford University. This article compares data gathered through the same instrument from death education classes spanning 25 years across 3 decades. The results offer a unique opportunity to compare attitudes toward and beliefs about death with the original responses as well as to note changes across decades within a similar population.","1046":"Dissection of a human cadaver is a time-honored tradition for teaching anatomy in medical education. However, in recent years, for a variety of reasons, including costs and ethical concerns, some medical programs have ceased cadaver dissection in exchange for virtual dissection of cadavers in cyberspace. Past research suggests that students find work on a cadaver to be distressing, but also rewarding. This study analyzed journal entries from 21 undergraduate students working with a cadaver in a gross anatomy course. An empirical, phenomenological analysis of the data identified 19 common themes among the participant's journal entries. In addition, the analysis disclosed how participants usually felt a need to justify the act of dissection. Finally, the analysis identified how students differed in the varied ways they coped with the ambiguous status of the cadaver, which was sometimes viewed as a deceased person while at other times experienced as a fascinating machine. Based on the findings, the researchers offer recommendations for helping students to better cope with the experience of cadaver dissection and to use the experience pedagogically to better prepare students for the stress of the medical world, especially issues surrounding death and dying.","1047":"In order to explore the generalizability of perceptions of the losses experienced by grandparents raising their grandchildren, 610 traditional\/non-custodial grandparents, who had no custodial responsibility for their grandchildren, read a randomly assigned scenario depicting a grandmother and her grandchild, wherein scenarios varied in terms of grandchild gender, the presence or absence of grandchild problems, and the reason for role assumption. They then completed the Perceptions of Loss (PLS) scale, where higher scores indexed greater awareness of loss. Results suggested that perceptions of loss varied by grandchild gender (favoring females), grandchild problem (favoring those with problems), and the reason for role assumption (favoring parental abandonment and parental drug abuse). Moreover, PLS scores were influenced by the interaction between grandchild gender and reason for role assumption, where the impact of role assumption was greater for female grandchildren than for male grandchildren. These findings in part parallel those obtained from young adults, and generally suggest that others in varying degrees are sensitive to the losses grandparents raising their grandchild experience. Such findings have implications regarding the extent to which grandparent caregivers' grief is disenfranchised, as well as impacting custodial grandparents' feelings of loneliness and isolation from age peers brought about by the necessity to raise their grandchildren.","1048":"Caregivers of terminal cancer patients experience substantial communication difficulties with their loved ones about their illness. Existing communication scales focus on communication as perceived by the patient and do not include items that refer to his close death. The current study describes the development and initial validation of an instrument aimed at measuring caregivers' communication with patients about their illness and death. Two hundred thirty-six bereaved primary caregivers of cancer patients were recruited over a period of 18 months. The psychometric properties of the scale were explored by confirmatory factor analysis. Results provided support for a one factor solution. The discriminant and convergent validity of the responses to the scale were also supported. Future studies should further establish the validity of the scale with larger sample sizes and different populations of caregivers of patients with other terminal diseases.","1049":"Family bereavement by homicide is one of the most challenging facets of crime victim intervention a medical care provider, mental health clinician, or law enforcement officer will face. But the process of healing can begin at the outset through intelligent, sensitive, competent, and compassionate death notification and body identification by trained and dedicated professionals. A practical system for death notification and body identification is presented that can be adapted and modified to the needs of law enforcement, military mental health, and notifiers from related disciplines; it can also be adapted to death notification in sudden, accidental deaths. Throughout, the emphasis is on how notifiers may often be the de facto first responders in the struggle to help traumatically bereaved family members survive their ordeal and reclaim their lives.","1050":"This research sought to investigate the role of social networks in coping and adjustment to spousal bereavement. A total of 198 Xhosa-speaking participants, drawn from the rural areas of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, took part in the study. Quantitative data analyses revealed significant correlations between perceived social support on Social Support Appraisals scale and the anxiety scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition and the problem-solving coping strategy scale on the Coping Strategy Indicator. Regression analyses revealed that depression contributed to increased social support appraisals, while anxiety was a significant negative predictor of the participants' experience of perceived social support. The authors highlight the need for bereavement intervention programs in the rural areas to be geared toward psycho-educating the conjugally bereaved individuals, within the socio-cultural framework, to continuously evaluate their support structures and strengthen ties with social networks that render support, instrumental assistance, and advice in times of need.","1051":"As patients with terminal disease enter into the final stage of their illness, psychiatric symptoms and psychological responses to the disease contribute to overall suffering of both patient and family. Until recently, no nationally accepted guidelines or practices had been established to support assessment and management of this type of suffering. In 2007, the National Quality Forum published A National Framework and Preferred Practices for Palliative and Hospice Care Quality that included a list of preferred practices for assessing and treating symptoms of psychiatric illness, anticipatory grief and psychologic distress prior to death, and bereavement after the death, of the patient. While specialized care may be provided to patient and families in the context of advanced disease, all clinicians involved in palliative and end-of-life care are responsible for having a basic understanding of effectively managing psychologic and psychiatric aspects of this care. Evidence from current literature supports these best practices.","1052":"","1053":null,"1054":"More than 30 years have passed since palliative care was introduced in the United States, and what began as a small rebellion has evolved into a fairly large health care industry. Although the palliative care movement has considerably improved the care given to those at the end of life, many challenges remain for palliative care providers in the United States. This article discusses the history of hospice and palliative care in the United States, the Medicare Hospice Benefit, the growth of hospice and palliative care, and challenges such as the need for regulatory change, workforce issues, improving access to care, and improving the quality of palliative care.","1055":"In Britain, Palliative Medicine was recognized as a subspecialty of Internal Medicine exactly 20 years after Cicely Saunders founded St Christopher's, at exactly the same time that government was at last recognizing the worth and the needs of general practice. Both had far-reaching effects and implications for patients, doctors, and the future of medicine. For Palliative Medicine it meant units wishing to train specialists going through a rigorous selection process; the development of an equally rigorous training program for the doctors who had already gained a higher qualification before starting Palliative Medicine, demonstrating the need for and benefits of palliative medicine to the sceptics in the profession and, now, continuing to recruit the staff for the steadily increasing number of new services. Today there are more Palliative Medicine consultants\/specialists than there are oncologists and neurologists combined, with Hospital Palliative Care Teams in every major hospital and cancer center. With nine Chairs in Palliative Medicine, there is now a drive for research and professional education. The specialty faces major challenges, however, ranging from training to care for patients with non-malignant disease to enabling patients to die in the place of their choice-something that rarely happens today; from defining what is distinctive or unique about palliative medicine to clarifying the respective place of general practice and the specialty. Most would agree that the biggest challenge for the young, thriving specialty is how to share its principles with other doctors wherever they work.","1056":"The founding vision of St Christopher's Hospice was based on a recognition that permeating mainstream health care services would be essential and an emphasis on an adaptable philosophy rather than a building. Today, demographic and disease related changes mean that need and demand for end-of-life care will inevitably outstrip professional and financial resource. Hospices must engage with the development of cost-effective models of service delivery and rational planning. Only partnership working with the National Health Service, care homes, and others will ensure that appropriate care is available to everyone wherever the bed in which they die, regardless of diagnosis. Only collaboration and active engagement will ensure that future strategy in end-of-life care retains the original insight that its focus rightly includes not only patients but also the social context that will be affected by their death. Cost and patient choice dictate an emphasis on care at home. Health-promoting, public education and family-focused strategies will be essential. At a pivotal moment for the delivery of health care generally, hospices can play a vital part by marrying the role of \"insistent conscience\" of the health care service with continued cost-effective clinical innovation.","1057":"The rapid spread of Saunders' thinking across the world has been facilitated by the Hospice Information service and library at St Christopher's Hospice which she helped to create and further enhanced by Help the Hospices. We have set this article in the context of the Web and other information systems as they are developing today. \"Connecting people\" and \"collecting people's experiences\" were terms often used by Cicely Saunders when she described the work of Hospice Information, a service that has in some measure contributed to the rapid spread of her thinking across the world and which is currently in close contact with palliative care workers in over 120 countries. Connecting--or networking--putting people and organizations in touch with each other for mutual benefit and collecting and disseminating people's experiences are central to our work as a U.K. and international resource on hospice and palliative care for professionals and the public. Add to these the crucial role of information provision and advocacy for patients, carers, and health professionals alike and we hope that you may begin to appreciate how our respective organizations have contributed to the spread of Cicely Saunders' vision.","1058":"Spirituality is an essential component of the care of patients with serious illness and those that are dying. Dame Cicely Saunders developed the hospice movement based on the biopsychosocialspiritual model of care, in which all four dimensions are important in the care of patients. Of all the models of care, hospice and palliative care recognize the importance of spiritual issues in the care of patients and their families. The National Consensus Project Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care, in the United States, provides specific recommendations about all domains of care including the spiritual domain, which is recognized as a critical component of care (The National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care www.nationalconsensusproject.org). Studies indicate that the majority of patients would like their spiritual issues addressed, yet find that their spiritual needs are not being met by the current system of care. Interestingly, spirituality is the one dimension that seems to get slightly less emphasis than the biopsychosocial dimensions of care. Some reasons may include the difficulty with definitions of spirituality for clinical and research purposes, the time constraints and financial burdens in the current healthcare system in the United States, and the lack of uniform training for all healthcare professionals. Yet, there are theoretical and ethical frameworks that support spiritual care as well as some educational models in spirituality and health that have been successful in medical education in the United States. Spirituality can be seen as the essential part of the humanity of all people. It is at its root, relational and thus forms the basis of the altruistic care healthcare professionals are committed to. Spirituality has to do with respecting the inherent value and dignity of all persons, regardless of their health status. It is the part of humans that seeks healing, particularly in the midst of suffering. Spiritual care models are based on an intrinsic aspect that calls for compassionate presence to patients as well as an extrinsic component where healthcare professionals address spiritual issues with patients and their loved ones. Currently in the healthcare system, evidence-base models are the criteria for practice recommendations. Yet, spirituality may not be amenable entirely to strict evidence-base criteria. As hospice and palliative care continues to develop as a field, healthcare professionals are challenged to think of ways to advocate for and include the spiritual dimension of care.","1059":"Distress reverberates throughout the family during palliative care and bereavement, inviting consideration of a family-centered model of care. Targeting families thought to be \"at risk\" has merit. The Family Focused Grief Therapy model was tested in a randomized controlled trial of 81 families (353 individuals) and bereavement outcome is reported here for treatment completers compared to controls. There were no significant baseline differences between treatment completers and non-completers. Significant reduction in distress occurred at 13 months post death for the families completing treatment, with further improvements for the 10% of individuals most distressed at baseline. A preventive model of family-centered care applied to those at greatest risk is meritorious and in keeping with the aspirations of Cicely Saunders for improving the quality of hospice care.","1060":"The 40 years since St Christopher's Hospice opened has witnessed a burgeoning international interest in palliative care. Its key characteristics comprise a focus on the whole-person (physical, psychological, social, and spiritual), patient-centeredness (partnership with and empowerment of the patient and family), openness and honesty in communication, an acceptance of the inevitability of death coupled with improvement in the quality of life, multi-professional teamwork integrated with community (volunteer) involvement. Although much has been achieved, much remains to be done. Both in resource-poor countries and in more wealthy ones, the scope of palliative care has changed. Initially in the United Kingdom, palliative care was mostly limited to cancer patients but now strenuous efforts are being made to extend coverage to other patient groups, e.g., those with end-stage heart disease or renal failure. In India, with a dearth of chronic care facilities, palliative care services increasingly embrace those with chronic disability as well as progressive end-stage disease. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the devastating impact of AIDS is having a major impact on the development and delivery of palliative care. To maximize the benefits of limited financial and other resources, a strategic approach is necessary. The World Health Organization emphasizes three essential foundation measures: health service policy, public awareness and professional education, and drug availability. However, at the end of the day, if we are truly to honor Cicely Saunders, palliative care must remain a movement with momentum, combining creative charisma with inevitable bureaucratic routinization.","1061":"","1062":"Obituaries from the New York Times are examined at three points to illuminate changing conceptions of death. The findings are twofold. Changes in the obituary demonstrate how the locus of social control over death has shifted from nature and God, to medicine and most recently to the individual. Additionally, it is shown that descriptions of biophysical aspects of the dying process are marginalized over time and that there is more frequent use of language that emphasizes death-resistant themes in the most recent obituaries. This finding exemplifies the observation of increasing claims to authority over mortality by individuals in recent decades.","1063":"Scales to measure helplessness and hopelessness were found to have good reliability and concurrent validity and were significantly correlated with suicidal ideation.","1064":"In samples of both Turkish and American students, the correlates of suicidal ideation were found to be similar, with depression, hopelessness, and attitudes toward the ownership of life predicting the level of suicidal ideation in both samples. Results using a Western measure of religiosity, however, were different in the two cultures, indicating the need for measures of religiosity specifically tailored for Turkish culture.","1065":"The present study aimed to examine the level of death anxiety, the sex-related differences among a middle-aged Kuwaiti personnel sample, and to explore the replicability of the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety (ASDA) factors. A sample of 236 volunteer Kuwaiti personnel took part in the study. The mean ages of men and women were 41.5 (SD = 7.5) and 40.9 (SD = 7.1), respectively. The alpha reliability of the ASDA was found to be high (.93). Women had a significantly higher mean total score on the ASDA as well as on 17 out of its 20 items. Middle-aged personnel had a significantly lower mean ASDA total score than younger college students (M age = 22). The factor analysis of the ASDA items yielded three factors: fear of dead people and tombs; fear of postmortem events; and fear of lethal disease. These factors were highly replicable with previous factors extracted from a Kuwaiti college student sample. On the basis of the present findings, there are three general conclusions as follows: death anxiety is negatively associated with age; the sex-related differences on death anxiety are salient in the Arab samples; and the ASDA has a highly replicable factor structure.","1066":"Convergent lines of evidence from adoption, family, geographical, immigrant, molecular genetic, surname, and twin studies of suicide point to genetic contributions to risk factors for suicidal behavior. Related mental health literacy (knowledge and beliefs) of professionals and laypersons may, however, lag behind this research progress. The purpose of this study was to further validate the 22-item Beliefs in the Inheritance of Risk Factors for Suicide Scale (BIRFSS), a novel instrument for assessing individuals' beliefs in the genetics of suicide. Data from a general population sample of 159 Austrian adults showed adequate internal scale consistency. Due to deliberate content heterogeneity, the instrument has a subscale structure, but factor analysis of items extracted a dominant first factor. BIRFSS scores were positively related to overall and specific knowledge on suicide facts (convergent validity), whereas unrelated to the Big Five personality dimensions, locus of control, social desirability, and verbal intelligence (discriminant validity). Demographic correlates of BIRFSS scores included respondents' age and religiosity (both positive ones), but not respondents' sex, educational level, or political orientation.","1067":"The objectives of the current investigation were threefold: a) to explore the gender differences on love of life (a new construct in the well-being domain) and death distress (death anxiety, death depression, and death obsession); b) to explore the relationship between the scales of these constructs; and c) to examine the factorial structure of these scales. The sample was 245 volunteer Kuwaiti college students (53.5% women). Their mean age was 21.9 (SD = 2.3). They responded to the Love of Life Scale, the Death Anxiety Scale, the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety, the Death Depression Scale-Revised, and the Death Obsession Scale. Gender differences on love of life were not significant. However, women had significantly higher mean scores for the four death distress scales than did their male counterparts. All the correlations between love of life and the death distress scales were not significant except one pertaining to love of life and death depression (negative) in women. Two oblique factors were extracted: death distress and love of life. It was concluded that these constructs represent two distinct and independent factors. Counselors and clinicians dealing with death distress would find that it is not associated with love of life.","1068":"As Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) gains popularity in various areas in the world, we are not sure whether the scale is an optimal measure of suicide intent in the Chinese culture. This study is to provide evidence to support the use of the Chinese shortened version of SIS (C-SIS) in Chinese societies. The data were from applying the C-SIS in a psychological autopsy (PA) study of 66 suicides in Dalian, China. Reliability and validity tests were performed on the C-SIS data. Internal consistency analysis showed excellent correlation coefficients for all items but one. Inter-rater reliability tests showed statistically significant correlations between each pair of informants for each item and for the total scores. Criterion validity analysis demonstrated a relatively high correlation between the scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and C-SIS. Factor analysis produced three factors accounting for 66.77% of the total variance. The study suggested that C-SIS should be an appropriate instrument for detecting and measuring suicide intent in Chinese societies.","1069":"This study investigated the patterns of parental bereavement in 20 parents who have lost a child to cancer, congenital heart disease, meningitis, or drowning in the last 19 months, using semi-structured interviews and standardized questionnaires of depression and grief. Qualitative content analysis of interviews identified three bereavement patterns: The majority of parents (65%) presented uncomplicated, Integrated Grief five mothers were Consumed by Grief and one mother and one father expressed Minimal Grief. Quotes from parents exemplified these patterns. Parental gender, symptoms of depression, and pre-death relationship between parents and their deceased child differentially related to these patterns. Having surviving children, social support, and being active appeared to help to integrate grief into daily life. These findings illustrate differential patterns of parental bereavement and related factors, information that has important implications for identifying at-risk parents for complicated bereavement.","1070":"The present study examined the relationship between idiocentrism, allocentrism, psychological well being (self-esteem, depression, and social support), and suicidal ideation among 283 American college students and 343 Chinese college students. Idiocentrism was correlated with high self-esteem, high depression, and low social support, but the relationships were more likely to be significant for women than for men in both cultures. Allocentrism was primarily related to social support. As predicted, high levels of suicidal ideation were correlated with more idiocentrism, but only for women. Allocentrism was related to lower levels of suicidal ideation in both cultures, but the relationship was small. As suicide prevention may start from suicidal ideation treatment, the treatment of suicidal ideation may have to take into account cultural and personal characteristics, such as idiocentrism.","1071":"The value of parent-to-parent support has been noted in research with parents of children who have a range of special needs and chronic medical conditions, however, less is known about the benefit of such mentorship for parents caring for seriously ill and dying children. Findings from a qualitative study with mothers of seriously ill children, including those whose children had died, provided rich and detailed information about the personal and practical resources they received from other parents. Personal recommendations to parents by parents included the value of seeking out mentorship and appreciating the small things in life, while practical suggestions encompassed encouraging parents to become informed and to advocate for their children's best interests. Mothers also identified professionals with end-of-life training as instrumental agents of support.","1072":"The death of a loved one requires many adults to make decisions about a variety of details regarding funeral arrangements. Based upon data collected from 348 adults (M age = 34.21) who had attended the funeral of a loved one within the last year, a scale consisting of 50 items regarding the difficulties each had experienced with regard to events prior to, during, and after the funeral, was developed. Cronbach's Alpha coefficient for this measure of difficulty was .96. Principal components analysis of these data indicated that difficulty in coping with funerals could be understood in light of six factors explaining 56% of the common variance among relationships between items: 1) protocol\/mechanics of the funeral; 2) general personal and interpersonal difficulties related to the death\/funeral; 3) trust in the funeral industry; 4) concerns regarding the cemetery; 5) issues pertaining to grief; and 6) post-funeral personal responsibilities. With regard to both overall difficulty and the above six factors, older adults experienced fewer difficulties, as did those who more actively participated in funeral rituals. In contrast, those who reported more personal and bereavement-related distress experienced more difficulties. Findings of the current study have value both in identifying persons for whom funerals may undermine bereavement adjustment and in identifying appropriate intervention and aftercare services for such individuals.","1073":"This research study explores the effects of support groups on traumatic stress responses of women experiencing stillbirth. Women (N = 47) responded to a mixed method questionnaire. Quantitative results utilizing the Impact of Event Scale Revised demonstrate that women who attend support group, when controlling for time, had fewer post traumatic stress symptoms than did the women who did not attend support group. Qualitative results elucidate the role of support groups in managing grief, suggesting that connectivity with other like women may be a useful strategy in reducing problematic psychological outcomes.","1074":"Assessing a person's intent to die in a suicide attempt is crucial for risk assessment and research, yet suicidal intent is notoriously difficult to measure. People who intended to die when they hurt themselves may deny it, and others may feign intent for secondary gain. Additionally, ambivalence, memory gaps, impulsivity, and fluidity of intent can hinder accurate assessment of intent. Circumstantial evidence, such as a suicide note, may illuminate true intentions but also has substantial limitations. This article summarizes disparate challenges to the measurement of suicidal intent; describes strengths and weaknesses of circumstantial indicators; reviews evidence from studies using the Suicide Intent Scale to show that subjective and circumstantial indicators do not strongly correlate with each other; and concludes with a call to place more trust in individuals whose disclosures of suicidal intent are questionable, even if the possibility for manipulation exists.","1075":"Societal expectations of grief impact the experience of bereavement. The congruence of societal expectations with current scientific understanding of grief is unknown. Therefore two qualitative studies explored community perceptions of grief. In study one, three small focus groups (N = 9) examined grief-related expectations associated with hypothetical scenarios of bereavement. In study two, the impact of grief-related perceptions on the lived experience of bereavement for 11 individuals was explored through semi-structured interviews. Across both studies, elements of a traditional stage model view of grief were evident, with participants viewing emotional expression of grief as important. An avoidant coping style in the bereaved was considered problematic. Findings of study two suggested that grief-related beliefs may impact the bereavement experience via appraisal of the grief response and willingness to support bereaved individuals. The studies suggested that stage model assumptions in the beliefs of the general population persist, although there was a recognition of diversity in the grief response.","1076":"The purpose of this study was to explore the bereavement experiences of parents who had experienced the death of a child in Chinese families. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 bereaved parents in Macau, China. Narrative accounts of Chinese parents' experience in the loss of a child were explored to understand how their connection to the deceased child and their worldview were influenced by cultural beliefs and values. Study themes related to parental connections with the deceased child included the use of object linking, memorializing acts, and avoidance of traditional funeral processes, with clear patterns of Chinese cultural influence. Additionally, themes related to impacts on parental worldview included use of the concept of fate as a rationale for child loss and influences on religious orientation. The influence of cultural beliefs and background on Chinese parents as they deal with the issue of a child's death was apparent. Further research is needed and will benefit our understanding of parental bereavement in Chinese families.","1077":"Bereaved adolescents (N = 90) who had experienced relatively common death losses (e.g., grandparent, friend) completed the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief and the Emotional Closeness Scale and Continuum. Results indicated that present grief was significantly higher for friend than for grandparent death loss. A MANOVA revealed that those in the high closeness group reported significantly higher mean scores on past and present grief than those in the low closeness group. Finally, in a hierarchal multiple regression, after demographic variables were entered (e.g., age, present at death), emotional closeness added significant variance to the prediction of past and present grief. This research contributes to the understanding of grief intensity following adolescents' most common death losses and highlights the importance of counselors' intentionally and directly assessing bereaved adolescents' perceived emotional closeness to the deceased as part of grief-related counseling.","1078":"There is an ongoing debate on the definition of euthanasia and attempts to change laws about euthanasia and its practice in many countries. It is the medical doctors and the other health professionals who will elucidate the issue. Therefore, we performed this study to reveal attitude of Turkish health professionals toward euthanasia. This is an observational and cross-sectional study and data were collected with a questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 545 health professionals in Samsun, a city in the Black Sea Region in Turkey. Data were analyzed with SPSS package programs. Of all health professionals included in the study, 43.5% were medical doctors and 45.5% auxiliary health professionals. Of all participants, 33.6% did not object to euthanasia and 7.9% were asked to perform euthanasia. Eighty point seven percent of the participants noted that euthanasia could be abused even if a euthanasia law were passed. It can be concluded that the health professionals should have a chance to discuss euthanasia and that their attitude toward and their expectations and worries about euthanasia should be taken into account when a euthanasia law is drafted.","1079":"This research project explored grief and its impact upon men and women who have experienced the sudden and unanticipated death of his or her partner. It included what grief meant to them, how it was manifested in his or her everyday lives and how his or her partner's death had impacted upon his or her relationship with themselves, with others and the world. A Husserlian phenomenological approach was used to explore the experiences of the ten women and five men whose partner had died up to five years prior to being interviewed. The need for the surviving partner to continue to participate in everyday life placed great strain upon the internal resources of the surviving partner. The surviving partner needed to reinvent him or herself, in an attempt to become independent and regain functionality, whilst dealing with the sadness and loss that they had experienced. The surviving partner discovered that a new life order emerged that included hope, optimism, planning for the future and perhaps the prospect of a new relationship. The death of a partner left the surviving partner with a loss that would always be a part of them, with the memories of his or her relationship being maintained within them that will never be replaced by somebody else. The results of this research project reinforce the need for ongoing education of the community in grief and bereavement issues in order to increase the awareness of the support needs of the bereaved person. The length of time and amount of energy required to incorporate the experience into the survivor's life, is greatly underestimated by the community, and perhaps by some of the health and caring professionals. Colonial and hospital based bereavement support services need to be established and be proactive using outreach programs, actively offering the suddenly bereaved partner and family support and information.","1080":"The purpose of this article is to describe the evaluations involved in the Yale Bereavement Study (YBS), a three-year NIMH and NCI-funded longitudinal study conducted from January 2000 through May 2003. The quantitative and qualitative questions included in the YBS gave the respondents an opportunity to describe their most recent loss, rate and review their past losses, and assess all aspects of their current life situations. In this article, the first author describes, in a qualitative manner, the ways in which this assessment, per se, appeared helpful and not harmful to the respondents. Also, developed here is the implication for potential application of a modified version of the YBS which could be used in both research and clinical practice.","1081":"Data are reported from samples of undergraduates around the world who have been administered Templer's Death Anxiety Scale. Data from 24 American samples and from 16 nations were identified. Strong sex differences were found and an association between the scores of men and women.","1082":"This article explores ways in which parents are represented as being involved with children in death and loss experiences. These representations are taken from 46 selected examples of death-related literature designed to be read by or with children. The main goal for us is to ask how parents are portrayed in these books and how their interactions with children are depicted. Since parents usually bear primary responsibility for the care of their children, they are ordinarily expected to share their experience and insights with their children, and to help children cope with death and loss. What do they do and how do they help (or not help) children in this body of literature?","1083":"With our aging population, it is estimated that in the near future there will be an overwhelming increase in the number of individuals dealing with Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD). From the time that symptoms begin to insidiously emerge, it can take well over ten years for the disease to run its course. In addition to the crippling effect for those inflicted, this lengthy duration can have an ongoing debilitating effect on the family members who are grieving while providing care. Researchers have claimed that the manner in which family members experience and manage their grief reactions to the pre-death losses can influence both caregiving outcomes and adjustment to bereavement once those with the disease have died. Given the relevance of grief management, this article provides answers to such questions as: How do family caregivers of individuals with ADRD manifest their grief? How can healthcare professionals intervene in assisting with grief management? The answers are provided introducing the 3-A grief intervention model for family caregivers of individuals with ADRD. The 3-A model enfranchises the caregiver grief experience through Acknowledging, Assessing, and Assisting in grief management. In doing so, different grieving styles are identified and the role that denial and respite plays in adapting to the family caregiver's grief experience is recognized. Clinical strategies to assist in grief management are also provided.","1084":"Death ideation and death anxiety represent the cognitive and affective dimensions of death attitudes, respectively. General beliefs about the world are proposed to be useful defensive mechanisms protecting persons against the death anxiety provoked by death ideation. SEM is employed to test the proposed mediation model, using a sample of 133 Hong Kong Chinese university students. Results showed that death ideation was significantly and inversely linked to belief in social cynicism, reward for application, and fate control. Moreover, higher levels of belief in fate control and lower levels of religiosity predicted greater death anxiety. Only belief in fate control partially mediated the relationship between death ideation and death anxiety. Discussion focused on how social axioms serve as useful defensive mechanisms against death anxiety.","1085":"How do people respond to the grief of parents over the death of their infant child? This article documents the experience of one of the authors, an American married to a Russian whose child died in England. Responses to this death by friends, colleagues and family in the USA, England, and two cities in Russia varied considerably in terms of depth and degree of engagement (emotional engagement, respect, or distance and avoidance). What factors underlie these varied responses? Two are identified, one structural, the other cultural: the strength of the social ties within social networks, and religiosity as historically sedimented within a culture. The degree of engagement is correlated with network form; but the content of engagement depends on religiosity.","1086":"This study reports the results of a survey on death preparation, death-related beliefs, and death anxiety in a Hong Kong sample. Respondents (N = 285) recruited from the community were asked if they have prepared for themselves a life insurance, a will, and a resting place (e.g. burial site, columbarium, etc.). Questions about their death-related cultural beliefs and anxiety were also asked. Results indicated that respondents who have thought of preparing for their own deaths but not yet acted out (contemplators) held stronger traditional cultural beliefs about death than respondents who have either done the preparations (planners) or never thought of the idea (non-contemplators). Contemplators also reported higher death anxiety. Despite limitations of the study's design, the current results suggest the beliefs in cultural taboo may play a role in the preparation for one's death.","1087":"Several studies have reported evidence that death is often associated with significant ceremonial events like holidays and birthdays, a phenomenon variously called the \"anniversary reaction,\" \"holiday effect,\" \"birthday blues,\" etc. This article, using data from the social security death index (SSDI), shows how evidence for this phenomenon can arise from an artifact in death records called \"death heaping\" in which certain dates, usually the 1st or the 15th, are systematically entered for missing data. In this study, each calendar birthday for the year 2003 in the SSDI was paired with either the 14th or 15th calendar day of death. For each pairing, there were more deaths for the 15th than the 14th. A second analysis compared the correspondence between dying on the same day of the month as one's birthday for the first 28 days of the month. A significantly greater number of birth-death combinations occurred for the 1st and 15th day of the month. These results suggest that studies of \"anniversary reactions\" should conduct preliminary evaluations to consider the possibility that statistically significant relationships do not arise from \"death heaping.\"","1088":"An education program for GPs about treating patients with depressive disorders and panic disorders was implemented in one district in the year 1998. A neighboring district was used as a control. Although the educational program was followed by an increase in referrals for panic disorder in the target district, there was no impact on referrals for depressive disorders, the prescribing of antidepressants by the GPs, or the suicide rate.","1089":"This article is part of a series of humor on social attitudes (Richmen, 1977), humor by the elderly (Richman, 1989), assessment (Richman, 1996a), and psychotherapy (Richman, 1996b). The present study is based on the topics of humor related to death anxiety and wishes, and aging that emerged during psychotherapy with elderly patients. The healing qualities of laughter and humor have been observed since Biblical times to the present, however the applications of humor to professional psychotherapy is still in its infancy. The examples in this study spell out how humor in therapy can bring people together, and help them affirm life and laugh at anxiety, depression, and their problems in living.","1090":"This article examines how absolute and relative income levels, social capital, and racial\/ethnic composition interact to explain variation in age-adjusted mortality rates across the 48 contiguous U.S. states. Our data showed that social capital had a powerful, negative effect on age-adjusted mortality rates--higher social capital states had lower age-adjusted mortality rates. After controlling for other variables, median income moderately related to mortality, but unexpectedly three measures of inequality did not. Finally, states' percent African American positively related to mortality, though indirectly and mediated entirely by social capital. In contrast, the strong negative effect of percent Hispanic\/Latino on mortality was partially suppressed by its negative association with social capital. Our understanding of the substantial impact of social conditions on mortality can help inform public policies and actions that may foster healthier and longer lives.","1091":"Hospice organizations are assailed by stiff competition, ever-rising costs, limited funding, and policy changes. Do such pressures stifle the high quality of care these organizations strive to provide? As a case-in-point, we draw from the mid-1990s accounts of caregivers at a nonprofit hospice in a Midwestern city in the United States. We maintain that economic pressures drive organizational restructuring, which then weakens working conditions and, thereby, weakens the staff-client relationship. We discuss effects upon worker behaviors, the worker-client relationship, and client care. This ethnographic case study signals the need to closely examine the threats that current economic and organizational pressures in the United States may pose to the quality of hospice care.","1092":"Within the hospice literature, spirituality and religion are usually defined in opposition to one another, with religion negatively associated with the external, authoritarian doctrines of Christianity and spirituality positively associated with the free search for truth, meaning, and authenticity. According to survey data, however, most Americans integrate spirituality and traditional religious commitments. The hospice literature is promoting spirituality to its own detriment by alienating potential patients and depriving religious patients of the resources that religious traditions and their affiliated religious communities have to offer.","1093":"To date, investigators have not demonstrated a clear relationship between a parent's history of prior perinatal losses and intensity of grief response following a subsequent perinatal loss. Examining this relationship for low-income, African-American parents is important because they are a vulnerable population due to the high incidence of perinatal mortality in Blacks and their other life stressors that can impact on grief response and caring needs. The purpose of this case study was to examine the impact of recurrent perinatal loss on a low-income African-American parent. The research design for this study was case report, using interview data collected from a mother who had recently experienced her fourth perinatal loss, which occurred at twenty-five weeks of gestation. Transcripts from two open-ended interviews were analyzed. The theoretical framework used to guide analysis of this case study was Lazarus and Folkman's stress and coping theory. Results demonstrated that the prior perinatal losses did not appear as critical components of the way the mother responded to her most recent loss. Instead, perception of the care she received from healthcare providers and how that care related to her experiences with her one living child who was born at the same gestational age was an important determinant in how she responded to her loss. The results of this case study demonstrate the importance assessing a person's perception of their experience and those factors which contribute to the way they respond.","1094":"The topic of euthanasia has been a matter of public debate for several decades. Although empirical research should inform policy, scale measurement is lacking. After analyzing shortcomings of previous work, we offer a systematically designed scale to measure attitudes toward euthanasia. We attempt to encompass previously unspecified dimensions of the phenomenon that are central to the euthanasia debate. The results of our pretest show that our attitude towards euthanasia (ATE) scale is both reliable and valid. We delineate active and passive euthanasia, no chance for recovery and severe pain, and patient's autonomy and doctor's authority. We argue that isolating these factors provides a more robust scale capable of better analyzing sample variance. Internal consistency is established with Cronbach's alpha=.871. Construct external consistency is established by correlating the scale with other predictors such as race and spirituality.","1095":"While there is ample evidence to support the need for hospice and palliative care services for African Americans, only 8% of patients who utilize those services are from African-American communities. The underutilization of end-of-life and palliative care can be attributed to several barriers to service access including incompatibility between hospice philosophy and African-American religious, spiritual, and cultural beliefs; health care disparities; distrust of the medical establishment; physician influence; financial disincentives, and hospice admission criteria. Suggestions for dismantling barriers to care access include developing culturally competent professionals in the health and human services, expanding the philosophy of hospice to include spiritual advisors from client communities, and funding national initiatives to promote improved access to health care at all stages in the life cycle of members of all underserved communities.","1096":"Our study focused on the cultural construction of dying and death in long-term care facilities. This article centers on direct care workers' perspective of residents' deaths. The data on which this article is based were gathered in a multi-year, multi-site study through formal ethnographic interviews, informal conversations, and on-site observations of residents and staff members. During fieldwork, we noticed an aptitude of direct care workers to deal with residents' deaths, which we named \"moral imagination.\" The term is borrowed from other disciplines to describe a \"way of seeing\" residents. The case studies presented--that of three direct care workers: a dietary aide, a nurse aide, and an assistant activities director--are suggestive of workers in each category. Our study offers implications for future research concerning direct care workers' value to residents' quality of life. We also propose questions for long-term care facilities about standards of formal caregiving at the end of life.","1097":"Euthanasia and assisted suicide are subject to an ongoing debate and discussed with various aspects. Because physicians are in a profession closely related to euthanasia, their attitudes toward this subject are significant. Thus, research intending to explore their opinions is carried out in many countries. In this study, opinions of the physicians regarding euthanasia's definition, contents, legal aspects, and acceptable conditions for its application are addressed. The questionnaire was given to 949 physicians, more than 1% of the total working in Turkey. Of the physicians who participated in the study, 49.9% agreed with the opinion that euthanasia should be legal in certain circumstances. In addition, 19% had come across a euthanasia request and the majority of physicians (55.9%) believed that euthanasia is applied secretly in the country despite the prohibitory legislation. In conclusion, the authors infer from the study itself and believe that euthanasia should be legal in certain circumstances and that the subject, which is not in the agenda of the Turkish population, should continue to be examined.","1098":"The purpose of this article is to describe the end-of-life process in the nursing home for three groups of cognitively-impaired nursing home residents: those who died with a medical decision-making process prior to death; those who died without such a decision-making process; and those who had a status-change event and a medical decision-making process, and did not die prior to data collection. Residents had experienced a medical status-change event within the 24 hours prior to data collection, and were unable to make their own decisions due to cognitive impairment. Data on the decision-making process during the event, including the type of event, the considerations used in making the decisions, and who was involved in making these decisions were collected from the residents' charts and through interviews with their physicians or nurse practitioners. When there was no decision-making process immediately prior to death, a decision-making process was usually reported to have occurred previously, with most decisions calling either for comfort care or limitation of care. When comparing those events leading to death with other status-change events, those who died were more likely to have suffered from troubled breathing than those who remained alive. Hospitalization was used only among those who survived, whereas diagnostic tests and comfort care were used more often with those who died. Those who died had more treatments considered and chosen than did those who remained alive. For half of those who died, physicians felt that they would have preferred less treatment for themselves if they were in the place of the decedents. The results represent preliminary data concerning decision-making processes surrounding death of the cognitively-impaired in the nursing home. Additional research is needed to elucidate the trends uncovered in this study.","1099":"This study aimed at investigating attitudes toward assisted suicide among individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the differences in health status (illness severity and functional disability) and psychosocial adjustment (depression, perceived stress, social support, and coping) between those in favor of and those against assisted suicide. This study also aimed at describing the characteristics of terminally-ill individuals who acknowledge contemplating assisted suicide. Forty-four individuals diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were surveyed about their attitudes and the circumstances that would make them contemplate assisted suicide and filled out standardized measures of mood, stress, social support, coping, and illness status. Seventy percent of the sample found assisted suicide morally acceptable and 60% thought it should be legalized. In addition, 60% of patients agreed they could foresee circumstances that would make them contemplate assisted suicide, but only three (7%) indicated they would have requested it already if it had been legal. Willingness to contemplate assisted suicide was associated with reports of elevated levels of depressive symptoms and reports of hopelessness. Results highlight the need to assess psychological status carefully when terminally ill individuals begin contemplating assisted suicide or voice a request for it.","1100":"The affective effect of suicide on people around is assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and some correlates are examined to identify characteristics of the bereaved individuals who score high on depression. We used the informants of 66 suicides as subjects for study and the informants of 66 living people as the control group. For each suicide and living person, we interviewed two informants: one family member and one friend. Data collection was accomplished in China in the summer of 2003. Results indicate that the bereaved people (informants of the suicides) are more likely to experience depression than those people in the control group. The closer the relationship to the suicide, the higher the degree of depression. While the survivor's education and income are negatively correlated with his or her depression level, neither age nor gender is a predictor of depression in the sample. Given the strong relationship between suicide and depression, the bereaved survivors of suicide could be a high risk group of suicide. Further and larger study is warranted to investigate more details of the high risk group so as to recommend prevention measures.","1101":"It will be shown, through the presentation of recent research findings, that haematology is a neglected area in terms of sensitive care of the dying. The Australian evidence indicates that scant progress has been made in relation to even the most basic palliative care practices such as sensitive, honest information giving or appropriate referral to the palliative system. Rather, the data show that during terminal trajectory, patients from these diagnostic groups and their families remain trapped in processes within the high-tech, curative system that are not responsive to the needs of the dying.","1102":"Psychological factors may influence an individual's acceptance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS). The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate predictors of attitudes towards PAS. Data were collected from 136 college students at a private Midwestern university. In addition to demographic and family history information, respondents completed measures of attitudes toward seeking mental health services, depression, hopelessness, and PAS attitudes. Respondent age, race, and hopelessness scores emerged as the only significant predictors (R2=.20) in a multiple regression model used to identify potential predictors of PAS attitudes. Younger, non-minority respondents, and those enduring more hopelessness reported more accepting attitudes towards PAS. Data from a three month follow-up assessment supported the stability of this pattern. The findings highlight the important role that mental health professionals should play in PAS decision making. Implications for the evaluation of medically ill considering PAS and their caregivers are discussed.","1103":"A scale to measure attitudes toward physician assisted suicide was administered to a sample (N=246) of Polish citizens and a sample (N=246) of U.S. citizens equated on gender, marital status, religion, and socioeconomic level. In both samples the reliability was substantial (Cronbach's alphas of .93 and .89), and the factor structure identical (one major factor). Significant ethnic differences were found for 10 of the 12 scale items, but no differences related to demographic variables. The obtained differences appear to parallel a conservative-liberal dimension, though this will need to be assessed in future studies.","1104":"Attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide (PAS) were assessed in a sample of 400 community adults, stratified as to gender and socioeconomic class, using a 12-item psychometric scale rather than the more typical survey question. The results indicate that the Domino scale, currently the only psychometric instrument of attitudes toward PAS, is factorially homogeneous and shows considerable internal stability. There were no gender differences, but significant socioeconomic class differences were obtained with better educated, upper class individuals more favorable in attitude than semi-skilled and unskilled poorly educated lower social class individuals. The majority of respondents support physician assisted suicide, but such support is inversely related to age.","1105":"","1106":"Nursing home patients have a constitutional right to refuse treatment. The Patient Self-Determination Act confirmed that right. State laws address the obligations of health care providers and facilities to honor that right. The New York State law is more specific than those of many other states. It allows exemptions for \"reasons of conscience\" and imposes a number of requirements on nursing homes claiming such an exemption, including the transfer of a patient to a home that will honor an end-of-life wish. This study, conducted by FRIA, investigated the refusal of some nursing homes in New York City to carry out patients' end-of-life wishes because of conscience-based objections. The study also investigated the willingness of homes which did not have such policies to accept patients transferring from a home with a policy so that the patient's end-of-life wishes would be honored. Implications for administrators, policy makers, and regulators are discussed.","1107":"","1108":"","1109":"Our personal reflections on the Michigan versus Kevorkian trial highlight the following issues: 1) the switch from physician-assisted suicide to euthanasia, 2) the television showing of the death, 3) the dropping of the prosecution of the charge of physician-assisted suicide, 4) Kevorkian serving as his own defense attorney, trying to argue that ALS was a secondary cause of Thomas Youk's death, 5) Kevorkian's attempt to employ a logical syllogism to demonstrate that euthanasia need not be murder, 6) Kevorkian's initial reference to the civil rights tradition but sudden change to the medical analogy of Nazi medicine: a final solution, 7) the insistence of Kevorkian on \"all or nothing\" sentencing, 8) the irony of Kevorkian being finally convicted by a prosecutor who was elected on a platform of not prosecuting Kevorkian, 9) Kevorkian hiring a lawyer after the verdict is in, and 10) Kevorkian's threat to starve himself to death if sent to prison.","1110":"In this short article, the authors describe their attempt to do suicide-prevention with a patient that ultimately died as the result of a physician-assisted suicide. Autopsy revealed no sign of physical disease but the patient's letters indicate a preoccupation with independence as the definition of life, and conviction that people who lose independence are no longer alive.","1111":"Euphemisms are place-holders for important concepts. They may disguise a practice which one might abhor if it were given another name. In Nazi Germany during World War II, euphemisms were used to desensitize physicians and society to the horrors of a program of euthanasia. This article examines some of the euphemisms used by the Nazi physicians to redefine medicalized killing, compares the Nazi language games with those of contemporary proponents of medicalized killing, and concludes that the consistent application of euphemisms for medicalized killing significantly weakens arguments against assisted killing.","1112":"","1113":"A qualitative case study was conducted to explore the clinical decision making processes that underpinned the practice of euthanasia under the Rights of the Terminally Ill (ROTI) Act. The key informant for this research was Philip Nitschke, the general practitioner responsible for the legal cases of euthanasia. His information was supported by extensive document analysis based on the public texts created by patients in the form of letters and documentaries. Further collaborating sources were those texts generated by the media, rights groups, politicians, the coroner's cort, and the literature on euthanasia and assisted suicide. A key study finding was that the ROTI legislation did not adequately provide for the specific medical situation in the Northern Territory, Australia. The medical roles, as proscribed by the legislation, carried many inherent assumptions about the health care context and the availability of appropriately qualified medical staff committed to providing euthanasia. These assumptions translated into difficulties in establishing clinical practices for the provision of euthanasia. A further finding concerned the motivations of those who requested euthanasia. This article addresses the medical roles and the motivations of those seeking euthanasia.","1114":"This report presents an update of the Kevorkian-Reding physician-assisted (or physician-aided) deaths to include the ninety-three publicly acknowledged cases as of November 25, 1998. These deaths are divided into ten distinct time phases. The following trends emerge. Over two-thirds of the decedents are women, the ratio of females to males varying widely with phase. The proportion of women seems to be the highest when Kevorkian is free to act as he wants and lowest when he seems to be acting under legal or political restraints. Based on autopsy results, only 29.0 percent of the cases are terminal, this percentage being higher among men (37.9%) than among women (25.4%). However, 66.7% of the decedents were disabled, no significant difference emerging between men and women. Further, five out of the six decedents showing no apparent anatomical sign of disease at autopsy were women. Over 80 percent of the physician-assisted deaths are cremated, approximately twice as high a proportion as that emerging for suicides in Michigan and four times as high as cremations occurring with regard to overall deaths. Finally, death by carbon monoxide decreases dramatically with time phase while the use of the contraption dubbed the \"suicide machine\" increases, suggesting an increasing routinization over time. Finally, during the ninth and tenth phases, Kevorkian's aims and his own suicidality emerge more clearly involving 1) harvesting organs and 2) threat of starving himself in prison if he is convicted. Phase 10 can be seen as an escalation from assisted death to overt euthanasia, repeating the same need for a demonstration (Thomas Youk) that was first exhibited in Phase I (Janet Adkins).","1115":"This study examines the seventy-five suicide cases Dr. Jack Kevorkian acknowledged assisting during the period between 1990-1997. Although these cases represent a range of regional and occupational backgrounds, a significant majority are women. Most of these individuals had a disabling, chronic, nonterminal-stage illness. In five female cases, the medical examiner found no evidence of disease whatsoever. About half of the women were between the ages of forty-one and sixty, and another third were older adults. Men's conditions were somewhat less likely than women's to be chronic and nonterminal-stage. The main reasons for the hastened death mentioned by both the person and their significant others were having disabilities, being in pain, and fear of being a burden. The predominance of women among Kevorkian's assisted suicides contrasts with national trends in suicide mortality, where men are a clear majority. It is possible that individuals whose death was hastened by Kevorkian are not representative of physician-assisted suicide cases around the country, because of Kevorkian's unique approach. Alternatively, the preponderance of women among Kevorkian's assisted suicides may represent a real phenomenon. One possibility is that, in the United States, assisted suicide is particularly acceptable for women. Individual, interpersonal, social, economic, and cultural factors encouraging assisted suicide in women are examined.","1116":"This article examines biomedical and psychosocial data on the first forty-seven cases of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) of Kevorkian as collected by means of both a physical autopsy and a preliminary psychological autopsy. The following patterns emerge: 1) The physical condition of these PAS patients was not typical of the conditions that lead to death in the United States. 2) Consistent with the above findings, our pilot data indicate that only 31.1 percent of these patients were terminal. While 73.9 percent were described as reporting pain, only 42.6 percent were revealed at autopsy to have a specific anatomical basis for their pain. However 36 percent were described as depressed, 66 percent as having some disability, and perhaps of key importance, 90 percent expressed a fear of dependency. Most important, our pilot data suggest the possibility of large gender differences, since 3) 68.1 percent of these forty-seven PAS's are women and only 31.9 percent are men. This represents the reverse of the gender pattern for completed suicides in the United States in 1995, resembling instead the approximate pattern for unsuccessful suicide attempts. 4) Approximately 75 percent of both men and women in the above sample were described as reporting pain. Men were almost twice as likely to have had an anatomical basis for the pain and three times as likely to be terminal. Our pilot data indicate PAS women are more likely to be described as depressed and twice as likely to have had a history of previous unsuccessful suicide attempts. 5) Kevorkian's patients were older than the typical unaided suicides in America. Reported pain decreases with age as does depression; however anatomical basis for pain increases slightly with age, and no age effect emerges for terminality. 6) Approximately two-thirds of those physician-assisted suicides were at middle SES levels. History of disability was the biggest risk factor for the low SES patients and fear of dependency for the high SES patients.","1117":"A number of assumptions underlying the debate over physician-assisted suicide (PAS) deserve closer scrutiny. It is often implicitly assumed that decisions as to the competency of the patient to request PAS can be accurately made, and that the treating physician's values and intrapsychic conflicts can be successfully separated from the decision to accede to or reject the patient's request. This article argues that in such an emotionally-laden decision, such factors may play a significant role, and that even were PAS to gain widespread acceptance, ignoring them may lead to errors in classifying patients either as appropriate or inappropriate for PAS.","1118":"Pharmacists are in a critical position when pharmaceutical agents are prescribed for the purpose of physician-assisted suicide and\/or euthanasia and they may need to decide whether dispensing a lethal dose of a medication is ethically and morally acceptable for a patient. In many cases, pharmacists may not even be aware that prescriptions are intended for physician-assisted suicide and\/or euthanasia. Pharmacists have a special responsibility to protect patients who are contemplating end-of-life decisions such as physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. Pharmaceutical care (\"Responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient's quality of life ...\") requires that the pharmacist not only understands the medications but also the individual patient and the complexities of their lives and suffering. Only in this way can pharmacists provide safe and effective use of medications for the patients they serve.","1119":"Michigan public opinion on Doctor Assisted Suicide (DAS) was assessed in January 1997 (N=603). Asked if they would consider DAS for themselves, two-thirds would if being kept alive by machine or were experiencing chronic pain; one-half would if they experienced a loss in mobility or independence, became a burden to others, or were diagnosed with a terminal disease; and one-third would if they were incontinent or going to a nursing home. A series of demographic and attitudinal comparisons were made for support for the concept of DAS and as a hypothetical consideration for oneself. The highest support for the concept of DAS was found among the following: men eighteen to twenty-four years old, some college education, $35-60,000\/year income, Caucasian, Democrat, liberal, Protestant, and frequent church attendee. The highest self-consideration of DAS was found among the following: men, fifty to fifty-five years old, post-graduate education, $35-60,000\/year income, Caucasian, Democrat, liberal, Protestant, and infrequent church attendee.","1120":"Ninety-six students were presented with eighteen different vignettes describing different types of active and passive observed suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. Attitudes regarding the morality and desired legality of each situation were measured. Results indicated that the interaction between the doctor and the patient, and, to a lesser extent, the active or passive nature of the agent of death, were more important than the actual actions of the doctor in allowing or causing death to occur.","1121":"The present study concentrates on the attitudes of high school students toward active doctor-assisted suicide as described in hypothetical doctor-patient scenarios, orthogonally manipulating doctor's reaction to patient's wishes to end his\/her life (whether discussed, accepted or encouraged), presence of patient's physical pain, presence of patient's emotional pain, and the gender of the hypothetical patient. Doctor-assisted suicides thoroughly discussed with the patient are judged to be more moral, acceptable, and \"legal\" than assisted suicides that are simply accepted by the doctor or actively encouraged by him. Significantly, this is not a distinction that is relevant in the eyes of the law. Further, the presence of both physical and emotional pain on the part of the patient make the patient death more acceptable in the eyes of high school students. This latter effect is striking, given the result of the Wooddell and Kaplan (1999-2000) study showing that patient depression tends to weaken acceptability of death. Finally, respondents, both male and female, tend to view deaths of patients of the opposite gender as more acceptable than patients of the same gender.","1122":"Jack Kevorkian criticizes the Hippocratic tradition in Greek medicine, which bans the physician from giving his patient a lethal medication. He sees this prohibition as potentially bringing harm to a suffering patient and not reflective of the larger Greek society which was tolerant and even approving of suicide. However, Kevorkian's advocacy of doctor-assisted suicide can be seen as the polarity of doctor abandonment of the suffering patient rather than as an antidote to it. Both positions involve an outcome of physician removal from the suffering patient, which can be contrasted with Maimonides' command to the physician to watch over the life and death of his patients.","1123":"Throughout recorded history, a series of seemingly unrelated ideas have been consistently intertwined: suicide, euthanasia, infanticide, eugenics, genocide and, most recently, the practice termed physician-assisted suicide. From Plato and Hippocrates to a pair of twentieth-century American physicians named Haiselden and Kevorkian, an examination of history shows these disparate notions always involve two troublesome questions: Which lives are not worth living? And who will decide? The same examination of history teaches that separating the worthy from the not worthy is a very dangerous proposition, especially for those whose lives are deemed marginal.","1124":"","1125":"The Physicians' End-of-Life Care Attitude Scale (PEAS) was developed as an outcome measure for palliative care education. PEAS assesses the willingness of medical trainees to care for dying patients. Sixty-four Likert-type questions were created on the basis of discussions with focus groups of medical trainees, then administered to sixty-two medical students and residents. Total PEAS scores as well as personal preparation and professional role subscales (where higher scores indicated greater concern) possessed excellent internal consistency and reliability. In addition, there were substantial correlations between PEAS scores and the CA-Dying scale, a measurement of laypersons' fears about interacting with dying persons. Thus, PEAS adequately assesses the unique communication concerns of physicians in training regarding working with dying persons and their families. Correlations between PEAS scores and age were negative, while those who had experienced the death of a loved one had higher PEAS scores than those who did not. This suggests that for some persons, life experiences may lessen difficulties in dealing with dying persons, while for others, personal losses may exacerbate such concerns. The utility of PEAS in evaluating the efficacy of palliative care education as well as its potential to measure medical trainee's willingness to care for the terminally ill is discussed.","1126":"Family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often experience significant stress-related problems in mental and physical health. Patients with AD often survive for protracted periods of time, placing an extensive burden of care on the caregiver prior to the patient's death. The present study addresses ethnic differences in the experience of AD caregivers around the time of their loved one's death, including life-sustaining treatment decisions and reactions to death. The results showed that, in our sample, more patients died in their homes than has been reported for deaths in the United States. African-American and White caregivers differed substantially in their reports of end of life care and subjective reactions to the death. Compared with White caregivers, African-American caregivers were less likely to make a decision to withhold treatment at the time of death, less likely to have their relative die in a nursing home, and reported less acceptance of the relative's death and greater perceived loss. Results suggest that death after AD caregiving deserves further study, and that ethnic differences in end of life care and bereavement may be of particular importance.","1127":"The current study had two primary goals, to determine whether: 1) self-rated mental and physical health, pain, and experience with health problems were predictors of elderly adults' attitudes toward death; and 2) death attitudes predict end-of-life medical treatment concerns. Participants were 109 adults, 65 years of age or older (M=78.74 years), recruited from the local community. Regression analysis indicated that poorer perceived physical health predicted a greater likelihood of viewing death as an escape, and poorer perceived mental health predicted a greater fear of death. Viewing death as an escape and fearing death predicted end-of-life medical treatment concerns; a greater endorsement of either attitude predicted more concern. Possible explanations for the links between perceived health, attitudes toward death, and concern about end-of-life issues are suggested.","1128":"We examined families' end-of-life decision making and their interactions with health professionals. Twenty-eight family members of institutionalized dementia patients participated in four focus groups. We found that participating family members were not well prepared for their decision-making roles, and that they: 1) experienced substantial burdens and loss in caring for institutionalized elders; 2) had limited understanding of the natural progression of dementing conditions; 3) were uncomfortable in setting goals for their relatives' end-of-life care; 4) had little experience with death, and were ambivalent about the anticipated death of their relative; and (5) reported that they had little substantive communication with health professionals regarding end-of-life care planning. We concluded that many of the needs of such families could be addressed through improved application of the principles of advance care planning, including regular structured discussions, involvement of surrogate decision-makers, and anticipation of clinical decisions. Health professionals should take the lead in 'normalizing' the discussion of death.","1129":"Public support for assisted suicide has been growing despite the ethical questions raised by members of the medical profession. Previous research suggests that age, gender, experience, and religiosity are factors affecting individuals' attitudes. This study examines the effect of demographic and ideological factors, as well as individuals' caregiving experiences, on attitudes toward assisted suicide. Random-digit-dialing procedures produced a sample of 156 residents of Denton, Texas, in March 1998. T-tests were conducted to measure significance, while gamma values were used to measure level of association and percent reduction in error. The data indicate that age, gender, and caregiving experience were not significant predictors of attitudes. Situational factors, including whether a physician or friend\/family member should assist and whether a child or a terminally ill patient experiencing no pain should receive assistance, all were highly significant and positively associated with attitudes toward assisted suicide. Respondents were most likely to support physician-assisted suicide for individuals experiencing no pain. The data also indicated that the depth of commitment to the beliefs that suffering has meaning, that life belongs to God, and that physician-assisted suicide is murder, were highly significant and negatively associated with attitudes toward assisted suicide.","1130":"Mercy killing is usually defined as intentional killing, often by family members or friends, with the stated intent to end perceived suffering. International evidence suggests that mercy killing typically involves an older man killing his ailing wife. In this study, we examined U.S. cases of mercy killing recorded by The Hemlock Society for the period 1960-1993. We found that the typical case involved an older woman being killed by a man, often her husband, with her poor health as the justification for the killing. A firearm was often used in these incidents. These patterns of mercy killing are consistent with patterns of homicide-suicide among older adults. Future research should seek to understand why women are typically the targets, and men the agents of mercy killing.","1131":"The study examines descriptions by twenty-six elderly Israelis of a good death. The transcripts of personal interviews were analyzed using phenomenological methods to determine general and essential essences of the good death phenomenon. The good death was perceived as a multidimensional phenomenon based on eighteen general essences that were condensed into five essential essences that included the physiological, personal, interpersonal, social and cultural domains of life. The good death description further involved a critical component toward the ways in which death and dying are currently occurring in Israel. The research results call for Israeli policy-makers to more forcefully acknowledge and accommodate the different secular perspectives of the good death into law and to allow individuals more freedom and control over the dying processes and rituals following one's death.","1132":"It is widely recognized that the code of the physician has undergone dramatic changes in the last century--changes which have serious implications for the patient-physician relationship. This is an ethnographic study examining how certain changes in the role and abilities of biomedical physicians have affected patient attitudes and expectations about end-of-life care. In-home interviews were conducted with eighteen persons age fifty-five and older, including a sample of Hemlock Society members. Results indicate a broad spectrum of end-of-life concerns including capacity, autonomy, pain, and burden to loved ones. Most participants reported a reluctance to begin a discussion of death or future deteriorating capacity with their physicians. Instead, when conversations about death were reported, they had been largely limited to the scenarios of catastrophic illness (e.g., hospitalization, ventilator, etc.) and the Living Will. While this discussion does not overlook the utility of the Living Will, it proposes the reliance on this document for preparing patients for end-of-life care is inadequate.","1133":"This article reviews ten of the most common mental health-related arguments against assisted death and applies them to the withholding\/withdrawal of treatment to determine if the concerns expressed are truly unique to assisted death. After this analysis it is suggested that the mandatory involvement of a mental health professional can alleviate many of the concerns specifically associated with assisted death and that a mental health professional may also be helpful in situations involving the withholding\/withdrawal of treatment.","1134":"This study examined whether stereotypes of aging might contribute to decisions the elderly make about when to die. Old and young participants (N=64) were subliminally primed with either negative or positive stereotypes of old age and then responded to hypothetical medical situations involving potentially fatal illnesses. Consistent with our prediction, the aged participants primed with negative stereotypes tended to refuse life-prolonging interventions, whereas the old participants primed with positive age stereotypes tended to accept the interventions. This priming effect did not emerge among the young participants for whom the stereotypes were less relevant. The results suggest that societally-transmitted negative stereotypes of aging can weaken elderly people's will to live.","1135":"Despite the effort to provide an alternate way to dying, there seems to be little effort to examine the real situation of hospice care. For example, the patients' desired outcomes are seldom addressed. It is recently that studies began to investigate the features of \"good death.\" However, work in eastern cultures, such as Chinese, remains scarce. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of what it means to die a \"good death\" from the perspective of Chinese patients. Thirty-three Chinese hospice patients with terminal cancer were interviewed. Grounded in the analysis of qualitative data, seven elements that contribute to dying a good death emerged. Awareness of dying was identified as the foremost essential element of a good death. From the findings of this study, most respondents considered receiving a diagnosis of cancer as one of the significant points of psychological distress in the course of their illness. Half of the patients openly talked about their cancers and more than half of them discussed various issues related to death. That means, about one-third of the respondents talked about death and cancer with openness. These preliminary findings may reflect the progress of hospice work in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, 13 respondents did not mention the word \"death\" and 16 of them did not mention that they had cancer. They talked about their illness and future using the expressions that they preferred. It is important that health care professionals also respect people who show awareness of dying as much as those who do not present clear evidence of this awareness. Both groups of people can have a positive experience when they die.","1136":"A national membership survey of Hemlock Society USA was conducted by Fox and Kamakahi (1995). Respondents (N=6398) were asked a variety of questions, but in this paper we perform a longitudinal analysis of the characteristics of Hemlock Society USA members. Hemlock Society USA members are divided into three 5-year cohorts: Early Joiners (11 or more years of membership), Middle Joiners (6 to 10 years membership), and Late Joiners (5 or fewer years of membership). Differences between cohorts are examined and extrapolations made regarding Hemlock Society USA and the Right-to-Die Movement. A series of one-way ANOVAs were used with Scheme post-hoc comparisons as heuristic tools for assessing between-cohort differences. Late Joiners are different from earlier members, but are more like other Hemlock Society USA members than the adult U.S. population at large. Hemlock Society USA members are essentially societal \"elites\" (based on socio-demographic variables) who work in social environments that are decidedly split on the issue of voluntary suicide and euthanasia.","1137":"","1138":"","1139":"","1140":"","1141":"","1142":"","1143":"","1144":"","1145":"","1146":"","1147":"","1148":"","1149":"","1150":"","1151":"","1152":"Over the last two decades social concerns with the \"right to die\" have grown beyond the ability of our governmental and judicial institutions to consistently deal with them. One reason for this difficulty has been the unavailability of any legal or judicial standard that is consistent with American conceptions of liberty, morality, and justice. This article attempts to examine the theory of natural law to determine whether it may provide a consistent standard for resolving these difficult questions. As natural law theories are traced through history, they lead directly to the United States where a uniquely American interpretation became one of the foundational principles for our constitution. By applying these theories to the contemporary question of the \"right to die,\" natural law can again provide the foundational principles needed to develop standards for dealing with such questions that are consistent with our historical, philosophical, and political traditions.","1153":"","1154":"","1155":"","1156":"","1157":"","1158":"","1159":"","1160":"","1161":"","1162":"","1163":"","1164":"","1165":"","1166":"","1167":"This article examines the responses of bone marrow donors to the death of the unrelated person to whom they donated. Data analyzed were 330 questionnaires and fifty in-depth interviews collected from donors in the National Marrow Donor Program at one year post-donation. Death of the recipient produced feelings of guilt and responsibility in the donors in only a few cases (2% of donors from questionnaire data and 2 of the 23 donors interviewed). Grief occurred often (22 of 23 donors interviewed) and was often surprisingly intense, given the fact that the recipient was a stranger. Intensity of grief varied depending on the perceived relationship with the recipient. Our data indicate that limiting contact and\/or information about the recipient to the donor would be unlikely to result in more positive psychosocial outcomes. However, several strategies which might be useful in relieving donor guilt and\/or grief are suggested.","1168":"","1169":"","1170":"","1171":"","1172":"","1173":"","1174":"","1175":"","1176":"","1177":"","1178":"","1179":"","1180":"","1181":"","1182":"","1183":"","1184":"","1185":"","1186":"","1187":"","1188":"","1189":"","1190":"","1191":"","1192":"","1193":"","1194":"","1195":"","1196":"","1197":"","1198":"","1199":"","1200":"","1201":"","1202":"","1203":"","1204":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Transnational Caregiving and Grief: An Autobiographical Case Study of Loss and Love During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","1":"A Systematic Review of Death Anxiety and Related Factors Among Nurses.","2":"Mortality Salience Effects of Critical Incidents - A Systematic Literature Review and Research Agenda.","3":"Determination of the Relationship Between Self-Care Agency and Death Anxiety Among Elderly Individuals.","4":"Death From COVID-19, Muslim Death Rituals and Disenfranchised Grief - A Patient-Centered Care Perspective.","5":"Deathbed Visions: Visitors and Vistas.","6":"Loneliness, Social Support Level, Quality of Life and Symptom Management Among Turkish Oncology Patients.","7":"Does 'Time Heal all Wounds?'
