The BDS method is sensitive to the actual electronic structure of species, and it is most relevant to redox reactions involving charge-transfer. In this paper, using BDS, we have studied and characterized the oxidation of a copper layer in a purposely built prototypical 3-D integrated circuit (3D-IC) during cycled high-temperature storage. We show that the microwave signal loss in these devices is attributable to the energy dissipation through the signal's interactions with the copper oxidation product. The results demonstrate that contactless BDS could be leveraged into an excellent metrology for applications that use metal oxide as sensing elements.","1":null,"2":"Nitric oxide (NO) levels in exhaled breath are a non-invasive marker that can be used to diagnose various respiratory diseases and monitor a patient's response to given therapies. A portable and inexpensive device that can enable selective NO concentration measurements in exhaled breath samples is needed. Herein, the performance of an amperometric Pt-Nafion-based gas phase sensor for detection of NO in exhaled human nasal breath is examined. Enhanced selectivity over carbon monoxide and ammonia is achieved via an in-line zinc oxide-based filter. Exhaled nasal NO levels measured in 21 human samples with the sensor are shown to correlate well with those obtained using a chemiluminescence reference method (R2 = 0.9836).","3":null,"4":"Capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrochemical detection can be a powerful analysis tool; however, previous methods developed to integrate these two techniques can often times be fragile and have alignment issues such that there are no commercially available approaches. In this paper, we present the use of a 3D-printed Wall-Jet Electrode device for integrating capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection. A pressure mobilization step was also utilized to further reduce noise by allowing the electrophoresis separation step to continue only until the first analyte was close to elution. Then, the separation voltage was terminated and pressure-based flow was used for elution of the analyte bands onto the electrode surface with a wall-jet configuration. It is shown that the pressure-based elution is beneficial for the reduction of baseline noise and elimination of field effects. A mixture of catecholamines were separated to demonstrate effectiveness of the system. In addition, the system was coupled with a Beckman Coulter commercial capillary electrophoresis instrument in a straightforward manner. The system was also shown to be effective in separations done with a high ionic strength physiological buffer. This 3D printing approach can be used by researchers to utilize electrochemical detection on commercial capillary electrophoresis systems by downloading the provided STL and\/or CAD files.","5":"Microfluidic platforms can lead to miniaturisation, increased throughput and reduced reagent consumption, particularly when the processes are automated. Here, a programmable microcontroller is used for automation of a microfluidic platform configured to electrochemically determine the levels of 8 proteins simultaneously in complex liquid samples. The platform system is composed of a programmable Arduino microcontroller that controls inexpensive valve actuators, pump, magnetic stirrer and electronic display. The programmable microcontroller results in repeatable timing for each step in a complex assay protocol, such as sandwich immunoassays. Application of the platform is demonstrated using a multiplexed electrochemical immunoassay based on capture at the electrode surface of magnetic particles labelled with horseradish peroxidase and detection antibody. The multiplexed assay protocol is completed in less than 30 mins and results in detection of eight proteins associated with prostate cancer. The approach presented can be used to automate and simplify high-throughput screening campaigns, such as detection of multiple biomarkers in patient samples.","6":null,"7":null,"8":"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by degeneration of the striatum. Here, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes was used to uncover regional differences in dopamine (DA) release in the caudate putamen of R6\/2 and wild-type control mice. We found a decreasing ventral-to-dorsal gradient in DA release, evoked by a single electrical stimulus pulse, in aged R6\/2 mice. Moreover, under more intense stimulation conditions (120 pulses), DA release was significantly attenuated in the dorsal, but not in the ventral caudate. Autoradiography measurements using [3H]WIN 35,428 revealed that the overall density of DA transporter (DAT) protein molecules was significantly less in R6\/2 mice compared to WT control mice; however, quadrants of the caudate putamen were not differentially altered in the R6\/2 mice. These data collectively suggest that DA release in the dorsal caudate region is more vulnerable with age progression compared to the ventral region.","9":null,"10":"An array of four independently wired indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes was used for electrochemically stimulated DNA release and activation of DNA-based Identity, AND and XOR logic gates. Single-stranded DNA molecules were loaded on the mixed poly(N,N-di-methylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)\/poly-(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) brush covalently attached to the ITO electrodes. The DNA deposition was performed at pH 5.0 when the polymer brush is positively charged due to protonation of tertiary amino groups in PDMAE-MA, thus resulting in electrostatic attraction of the negatively charged DNA. By applying electrolysis at -1.0 V(vs. Ag\/AgCl reference) electrochemical oxygen reduction resulted in the consumption of hydrogen ions and local pH increase near the electrode surface. The process resulted in recharging the polymer brush to the negative state due to dissociation of carboxylic groups of PMAA, thus repulsing the negatively charged DNA and releasing it from the electrode surface. The DNA release was performed in various combinations from different electrodes in the array assembly. The released DNA operated as input signals for activation of the Boolean logic gates. The developed system represents a step forward in DNA computing, combining for the first time DNA chemical processes with electronic input signals.","11":"Electrochemical hybridization sensors have been explored extensively for analysis of specific nucleic acids. However, commercialization of the platform is hindered by the need for attachment of separate oligonucleotide probes complementary to a RNA or DNA target to an electrode's surface. Here we demonstrate that a single probe can be used to analyze several nucleic acid targets with high selectivity and low cost. The universal electrochemical four-way junction (4J)-forming (UE4J) sensor consists of a universal DNA stem-loop (USL) probe attached to the electrode's surface and two adaptor strands (m and f) which hybridize to the USL probe and the analyte to form a 4J associate. The m adaptor strand was conjugated with a methylene blue redox marker for signal ON sensing and monitored using square wave voltammetry. We demonstrated that a single sensor can be used for detection of several different DNA\/RNA sequences and can be regenerated in 30 seconds by a simple water rinse. The UE4J sensor enables a high selectivity by recognition of a single base substitution, even at room temperature. The UE4J sensor opens a venue for a re-useable universal platform that can be adopted at low cost for the analysis of DNA or RNA targets.","12":"Acetaminophen (APAP) is an antipyretic, analgesic agent, the overdose of which during medical treatment poses a risk for liver failure. Hence, it is important to develop methods to monitor physiological APAP levels to avoid APAP. Here, we report an efficient, selective electrochemical APAP sensor made from depositing silicon nanowires (SiNWs) onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). Electrocatalytic activity of the SiNW\/GCE sensors was monitored under varying pH and concentrations of APAP using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). CV of the SiNWs at 0.5 to 13 mmol dm-3 APAP concentrations was used to determine the oxidation and reduction potential of APAP. The selective detection of APAP was then demonstrated using CA at +0.568 V vs Ag\/AgCl, where APAP is fully oxidized, in the 0.01 to 3 mmol dm-3 concentration range with potentially-interfering species. The SiNW sensor has the ability to detect APAP well within the detection limits for APAP toxicity, showing promise as a practical biosensor.","13":"In this work, we report on the determination of trace manganese (Mn) using cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) using a microfabricated sensor with a Pt thin-film working electrode. While an essential trace metal for human health, prolonged exposure to Mn tends to gradually impair our neurological system. The potential sources of Mn exposure make it necessary to monitor the concentration in various sample matrices. Previous work by us and others suggested CSV as an effective method for measuring trace Mn. The analytical performance metrics were characterized and optimized, leading to a calculated limit of detection (LOD) of 16.3 nM (0.9 ppb) in pH 5.5, 0.2 M acetate buffer. Further, we successfully validated Mn determination in surface water with ~90% accuracy and &gt;97% precision as compared with ICP-MS \"gold standard\" measurement. Ultimately, with stable, accurate and precise electrochemical performance, this Pt sensor permits rapid monitoring of Mn in environmental samples, and could potentially be used for point-of-use measurements if coupled with portable instrumentation.","14":"Measuring panels of protein biomarkers offer a new personalized approach to early cancer detection, disease monitoring and patients' response to therapy. Multiplex electrochemical methods are uniquely positioned to provide faster, more sensitive, point of care (POC) devices to detect protein biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. Nanomaterials-based electrochemical methods offer sensitivity needed for early cancer detection. This review discusses recent advances in multiplex electrochemical immunosensors for cancer diagnostics and disease monitoring. Different electrochemical strategies including enzyme-based immunoarrays, nanoparticle-based immunoarrays and electrochemiluminescence methods are discussed. Many of these methods have been integrated into microfluidic systems, but measurement of more than 2-4 protein markers in a small single serum sample is still a challenge. For POC applications, a simple, low cost method is required. Major challenges in multiplexed microfluidic immunoassays are reagent additions and washing steps that require creative engineering solutions. 3-D printed microfluidics and paper-based microfluidic devices are also explored.","15":"This article reviews recent progress from our laboratory in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) arrays designed for screening toxicity-related chemistry of chemical and drug candidates. Cytochrome P450s and metabolic bioconjugation enzymes convert lipophilic chemicals in our bodies by oxidation and bioconjugation that can lead to toxic metabolites. DNA can be used as an easily measurable toxicity-related endpoint, targeting DNA oxidation and addcut formation with metabolites. ECL using guanosines in the DNA strands as co-reactants have been used in high throughput arrays utilizing DNA-enzyme films fabricated layer-by-layer. This review describes approaches developed to provide new high throughput ECL arrays to aid in toxicity assessment for drug and chemical product development.","16":"We report single drop electroanalytical measurements of pharmaceutically and biologically relevant compounds using screen printed electrodes (SPEs) modified with carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH) as the sensor surface. Acetaminophen, nicotine, ascorbic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form (NADH) were detected in a single drop of solution. We show that combined polar and nonpolar interactions of analytes with -COOH functional groups and large surface area of MWCNT, respectively, allow highly sensitive analyte detection with wide dynamic range. Smaller analytes can bind to a significantly greater number of sensor sites than the bulkier analytes and offer better detection sensitivity. Results suggest that sensitivity is controlled by predominant nonpolar interactions that an analyte can undergo with the MWCNT-COOH SPE sensor surface, whereas limit of detection is controlled by the extent of polar interactions between an analyte and the sensor surface, facilitating interfacial charge transport and an electrochemical signal output. Furthermore, a combination of polar and nonpolar analyte interactions with the sensor surface shows a synergistic effect on sensitivity and detection limit. This could be a likely reason for why sensitivity does not need to always correlate with lower detection limits as variations in the interfacial interactions are critical. Application of the designed single drop method to real samples was validated by estimating the amounts of acetaminophen, nicotine, ascorbic acid, and NADH in commercially available pharmaceuticals with excellent recovery.","17":null,"18":"Carbon-fiber microelectrodes (CFEs) are the primary electroanalytical tool in single-cell exocytosis and in-vivo studies. Here we report a new study on the kinetic properties of electrolyte-filled CFEs in single-cell measurements and demonstrate that the addition of outer sphere redox species, such as Fe(CN)63- and Ru(NH3)63+, in the backfill electrolyte solution can greatly enhance the kinetic response of CFEs. We show that at 750 mV, a voltage normally applied for detection of dopamine, the presence of fast outer sphere redox species in the backfilling solution significantly enhances the kinetic response of CFEs toward fast dopamine detection at single PC12 cells. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the use of Fe(CN)63- in the backfilling solution has enabled direct measurement of dopamine at applied voltages as low as 200 mV. This kinetic enhancement is believed to be due to faster electron-transfer kinetics on the coupling pole as compared to the sluggish reduction of oxygen. We anticipate that such redox-filled CFE ultramicroelectrodes will find many useful applications in single cell exocytosis and in-vivo sensing.","19":null,"20":"Metal catalyst free carbon nanotube (MCFCNT) whiskers were first used as an electrode modification material on a gold electrode surface for zinc voltammetric measurements. A composite film of Nafion and MCFCNT whiskers was applied to a gold electrode surface to form a mechanically stable sensor. The sensor was then used for zinc detection in both acetate buffer solution and extracted bovine serum solution. A limit of detection of 53 nM was achieved for a 120 s deposition time. The zinc in bovine serum was extracted via a double extraction procedure using dithizone in chloroform as a zinc chelating ligand. The modified electrode was found to be both reliable and sensitive for zinc measurements in both matrices.","21":null,"22":"Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) and cathodic stripping voltammetry (CSV) were used to determine Mn concentration using metal catalyst free carbon nanotube (MCFCNT) electrodes and square wave stripping voltammetry (SWSV). The MCFCNTs are synthesized using a Carbo Thermal Carbide Conversion method which results in a material that does not contain residual transition metals. Detection limits of 120 nM and 93 nM were achieved for ASV and CSV, respectively, with a deposition time of 60 s. CSV was found to be better than ASV in Mn detection in many aspects, such as limit of detection and sensitivity. The CSV method was used in pond water matrix addition measurements.","23":null,"24":"Glutathione-decorated 5 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and oppositely charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) were assembled into {PAH\/AuNP} n films fabricated layer-by-layer (LbL) on pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes. These AuNP\/polyion films utilized the AuNPs as electron hopping relays to achieve direct electron transfer between underlying electrodes and redox proteins on the outer film surface across unprecedented distances &gt;100 nm for the first time. As film thickness increased, voltammetric peak currents for surface myoglobin (Mb) on these films decreased but the electron transfer rate was relatively constant, consistent with a AuNP-mediated electron hopping mechanism.","25":null,"26":"We report here on the electrochemical reduction of S-nitrosothiol species (RSNO). Nitric oxide (NO) is the reported common product from electrochemically reduced RSNOs at physiological pH. However, studies here at pH 7.4 show that during the reduction of RSNOs (-0.6 V to -0.9 V, vs. Ag\/AgCl), no significant amount of NO is detected. Gas analysis suggests RSNO are reduced to nitrous oxide (N2O) at pH 7.4 and can only be converted back to NO at more oxidizing voltages. Interestingly, at pH 4.0, a direct one-electron reduction of RSNOs appears to occur and generates significant amounts of NO from RSNO species.","27":"A robust selectivity enhancement of an In(III)-porphyrin ionophore-based chloride-selective electrode under pulsed chronopotentiometric measurement mode that enables the detection of chloride ions in the presence of a normally interfering concentration of salicylate ions is described. This enhancement is achieved by the rapid depletion of the surface concentration of the more dilute lipophilic anion during an initial anodic current pulse period due to extraction of this preferred anion into the membrane phase. Measurement of chloride with a detection limit of 8 mM and near Nernstian response slope in the presence of 1 mM salicylate is possible using the pulstrode method.","28":"Potentiometric membrane electrodes that respond to heparin and other polyanions were introduced in the early 1990s. Herein, the mechanism of polymer membrane electrode type heparin sensors is revisited. The extraction\/diffusion of heparin is studied via both potentiometric and impedance spectroscopic techniques using a pre-fractionated heparin preparation that contains polyanionic species &gt; 10000 Daltons. The reversal in EMF response using this heparin preparation indicates diffusion of higher MW heparin fragments to the backside of the membrane. Diffusion coefficients are calculated using a novel formula derived from the phase boundary potential model and Fick's second law of diffusion. Impedance spectroscopy is also employed to show that high MW heparin species are extracted and diffuse across the PVC membranes.","29":"This study is the first to focus on the potential use of carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffolds as enzyme immobilization substrates for analytical purposes. Besides all the well-known advantages of CNT, three-dimensional scaffolds can significantly increase the amount of enzymes adsorbed per unit area, preserve the catalytic activity of the adsorbed molecules, and allow effective exposure to substrates present in the adjacent medium. Additionally, our results indicate that the sensitivity of analytical probes based on enzyme-loaded CNT scaffolds is proportional to the thickness of the scaffold providing 3-fold sensitivity improvements with respect to the control surfaces.","30":null,"31":"Nowadays, detecting the presence of bioterrorism and biohazard agents in environmental and food samples is of great concern, due to their toxicity, and because many of them are prone to be used in terrorism attacks. The use of functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) in the development of electrochemical immuno- and genosensors has resulted in innovative and powerful detection strategies that may be applied to environmental, food and clinical analysis. This review describes current research on the combination of functionalized MBs with electrochemical detection for the development of magnetobiosensors applied to rapid, sensitive and specific detection of bioterrorism and biohazard agents.","32":"In this communication, we demonstrate that a carbon ink microelectrode array, where the electrodes are held at the same potential, affords significant signal enhancement in microchip electrophoresis with amperometric detection. The ability to fabricate an array of carbon ink microelectrodes with a palladium decoupler was demonstrated and the resulting electrodes were integrated with a valving microchip design. The use of an 8 electrode array led to a significant improvement in the limits of detection at the expense of separation resolution due to the increased detection zone size. It is also shown that microdialysis sampling can be integrated with the microchip device and a multi-analyte separation achieved.","33":"Quantification of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) in biomedical heparin preparations is achieved using a recently described potentiometric polyanion sensor-based approach operated in a kinetic mode of analysis. This is accomplished by adjusting the concentration of the test sample to a range where the OSCS level is low enough for the sensor not to achieve a full and rapid equilibrium phase boundary potential change at the membrane\/sample interface upon exposure to the heparin sample. Using this method, the OSCS wt% determined within heparin samples containing OSCS are shown to be in good agreement with those determined by an accepted NMR method.","34":"Recent years have seen the emergence of a new class of electrochemical sensors predicated on target binding-induced folding of electrode-bound redox-modified aptamers and directed against targets ranging from small molecules to proteins. Previous studies of the relationship between gain and probe-density for these electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensors suggest that signal transduction is linked to binding-induced changes in the efficiency with which the attached redox tag strikes the electrode. This, in turn, suggests that even well folded aptamers may support E-AB signaling if target binding sufficiently alters their flexibility. Here we investigate this using a thrombin-binding aptamer that undergoes binding-induced folding at low ionic strength but can be forced to adopt a folded conformation at higher ionic strength even in the absence of its protein target. We find that, under conditions in which the thrombin aptamer is fully folded prior to target binding, we still obtain a ca. 30% change in E-AB signal upon saturated target levels. In contrast, however, under conditions in which the aptamer is unfolded in the absence of target and thus undergoes binding-induced folding the observed signal change is twice as great. The ability of folded aptamers to support E-AB signaling, however, is not universal: a fully folded anti-IgE aptamer, for example, produces only an extremely small, ca. 2.5% signal change in the presence of target despite the larger steric bulk of this protein. Thus, while it appears that binding-induced changes in the dynamics in fully folded aptamers can support E-AB signaling, this signaling mechanism may not be general, and in order to ensure the design of high-gain sensors binding must be linked to a large-scale conformational change.","35":"Recent advances in ion-selective electrodes have pushed the detection limits of direct potentiometry to the nanomolar concentration range. Here we present a direct comparison of the sensitivity and selectivity of potentiometric and stripping-voltammetric measurements of cadmium and lead. While both techniques offer a similar sensitivity, the potentiometric method offers higher selectivity in the presence of excess of metal ions (e.g., thallium, tin) that commonly interfere in the stripping-voltammetric operation. Because of the complementary nature of the potentiometric and stripping-voltammetric methods, it is recommended that these techniques will be selected based on the specific analytical problem or used in parallel to provide additional analytical information.","36":"Voltammetric sensors made with films of polyions, double-stranded DNA and liver microsomes adsorbed layer-by-layer onto pyrolytic graphite electrodes were evaluated for reactive metabolite screening. This approach features simple, inexpensive screening without enzyme purification for applications in drug or environmental chemical development. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in the liver microsomes were activated by an NADPH regenerating system or by electrolysis to metabolize model carcinogenic compounds nitrosamine and styrene. Reactive metabolites formed in the films were trapped as adducts with nucleobases on DNA. The DNA damage was detected by square-wave voltammetry (SWV) using [Formula: see text] as a DNA-oxidation catalyst. These sensors showed a larger rate of increase in signal vs. reaction time for a highly toxic nitrosamine than for the moderately toxic styrene due to more rapid reactive metabolite-DNA adduct formation. Results were consistent with reported in vivo TD(50) data for the formation of liver tumors in rats. Analogous polyion\/ liver microsome films prepared on 500 nm silica nanoparticles (nanoreactors) and reacted with nitrosamine or styrene, provided LC-MS or GC analyses of metabolite formation rates that correlated well with sensor response.","37":"Amperometric immunosensor configurations featuring covalently bound anti-biotin antibodies (Ab) embedded into a polylysine (PLL)-single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composite layer were evaluated. Assemblies were made by first oxidizing pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes to form surface carboxylic acid groups, to which PLL, SWCNTs and anti-biotin were covalently linked. Incorporating SWCNT into PLL-antibody assemblies improved the amperometric detection limit for biotin (Ag) labeled with horseradish peroxidase to 10 fmol mL(-1). Anti-biotin embedded into the PLL matrix had improved thermal stability and retained its binding ability for biotin after exposure to temperatures of 42 degrees C for up to 3 hours, while the noncrosslinked antibody was inactivated at this temperature in several minutes.","38":null,"39":null,"40":"A highly sensitive electrochemical DNA hybridization assay using Prussian blue (PB)-modified polymeric spheres as the oligonculeotide labeling tag is described. The sandwich assay relies on a secondary nucleic-acid probe functionalized with polystyrene beads loaded with numerous Prussian blue nanoparticles. The very strong catalytic activity of the captured PB 'artificial peroxidase' tag towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, along with the encapsulation of numerous catalytic particles onto polymeric beads, allows amperometric detection of the DNA target down to the 50 fM level (2.5 amol). Imaging and spectroscopic measurements are used to characterize the PB-tagged polystyrene beads. Such coupling of PB catalytic labels with polymeric carrier beads offers great promise for amplified transduction of different biomolecular interactions.","41":"Impedance biosensors are a class of electrical biosensors that show promise for point-of-care and other applications due to low cost, ease of miniaturization, and label-free operation. Unlabeled DNA and protein targets can be detected by monitoring changes in surface impedance when a target molecule binds to an immobilized probe. The affinity capture step leads to challenges shared by all label-free affinity biosensors; these challenges are discussed along with others unique to impedance readout. Various possible mechanisms for impedance change upon target binding are discussed. We critically summarize accomplishments of past label-free impedance biosensors and identify areas for future research.","42":null,"43":"More than ten different approaches for improving the lower detection limit of polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes have been suggested during the recent years.
