IVD calcification is not a rare finding in ageing or in degenerative and scoliotic spinal conditions, but is often ignored and under-reported. IVD calcification may lead to stiffer IVDs and altered segmental biomechanics, more severe IVD degeneration, inflammation and low back pain. Calcification is not restricted to the IVD but is also observed in the degeneration of other cartilaginous tissues, such as joint cartilage, and is involved in the tissue inflammatory process. Furthermore, IVD calcification may also affect the vertebral endplate, leading to Modic changes (non-neoplastic subchondral vertebral bone marrow lesions) and the generation of pain. Such effects in the spine might develop in similar ways to the development of subchondral marrow lesions of the knee, which are associated with osteoarthritis-related pain. We propose that IVD calcification is a phenotypic biomarker of clinically relevant disc degeneration and endplate changes. As IVD calcification has implications for the management and prognosis of degenerative spinal changes and could affect targeted therapeutics and regenerative approaches for the spine, awareness of IVD calcification should be raised in the spine community.","1":"Ubiquitylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates intracellular signalling networks by triggering proteasomal substrate degradation, changing the activity of substrates or mediating changes in proteins that interact with substrates. Hundreds of enzymes participate in reversible ubiquitylation of proteins, some acting globally and others targeting specific proteins. Ubiquitylation is essential for innate immune responses, as it facilitates rapid regulation of inflammatory pathways, thereby ensuring sufficient but not excessive responses. A growing number of inborn errors of immunity are attributed to dysregulated ubiquitylation. These genetic disorders exhibit broad clinical manifestations, ranging from susceptibility to infection to autoinflammatory and\/or autoimmune features, lymphoproliferation and propensity to malignancy. Many autoinflammatory disorders result from disruption of components of the ubiquitylation machinery and lead to overactivation of innate immune cells. An understanding of the disorders of ubiquitylation in autoinflammatory diseases could enable the development of novel management strategies.","2":"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is part of a group of closely related clinical phenotypes ('psoriatic disease') that is defined by shared molecular pathogenesis resulting in excessive, prolonged inflammation in the various tissues affected, such as the skin, the entheses or the joints. Psoriatic disease comprises a set of specific drivers that promote an aberrant immune response and the consequent development of chronic disease that necessitates therapeutic intervention. These drivers include genetic, biomechanical, metabolic and microbial factors that facilitate a robust and continuous mobilization, trafficking and homing of immune cells into the target tissues. The role of genetic variants involved in the immune response, the contribution of mechanical factors triggering an exaggerated inflammatory response (mechanoinflammation), the impact of adipose tissue and altered lipid metabolism and the influence of intestinal dysbiosis in the disease process are discussed. Furthermore, the role of key cytokines, such as IL-23, IL-17 and TNF, in orchestrating the various phases of the inflammatory disease process and as therapeutic targets in PsA is reviewed. Finally, the nature and the mechanisms of inflammatory tissue responses inherent to PsA are summarized.","3":"","4":"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which acts via G protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs), is a bioactive lipid essential for vascular integrity and lymphocyte trafficking. The S1P-S1PR signalling axis is a key component of the inflammatory response in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Several drugs that target S1PRs have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease and are under clinical testing for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that targeting the S1P-S1PR axis would be beneficial to patients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) by reducing pathological inflammation. Whereas most preclinical research and development efforts are focused on reducing lymphocyte trafficking, protective effects of circulating S1P on endothelial S1PRs, which maintain the vascular barrier and enable blood circulation while dampening leukocyte extravasation, have been largely overlooked. In this Review, we take a holistic view of S1P-S1PR signalling in lymphocyte and vascular pathobiology. We focus on the potential of S1PR modulators for the treatment of SLE, RA and SSc and summarize the rationale, pathobiology and evidence from preclinical models and clinical studies. Improved understanding of S1P pathobiology in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and S1PR therapeutic modulation is anticipated to lead to efficacious and safer management of these diseases.","5":"","6":"","7":"Activation of endothelium and immune cells is fundamental to the initiation of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and it results in trans-endothelial cell migration and synovial fibroblast proliferation, leading to joint destruction. In RA, the synovial microvasculature is highly dysregulated, resulting in inefficient oxygen perfusion to the synovium, which, along with the high metabolic demands of activated immune and stromal cells, leads to a profoundly hypoxic microenvironment. In inflamed joints, infiltrating immune cells and synovial resident cells have great requirements for energy and nutrients, and they adapt their metabolic profiles to generate sufficient energy to support their highly activated inflammatory states. This shift in metabolic capacity of synovial cells enables them to produce the essential building blocks to support their proliferation, activation and invasiveness. Furthermore, it results in the accumulation of metabolic intermediates and alteration of redox-sensitive pathways, affecting signalling pathways that further potentiate the inflammatory response. Importantly, the inflamed synovium is a multicellular tissue, with cells differing in their metabolic requirements depending on complex cell-cell interactions, nutrient supply, metabolic intermediates and transcriptional regulation. Therefore, understanding the complex interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways in synovial cells in RA will provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.","8":"The observations that traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors fail to fully account for the excessive cardiovascular mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with the general population have prompted in-depth investigations of non-traditional, SLE-related risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular complications in patients with SLE. Of the various perturbations of vascular physiology, endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to occur in the earliest step of atherosclerosis, has been extensively investigated for its contribution to CVD risk in SLE. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which play a crucial part in vascular repair, neovascularization and maintenance of endothelial function, are quantitatively and functionally reduced in patients with SLE. Yet, the lack of a unified definition of EPCs, standardization of the quantity and functional assessment of EPCs as well as endothelial function measurement pose challenges to the translation of endothelial function measurements and EPC levels into prognostic markers for CVD in patients with SLE. This Review discusses factors that contribute to CVD in SLE, with particular focus on how endothelial function and EPCs are evaluated currently, and how EPCs are quantitatively and functionally altered in patients with SLE. Potential strategies for the use of endothelial function measurements and EPC quantification as prognostic markers of CVD in patients with SLE, and the limitations of their prognostication potential, are also discussed.","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"The published results of the post-marketing ORAL Surveillance study, which compared the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib with anti-TNF therapy in older patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have cardiovascular risk factors, have led to changes in the recommendations for the use of JAK inhibitors. Although new safety signals have emerged for tofacitinib, namely malignancy and cardiovascular disease, it should be noted that these signals are relative to those seen with TNF blockers. The new data further raise our intrigue that venous thromboembolism might be a true risk related to JAK inhibition. Reassuringly, the totality of the findings from this newly published study and the other data collected to date suggest that JAK inhibitors can be used safely at approved doses by many patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","17":"The rise in the number of people aged 65 years and older living with inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis is causing considerable challenges for clinicians. As patients get older, they are at an increased risk of multiple chronic diseases, a situation termed multimorbidity. Multimorbidity inevitably drives polypharmacy, where by a patient requires treatment with multiple medications. In addition, advancing age, multimorbidity and polypharmacy all place a patient at an increased risk of developing geriatric syndromes, which are clinical conditions in older people that do not fit into disease categories and include malnutrition, sarcopenia and frailty. Geriatric syndromes further increase the risk of adverse outcomes, including the accrual of additional morbidity, nursing home admission and mortality. Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases are especially prone to developing geriatric syndromes. Some predisposing risk factors for geriatric syndromes, such as joint swelling and functional limitations, are also inherent to rheumatic inflammatory disease itself. The frequent coexistence of multimorbidity, polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes in this patient group requires individually tailored interventions to preserve patient independence and overall functioning. To prepare for the changing demography, rheumatologists should gain more insight into the implications of multimorbidity, polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes for the management of older patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.","18":"Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) is associated with high mortality resulting from early internal-organ involvement. Clinicians therefore tend to focus on early diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening cardiorespiratory and renal disease. However, the rapidly progressive painful, itchy skin tightening that characterizes dcSSc is the symptom that has the greatest effect on patients' quality of life, and there is currently no effective disease-modifying treatment for it. Considerable advances have been made in predicting the extent and rate of skin-disease progression (which vary between patients), including the development of techniques such as molecular analysis of skin biopsy samples. Risk stratification for progressive skin disease is especially relevant now that haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a treatment option, because stratification will inform the balance of risk versus benefit for each patient. Measurement of skin disease is a major challenge. Results from clinical trials have highlighted limitations of the modified Rodnan skin score (the current gold standard). Alternative patient-reported and other potential outcome measures have been and are being developed. Patients with early dcSSc should be referred to specialist centres to ensure best-practice management, including the management of their skin disease, and to maximize opportunities for inclusion in clinical trials.","19":"","20":"","21":null,"22":"","23":"Diagnosis and management of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) has vastly improved over the past two decades. With advances in the discernment of immunopathogenesis of this disease, new therapies have become available, which are associated with substantial improvement in symptoms, signs and quality of life.

In addition, there have been a host of new developments in the axSpA field, including new treatment guidelines, the FDA approval of three biologic DMARDs to treat non-radiographic axSpA, the FDA and EMA approval of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors for ankylosing spondylitis, new data on the effect of biologic DMARDs on structural progression in ankylosing spondylitis, strategy trials on tapering or stopping TNF inhibitors in patients in remission, trials of treat-to-target strategy in axSpA, and several new molecules in phase III studies.

The data that are now available suggest that rheumatic disease is associated with a small additional risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that outcomes of COVID-19 are primarily influenced by comorbidities and particular disease states or treatments. Despite considerable advances in our knowledge of which therapeutic agents provide benefits in COVID-19, and of what constitutes effective vaccination strategies, the specific considerations that apply to people with rheumatic disease are yet to be definitively addressed. An overview of the most important COVID-19 studies to date that relate to people with rheumatic disease can contribute to our understanding of the clinical-care requirements of this population.","26":"","27":"","28":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disease resulting in joint deterioration. Synovial inflammation is present in the OA joint and has been associated with radiographic and pain progression. Several OA risk factors, including ageing, obesity, trauma and mechanical loading, play a role in OA pathogenesis, likely by modifying synovial biology. In addition, other factors, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, metabolites and crystals in the synovium, activate synovial cells and mediate synovial inflammation. An understanding of the activated pathways that are involved in OA-related synovial inflammation could form the basis for the stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutics. This Review focuses on the biology of the OA synovium, how the cells residing in or recruited to the synovium interact with each other, how they become activated, how they contribute to OA progression and their interplay with other joint structures.","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"Osteoarthritis (OA) most commonly affects knee joints, and the next most commonly affected sites are the hands and hips.

EHOA predominantly affects women and is the most aggressive form of hand OA, characterized by a severe clinical onset and progression, leading to joint damage, disability and reduction of quality of life. Clinical signs of inflammation associated with EHOA include the acute onset of pain, swelling and redness. Moreover, EHOA is characterized by radiographic features such as central erosion, saw-tooth and gull-wing lesions and, rarely, ankylosis. The aim of this Review is to report the latest findings on epidemiology, clinical features, pathology and aetiopathogenesis, biomarkers, imaging modalities and treatments for EHOA. The ongoing development of new hand OA classification criteria should facilitate standardization between studies.","36":"","37":"","38":"","39":"","40":"","41":"Adaptive immune responses rely on the proliferation of T lymphocytes able to recognize and eliminate pathogens. The magnitude and duration of the expansion of activated T cell clones are finely regulated to minimize immunopathology and avoid autoimmunity. In patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, activated lymphocytes survive and exert effector functions for prolonged periods, defying the mechanisms that normally curb their capacities during acute and chronic infections. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that limit the duration of immune responses in health and discuss the factors that alter such regulation in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. We highlight defects that could contribute to the development and progression of autoimmune disease and describe how chronic inflammation can alter the regulation of activated lymphocyte survival, promoting its perpetuation. These concepts might contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the chronicity of inflammation in the context of autoimmunity.","42":"Arthritis affects millions of people worldwide. With only a few disease-modifying drugs available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and none for osteoarthritis, a clear need exists for new treatment options. Current disease models used for drug screening and development suffer from several disadvantages and, most importantly, do not accurately emulate all facets of human joint diseases. A humanized joint-on-chip (JoC) model or platform could revolutionize research and drug development in rheumatic diseases. A JoC model is a multi-organ-on-chip platform that incorporates a range of engineered features to emulate essential aspects and functions of the human joint and faithfully recapitulates the joint's physiological responses. In this Review, we propose an architecture for such a JoC platform, discuss the status of the engineering of individual joint tissues and the efforts to combine them in a functional JoC model and identify unresolved issues and challenges in constructing an accurate, physiologically relevant system. The goal is to ultimately obtain a reliable and ready-to-use humanized model of the joint for studying the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases and screening drugs for treatment of these conditions.","43":"The treat-to-target (T2T) concept has improved outcomes for patients with diabetes, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. This therapeutic strategy involves choosing a well-defined, relevant target, taking therapeutic steps, evaluating whether the target has been achieved, and taking action if it has not. The T2T principle has been embraced by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experts, but measurable and achievable outcomes, and therapeutic options, are needed to make this approach possible in practice. Considerable evidence has been generated regarding meaningful 'state' outcomes for SLE. Low disease activity has been defined and studied, and the most aspirational goal, remission, has been defined by the Definition of Remission in SLE task force. By contrast, current therapeutic options in SLE are limited, and more effective and safer therapies are urgently needed. Fortunately, clinical trial activity in SLE has been unprecedented, and encouraging results have been seen for novel therapies, including biologic and small-molecule agents. Thus, with the expected advent of such treatments, it is likely that sufficiently diverse therapies for SLE will be available in the foreseeable future, allowing the routine implementation of T2T approaches in the care of patients with SLE.","44":"Vascular pathologies underpin and intertwine autoimmune rheumatic diseases and cardiovascular conditions, and atherosclerosis is increasingly recognized as the leading cause of morbidity in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Neutrophils, important cells in the innate immune system, exert their functional effects in tissues via a variety of mechanisms, including the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps and the production of reactive oxygen species. Neutrophils have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several rheumatic diseases, and can also intimately interact with the vascular system, either through modulating endothelial barriers at the blood-vessel interface, or through associations with platelets. Emerging data suggest that neutrophils also have an important role maintaining homeostasis in individual organs and can protect the vascular system. Furthermore, studies using high-dimensional omics technologies have advanced our understanding of neutrophil diversity, and immature neutrophils are receiving new attention in rheumatic diseases including SLE and systemic vasculitis. Developments in genomic, imaging and organoid technologies are beginning to enable more in-depth investigations into the pathophysiology of vascular inflammation in rheumatic diseases, making now a good time to re-examine the full scope of roles of neutrophils in these processes.","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"The four Janus kinase (JAK) proteins and seven signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors mediate intracellular signal transduction downstream of cytokine receptors, which are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune, allergic and inflammatory diseases. Development of targeted small-molecule therapies such as JAK inhibitors, which have varied selective inhibitory profiles, has enabled a paradigm shift in the treatment of diverse disorders. JAK inhibitors suppress intracellular signalling mediated by multiple cytokines involved in the pathological processes of rheumatoid arthritis and many other immune and inflammatory diseases, and therefore have the capacity to target multiple aspects of those diseases. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis, JAK inhibition has potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and alopecia areata, in which stimulation of innate immunity activates adaptive immunity, leading to generation of autoreactive T cells and activation and differentiation of B cells. JAK inhibitors are also effective in the treatment of allergic disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, and can even be used for the COVID-19-related cytokine storm. Mechanism-based treatments targeting JAK-STAT pathways have the potential to provide positive outcomes by minimizing the use of glucocorticoids and\/or non-specific immunosuppressants in the treatment of systemic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"Mechanical stimuli have fundamental roles in articular cartilage during health and disease. Chondrocytes respond to the physical properties of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) and the mechanical forces exerted on them during joint loading. In osteoarthritis (OA), catabolic processes degrade the functional ECM and the composition and viscoelastic properties of the ECM produced by chondrocytes are altered. The abnormal loading environment created by these alterations propagates cell dysfunction and inflammation. Chondrocytes sense their physical environment via an array of mechanosensitive receptors and channels that activate a complex network of downstream signalling pathways to regulate several cell processes central to OA pathology. Advances in understanding the complex roles of specific mechanosignalling mechanisms in healthy and OA cartilage have highlighted molecular processes that can be therapeutically targeted to interrupt pathological feedback loops. The potential for combining these mechanosignalling targets with the rapidly expanding field of smart mechanoresponsive biomaterials and delivery systems is an emerging paradigm in OA treatment. The continued advances in this field have the potential to enable restoration of healthy mechanical microenvironments and signalling through the development of precision therapeutics, mechanoregulated biomaterials and drug systems in the near future.","53":"","54":"Gout is a common hyperuricaemic metabolic condition that leads to painful inflammatory arthritis and a high comorbidity burden, especially cardiometabolic-renal (CMR) conditions, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the excess CMR burden in gout, ranging from pathogenesis underlying excess CMR comorbidities, inferring causal relationships from Mendelian randomization studies, and potentially discovering urate crystals in coronary arteries using advanced imaging, to clinical trials and observational studies. Despite many studies finding an independent association between blood urate levels and risk of incident CMR events, Mendelian randomization studies have largely found that serum urate is not causal for CMR end points or intermediate risk factors or outcomes (such as kidney function, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, glycaemic traits or blood lipid concentrations). Although limited, randomized controlled trials to date in adults without gout support this conclusion. If imaging studies suggesting that monosodium urate crystals are deposited in coronary plaques in patients with gout are confirmed, it is possible that these crystals might have a role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with gout; removing monosodium urate crystals or blocking the inflammatory pathway could reduce this excess risk. Accordingly, data for CMR outcomes with these urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory therapies in patients with gout are needed. In the meantime, highly pleiotropic CMR and urate-lowering benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and key lifestyle measures could play an important role in comorbidity care, in conjunction with effective gout care based on target serum urate concentrations according to the latest guidelines.","55":"","56":null,"57":"","58":"","59":"","60":"","61":"","62":null,"63":"","64":"The 3D nature and soft-tissue contrast of MRI makes it an invaluable tool for osteoarthritis research, by facilitating the elucidation of disease pathogenesis and progression.

These AI-related advances are revolutionizing the use of MRI in clinical research by augmenting activities ranging from image acquisition to post-processing. Automation is key to reducing the long acquisition times of MRI, conducting large-scale longitudinal studies and quantitatively defining morphometric and other important clinical features of both soft and hard tissues in various anatomical joints. Deep learning methods have been used recently for multiple applications in the musculoskeletal field to improve understanding of osteoarthritis. Compared with labour-intensive human efforts, AI-based methods have advantages and potential in all stages of imaging, as well as post-processing steps, including aiding diagnosis and prognosis. However, AI-based methods also have limitations, including the arguably limited interpretability of AI models. Given that the AI community is highly invested in uncovering uncertainties associated with model predictions and improving their interpretability, we envision future clinical translation and progressive increase in the use of AI algorithms to support clinicians in optimizing patient care.","65":"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a common finding on spine imaging that increases in prevalence with age. IVD degeneration is a frequent cause of low back pain, which is a leading cause of disability. The process of IVD degeneration consists of gradual structural change accompanied by severe alterations in metabolic homeostasis. IVD degeneration, like osteoarthritis, is a common comorbidity in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, two metabolic syndrome pathological conditions in which adipokines are important promoters of low-grade inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation and fibrosis. Impairment in white adipose tissue function, due to the abnormal fat accumulation in obesity, is characterized by increased production of specific pro-inflammatory proteins such as adipokines by white adipose tissue and of cytokines such as TNF by immune cells of the stromal compartment. Investigations into the immunometabolic alterations in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and their interconnections with IVD degeneration provide insights into how adipokines might affect the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration and impair IVD function and repair. Toll-like receptor-mediated signalling has also been implicated as a promoter of the inflammatory response in the metabolic alterations associated with IVD and is thus thought to have a role in IVD degeneration. Pathological starvation, obesity and adipokine dysregulation can result in immunometabolic alterations, which could be targeted for the development of new therapeutics.","66":"","67":"","68":"","69":"","70":"","71":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations that can potentially affect every organ and system.

Disease in these individuals can either progress over time to definite SLE or remain stable, in which case their disease is often described as intermediate, possible or probable SLE. Alternatively, such individuals might have undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). Being able to differentiate between those with stable UCTD and those with SLE at an early stage is important to avoid irreversible target-organ damage from occurring. This Review provides insight into existing and evolving perceptions of the early stages of SLE, including clinical and mechanistic considerations, as well as potential paths towards early identification and intervention. Further research into the earliest phases of SLE will be important for the development of targeted diagnostic approaches and biomarkers for the identification of individuals with early disease who are likely to progress to definite SLE.","72":"Machine learning (ML) is a computerized analytical technique that is being increasingly employed in biomedicine. ML often provides an advantage over explicitly programmed strategies in the analysis of multidimensional information by recognizing relationships in the data that were not previously appreciated. As such, the use of ML in rheumatology is increasing, and numerous studies have employed ML to classify patients with rheumatic autoimmune inflammatory diseases (RAIDs) from medical records and imaging, biometric or gene expression data. However, these studies are limited by sample size, the accuracy of sample labelling, and absence of datasets for external validation. In addition, there is potential for ML models to overfit or underfit the data and, thereby, these models might produce results that cannot be replicated in an unrelated dataset. In this Review, we introduce the basic principles of ML and discuss its current strengths and weaknesses in the classification of patients with RAIDs. Moreover, we highlight the successful analysis of the same type of input data (for example, medical records) with different algorithms, illustrating the potential plasticity of this analytical approach. Altogether, a better understanding of ML and the future application of advanced analytical techniques based on this approach, coupled with the increasing availability of biomedical data, may facilitate the development of meaningful precision medicine for patients with RAIDs.","73":"Failure of regulatory T (Treg) cells to properly control immune responses leads invariably to autoimmunity and organ damage.

Genetically modified IL-2 with an extended half-life and increased selectivity for Treg cells is now in clinical development. Administration of IL-2 combined with therapies targeting other pathways involved in the expression of autoimmune diseases should further enhance its therapeutic potential.

Joint distraction of the knee has been most extensively studied, with these studies showing prolonged symptomatic improvement in combination with repair of cartilage tissue in degenerated knee joints, supporting the concept that cartilage repair can translate into real clinical benefit. The reversal of tissue degeneration observed with joint distraction could be the result of one or a combination of various proposed mechanisms, including partial unloading, synovial fluid pressure oscillation, mechanical and biochemical changes in subchondral bone, adhesion and chondrogenic commitment of joint-derived mesenchymal stem cells or a change in the molecular milieu of the joint. The overall picture that emerges from the combined evidence is relevant for future research and treatment-related improvements of joint distraction and for translation of the insights gained about tissue repair to other joint-preserving techniques. It remains to be elucidated whether optimizing the biomechanical conditions during joint distraction can actually cure osteoarthritis rather than only providing temporary symptomatic relief, but even temporary relief might be relevant for society and patients, as it will delay joint replacement with a prosthesis at an early age and thereby avert revision surgery later in life.

As the amount of high-throughput profiling studies and mechanistic investigations of microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs in joint tissues and biofluids has increased, data have emerged that suggest complex interactions among non-coding RNAs that are often overlooked as critical regulators of gene expression. Identifying these non-coding RNAs and their interactions is useful for understanding both joint health and disease. Non-coding RNAs regulate signalling pathways and biological processes that are important for normal joint development but, when dysregulated, can contribute to disease. The specific expression profiles of non-coding RNAs in various disease states support their roles as promising candidate biomarkers, mediators of pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. This Review synthesizes literature published in the past 2 years on the role of non-coding RNAs in OA and RA with a focus on inflammation, cell death, cell proliferation and extracellular matrix dysregulation.

A growing body of evidence implicates epigenetic aberrations in this intractable disease, including specific modifications affecting the three main cell types involved in SSc pathogenesis: immune cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In this Review, we discuss the latest insights into the role of DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs in SSc and how these epigenetic alterations affect disease features. In particular, histone modifications have a role in the regulation of gene expression pertinent to activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, governing their fate. DNA methyltransferases are crucial in disease pathogenesis by mediating methylation of DNA in specific promoters, regulating expression of specific pathways. We discuss targeting of these enzymes for therapeutic gain. Innovative epigenetic therapy could be targeted to treat the disease in a precision epigenetics approach.","99":"Blood vessels form a versatile transport network that is best known for its critical roles in processes such as tissue oxygenation, metabolism and immune surveillance.

In the skeletal system, the local vasculature is actively involved in both bone formation and resorption. In addition, blood vessels participate in inflammatory processes and contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases that affect the joints, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

During inflammation, stromal cells contribute to inflammation, from induction to chronicity or resolution, through direct cell interactions and through the secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Stromal cells are imprinted with tissue-specific phenotypes and contribute to site-specific lymphocyte recruitment. During chronic inflammation, the modified pro-inflammatory microenvironment leads to changes in the stromal cells, which acquire a pathogenic phenotype. At the site of inflammation, infiltrating B cells and T cells interact with stromal cells. These interactions induce a plasma cell-like phenotype in B cells and T cells, associated with secretion of immunoglobulins and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. B cells and T cells also influence the stromal cells, inducing cell proliferation, molecular changes and cytokine production. This positive feedback loop contributes to disease chronicity. This Review describes the importance of these cell interactions in chronic inflammation, with a focus on human disease, using three selected autoimmune and inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (and psoriasis) and systemic lupus erythematosus. Understanding the importance and disease specificity of these interactions could provide new therapeutic options.","112":"","113":"Most rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) can be placed along a spectrum of disorders, with autoinflammatory diseases (including monogenic systemic autoinflammatory diseases) and autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome) representing the two ends of this spectrum.

Indeed, some 'mixed-pattern' diseases such as spondyloarthritis and some forms of rheumatoid arthritis can also be delineated. A better understanding of the pathogenic pathways of autoinflammation and autoimmunity in RMDs, as well as the preferential cytokine patterns observed in these diseases, could help us to design targeted treatment strategies.","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"Gout and chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently coexist, but quality evidence to guide gout management in people with CKD is lacking.

Consequently, the assessment of physical function is recommended as a key domain in the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society-OMERACT Core Outcome Set. However, in comparison with disease activity, physical function seems to be a relatively neglected target of intervention in patients with axSpA, even though physical function is a major contributor to costs and disability in this disease.

These limitations on the clinical efficacy of TNF inhibitors can be explained by the differences between TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 signalling and by the diverse effects of TNF on multiple immune cells, including FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. This basic knowledge sheds light on the consequences of TNF inhibitor therapies on regulatory T cells in treated patients and on the limitations of such treatment in the control of diseases with an autoimmune component. Accordingly, the next generation of drugs targeting TNF is likely to be based on agents that selectively block the binding of TNF to TNFR1 and on TNFR2 agonists.

Functional follow-up of these findings is most challenging for genomic variants that are in non-coding genomic regions, where the large majority of common disease-associated variants are located, and\/or that probably affect disease progression via cell type-specific gene regulation. To deliver on the therapeutic promise of human genetic studies, defining the mechanisms of action of these alleles is essential. Genome editing technology, such as CRISPR-Cas, has created a vast toolbox for targeted genetic and epigenetic modifications that presents unprecedented opportunities to decipher disease-causing loci, genes and variants in autoimmunity.

During homeostatic development, oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases, circadian clock proteins and metabolic intermediates control the activities of HIF1 and HIF2 in these tissues. Mechanistically, HIF1 is the master regulator of glycolytic metabolism and cytosolic lactate levels. In addition, HIF1 regulates mitochondrial metabolism by promoting flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, inhibiting downsteam oxidative phosphorylation and controlling mitochondrial health through modulation of the mitophagic pathway. Accumulation of metabolic intermediates from HIF-dependent processes contribute to intracellular pH regulation in the disc and cartilage. Namely, to prevent changes in intracellular pH that could lead to cell death, HIF1 orchestrates a bicarbonate buffering system in the disc, controlled by carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and CA12, sodium bicarbonate cotransporters and an intracellular H+\/lactate efflux mechanism. In contrast to HIF1, the role of HIF2 remains elusive; in disorders of the disc and cartilage, its function has been linked to both anabolic and catabolic pathways. The current knowledge of hypoxic cell metabolism and regulation of HIF1 activity provides a strong basis for the development of future therapies designed to repair the degenerative disc.","148":"","149":"","150":"","151":"","152":"","153":"","154":null,"155":"","156":"","157":"","158":"","159":"","160":"","161":"","162":"","163":"","164":"","165":"","166":null,"167":"","168":"","169":"","170":null,"171":"Immune-related manifestations are increasingly recognized conditions in patients with COVID-19, with around 3,000 cases reported worldwide comprising more than 70 different systemic and organ-specific disorders.

The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients.

One reason could be that current therapies are based on the assumption that chronic inflammation is driven by persistent 'acute' immune reactions. Here we discuss a paradigm shift by suggesting that beyond these reactions, chronic inflammation is driven by imprinted, pathogenic 'memory' cells of the immune system. This rationale is based on the observation that in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapies, therapy-free remission can be achieved by resetting the immune system; that is, by ablating immune cells and regenerating the immune system from stem cells. The success of this approach identifies antigen-experienced and imprinted immune cells as essential and sufficient drivers of inflammation. The 'dark side' of immunological memory primarily involves memory plasma cells secreting pathogenic antibodies and memory T lymphocytes secreting pathogenic cytokines and chemokines, but can also involve cells of innate immunity. New therapeutic strategies should address the persistence of these memory cells. Selective targeting of pathogenic immune memory cells could be based on their specificity, which is challenging, or on their lifestyle, which differs from that of protective immune memory cells, in particular for pathogenic T lymphocytes. The adaptations of such pathogenic memory cells to chronic inflammation offers entirely new therapeutic options for their selective ablation and the regeneration of immunological tolerance.","183":"","184":"","185":"","186":"","187":"","188":null,"189":"","190":"","191":"","192":"","193":"","194":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective in the treatment of patients with advanced cancer and have emerged as a pillar of standard cancer care.

ICI-induced inflammatory arthritis is distinguished from other irAEs by its persistence and requirement for long-term treatment. TNF inhibitors are commonly used to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies and inflammatory bowel disease, and have also been adopted as second-line agents to treat irAEs refractory to glucocorticoid treatment. Experiencing an irAE is associated with a better antitumour response after ICI treatment. However, whether TNF inhibition can be safely used to treat irAEs without promoting cancer progression, either by compromising ICI therapy efficacy or via another route, remains an open question. In this Review, we discuss clinical and preclinical studies that address the relationship between TNF, TNF inhibition and cancer. The bulk of the evidence suggests that at least short courses of TNF inhibitors are safe for the treatment of irAEs in patients with cancer undergoing ICI therapy. Data from preclinical studies hint that TNF inhibition might augment the antitumour effect of ICI therapy while simultaneously ameliorating irAEs.","195":"","196":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the joints.

Alterations in the composition of the microbial flora in the lungs, mouth and gut in individuals with preclinical and established RA suggest a role for mucosal dysbiosis in the development and perpetuation of RA, although establishing whether these alterations are the specific consequence of intestinal involvement in the setting of a systemic inflammatory process, or whether they represent a specific localization of disease, is an ongoing challenge. Data from mouse models of RA and investigations into the preclinical stages of disease also support the hypothesis that these alterations to the microbiota predate the onset of disease. In addition, several therapeutic options widely used for the treatment of RA are associated with alterations in intestinal microbiota, suggesting that modulation of intestinal microbiota and\/or intestinal barrier function might be useful in preventing or treating RA.","197":"","198":"","199":"","200":"","201":"","202":"","203":"","204":"The concept of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) prevention is gaining increased interest owing to the physical limitation, poor quality of life and low remission rates that are achieved with current therapies for PsA.

In the synovium, a main site of disease activity in RA, positional and disease stage-specific cellular diversity exist. Improved understanding of the architecture of the synovium from gross anatomy to the single-cell level, in parallel with evidence demonstrating how the synovial ECM is vital for synovial homeostasis and how dysregulated signals from the ECM promote chronic inflammation and tissue destruction in the RA joint, has opened up new ways of thinking about the pathogenesis of RA.

A prototypic disease associated with B cell hyperactivity is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

TLR7 drives the extrafollicular B cell response and the germinal centre reaction that are involved in autoantibody production and disease pathogenesis. Surprisingly, TLR9 seems to protect against SLE, even though it is required for the production of autoantibodies recognizing double-stranded DNA-associated antigens, which are abundant in SLE and are a hallmark of this disease. The protective function of TLR9 is at least partly mediated by its capacity to limit the stimulatory activity of TLR7.

The advent of biosimilars has sparked a renewed interest in immunogenicity that has resulted in the development of increasingly sensitive assays, an enhanced appreciation of the pharmacokinetic consequences of immunogenicity and the development of comprehensive and specific guidance from regulatory authorities. As a result, rheumatologists have a greatly improved understanding of the field in general, including the factors responsible for immunogenicity, its potential clinical consequences and the implications for everyday treatment.

Even now, achieving a cure seems to be a rare occurrence among individuals with RA. Therefore, this Review is aimed at addressing the obstacles to the achievement of cure in RA. The differences between remission and cure in RA are first defined, followed by a discussion of the underlying factors (referred to as drivers) that prevent the achievement of cure in RA by triggering sustained immune activation and effector cytokine production. Such drivers include adaptive immune system activation, mesenchymal tissue priming and so-called 'remote' (non-immune and non-articular) factors.

These two types of disease are not mutually exclusive, but identifying those individuals with predominant PIRRA or NIRRA is important, as it informs distinct treatment and management approaches. This Review outlines the clinical differences between PIRRA and NIRRA, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and immune pathways that might contribute to the immunopathogenesis of recalcitrant synovitis in PIRRA, and a possible basis for non-inflammatory symptomatology in NIRRA.

In patients with seronegative IMNM, disease can be concomitant with cancer. Research into IMNM pathogenesis has shown that anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR autoantibodies cause weakness and myofibre necrosis in mice, suggesting that, as well as being diagnostic biomarkers of IMNM, they may play a key role in disease pathogenesis.

CD4+ T cells have also been investigated in detail; CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (suspected of promoting disease) and a specific T follicular helper cell subset that contributes to IgG4 isotype switching have both been defined by multiple groups. The mechanisms by which these immune cells converge on target tissues, interact with fibroblasts and promote tissue remodelling are beginning to be understood and will be an important research focus in the coming years.","283":"","284":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.","285":"","286":"Despite the success of targeted therapies in the treatment of inflammatory arthritides, the lack of predictive biomarkers drives a 'trial and error' approach to treatment allocation, leading to variable and\/or unsatisfactory responses.

Of the four FGF receptors (FGFRs 1-4), FGFR1 and FGFR3 are strongly implicated in osteoarthritis, and FGFR1 antagonists, as well as agonists of FGFR3, have shown therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of spontaneous and surgically induced osteoarthritis. FGF18, a high affinity ligand for FGFR3, is the only FGF-based drug currently in clinical trials for osteoarthritis. This Review covers the latest advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate FGF signalling during normal joint development and in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Strategies for FGF signalling-based treatment of osteoarthritis and for cartilage repair in animal models and clinical trials are also introduced. An improved understanding of FGF signalling from a structural biology perspective, and of its roles in skeletal development and diseases, could unlock new avenues for discovery of modulators of FGF signalling that can slow or stop the progression of osteoarthritis.","299":"","300":"","301":"Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA, the best studied epigenetic modification, is associated with gene transcription and nuclear organization, and ultimately the function of a cell. DNA methylation can be influenced by various factors, including changes in neighbouring genomic sites such as those induced by transcription factor binding. The DNA methylation profiles in relevant cell types are altered in most human diseases compared with the healthy state. Given the physical stability of DNA and methylated DNA compared with other epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation is an ideal marker for clinical purposes. However, few DNA methylation-based markers have made it into clinical practice, with the notable exception of some markers used in the field of oncology. Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are genetically complex entities that can vary widely in terms of prognosis, subtypes, progression and treatment responses. Increasing reports showing strong links between DNA methylation profiles and different clinical outcomes and other clinical aspects in autoimmune rheumatic diseases reinforce the usefulness of DNA methylation profiles as novel clinical markers. In this Review, we provide an updated discussion on DNA methylation alterations in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and the advantages and disadvantages of using these markers in clinical practice.","302":"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common type of primary vasculitis in Western countries. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the second most common inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly after rheumatoid arthritis.

Careful use of glucocorticoids and the application of preventive strategies can minimize these adverse effects. Possible long-term complications of GCA include aneurysm and stenosis of vessels, even in patients with apparently clinically inactive disease; acute blindness is rare during glucocorticoid treatment. In PMR, whether subclinical chronic inflammation can lead to long-term damage is less clear. Management of both GCA and PMR is hampered by the lack of universally accepted definitions of remission and other disease states, such as low disease activity or vessel damage without active disease.

This process helps maintain tissue homeostasis, supports recovery from acute injury, deals with infection and regulates immunity. Cell death can also provoke inflammatory responses, and lytic forms of cell death can incite inflammation. Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to the uncontrolled release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are normally sequestered inside cells. Such DAMPs increase local inflammation and promote the production of cytokines and chemokines that modulate the innate immune response. Cell death can be both a consequence and a cause of inflammation, which can be difficult to distinguish in chronic diseases. Despite this caveat, excessive or poorly regulated cell death is increasingly recognized as a contributor to chronic inflammation in rheumatic disease and other inflammatory conditions. Drugs that inhibit cell death could, therefore, be used therapeutically for the treatment of these diseases, and programmes to develop such inhibitors are already underway. In this Review, we outline pathways for the major cell death programmes (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and NETosis) and their potential roles in chronic inflammation.

Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases. Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia.

These epigenetic analyses have involved investigations of joint development, homeostasis and disease and have used both human samples and animal models. What has become apparent from a comparison of these two complementary approaches is that many OA genetic risk signals interact with, map to or correlate with epigenetic mediators. This discovery implies that epigenetic mechanisms, and their effect on gene expression, are a major conduit through which OA genetic risk polymorphisms exert their functional effects.

Tendons and ligaments require physiological levels of mechanical loading to develop and maintain their tissue architecture, a process that is achieved at the cellular level through mechanotransduction-mediated fine tuning of the extracellular matrix by tendon and ligament stromal cells. Pathological levels of force represent a biological (mechanical) stress that elicits an immune system-mediated tissue repair pathway in tendons and ligaments. The biomechanics and mechanobiology of tendons and ligaments form the basis for understanding how such tissues sense and respond to mechanical force, and the anatomical extent of several mechanical stress-related disorders in tendons and ligaments overlaps with that of chronic inflammatory arthritis in joints. The role of mechanical stress in 'overuse' injuries, such as tendinopathy, has long been known, but mechanical stress is now also emerging as a possible trigger for some forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, including spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, seemingly diverse diseases of the musculoskeletal system might have similar mechanisms of immunopathogenesis owing to conserved responses to mechanical stress.","394":"","395":"After decades of sometimes fierce debate about the advantages and disadvantages of glucocorticoids, an age of convergence has been reached.

Over the past few years, a range of glucocorticoid-sparing strategies have been developed, as have tools to improve the management of this therapy. A comprehensive view of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis has also emerged that recognizes that bone fragility is not solely determined by the dose and duration of glucocorticoid treatment.

Myofibroblasts are scar-forming cells that are ultimately responsible for the excessive synthesis, deposition and remodelling of extracellular matrix proteins in fibrosis. Advances have been made in our understanding of the mechanisms that keep myofibroblasts in an activated state and control myofibroblast functions. However, the mechanisms that help myofibroblasts to persist in fibrotic tissues remain poorly understood. Myofibroblasts evade apoptosis by activating molecular mechanisms in response to pro-survival biomechanical and growth factor signals from the fibrotic microenvironment, which can ultimately lead to the acquisition of a senescent phenotype. Growing evidence suggests that myofibroblasts and senescent myofibroblasts, rather than being resistant to apoptosis, are actually primed for apoptosis owing to concomitant activation of cell death signalling pathways; these cells are poised to apoptose when survival pathways are inhibited. This knowledge of apoptotic priming has paved the way for new therapies that trigger apoptosis in myofibroblasts by blocking pro-survival mechanisms, target senescent myofibroblast for apoptosis or promote the reprogramming of myofibroblasts into scar-resolving cells. These novel strategies are not only poised to prevent progressive tissue scarring, but also have the potential to reverse established fibrosis and to regenerate chronically injured tissues.","441":"","442":"","443":"","444":"","445":"","446":"","447":"","448":"","449":"","450":"","451":"","452":"","453":null,"454":"Chemokines, a family of small secreted chemotactic cytokines, and their G protein-coupled seven transmembrane spanning receptors control the migratory patterns, positioning and cellular interactions of immune cells.

No firm evidence exists that these ACPAs are pathogenic. By contrast, private ACPAs encompass antibodies that specifically recognize citrullinated epitopes on joint proteins or that cross-react with joint proteins, thereby opening up the possibility that these private ACPAs are arthritogenic. These joint-reactive antibodies are more likely to target joints by binding to joint tissues and to promote the formation of local immune complexes leading to bone erosions, pain and arthritis.","529":"","530":"","531":"","532":"Inflammatory arthritis occurs in many diseases and is characterized by joint inflammation and damage. However, the inflammatory state in arthritis is commonly associated with systemic manifestations, which are generally linked to a poor prognosis. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 functions within a complex network of cytokines and contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. Three IL-17 inhibitors have already been approved for the treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. After a brief description of IL-17 and its local effects on joints, this Review focuses on the systemic effects of IL-17 in inflammatory arthritis. Increased circulating concentrations of bioactive IL-17 mediate changes in blood vessels, liver and cardiac and skeletal muscles. The effects of IL-17 on vascular and cardiac cells might contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular events that occurs in all patients with inflammatory disorders. In the liver, IL-17 contributes to the high circulating concentrations of acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein, and the appearance of liver lesions. In skeletal muscle, IL-17 contributes to muscle contractibility defects and weakness. Thus, targeting IL-17 might have beneficial effects at both local and systemic levels, and could also be proposed for the treatment of a wider range of inflammatory diseases.","533":"","534":"","535":"","536":"The classification and monitoring of individuals with early knee osteoarthritis (OA) are important considerations for the design and evaluation of therapeutic interventions and require the identification of appropriate outcome measures.

To that end, this Review highlights research opportunities afforded by studying dogs with spontaneous OA, with a view to sharing this active area of veterinary research with new audiences. Similarities and differences between dog and human OA are examined, and the proposition is made that suitably aligned studies of spontaneous OA in dogs and humans, in particular hip and knee OA, could highlight new avenues of discovery. Developing cross-species collaborations will provide a wealth of research material and knowledge that is relevant to human OA and that cannot currently be obtained from rodent models or experimentally induced dog models of OA.

Platelets are an important cellular element in the circulation that can bind several dysregulated molecules (such as collagen, thrombin and fibrinogen) that are present both in the synovium and the circulation of patients with RA. Platelets not only respond to dysregulated molecules in their environment but also transport and express their own inflammatory mediators, and serve as regulators at the boundary between haemostasis and immunity. Activated platelets also produce microparticles, which further convey signalling molecules and receptors to the synovium and circulation, thereby positioning these platelet-derived particles as strategic regulators of inflammation. These diverse functions come together to make platelets facilitators of cellular crosstalk in RA. Thus, the receptor functions, ligand binding potential and dysregulated signalling pathways in platelets are becoming increasingly important for treatment in RA. This Review aims to highlight the role of platelets in RA and the need to closely examine platelets as health indicators when designing effective pharmaceutical targets in this disease.","596":"","597":"The advent of biologic therapies, particularly antibody therapeutics, has revolutionized the pharmacological treatment of many rheumatic diseases.

For most clinical applications in rheumatology, antibodies have been used as blocking agents capable of neutralizing the function of pro-inflammatory proteins, such as TNF. The latest strategies involve antibody products armed with effector moieties, such as anti-inflammatory drugs or cytokines, or antibody products that are specific for multiple targets for the selective inhibition of inflammation at sites of disease.

Moreover, many of these therapies possess undesirable safety profiles and have no appreciable effect on long-term mortality. This Review describes the most promising of the existing therapeutic targets for SSc and places them in the context of our evolving understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease. As well as taking an in-depth look at the immune, inflammatory, vascular and fibrotic pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of SSc, this Review discusses emerging treatment targets and therapeutic strategies.

BMUs are focally transient teams of osteoclasts and osteoblasts that respectively resorb a volume of old bone and then deposit an equal volume of new bone at the same location. Around the time of menopause, bone remodelling becomes unbalanced and rapid, and an increased number of BMUs deposit less bone than they resorb, resulting in bone loss, a reduction in bone volume and microstructural deterioration. Cortices become porous and thin, and trabeculae become thin, perforated and disconnected, causing bone fragility. Antiresorptive agents reduce fracture risk by reducing the rate of bone remodelling so that fewer BMUs are available to remodel bone. Bone fragility is not abolished by these drugs because existing microstructural deterioration is not reversed, unsuppressed remodelling continues producing microstructural deterioration and unremodelled bone that becomes more mineralized can become brittle. Anabolic agents reduce fracture risk by stimulating new bone formation, which partly restores bone volume and microstructure. To guide fracture prevention, this Review provides an overview of the structural basis of bone fragility, the mechanisms of remodelling and how anabolic and antiresorptive agents target remodelling defects.","604":"Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases, affecting 3% of the world's population, and approximately one-third of patients with psoriasis will eventually transition to having psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The evolution from cutaneous to synovio-entheseal inflammation in these patients presents an opportunity to investigate the critical events linked to arthritis development. The events responsible for progression to PsA are currently unclear. Genetic and clinical-demographic risk factors (most notably familial aggregation and psoriasis sub-phenotypes) provide relevant insights into the variables that promote transition. The specific underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, however, remain poorly defined. Intriguingly, although targeting the IL-23-IL-17 axis substantially improves psoriasis outcomes, this strategy is not more effective than TNF inhibitors in improving musculoskeletal symptoms in PsA. Major unmet needs in the field of PsA include defining those patients with psoriasis at increased risk of developing arthritis, improving our understanding of the natural history of disease and characterizing the immune, environmental and molecular subclinical events preceding PsA onset. Improving our knowledge of this transition is essential for designing clinical trials with treatments that can delay, attenuate or even prevent the development of PsA in patients with psoriasis.","605":"","606":"","607":"","608":"","609":"","610":"","611":"","612":"","613":"","614":"Treat-to-target has been established as a guiding principle for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and encompasses several distinct elements: choosing a target and a method for measuring it; assessing the target at a pre-specified time point; a commitment to change the therapy if the target is not achieved; and shared decision-making. A treat-to-target approach yields superior outcomes to standard care in RA, and the ACR, EULAR and other professional organizations have endorsed treat-to-target as a fundamental therapeutic strategy for RA. Nevertheless, data on the degree to which treat-to-target is employed in the clinic are scarce; it seems that although some elements of treat-to-target are widely used, full implementation remains uncommon.

Some features of NPSLE, in particular those related to coagulopathy, have been characterized and an evidence-based treatment algorithm is available. The cognitive and affective manifestations of NPSLE, however, remain poorly understood. Various immune effectors have been evaluated as contributors to its pathogenesis, including brain-reactive autoantibodies, cytokines and cell-mediated inflammation. Additional brain-intrinsic elements (such as resident microglia, the blood-brain barrier and other neurovascular interfaces) are important facilitators of NPSLE. As yet, however, no unifying model has been found to underlie the pathogenesis of NPSLE, suggesting that this disease has multiple contributors and perhaps several distinct aetiologies. This heterogeneity presents a challenge for clinicians who have traditionally relied on empirical judgement in choosing treatment modalities for patients with NPSLE. Improved understanding of this manifestation of SLE might yield further options for managing this disease.","619":"In the originally published online version of this article there were errors in the Supplementary Information.

The isolation of such cells implies that the IVD might contain a quiescent progenitor-like population that could be activated for IVD repair and regeneration. Increased understanding of endogenous disc progenitor cells will improve our knowledge of IVD homeostasis and, when combined with tissue engineering techniques, might hold promise for future therapeutic applications. In this Review, the characteristics of progenitor cells in different IVD compartments are discussed, as well as the potency of different cell populations within the IVD.

Although this process is critical for successful wound healing, aberrant immune-mediated cell infiltration can lead to pathological inflammation of the joint. Importantly, cells of mesenchymal or haematopoietic origin use distinct modes of migration and thus might respond differently to similar biological cues and microenvironments. Furthermore, cell migration in the physiological microenvironment of musculoskeletal tissues differs considerably from migration in vitro. This Review addresses the complexities of cell migration in fibrous connective tissues from three separate but interdependent perspectives: physiology (including the cellular and extracellular factors affecting 3D cell migration), pathophysiology (cell migration in the context of synovial joint autoimmune disease and injury) and tissue engineering (cell migration in engineered biomaterials). Improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing interstitial cell migration might lead to interventions that stop invasion processes that culminate in deleterious outcomes and\/or that expedite migration to direct endogenous cell-mediated repair and regeneration of joint tissues.","630":"","631":"","632":"","633":"","634":"Dactylitis is diffuse swelling of the digits that is usually related to an underlying inflammatory or infiltrative disorder.

Clinical trials in PsA have increasingly included dactylitis as an important secondary outcome measure. These studies indicate that cytokines drive multi-locus microanatomical pan-digital pathology. Given the importance of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the pathogenesis of dactylitis is best understood as an initial aberrant innate immune response to biomechanical stress or injury, with subsequent adaptive immune mechanisms amplifying the dactylitis inflammatory response.

Similar to other autoimmune diseases, AAV develops in patients with a predisposing genetic background who have been exposed to causative environmental factors. The mechanism by which ANCAs cause vasculitis involves ANCA-mediated excessive activation of neutrophils that subsequently release inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and lytic enzymes. In addition, this excessive activation of neutrophils by ANCAs induces formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although NETs are essential elements in innate immunity, excessive NET formation is harmful to small vessels. Moreover, NETs are involved not only in ANCA-mediated vascular injury but also in the production of ANCAs themselves. Therefore, a vicious cycle of NET formation and ANCA production is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of AAV. In addition to this role of NETs in AAV, some other important discoveries have been made in the past few years. Incorporating these new insights into our understanding of the pathogenesis of AAV is needed to fully understand and ultimately overcome this disease.","641":"","642":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is an extremely common musculoskeletal disease.

Also covered are epidemiology and clinical descriptions of rheumatic irAEs, plus guiding principles for managing irAEs. Finally, we outline future directions that must be taken in response to a series of unanswered questions and unmet needs that now confront rheumatologists who are, or will be, engaged in this new area of rheumatology.","713":"","714":null,"715":"Individuals at high risk of developing seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be identified for translational research and disease prevention studies through the presence of highly informative and predictive patterns of RA-related autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), in the serum. In serologically positive individuals without arthritis, designated ACPA positive at risk, the presence of mucosal inflammatory processes associated with the presence of local ACPA production has been demonstrated. In other at-risk populations, local RA-related autoantibody production is present even in the absence of serum autoantibodies. Additionally, a proportion of at-risk individuals exhibit local mucosal ACPA production in the lung, as well as radiographic small-airway disease, sputum hypercellularity and increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Other mucosal sites in at-risk individuals also exhibit autoantibody production, inflammation and\/or evidence of dysbiosis. As the proportion of individuals who exhibit such localized inflammation-associated ACPA production is substantially higher than the likelihood of an individual developing future RA, this finding raises the hypothesis that mucosal ACPAs have biologically relevant protective roles. Identifying the mechanisms that drive both the generation and loss of externally focused mucosal ACPA production and promote systemic autoantibody expression and ultimately arthritis development should provide insights into new therapeutic approaches to prevent RA.","716":"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an organ-threatening and life-threatening multi-system autoimmune disease in which B cell-derived ANCAs cause neutrophil activation and endothelial damage, strongly implicating these autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of AAV. B cell depletion with rituximab combined with glucocorticoids is associated with a reduction in ANCA concentrations and with clinical remission in the majority of patients with AAV. However, the safety profile of rituximab is no better than that of conventional therapy with cyclophosphamide, and long-term glucocorticoid treatment is needed to achieve and maintain disease-free remission. A need for new therapies exists to reduce the time to remission, to spare the use of glucocorticoids and to promote long-lasting remission without the risk of relapse. Over the past 20 years, there has been great interest in therapeutically targeting B cell cytokines, such as B cell-activating factor (BAFF), in many autoimmune disease settings. Dual B cell-targeted immunotherapy that combines B cell depletion and BAFF blockade could potentially be more efficacious than targeting either mechanism alone. In this Review, the theoretical background for use of this combination approach in AAV is presented and discussed.","717":"","718":"","719":"","720":null,"721":"","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"","726":"","727":"","728":"","729":"","730":"","731":"","732":"Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a term that refers to a group of inflammatory diseases that includes psoriatic arthritis, axial SpA and nonradiographic axial SpA, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis and undifferentiated SpA.

The diseases also share genetic factors. The aetiology of SpA is still the subject of research by many groups worldwide. Evidence from genetic, experimental and clinical studies has accumulated to indicate a clear role for the IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of SpA. The IL-17 family consists of IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E and IL-17F, of which IL-17A is the best studied. IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that also has the capacity to promote angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Of the six family members, IL-17A has the strongest homology with IL-17F.

Lymphocytes are long-lived cells that visit many lymphoid and peripheral tissues over their lifetime and can even recirculate back to the bone marrow, whereas granulocytes and monocytes are not thought to recirculate so widely. Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an example, this Review explores the migratory journey of leukocytes during the establishment and resolution of disease - from the blood, through the lymphoid tissues and into peripheral sites such as the lungs and the gut before their entry into the synovium. This Review explores our current understanding of differences in the molecular processes that regulate leukocyte trafficking at different phases of disease and in different stromal compartments, which could help to explain the disease heterogeneity seen in patients with RA. Expanding our knowledge of these processes will open new avenues in the clinical management of RA, paving the way for personalized medicine that is founded on the pathological molecular signature of each patient, which varies according to their phase of disease or disease subtype.","734":"","735":"","736":"","737":"","738":"","739":"","740":"","741":"","742":"","743":"","744":"","745":"","746":"Rheumatic diseases are a collection of disorders defined by the presence of inflammation and destruction of joints and internal organs.

Neutrophils, major players in the host innate immune response, initiate a cell death mechanism termed neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as a way to ensnare pathogens. NETs are also a source of released self-molecules found in rheumatic diseases. Subsequently, research on the role of NETs in the onset, progression and resolution of inflammation in rheumatic diseases has intensified. This Review has two aims. First, it aims to highlight the mechanisms required for the generation of NETs, the research landscape of which is rapidly changing. Second, it aims to discuss the role of neutrophils and NETs in systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis (specifically anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis), rheumatoid arthritis and gout.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) result from accelerated atherogenesis, which is a consequence of endothelial dysfunction in the early stages of the disease. Endothelial dysfunction is a functional and reversible alteration of endothelial cells and leads to a shift in the properties of the endothelium towards reduced vasodilation, a pro-inflammatory state, and proliferative and prothrombotic properties. In RA, endothelial dysfunction can occur in the large vessels (such as the conduit arteries) and in the small vessels of the microvasculature, which supply oxygen and nutrients to the tissue and control inflammation, repair and fluid exchange with the surrounding tissues. Growing evidence suggests that microvascular endothelial dysfunction contributes to CVD development, as it precedes and predicts the development of conduit artery atherosclerosis and associated risk factors. As such, numerous studies have investigated microvascular endothelial dysfunction in RA, including its link with disease activity, disease duration and inflammation, the effect of treatments on endothelial function, and possible circulating biomarkers of microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Such findings could have important implications in the cardiovascular risk management of patients with RA.","758":"","759":"","760":"","761":"","762":"","763":"","764":"","765":"The discovery and validation of biomarkers resulting from technological advances in the analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, lipidomic and metabolomic pathways involved in the pathogenesis of complex human diseases have led to the development of personalized and rationally designed approaches for the clinical management of such disorders.

Past clinical trials have failed for several reasons, including the commonly applied definition of eligibility based on radiographic assessment of joint structure. In the context of precision medicine, finding the appropriate patient for a specific treatment approach will be of increasing relevance. Phenotypic stratification by use of imaging at the time of determining eligibility for clinical trials will be paramount and cannot be achieved using radiography alone. Furthermore, identification of joints at high risk of rapid progression of osteoarthritis is needed in order to enable a more efficient DMOAD trial design. In addition, joints at high risk of collapse need to be excluded at screening. The use of MRI might offer advantages over radiography in this context. Technological advances and simplified image assessment address many of the commonly perceived barriers to the application of MRI to assessment of eligibility for DMOAD clinical trials.","771":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was first identified in the late 17th century. 250 years later, inflammatory spine disease was recognized to be one of the patterns of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Isolated spondylitis is rare among patients with PsA, occurring in less than 5% of patients; however, many patients with PsA have axial disease that is concurrent with peripheral arthritis. At the other end of the spondyloarthritis spectrum, psoriasis is observed in 10% of patients with AS. Although axial involvement in PsA can be indistinguishable from axial disease in AS, it can also differ in several respects, raising the question of whether axial PsA and AS (with or without psoriasis) are different clinical presentations of the same disease, or whether they are separate diseases that have overlapping features. In this Review, the clinical presentation, metrology, radiographic characteristics, genetic factors, treatment options and axial prognosis of the two diseases are addressed.

The clinical features of gout result from an individual's immune response to these deposited crystals. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed the importance of urate excretion in the control of serum urate levels and the risk of gout and have identified the kidneys, the gut and the liver as sites of urate regulation. The genetic contribution to the progression from hyperuricaemia to gout remains relatively poorly understood, although genes encoding proteins that are involved in the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome pathway play a part. Genome-wide and targeted sequencing is beginning to identify uncommon population-specific variants that are associated with urate levels and gout. Mendelian randomization studies using urate-associated genetic variants as unconfounded surrogates for lifelong urate exposure have not supported claims that urate is causal for metabolic conditions that are comorbidities of hyperuricaemia and gout. Genetic studies have also identified genetic variants that predict responsiveness to therapies (for example, urate-lowering drugs) for treatment of hyperuricaemia.

However, the mechanisms by which autoimmune diseases evolve remain poorly understood. Newly discovered risk factors and pathogenic processes in the various idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) phenotypes (known collectively as myositis) have illuminated innovative approaches for understanding these diseases. The HLA 8.1 ancestral haplotype is a key risk factor for major IIM phenotypes in some populations, and several genetic variants associated with other autoimmune diseases have been identified as IIM risk factors. Environmental risk factors are less well studied than genetic factors but might include viruses, bacteria, ultraviolet radiation, smoking, occupational and perinatal exposures and a growing list of drugs (including biologic agents) and dietary supplements. Disease mechanisms vary by phenotype, with evidence of shared innate and adaptive immune and metabolic pathways in some phenotypes but unique pathways in others. The heterogeneity and rarity of the IIMs make advancements in diagnosis and treatment cumbersome. Novel approaches, better-defined phenotypes, and international, multidisciplinary consensus have contributed to progress, and it is hoped that these methods will eventually enable therapeutic intervention before the onset or major progression of disease. In the future, preemptive strategies for IIM management might be possible.","787":"The discovery of novel autoantigen systems related to idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (collectively referred to as myositis) in adults and children has had major implications for the diagnosis and management of this group of diseases across a wide range of medical specialties. Traditionally, autoantibodies found in patients with myositis are described as being myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) or myositis-associated autoantibodies (MAAs), depending on their prevalence in other, related conditions. However, certain MSAs are more closely associated with extramuscular manifestations, such as skin and lung disease, than with myositis itself. It is very rare for more than one MSA to coexist in the same individual, underpinning the potential to use MSAs to precisely define genetic and disease endotypes. Each MSA is associated with a distinctive pattern of disease or phenotype, which has implications for diagnosis and a more personalized approach to therapy. Knowledge of the function and localization of the autoantigenic targets for MSAs has provided key insights into the potential immunopathogenic mechanisms of myositis. In particular, evidence suggests that the alteration of expression of a myositis-related autoantigen by certain environmental influences or oncogenesis could be a pivotal event linking autoantibody generation to the development of disease.","788":"Mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation are now recognized as important factors in the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Mitochondria are the energy powerhouses of the cell, and also regulate different processes involved in the pathogenesis of OA including inflammation, apoptosis, calcium metabolism and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Mitochondria contain their own genetic material, mtDNA, which evolved through the sequential accumulation of mtDNA variants to enable humans to adapt to different climates. The ROS and reactive metabolic intermediates that are by-products of mitochondrial metabolism are regulated in part by mtDNA and are among the signals that transmit information between mitochondria and the nucleus. These signals can alter nuclear gene expression and, when disrupted, affect a number of cellular processes and metabolic pathways, leading to disease. mtDNA variation influences OA-associated phenotypes, including those related to metabolism, inflammation and even ageing, as well as nuclear epigenetic regulation. This influence also enables the use of specific mtDNA haplogroups as complementary diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of OA.","789":"The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs; also known as myositis) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which a common feature is chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle, leading to muscle weakness. Other organs are frequently affected in IIMs, such as the skin, joints, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and heart, contributing to morbidity and mortality. Currently, IIMs are most often subclassified into polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis, but this subclassification has limitations as these subgroups often have overlapping clinical and histopathological features, and outcomes vary within the subgroups; additionally, subgroups without considerable myopathy are not included. A new way of subgrouping patients could be on the basis of the presence of myositis-specific autoantibodies. These autoantibodies are associated with distinct clinical features and, moreover, can help to identify subsets of IIMs in which extramuscular symptoms, such as skin manifestations, arthritis or interstitial lung disease, might be the presenting or predominant feature when muscle symptoms are mild or absent. The recognition that subphenotypes with single-organ involvement other than muscles exist is important for identifying patients with early disease, for clinical care demanding team management and in designing clinical studies to improve our understanding of this heterogeneous disease to develop new therapies.","790":"","791":"The adult and juvenile myositis syndromes, commonly referred to collectively as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), are systemic autoimmune diseases with the hallmarks of muscle weakness and inflammation. Validated, well-standardized measures to assess disease activity, known as core set measures, were developed by international networks of myositis researchers for use in clinical trials. Composite response criteria using weighted changes in the core set measures of disease activity were developed and validated for adult and juvenile patients with dermatomyositis and adult patients with polymyositis, with different thresholds for minimal, moderate and major improvement in adults and juveniles. Additional measures of muscle strength and function are being validated to improve content validity and sensitivity to change. A health-related quality of life measure, which incorporates patient input, is being developed for adult patients with IIM. Disease state criteria, including criteria for inactive disease and remission, are being used as secondary end points in clinical trials. MRI of muscle and immunological biomarkers are promising approaches to discriminate between disease activity and damage and might provide much-needed objective outcome measures.

The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs, also known as myositis), are fundamentally heterogeneous; many contributory immunological perturbations are involved in the pathogenesis of myositis, leading to varying clinical phenotypic presentations. Targeting any one or several of these deleterious pathways with a therapeutic agent might seem reasonable, but the desired response is not uniformly predictable. The presence of many serious extramuscular manifestations, such as severe skin rash, interstitial lung disease and arthritis, complicates the management of myositis. Myositis is rare, and very few large treatment trial results are available to guide clinicians. Outcome measures to effectively gauge treatment responses have been available for only a few years, and response criteria that incorporate critical core set measures continue to evolve. Nevertheless, a multitude of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents are available to clinicians managing myositis, and the emergence of biologic agents targeting potential pathogenic pathways offers hope for mitigating or curing this enigmatic group of diseases.

Platelets circulate in the blood and are chiefly recognized for their role in the prevention of bleeding and promotion of haemostasis; however, accumulating evidence points to a role for platelets in both adaptive and innate immunity. Through a broad repertoire of receptors, platelets respond promptly to immune complexes, complement and damage-associated molecular patterns, and represent a major reservoir of immunomodulatory molecules in the circulation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that platelets are activated in patients with SLE, and that they could contribute to the circulatory autoantigenic load through the release of microparticles and mitochondrial antigens. Herein, we highlight how platelets contribute to the immune response and review evidence implicating platelets in the pathogenesis of SLE.","801":"Space sojourns are challenging for life. The ability of the human body to adapt to these extreme conditions has been noted since the beginning of human space travel. Skeletal alterations that occur during spaceflight are now better understood owing to tools such as dual-energy X-ray densitometry and high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT, and murine models help researchers to understand cellular and matrix changes that occur in bone and that are difficult to measure in humans. However, questions remain with regard to bone adaptation and osteocyte fate, as well as to interactions of the skeleton with fluid shifts towards the head and with the vascular system. Further investigations into the relationships between the musculoskeletal system, energy metabolism and sensory motor acclimatisation are needed. In this regard, an integrated intervention is required that will address multiple systems simultaneously. Importantly, radiation and isolation-related stresses are gaining increased attention as the prospect of human exploration into deep space draws nearer. Although space is a unique environment, clear parallels exist between the effects of spaceflight, periods of immobilization and ageing, with possibly irreversible features.

Proteinases can also regulate ion flux owing to the cross-sensitization of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V members 1 and 4, which are associated with mechanosensing and pain. In this Review, the idea that proteinases have the potential to orchestrate inflammatory signals by interacting with receptors on cells within the synovial microenvironment of an inflamed joint is revisited in three arthritic diseases: osteoarthritis, spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

It is a dynamic response that expands before the onset of disease and generates antibodies (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)) that are extensively glycosylated in the variable domain. This feature of ACPAs is remarkable and warrants detailed investigation, as it can offer insights into the earliest immunologic mechanisms that lead up to the development of RA. The acquisition of variable domain glycans, in fact, could enable ACPA-expressing B cells to breach tolerance. Although the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, data to support this concept are emerging, owing to the reliable identification and isolation of citrullinated antigen-directed B cells from patients with RA. This technological proficiency also allows for the generation of an increasing number of well-defined monoclonal ACPAs, and provides the opportunity to test and define the mechanisms by which the citrullinated antigen-directed B cell response contributes to the onset and persistence of inflammation. Together with a revised perception of the HLA-risk effect and novel insights into how T cells can govern antibody effector functions, these developments shape an increasingly clear picture of the B cell response to citrullinated antigens in the development of RA.","827":"","828":"","829":"","830":"","831":null,"832":"","833":"","834":"","835":"","836":"","837":"","838":"This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038\/nrrheum.2017.200.","839":"Autoimmune rheumatic diseases pose many problems that have, in general, already been solved in the field of cancer.

Over the past decade, studies in murine models point to the critical role of the lymphatic system in the pathogenesis and therapy of inflammatory-erosive arthritis, presumably by the removal of catabolic factors, cytokines and inflammatory cells from the inflamed synovium. Murine studies demonstrate that lymphatic drainage increases at the onset of inflammatory-erosive arthritis but, as inflammation progresses to a more chronic phase, lymphatic clearance declines and both structural and cellular changes are observed in the draining lymph node. Specifically, chronic damage to the lymphatic vessel from persistent inflammation results in loss of lymphatic vessel contraction followed by lymph node collapse, reduced lymphatic drainage, and ultimately severe synovitis and joint erosion. Notably, clinical pilot studies in patients with RA report lymph node changes following treatment, and thus draining lymphatic vessels and nodes could represent a potential biomarker of arthritis activity and response to therapy.

Connexins are expressed in joint tissues including bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle and the synovium. Indicative of their importance as gap junction components, connexins are also known as gap junction proteins, but individual connexin proteins are gaining recognition for their channel-independent roles, which include scaffolding and signalling functions. Considerable evidence indicates that connexons contribute to the function of bone and muscle, but less is known about the function of connexons in other joint tissues.

Such genetic defects also predispose individuals to recurrent infections (a hallmark of immunodeficiency) and can cause primary immunodeficiencies, which can also lead to immune dysregulation and autoimmunity.

Data on the use of agents blocking TNF, which were among the first biologics introduced into clinical practice, provide ample evidence of primary and secondary treatment inefficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Important issues relevant to primary and secondary failure of these agents in RA include immunogenicity, methodological problems for the detection of antidrug antibodies and trough drug levels, and the implications for treatment strategies. Although there is no strong evidence to support the routine estimation of antidrug antibodies or serum trough levels during anti-TNF therapy, these assessments might be helpful in a few clinical situations; in particular, they might guide decisions on switching the therapeutic biologic in certain instances of secondary clinical failure.","875":"Entheses are the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments to the bone surface and are essential structures for locomotion. Inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) is a key feature of psoriatic arthritis and spondyloarthritis. To date, our conceptual understanding of enthesitis remains limited. This Review provides an insight into the pathophysiology of enthesitis, addressing the role of biomechanics, prostaglandin E2-mediated vasodilation and the activation of innate immune cells in the initiation phase of enthesitis, as well as the role of entheseal IL-23-responsive cells that augment inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-17A, IL-22 and TNF. In addition, the molecular steps that translate inflammation into resident tissue responses, resulting in new bone formation, are discussed. The second part of the article summarizes the clinical features of enthesitis, and the role of clinical and imaging instruments in detecting enthesitis are discussed together with their challenges and limitations. Finally, the Review summarizes the current treatment possibilities for enthesitis based on the aforementioned pathophysiological concepts, focusing on the role of cytokine-blocking agents.","876":"","877":"","878":"","879":"","880":"The role of native (not culture-expanded) joint-resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the repair of joint damage in osteoarthritis (OA) is poorly understood. MSCs differ from bone marrow-residing haematopoietic stem cells in that they are present in multiple niches in the joint, including subchondral bone, cartilage, synovial fluid, synovium and adipose tissue. Research in experimental models suggests that the migration of MSCs adjacent to the joint cavity is crucial for chonodrogenesis during embryogenesis, and also shows that synovium-derived MSCs might be the primary drivers of cartilage repair in adulthood. In this Review, the available data is synthesized to produce a proposed model in which joint-resident MSCs with access to superficial cartilage are key cells in adult cartilage repair and represent important targets for manipulation in 'chondrogenic' OA, especially in the context of biomechanical correction of joints in early disease. Growing evidence links the expression of CD271, a nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor by native bone marrow-resident MSCs to a wider role for neurotrophins in OA pathobiology, the implications of which require exploration since anti-NGF therapy might worsen OA. Recognizing that joint-resident MSCs are comparatively abundant in vivo and occupy multiple niches will enable the optimization of single-stage therapeutic interventions for OA.","881":"Early treatment is associated with improved outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suggesting that a 'window of opportunity', in which the disease is most susceptible to disease-modifying treatment, exists. Autoantibodies and markers of systemic inflammation can be present long before clinical arthritis, and maturation of the immune response seems to coincide with the development of RA. The pre-arthritis phase associated with symptoms such as as joint pain without clinical arthritis (athralgia) is now hypothesized to fall within the aforementioned window of opportunity. Consequently, disease modulation in this phase might prevent the occurrence of clinically apparent arthritis, which would result in a persistent disease course if untreated. Several ongoing proof-of-concept trials are now testing this hypothesis. This Review highlights the importance of adequate risk prediction for the correct design, execution and interpretation of results of these prevention trials, as well as considerations when translating these findings into clinical practice. The patients' perspectives are discussed, and the accuracy with which RA development can be predicted in patients presenting with arthralgia is evaluated. Currently, the best starting position for preventive studies is proposed to be the inclusion of patients with an increased risk of RA, such as those identified as fulfilling the EULAR definition of 'arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA'.","882":"","883":"","884":"","885":"","886":"","887":"","888":"","889":"","890":"","891":"","892":"","893":"Wnt signalling pathways have key roles in joint development, homeostasis and disease, particularly in osteoarthritis. New data is starting to reveal the importance of tightly regulating canonical Wnt signalling pathway activation to maintain homeostasis and health in articular cartilage. In addition to the presence of different Wnt antagonists that limit pathway activation in articular cartilage, the reciprocal crosstalk between the canonical and non-canonical cascades and competitive antagonism between different Wnt ligands seem to be critical in restraining excessive Wnt pathway activation. Changes in transcriptional complex assembly upon Wnt pathway activation, epigenetic modulation of target gene transcription, in particular through histone modifications, and complex interactions between the Wnt signalling pathway and other signalling pathways, are also instrumental in adjusting Wnt signalling. In this Review, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in fine-tuning canonical Wnt signalling in the joint are updated, with a focus on the articular cartilage. The interventions for preventing or treating osteoarthritis are also discussed, which should aim to limit disease-associated excessive canonical Wnt activity to avoid joint damage.","894":"Sequelae frequently seen in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as fatigue, depressed mood, sleep alterations, loss of appetite, muscle wasting, cachectic obesity, bone loss and hypertension, can be the result of energy shortages caused by an overactive immune system. These sequelae can also be found in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases that are in remission and in ageing individuals, despite the immune system being less active in these situations. This Perspectives article proposes a new way of understanding situations of chronic inflammation (such as rheumatic diseases) and ageing based on the principles of evolutionary medicine, energy regulation and neuroendocrine-immune crosstalk. A conceptual framework is provided to enable physicians and scientists to better understand the signs and symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases and long-term disease consequences resulting from physical and mental inactivity.","895":"","896":"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key epigenetic regulators that govern gene expression and influence multiple biological processes.

Ultrasonography and other imaging techniques have been introduced into routine clinical practice and there have been promising reports on the efficacy of biologic agents, particularly IL-6 antagonists such as tocilizumab, in treating these conditions. Along with these developments, which should improve outcomes in patients with GCA and PMR, new questions and unmet needs have emerged; future research should address which pathogenetic mechanisms contribute to the different phases and clinical phenotypes of GCA, what role imaging has in the early diagnosis and monitoring of GCA and PMR, and in which patients and phases of these diseases novel biologic drugs should be used.

According to the 1999 international consensus on ANCA testing, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) should be used to screen for ANCAs, and samples containing ANCAs should then be tested by immunoassays for proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCAs and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs. The distinction between PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs has important clinical and pathogenic implications. As dependable immunoassays for PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs have become broadly available, there is increasing international agreement that high-quality immunoassays are the preferred screening method for the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The present Consensus Statement proposes that high-quality immunoassays can be used as the primary screening method for patients suspected of having the ANCA-associated vaculitides GPA and MPA without the categorical need for IIF, and presents and discusses evidence to support this recommendation.","913":"Over the past decade, awareness of the importance of epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases has grown in parallel with a general recognition of the fundamental role of epigenetics in the regulation of gene expression. Large-scale efforts to generate genome-wide maps of epigenetic modifications in different cell types, as well as in physiological and pathological contexts, illustrate the increasing recognition of the relevance of epigenetics. To date, although several reports have demonstrated the occurrence of epigenetic alterations in a wide range of inflammatory rheumatic conditions, epigenomic information is rarely used in a clinical setting. By contrast, several epigenetic biomarkers and treatments are currently in use for personalized therapies in patients with cancer. This Review highlights advances from the past 5 years in the field of epigenetics and their application to inflammatory rheumatic diseases, delineating the future lines of development for a rational use of epigenetic information in clinical settings and in personalized medicine. These advances include the identification of epipolymorphisms associated with clinical outcomes, DNA methylation as a contributor to disease susceptibility in rheumatic conditions, the discovery of novel epigenetic mechanisms that modulate disease susceptibility and the development of new epigenetic therapies.","914":"","915":"","916":"A loss of humoral tolerance is a hallmark of many autoimmune diseases and the detection of self-reactive antibodies (autoantibodies) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype is widely used as a biomarker and diagnostic tool.

Moreover, while clear evidence exists of the pathogenic effects of autoantibodies in mouse model systems, the contribution of autoantibodies to the pathology of many autoimmune diseases has yet to be established. In this Review, the authors discuss the changes in total serum IgG and autoantibody glycosylation that occur during autoimmune disease and how these changes might help to predict disease development in the future. Furthermore, current knowledge of the signals regulating antibody glycosylation and how individual antibody glycoforms could be used to optimize current treatment approaches will be discussed.","917":"","918":"","919":"","920":"","921":null,"922":"","923":"","924":"","925":null,"926":"","927":"","928":"","929":"","930":"","931":"","932":"Complement activation is associated with common rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic vasculitis.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the complement component C5, is now approved for the treatment of rare conditions involving complement hyperactivation, and the success of this therapy has renewed interest in understanding the utility of complement inhibition in rheumatological practice, particularly for SLE. For example, inhibiting C5 is a potential means of reducing glomerular inflammation in lupus nephritis or treating thrombotic microangiopathy in SLE. The complement system is one of multiple mediators of tissue injury in complex diseases such as SLE, and identifying the disease context in which complement activation has a predominant role is a challenge. An added difficulty in RA is identifying a role for therapeutic complement inhibition within the diverse treatment modalities already available. In this Review, evidence for the therapeutic potential of complement manipulation in rheumatology practice is evaluated.","933":"In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.","934":"","935":"","936":"","937":"","938":"","939":"","940":null,"941":"","942":"","943":"","944":"","945":"","946":"","947":"This corrects the article DOI: 10.1038\/nrrheum.2017.105.","948":"","949":"The main goal of antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) in autoimmune and rheumatic diseases is to reprogramme or remove autoreactive cells and\/or induce immune tolerance to self-antigens. Current therapies in these diseases either treat symptoms or slow down disease progression but are not yet curative or preventative - disease-specific treatments are urgently needed. In contrast to the nonspecific treatments in current use that induce generalized immune suppression, which is associated with several adverse effects including increased risk of infections, ASIs target a restricted subset of B cells or T cells, and thus do not compromise systemic immunity and host defence. This Review provides a summary of novel approaches for identifying autoepitopes and detecting and targeting autoreactive cells that might help in the development of ASIs. Promising approaches include the use of tolerizing peptides coupled to MHC constructs and\/or nanocompounds, tolerizing dendritic cells and antigen-specific vaccines. Following studies in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, several of these strategies have now entered clinical trials. However, to use these approaches in humans, several important limitations must first be addressed, such as; selecting the proper immunodominant autoantigen; identifying the optimal timing, dosing and route of administration; finding biomarkers for monitoring the therapy; and optimizing methodology.","950":"The synovium is the major target tissue of inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis. The study of synovial tissue has advanced considerably throughout the past few decades from arthroplasty and blind needle biopsy to the use of arthroscopic and ultrasonographic technologies that enable easier visualization and improve the reliability of synovial biopsies. Rapid progress has been made in using synovial tissue to study disease pathogenesis, to stratify patients, to discover biomarkers and novel targets, and to validate therapies, and this progress has been facilitated by increasingly diverse and sophisticated analytical and technological approaches. In this Review, we describe these approaches, and summarize how their use in synovial tissue research has improved our understanding of rheumatoid arthritis and identified candidate biomarkers that could be used in disease diagnosis and stratification, as well as in predicting disease course and treatment response.","951":"Family size is reduced among patients with rheumatic diseases. The causes for the low number of children are multifactorial and include impaired sexual function, decreased gonadal function, pregnancy loss, therapy and personal choices. Sexuality contributes to quality of life in patients with rheumatic disease, but is often ignored by health professionals. Both disease-related factors and psychological responses to chronic disease can impair sexual functioning. Toxic effects of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs can induce transient or permanent gonadal failure in women and men. Furthermore, permanent infertility can be a consequence of treatment with cyclophosphamide, whereas transient infertility can be caused by NSAIDs in women and sulfasalazine in men. These adverse effects must be communicated to the patients, and measures to preserve fertility should be initiated before the start of gonadotoxic therapy. Management of patients of both genders should include regular family planning, effective treatment of high disease activity, sexual counselling, and, if necessary, infertility treatment.","952":"","953":"","954":"","955":"","956":"Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals aged 50 years and over. GCA typically affects large and medium-sized arteries, with a predilection for the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. Patients with GCA usually present with symptoms and signs that are directly related to the artery that is affected, with or without constitutional manifestations. The most dreaded complication of GCA is visual loss, which affects about one in six patients and is typically caused by arteritis of the ophthalmic branches of the internal carotid artery. Before the advent of glucocorticoid treatment, the prevalence of visual complications was high. Increasing awareness by physicians of the symptoms of GCA and advances in diagnostic techniques over the past twenty years have also contributed to a substantial decline in the frequency of permanent visual loss. Ischaemic brain lesions are less common than visual lesions, and mostly result from vasculitis of the extradural vertebral or carotid arteries. In the case of both the eye and the brain, ischaemic damage is thought to result from arterial stenosis or occlusion that occurs secondary to the inflammatory process. The inflammatory response at the onset of arteritis, its role as a predictor of complications and the role of traditional cardiovascular risk factors have been extensively investigated in the past decade. In this Review, the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation and current therapeutic approach of GCA-related ischaemic events are discussed, with a particular emphasis on visual loss.","957":"","958":"","959":"","960":"","961":"","962":"","963":"","964":"","965":"","966":"","967":"Rheumatic diseases follow a characteristic anatomical pattern of joint and organ involvement.

The embryonic development of limbs and joints is also relevant to the propensity of certain joints to develop arthritis. Additionally, location-specific homeostasis and disease occurs in skin and blood vessels, thereby extending the concept of site-specificity in human diseases beyond rheumatology. Acknowledging the importance of site-specific parameters increases the complexity of current disease paradigms and brings us closer to understanding why particular disease processes manifest at a particular location.","968":"Progress in rheumatology has been remarkable in the past 70 years, favourably affecting quality of life for people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.

Novel strategies for the use of such agents have also transformed outcomes, as have multidisciplinary nonpharmacological approaches to the management of rheumatic musculoskeletal disease including surgery, physical therapy and occupational therapy. Breakthroughs in our understanding of disease pathogenesis, diagnostics and the use of 'big data' continue to drive the field forward.

One of the roles of IL-6 is to support immunocompetence, defined as the ability of a host to respond to infections. Understanding the precise role of this cytokine in immunocompetence requires a critical appraisal of data derived from both preclinical and clinical studies. Primary immunodeficiency diseases involving IL-6 or its signalling pathways reveal that IL-6 is critical in the defence against numerous types of pathogens. Studies of IL-6 signalling in preclinical models reveal that selective inhibition of either classic IL-6 signalling or IL-6 trans-signalling has differential effects on the host response to different types of infections. Knowledge of such variation might inform bioengineering of new IL-6-targeting molecules and potentially enable modulation of their toxicity. Clinical studies of IL-6 inhibitors, mainly tocilizumab, reveal that their use is associated with an increased rate of both serious and opportunistic infections generally in the range observed with other non-IL-6 directed biologic therapies. Targeting IL-6 has several other important clinical implications related to diagnosis, management and prevention of infectious diseases.","970":"Clinicians have commonly differentiated chronic back pain into two broad subsets: namely, non-inflammatory (or mechanical) back pain and inflammatory back pain. As the terminology suggests, the latter category, in which ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is prominent, presupposes a close link between pain and inflammation. Advances in research into the genetics and immunology of AS have improved our understanding of the inflammatory processes involved in this disease, and have led to the development of potent anti-inflammatory biologic therapeutic agents. However, evidence from clinical trials and from biomarker and imaging studies in patients with AS indicate that pain and inflammation are not always correlated. Thus, the assumption that pain in AS is a reliable surrogate marker for inflammation might be an over-simplification. This Review provides an overview of current concepts relating to neuro-immune interactions in AS and summarizes research that reveals an increasingly complex interplay between the activation of the immune system and pain pathways in the nervous system. The different types of pain experienced by patients with AS, insights from brain imaging studies, neurological mechanisms of pain, sex bias in pain and how the immune system can modify pain in patients with AS are also discussed.","971":"","972":"","973":"","974":"","975":"","976":"The beginning of the 21st century saw a biopharmaceutical revolution in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis.

The past decade has seen great progress in the identification of genetic variants that influence the risk of rheumatic diseases. The challenging task of unravelling the function of these variants is ongoing. In this Review, the major insights from genetic studies, gained from advances in technology, bioinformatics and study design, are discussed in the context of rheumatic disease. In addition, pivotal genetic studies in the main rheumatic diseases are highlighted, with insights into how these studies have changed the way we view these conditions in terms of disease overlap, pathways of disease and potential new therapeutic targets.

ANAs represent key biomarkers in the evaluation of rheumatic diseases, most prominently systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and ANA testing is commonly performed in the clinical setting. In addition, ANA testing is now used to assess eligibility for participation in clinical trials of new therapeutic agents for SLE. ANAs can be assayed by various techniques, with the fluorescent ANA assay often viewed as the gold standard. Whereas a positive ANA test represents a classification criterion for SLE, up to 20-30% of the healthy population, depending on the assay used, is positive for an ANA, complicating the use of this test for diagnosis or the detection of preclinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, ANAs might be expressed in SLE less commonly than often thought.

For several rheumatic diseases, bed rest was traditionally advocated as the best treatment, but several levels of evidence support the imminent paradigm shift from the prescription of bed rest to physical activity in individuals with paediatric rheumatic diseases, in particular juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile fibromyalgia, and juvenile dermatomyositis. Increasing levels of physical activity can alleviate several symptoms experienced by patients with paediatric rheumatic diseases, such as low aerobic fitness, pain, fatigue, muscle weakness and poor health-related quality of life. Moreover, the propensity of patients with paediatric rheumatic diseases to be hypoactive - often due to social self-isolation, overprotection, and fear and\/or ignorance on the part of parents, teachers and health practitioners - can be detrimental to general disease symptoms and function. In support of this rationale, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that the systemic benefits of exercise training clearly outweigh the risks in these diseases.

For example, necrotizing vasculitis associated with hepatitis B virus infection has a different aetiopathogeneis to PAN and is now classified as a separate disease. Additionally, although 'classic' PAN is not an inherited disease, mutations in specific genes, such as ADA2 (also known as CECR1), can result in a necrotizing vasculopathy similar to PAN. The literature also suggests that the course of PAN differs in childhood-onset disease and in cases confined to the skin (so-called cutaneous PAN).

Moreover, an individual's lifestyle choices can greatly influence the progression and manifestation of chronic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In light of these effects, it makes sense that the search for additional therapies to attenuate such diseases would include investigations into lifestyle modifications.

Under adverse microenvironmental conditions, mammalian cells undergo a switch in cell metabolism from a resting regulatory state to a highly metabolically activate state to maintain energy homeostasis. This phenomenon also leads to an increase in metabolic intermediates for the biosynthesis of inflammatory and degradative proteins, which in turn activate key transcription factors and inflammatory signalling pathways involved in catabolic processes, and the persistent perpetuation of drivers of pathogenesis. In the past few years, several studies have demonstrated that metabolism has a key role in inflammatory joint diseases. In particular, metabolism is drastically altered in osteoarthritis (OA) and aberrant immunometabolism may be a key feature of many phenotypes of OA. This Review focuses on aberrant metabolism in the pathogenesis of OA, summarizing the current state of knowledge on the role of impaired metabolism in the cells of the osteoarthritic joint.

Fine tuning immunometabolism to provide the desired response, or prevent a deleterious response, is an attractive alternative to chemotherapy or overt immunosuppression.

Metabolic substrate utilization and integration of cues from energy sensors are critical checkpoints of effector functions in the immune system, with common as well as cell-specific programmes. Patients with SLE and lupus-prone mice present with activated metabolism of CD4+ T cells, and the use of metabolic inhibitors to normalize these features is associated with therapeutic effects. Far less is known about the metabolic requirements of B cells and myeloid cells in SLE. This article reviews current knowledge of the alterations in metabolism of immune cells in patients with SLE and mouse models of lupus in the context of what is known about the metabolic regulation of these cells during normal immune responses. How these alterations might contribute to lupus pathogenesis and how they can be targeted therapeutically are also discussed.","1018":"One of the fundamental traits of immune cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is their ability to proliferate, a property shared with the joint-resident cells that form the synovial pannus. The building of biomass imposes high demands for energy and biosynthetic precursors, implicating metabolic control as a basic disease mechanism. During preclinical RA, when autoreactive T cells expand and immunological tolerance is broken, the main sites of disease are the secondary lymphoid tissues. Naive CD4+ T cells from patients with RA have a distinct metabolic signature, characterized by dampened glycolysis, low ATP levels and enhanced shunting of glucose into the pentose phosphate pathway. Equipped with high levels of NADPH and depleted of intracellular reactive oxygen species, such T cells hyperproliferate and acquire proinflammatory effector functions. During clinical RA, immune cells coexist with stromal cells in the acidic milieu of the inflamed joint. This microenvironment is rich in metabolic intermediates that are released into the extracellular space to shape cell-cell communication and the functional activity of tissue-resident cells. Increasing awareness of how metabolites regulate signalling pathways, guide post-translational modifications and condition the tissue microenvironment will help to connect environmental factors with the pathogenic behaviour of T cells in RA.","1019":"","1020":"","1021":"Immune cells constantly patrol the body via the bloodstream and migrate into multiple tissues where they face variable and sometimes demanding environmental conditions.

As an evolutionary response, immune cells have developed different metabolic programmes to supply them with cellular energy and biomolecules, enabling them to cope with changing and challenging metabolic conditions. In the past 5 years, it has become clear that cellular metabolism affects immune cell function and differentiation, and that disease-specific metabolic configurations might provide an explanation for the dysfunctional immune responses seen in rheumatic diseases. This Review outlines the metabolic challenges faced by immune cells in states of homeostasis and inflammation, as well as the variety of metabolic configurations utilized by immune cells during differentiation and activation.

ACPAs recognize post-translationally modified proteins in which the amino acid arginine has been converted into a citrulline. More recently, other autoantibody systems recognizing post-translationally modified proteins have also gained attention, including autoantibodies recognizing fragmented immunoglobulin (anti-hinge antibodies), autoantibodies recognizing acetylated proteins and autoantibodies recognizing proteins that are modified by adducts formed under oxidative stress. In particular, detailed insights have been obtained on the presence and properties of autoantibodies recognizing carbamylated proteins, commonly called anti-carbamylated protein (anti-CarP) antibodies. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge relating to these emerging autoantibodies that recognize post-translationally modified proteins identified in RA, with an emphasis on anti-CarP antibodies.","1029":"","1030":"","1031":"","1032":"","1033":null,"1034":"","1035":"","1036":"","1037":"","1038":"Tofacitinib is the first Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor commercially approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Specific conditioning regimens are currently used to eradicate the autoreactive immunological memory of patients. Although in vivo immune cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin or anti-CD52 is the norm for many regimens, ex vivo selection of CD34+ stem cells from the graft is controversial. Following the extensive immune depletion associated with serotherapy and chemotherapy, HSCT effectively resets the immune system by renewing the CD4+ T cell compartment, especially the regulatory T cell population. The risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) within the first 100 days should be weighed against the risk of disease-related mortality, and the careful selection and screening of patients before transplantation is essential. Systemic sclerosis is the first autoimmune disease for which HSCT has been shown, in a randomized, controlled trial, to be associated with increased TRM in the first year but a significant long-term, event-free survival benefit afterwards.

At the same time, the strong links between an individual's metabolic and genetic profiles enable the investigation of pathways that underlie changes in metabolite levels. Thus, for the field of metabolomics to yield its full potential, researchers need to take into account the genetic factors underlying the production of metabolites, and the potential role of these metabolites in disease processes.

Emerging data indicate that ILCs not only have protective functions but can also have detrimental effects when dysregulated, leading to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, graft-versus-host disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Elucidation of the cytokine pathways involved in various autoimmune diseases - and the identification of ILCs as potent producers of these cytokines - points towards a potential role for these cellular players in the pathophysiology of these diseases.

Once secreted into the circulation, leptin reaches the central and peripheral nervous systems and acts by binding and activating the long form of leptin receptor (LEPR), regulating appetite and food intake, bone mass, basal metabolism, reproductive function and insulin secretion, among other processes. Research on the regulation of different adipose tissues has provided important insights into the intricate network that links nutrition, metabolism and immune homeostasis. The neuroendocrine and immune systems communicate bi-directionally through common ligands and receptors during stress responses and inflammation, and control cellular immune responses in several pathological situations including immune-inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

In patients with seropositive RA (that is, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies) evidence is accumulating that immunity against post-translationally modified (such as citrullinated) autoantigens might be triggered in mucosal organs, such as the lung, long before the first signs of inflammation are seen in the joints. However, the mechanism by which systemic autoimmunity specifically homes to the joint and bone compartment, thereby triggering inflammation, remains elusive. This Review summarizes potential pathways involved in this joint-homing mechanism, focusing particularly on osteoclasts as the primary targets of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) in the bone and joint compartment. Osteoclasts are dependent on citrullinating enzymes for their normal differentiation and are unique in displaying citrullinated antigens on their cell surface in a non-inflamed state. The binding of ACPAs to osteoclasts releases the chemokine IL-8, leading to bone erosion and pain. This process initiates a chain of events that could lead to attraction and activation of neutrophils, resulting in a complex series of proinflammatory processes in the synovium, eventually leading to RA.","1085":"","1086":"","1087":"","1088":"","1089":"","1090":"","1091":"Rheumatic diseases represent a heterogeneous group of inflammatory conditions, many of which involve chronic activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses by multiple genetic and environmental factors. These immune responses involve the secretion of excessive amounts of cytokines and other signalling mediators by activated immune cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cellular organelle that directs the folding, processing and trafficking of membrane-bound and secreted proteins, including many key components of the immune response. Maintaining homeostasis in the ER is critical to cell function and survival. Consequently, elaborate mechanisms have evolved to sense and respond to ER stress through three main signalling pathways that together comprise the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activation of the UPR can rapidly resolve the accumulation of misfolded proteins, direct permanent changes in the size and function of cells during differentiation, and critically influence the immune response and inflammation. Recognition of the importance of ER stress and UPR signalling pathways in normal and dysregulated immune responses has greatly increased in the past few years.

Owing to technological advances in the past 5 years in diverse MSI strategies, this technology is expected to become a standard tool in clinical practice and provides information complementary to that obtained using existing methods. Given that MSI is able to extract mass-spectral signatures from pathological tissue samples, this technique provides a novel platform to study joint-related tissues affected by rheumatic diseases.

In both sets of recommendations, the heterogeneity of PsA is recognized and the place of various drugs in the therapeutic armamentarium is discussed. Such agents include conventional DMARDs, such as methotrexate, and targeted therapies including biologic agents, such as ustekinumab, secukinumab and TNF inhibitors, or the targeted synthetic drug apremilast. The proposed sequential use of these drugs, as well as some other aspects of PsA management, differ between the two sets of recommendations. This disparity is partly the result of a difference in the evaluation process; the focus of EULAR was primarily rheumatological, whereas that of GRAPPA was balanced between the rheumatological and dermatological aspects of disease.

Adenosine mediates its effects on inflammatory cells by engaging one or more cell-surface receptors. The expression and function of adenosine receptors on different cell types change during the course of rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Targeting adenosine receptors directly for the treatment of rheumatic diseases is currently under study; however, indirect targeting of adenosine receptors by enhancing adenosine levels at inflamed sites accounts for most of the anti-inflammatory effects of methotrexate, the anchor drug for the treatment of RA. In this Review, we discuss the regulation of extracellular adenosine levels and the role of adenosine in regulating the inflammatory and immune responses in rheumatic diseases such as RA, psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis. In addition, adenosine and its receptors are involved in promoting fibrous matrix production in the skin and other organs, and the role of adenosine in fibrosis and fibrosing diseases is also discussed.","1107":"Human genetic studies into rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have uncovered more than 100 genetic loci associated with susceptibility to RA and have refined the RA-association model for HLA variants.

Emerging multi-omics data, high-density genotype data and bioinformatic approaches are enabling researchers to use RA-risk variants to identify functionally relevant cell types and biological pathways that are involved in impaired immune processes and disease phenotypes.

This Review discusses recent findings that support this concept and provides a new conceptual overview of the altered function and distribution of DCs in autoimmune disorders. The discussion will focus on systemic lupus erythematosus - a prototype of a multi-organ disease - as well as rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, pathologies characterized by tissue-specific lesions. Studies on these diseases have revealed common and disease-specific changes in DC distribution and in critical DC functions, such as phagocytosis, cytokine secretion and migration. An improved understanding of the roles of altered DC distribution and\/or disturbed key functions in these autoimmune diseases will pave the way for the development of new therapies aiming at reducing immunogenicity and at enhancing the tolerogenic capacity of DCs.

Importantly, pathogenic B-cell subpopulations function within a network of cellular interactions, many of which might require additional interventions to restore immunologic balance and suppress autoimmune disease. Thus, approaches that simultaneously target innate immune cells as well as multiple nodes of T-cell and B-cell interactions might hold the promise of improved therapeutic efficacy. Interfering with B-cell intracellular signalling pathways, altering their intracellular metabolic pathways and perturbing transcription factors are additional options.

Extracellular alarmins interact with specific receptors expressed by cells that are engaged in host defence to stimulate signalling pathways that result in initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses, triggering inflammation or tissue repair. Alarmins are considered to be markers of destructive processes that occur in degenerative joint diseases (primarily osteoarthritis (OA)) and chronic inflammatory joint diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and spondylarthropathy). In OA, high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and S100 proteins, along with many other alarmins, are abundantly secreted by joint cells, promoting cartilage matrix catabolism, osteophyte formation, angiogenesis and hypertrophic differentiation. The involvement of alarmins in chronic inflammatory arthritides is suggested by their presence in serum at high levels in these conditions, and their expression within inflamed synovia and synovial fluid. S100 proteins, HMGB1, IL-33 and other endogenous molecules have deleterious effects on joints, and can recruit immune cells such as dendritic cells to inflamed synovia, initiating the adaptive immune response and perpetuating disease. Improving our understanding of the pathological mechanisms associated with these danger signals is important to enable the targeting of new therapeutic approaches for arthritis.","1121":"","1122":"","1123":"","1124":"","1125":"","1126":"","1127":"","1128":"The past decade has seen many successes in translational rheumatology, from dramatic improvements in outcomes brought about by novel biologic therapies, to the discovery of new monogenic inflammatory disorders.

Although pathological processes might selectively target a single joint tissue, ultimately all of the components of the osteochondral unit will be affected because of their intimate association, and thus the biological and physical crosstalk among them is of great importance. The development of targeted therapies against the osteoarthritic processes in cartilage or bone will, therefore, require an understanding of the state of these joint tissues at the time of the intervention. Importantly, these interventions will not be successful unless they are applied at the early stages of disease before considerable structural and functional alterations occur in the osteochondral unit.

Innate lymphocytes also seem to be involved in autoimmunity in particular. Since 2010, accumulating evidence clearly shows that different populations of innate lymphocytes have roles in responding to antigen-specific autoantibody and autoreactive T cells, thereby amplifying or attenuating disease processes. Cytotoxicity is a cardinal feature of many innate lymphocytes and can contribute to inflammatory tissue damage. Finally, innate lymphocytes can respond to biologic therapies for autoimmune diseases. Consequently, like TNF and other effector molecules, certain innate lymphocyte subsets might be appropriate therapeutic targets to ameliorate various autoimmune diseases. In this Review, we summarize the main characteristics and functions of innate lymphocyte subsets, and describe their roles in autoimmune disease.

The reported worldwide incidence and prevalence of SLE vary considerably; this variation is probably attributable to a variety of factors, including ethnic and geographic differences in the populations being studied, the definition of SLE applied, and the methods of case identification. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the disease, distinct patterns of disease presentation, severity and course can often be related to differences in ethnicity, income level, education, health insurance status, level of social support and medication compliance, as well as environmental and occupational factors. Given the potential for the disease to cause such severe and widespread organ damage, not only are the attendant direct costs high, but these costs are sometimes exceeded by indirect costs owing to loss of economic productivity.

In light of these remarkable advances in the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms of the death machinery, this Review provides a snapshot of the available evidence implicating death pathways, especially within the phagocyte populations of the innate immune system, in the perpetuation of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Elevated levels of signalling mediators of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis, as well as the autophagy, are observed in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, risk polymorphisms are present in signalling molecules of the extrinsic apoptotic and autophagy death pathways. Although research into the mechanisms underlying these pathways has made considerable progress, this Review highlights areas where further investigation is particularly needed. This exploration is critical, as new discoveries in this field could lead to the development of novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.","1149":"Osteoarthritis (OA) has long been viewed as a degenerative disease of cartilage, but accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation has a critical role in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, we now appreciate that OA pathogenesis involves not only breakdown of cartilage, but also remodelling of the underlying bone, formation of ectopic bone, hypertrophy of the joint capsule, and inflammation of the synovial lining. That is, OA is a disorder of the joint as a whole, with inflammation driving many pathologic changes. The inflammation in OA is distinct from that in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases: it is chronic, comparatively low-grade, and mediated primarily by the innate immune system. Current treatments for OA only control the symptoms, and none has been FDA-approved for the prevention or slowing of disease progression. However, increasing insight into the inflammatory underpinnings of OA holds promise for the development of new, disease-modifying therapies. Indeed, several anti-inflammatory therapies have shown promise in animal models of OA. Further work is needed to identify effective inhibitors of the low-grade inflammation in OA, and to determine whether therapies that target this inflammation can prevent or slow the development and progression of the disease.","1150":"","1151":"The recent success of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy illustrates the importance of the inhibitory receptors cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) in the regulation of antitumour immune responses.

The human genome encodes over 300 inhibitory receptors, which represent as many opportunities to modulate inflammation in a disease-specific and tissue-specific manner. We argue that rheumatologists and oncologists should join forces to study these inhibitory immune molecules. An improved understanding of these immune checkpoints will enable both fields to make progress in exploiting inhibitory immune receptors therapeutically.

Accumulating evidence suggests that ANCA specificity could be better than clinical diagnosis for defining homogeneous groups of patients, as PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are associated with different genetic backgrounds and epidemiology. ANCA specificity affects the phenotype of clinical disease, as well as the patient's initial response to remission-inducing therapy, relapse risk and long-term prognosis.

Alterations to the regulation of autophagy contribute to the progression of various rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Implicit in the progression of these diseases are cell-type-specific responses to surrounding factors that alter autophagy: chondrocytes within articular cartilage show decreased autophagy in OA, leading to rapid cell death and cartilage degeneration; fibroblasts from patients with SSc have restricted autophagy, similar to that seen in aged dermal fibroblasts; fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA joints show altered autophagy, which contributes to synovial hyperplasia; and dysregulation of autophagy in haematopoietic lineage cells alters their function and maturation in SLE. Various upstream mechanisms also contribute to these diseases by regulating autophagy as part of their signalling cascades. In this Review, we discuss the links between autophagy, immune responses, fibrosis and cellular fates as they relate to pathologies associated with rheumatic diseases. Therapies in clinical use, and in preclinical or clinical development, are also discussed in relation to their effects on autophagy in rheumatic diseases.","1186":"","1187":"","1188":"","1189":"The human gut harbours a tremendously diverse and abundant microbial community that correlates with, and even modulates, many health-related processes.

This involvement affects proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes not only at the epithelial level, but also at remote sites such as the joints. Here, we review the role of the gut microbiota in shaping local and systemic immune responses and how disturbances in the host-microorganism interplay can potentially affect the development and progression of rheumatic diseases.

In fact, most advances in the field relate to the functional and metabolic capabilities of these microorganisms and their influence on mucosal immunity and systemic inflammation. An intricate relationship between the microbiome and the diet of the host is now fully recognized, with the microbiota having an important role in the degradation of polysaccharides into active metabolites.

The contribution of CD8(+) T cells to autoimmune arthritis is indicated by the close association of MHC class I polymorphisms with disease risk, as well as the correlation between CD8(+) T-cell phenotype and disease outcome. The heterogeneous phenotype, resistance to regulation and impaired regulatory function of CD8(+) T cells - especially at the target organ - might contribute to the persistence of autoimmune inflammation. Moreover, newly identified populations of tissue-resident CD8(+) T cells and their interaction with antigen-presenting cells might have a key role in disease pathology. In this Review, we assess the link between CD8(+) T cells, autoimmune arthritis and the basis of their homeostatic changes under inflammatory conditions.

This Review focuses on the contributions of the following factors: age-related inflammation (also referred to as 'inflammaging'); cellular senescence (including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)); mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; dysfunction in energy metabolism due to reduced activity of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is associated with reduced autophagy; and alterations in cell signalling due to age-related changes in the extracellular matrix. These various processes contribute to the development of OA by promoting a proinflammatory, catabolic state accompanied by increased susceptibility to cell death that together lead to increased joint tissue destruction and defective repair of damaged matrix. The majority of studies to date have focused on articular cartilage, and it will be important to determine whether similar mechanisms occur in other joint tissues.

Post-rituximab SLE flares that are characterized by high levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA are associated with elevated circulating BAFF (B-cell-activating factor, also known as TNF ligand superfamily member 13B or BLyS) levels, and a high proportion of plasmablasts within the B-cell pool. BAFF not only perpetuates autoreactive B cells (including plasmablasts), particularly when B-cell numbers are low, but also stimulates T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Moreover, plasmablasts and TFH cells promote each others' formation.

The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus has equivalent efficacy to cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil for inducing remission of lupus nephritis. Although rituximab has shown promise in refractory lupus nephritis, combining rituximab with mycophenolate mofetil as initial therapy offers no additional benefit. Considerable interethnic variation is evident in the efficacy and tolerability of the various immunosuppressive regimens, which necessitates individualized treatment and comparison of the efficacy of new regimens across different ethnic groups.

These effects are cell-type-specific, and are elicited in response to stimulation by growth factors, hormones and cytokines, as well as to internal and external metabolic cues. Rapamycin was initially developed as an inhibitor of T-cell proliferation and allograft rejection in the organ transplant setting. Subsequently, its molecular target (mTOR) was identified as a component of two interacting complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that regulate T-cell lineage specification and macrophage differentiation. mTORC1 drives the proinflammatory expansion of T helper (TH) type 1, TH17, and CD4(-)CD8(-) (double-negative, DN) T cells. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibit the development of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T regulatory (TREG) cells and, indirectly, mTORC2 favours the expansion of T follicular helper (TFH) cells which, similarly to DN T cells, promote B-cell activation and autoantibody production. In contrast to this proinflammatory effect of mTORC2, mTORC1 favours, to some extent, an anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization that is protective against infections and tissue inflammation. Outside the immune system, mTORC1 controls fibroblast proliferation and chondrocyte survival, with implications for tissue fibrosis and osteoarthritis, respectively. Rapamycin (which primarily inhibits mTORC1), ATP-competitive, dual mTORC1\/mTORC2 inhibitors and upstream regulators of the mTOR pathway are being developed to treat autoimmune, hyperproliferative and degenerative diseases.

Too often, health-care providers passively await final 'joint death', necessitating knee and hip replacements. Instead, OA should be viewed as a chronic condition, where prevention and early comprehensive-care models are the accepted norm, as is the case with other chronic diseases. Joint injury, obesity and impaired muscle function are modifiable risk factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention strategies. The strategies that are most appropriate for each patient should be identified, by selecting interventions to correct--or at least attenuate--OA risk factors. We must also choose the interventions that are most likely to be acceptable to patients, to maximize adherence to--and persistence with--the regimes. Now is the time to begin the era of personalized prevention for knee OA.","1303":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an immune-mediated arthritis, is the prototypic member of a group of conditions known as spondyloarthropathies that also includes reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and enteropathic arthritis. Patients with these conditions share a clinical predisposition for spinal and pelvic joint dysfunction, as well as genetic associations, notably with HLA-B(*)27. Spondyloarthropathies are characterized by histopathological inflammation in entheses (regions of high mechanical stress where tendons and ligaments insert into bone) and in the subchondral bone marrow, and by abnormal osteoproliferation at involved sites. The association of AS with HLA-B(*)27, first described &gt;40 years ago, led to hope that the cause of the disease would be rapidly established. However, even though many theories have been advanced to explain how HLA-B(*)27 is involved in AS, no consensus about the answers to this question has been reached, and no successful treatments have yet been developed that target HLA-B27 or its functional pathways. Over the past decade, rapid progress has been made in discovering further genetic associations with AS that have shed new light on the aetiopathogenesis of the disease. Some of these discoveries have driven translational ideas, such as the repurposing of therapeutics targeting the cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 and other factors downstream of this pathway. AS provides an excellent example of how hypothesis-free research can lead to major advances in understanding pathogenesis and to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.

Risk factors for allopurinol-related severe adverse reactions include the recent introduction of allopurinol, the presence of the HLA-B(*)58:01 allele, and factors that influence the drug concentration. The interactions between allopurinol, its metabolite, oxypurinol, and T cells have been studied, and evidence exists that the presence of the HLA-B(*)58:01 allele and a high concentration of oxypurinol function synergistically to increase the number of potentially immunogenic-peptide-oxypurinol-HLA-B(*)58:01 complexes on the cell surface, thereby increasing the risk of T-cell sensitization and a subsequent adverse reaction.

However, modern imaging techniques-especially ultrasonography but also conventional CT and dual-energy CT-reveal that MSU crystals form at the cartilage surface as well as inside tendons and ligaments, often at insertion sites. Tophi comprise round white formations of different sizes surrounded by inflammatory tissue. Studies of fibres recovered from gouty synovial fluid indicate that these fibres are likely to be a primary site of crystal formation by templated nucleation, with crystals deposited parallel to the fibres forming transverse bands. In tophi, two areas can be distinguished: one where crystals are formed on cellular tissues and another consisting predominantly of crystals, where secondary nucleation seems to take place; this organization could explain how tophi can grow rapidly. From these observations based on a crystallographic approach, it seems that initial templated nucleation on structural fibres-probably collagen-followed at some sites by secondary nucleation could explain MSU crystal deposition in gout.

The subgroup of PROs included in these core sets is, therefore, undoubtedly important. This Review summarizes the PROs included in core outcome sets developed for use in clinical trials across a wide range of rheumatic diseases. Three PROs are commonly utilized across the majority of rheumatic conditions: pain, physical functioning and the patient global assessment of disease activity.

UV represents the most important environmental factor, and exposure to UV triggers the development of skin lesions in areas where immunoglobulin has been deposited and various other components of the immune system have accumulated. In addition, a number of intracellular kinases and transcription factors have also been demonstrated to be involved in the generation of skin lesions in lupus-prone mice. These molecules can be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors, leading to the prospect that treatments suitable for topical application, and with limited adverse effects, could be developed.

Fibromyalgia and CRPS also seem to share many pathophysiological mechanisms, among which the most important are those involving central effects. Nonetheless, peripheral effects, such as neurogenic neuroinflammation, are also important contributors to the clinical features of each of these disorders. This Review highlights the differing degrees to which neurogenic neuroinflammation might contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of both fibromyalgia and CRPS, and discusses the evidence suggesting that this mechanism is an important link between the two disorders, and could offer novel therapeutic targets.

An increasing number of observations have suggested that cellular stress, in the absence of infection or evident damage, can also induce inflammation. Thus, inflammation can be triggered by exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)-so-called classic inflammation-or by endogenous stress resulting from tissue or cellular dysfunction. External triggers and cellular stress activate the same molecular pathways, possibly explaining why classic and stress-induced inflammation have similar clinical manifestations. In some systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs), inflammatory cells exhibit reduction-oxidation (redox) distress, having high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promote proinflammatory cytokine production and contribute to the subversion of mechanisms that self-limit inflammation. Thus, SAIDs can be viewed as a paradigm of stress-related inflammation, being characterized by recurrent flares or chronic inflammation (with no recognizable external triggers) and by a failure to downmodulate this inflammation. Here, we review SAID pathophysiology, focusing on the major cytokines and DAMPs, and on the key roles of redox distress.

The available data have shown that the molecular steps in cartilage matrix breakdown overlap in OA and RA. However, they have also, to a great extent, changed our view of the roles of cartilage in the pathogenesis of these disorders. In OA, cartilage loss occurs as part of a complex programme that resembles aspects of embryonic bone formation through endochondral ossification. In RA, early cartilage damage is a key trigger of cellular reactions in the synovium. In a proposed model of RA as a site-specific manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disorder, early cartilage damage in the context of immune activation leads to a specific cellular response within articular joints that could explain not only the organ specificity of RA, but also the chronic nature and perpetuation of the disease.

In this comprehensive Review, data from epidemiological studies from diverse regions of the world are synthesized to depict the geographic variation in gout prevalence and incidence. Key advances in the understanding of factors associated with increased risk of gout are also summarized. The collected data indicate that the distribution of gout is uneven across the globe, with prevalence being highest in Pacific countries. Developed countries tend to have a higher burden of gout than developing countries, and seem to have increasing prevalence and incidence of the disease.

In other words, for a subset of patients the course of management is unclear. Some examples are patients with 'seronegative' APS, those who do not fulfil the formal (clinical or serological) classification criteria for definite APS, and those with recurrent thrombotic events despite optimal anticoagulation.

The study of IL-1 and IL-6 in this context led to novel therapies by forward translation. Conversely, effective treatment of sJIA and TRAPS with IL-1 blockade stimulated reverse translational efforts to study the pathophysiology of these cytokines in autoinflammatory diseases. These translational efforts led to the discovery of biomarkers such as S100 proteins, IL-18 or serum amyloid A, which are components of the inflammatory process, support diagnosis and allow for monitoring of disease activity, helping to predict patient outcomes.

Several pharmacologic strategies can modulate hedgehog signalling, and targeting this pathway could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

Cells and cytokines implicated in RA pathogenesis are also involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which is generally recognized as an inflammatory condition. The two diseases also share genetic and environmental risk factors, which suggests that patients who develop RA might also be predisposed to developing cardiovascular disease. In RA, inflammation and atherosclerosis are closely linked. Inflammation mediates its effects on atherosclerosis both through modulation of traditional risk factors and by directly affecting the vessel wall. Treatments such as TNF inhibitors might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk. However, whether this benefit is attributable to effective control of inflammation or whether targeting specific cytokines, implicated in atherosclerosis, provides additional risk reduction is unclear.

As no animal model recapitulates all the features of JIA-associated uveitis, questions remain regarding its pathogenesis. The most common form of JIA-associated uveitis is chronic anterior uveitis, which is usually asymptomatic initially. Effective screening is, therefore, essential to detect early disease and commence treatment before the development of visually disabling complications, such as cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy and cystoid macular oedema. Complications can result from uncontrolled intraocular inflammation as well as from its treatment, particularly prolonged use of high-dose topical corticosteroids. Accumulating evidence supports the early introduction of systemic immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, as steroid-sparing agents. Prospective randomized controlled trials of TNF inhibitors and other biologic therapies are underway or planned.

Autoantibody-mediated damage of fetal conduction tissues causes inflammation and fibrosis and leads to blockage of signal conduction at the atrioventricular (AV) node. Irreversible complete AV block is the principal cardiac manifestation of CHB, although some babies might develop other severe cardiac complications, such as endocardial fibroelastosis or valvular insufficiency, even in the absence of cardiac block. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology, classification and management of women whose pregnancies are affected by autoimmune CHB, with a particular focus on the autoantibodies associated with autoimmune CHB and how we should test for these antibodies and diagnose this disease.

In an active-comparator study, the drug of interest is compared with another agent commonly used for the same indication, rather than with no treatment (a 'non-user' group). This principle helps to ensure that treatment groups have similar treatment indications, attenuating both measured and unmeasured differences in patient characteristics.

Importantly, dysregulation of this balance can result in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). By further developing our understanding of how, where and when cells interact during immune responses, we can further dissect these events to assess how cell interactions might be aberrant in autoimmunity.

Chronobiological principles imply that tailoring the timing of treatments to the circadian rhythm of individual patients (chronotherapy) could optimize results. Trials of NSAID or methotrexate chronotherapy for patients with RA suggest such an approach can improve outcomes and reduce adverse effects. The most compelling evidence for RA chronotherapy, however, is that coordinating the timing of glucocorticoid therapy to coincide with the nocturnal increase in blood IL-6 levels results in reduced morning stiffness and pain compared with the same glucocorticoid dose taken in the morning. Aside from optimizing relief of the core symptoms of RA, chronotherapy might also relieve important comorbid conditions such as depression and sleep disturbances. Surprisingly, chronobiology is not mentioned in official guidelines for conducting RA drug registration trials.

In many cases, healing is imperfect, which leads to chronic impairment. Gene transfer might improve repair and regeneration at sites of injury by enabling the local, sustained and potentially regulated expression of therapeutic gene products; such products include morphogens, growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents. Proteins produced endogenously as a result of gene transfer are nascent molecules that have undergone post-translational modification. In addition, gene transfer offers particular advantages for the delivery of products with an intracellular site of action, such as transcription factors and noncoding RNAs, and proteins that need to be inserted into a cell compartment, such as a membrane. Transgenes can be delivered by viral or nonviral vectors via in vivo or ex vivo protocols using progenitor or differentiated cells. The first gene transfer clinical trials for osteoarthritis and cartilage repair have already been completed. Various bone-healing protocols are at an advanced stage of development, including studies with large animals that could lead to human trials. Other applications in the repair and regeneration of skeletal muscle, intervertebral disc, meniscus, ligament and tendon are in preclinical development.

Scaffolds must provide a balance of shape, biomechanical function and biocompatibility in order to achieve tissue replacement success. Different tissues can have different requirements for success, which has led to the development of various materials with unique characteristics. Articular cartilage scaffolds have the most robust clinical experience, with many scaffolds, mostly constructed of natural materials, showing promise, but levels of success vary. Tendon scaffolds also have proven clinical applications, with human-dermis-derived scaffolds showing the most potential. Synthetic and naturally derived meniscus scaffolds have been investigated in few clinical studies, but the results are encouraging. Bone scaffolds are limited to amorphous pastes and putties, owing to difficulties achieving adequate vascularization and biomechanical optimization. The complex physiological function and vascular demands of skeletal muscle have limited the widespread clinical use of scaffolds for engineering this tissue.

Another challenge is the question of how long therapy should be continued once the treatment target, which should be remission or at least a state of low disease activity, has been reached. The data available suggest that, in most patients with established disease, cessation of biologic therapy will be followed by disease flares, whereas a reduction of dose or an increase in the interval between doses enables maintenance of treatment success. Induction therapy very early in the disease course followed by withdrawal of the biologic agent might also be a feasible approach to attain sustained good outcomes, but currently available data are not strong enough to allow for such a conclusion to be reached.

The growing number of effective drugs has led to successful treatment and prevention of long-term sequelae in most patients. Although patients with JIA frequently achieve lasting clinical remission, sustained remission off medication is still elusive for most. Treatment approaches vary substantially among paediatric rheumatologists owing to the inherent heterogeneity of JIA and, until recently, to the lack of accepted and well-evidenced guidelines. Furthermore, many pertinent questions related to patient management remain unanswered, in particular regarding treatment targets, and selection, intensity and sequence of initiation or withdrawal of therapy. Existing JIA guidelines and recommendations do not specify treat-to-target or tight control strategies, in contrast to adult rheumatology in which these approaches have been successful. The concepts of window of opportunity (early treatment to improve long-term outcomes) and immunological remission (abrogation of subclinical disease activity) are also fundamental when defining treatment methodologies.

We then emphasize the potential benefit of urate-lowering therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with hyperuricaemia. The mechanisms that link elevated serum uric acid levels and gout with these comorbidities seem to be multifactorial, implicating low-grade systemic inflammation and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, as well as the deleterious effects of hyperuricaemia itself. Patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia should be treated by nonpharmacological means to lower their SUA levels. In patients with gout, long-term pharmacological inhibition of XO is a treatment strategy that might also reduce cardiovascular and renal comorbidities, because of its dual effect of lowering SUA levels as well as reducing free-radical production during uric acid formation.","1487":"IL-6 has been linked to numerous diseases associated with inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis and several types of cancer. Moreover, IL-6 is important in the induction of hepatic acute-phase proteins for the trafficking of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, the differentiation of adaptive T-cell responses, and tissue regeneration and homeostatic regulation. Studies have investigated IL-6 biology using cell-bound IL-6 receptors expressed predominantly on hepatocytes and certain haematopoietic cells versus activation mediated by IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptors via a second protein, gp130, which is expressed throughout the body. Advances in this research elucidating the differential effects of IL-6 activation provide important insights into the role of IL-6 in health and disease, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target. Knowledge of the basic biology of IL-6 and its signalling pathways can better inform both the research agenda for IL-6-based targeted therapies as well as the clinical use of strategies affecting IL-6-mediated inflammation. This Review covers novel, emerging aspects of the biology of IL-6, which might lead to more specific blockade of IL-6 signalling without compromising the protective function of this cytokine in the body's defence against infections.

This places great responsibility on rheumatologists in diagnosing malignancies and referring the patient for effective treatment. The selective influence of tumours on musculoskeletal tissue is surprising and indicates that tumours alter tissues such as the periosteum, synovial membrane, subcutaneous connective tissue, fascia, muscles and bones by specific molecular processes.

Although some AEs are a direct consequence of the functional inhibition of biologic-agent-targeted antigens, the pathogenesis of other AEs results from a drug-induced imbalance of the immune system, intermediary factors and cofactors, a complexity that complicates their prediction. Herein, we review the AEs associated with biologic therapy most relevant to rheumatic and immunological diseases, and discuss their underlying pathogenesis.

A considerable proportion of children experience therapeutic inefficacy or substantial adverse effects, or both, but a lack of reliable clinical indicators and biomarkers to predict treatment response prevents optimization of existing therapies. The identification of valid candidate gene variants involved in the pathways of methotrexate and etanercept, the most commonly used medications in JIA, has seen little success to date. The limited success of these studies is possibly due to the presence of confounding variables in the study populations, the heterogeneity of outcome parameters used to determine treatment response and the small number of candidate gene variants analysed. The first genome-wide pharmacogenetic study in JIA has identified gene regions of particular biological interest, but these findings require validation. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms as well as ontogeny processes might be additional factors influencing drug responses. Access to large, well-documented JIA cohorts and the rapid development of advanced genome analytics is ushering in a personalized approach to treatment. The discovery of new pharmacogenomic biomarkers and systems pathways can provide new drug targets and predictive tools for improved drug response and fewer adverse drug reactions in JIA.","1494":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially active disease, is associated with considerable changes in body composition, lipids, adipokines and insulin sensitivity. Metabolic changes, such as increased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, occur even in preclinical RA. Active RA is associated with decreased lipid levels, BMI, fat and muscle mass, as well as altered lipid profiles. Some of these changes are also seen in metabolic syndrome, and could increase cardiovascular mortality. Importantly, the systemic inflammation underlying RA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This Perspectives article summarizes data on the associations of various components of metabolic syndrome with RA, and discusses the effects of biologic therapy on these factors.

A particular emphasis is on the possibility that pathogenic immune reactions might be initiated at other sites than the joints, and that the lungs could harbour such sites. New data strengthen this concept, showing that local immunity towards citrullinated proteins and accompanying inflammation might be present in the lungs early during disease development.

Clinical and experimental evidence supports a pathogenesis that is driven by ANCA-induced activation of neutrophils and monocytes, producing destructive necrotizing vascular and extravascular inflammation. Pathogenic ANCAs can originate from precursor natural autoantibodies. Pathogenic transformation might be initiated by commensal or pathogenic microbes, legal or illegal drugs, exogenous or endogenous autoantigen complementary peptides, or dysregulated autoantigen expression. The ANCA autoimmune response is facilitated by insufficient T-cell and B-cell regulation. A putative pathogenic mechanism for vascular inflammation begins with ANCA-induced activation of primed neutrophils and monocytes leading to activation of the alternative complement pathway, which sets in motion an inflammatory amplification loop in the vessel wall that attracts and activates neutrophils with resultant respiratory burst, degranulation, extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps, apoptosis and necrosis. The pathogenesis of extravascular granulomatosis is less clear, but a feasible scenario proposes that a prodromal infectious or allergic condition positions primed neutrophils in extravascular tissue in which they can be activated by ANCAs in interstitial fluid to produce extravascular necrotizing injury that would initiate an innate granulomatous inflammatory response to wall off the necrotic debris.

Whereas numerous studies have demonstrated an association between the presence of eosinophils and markers of eosinophil activation in the blood and tissues of patients with EGPA, the precise role of eosinophils in disease pathogenesis has been difficult to ascertain owing to the complexity of the disease process. In this regard, results of clinical trials using novel agents that specifically target eosinophils are providing the first direct evidence of a central role of eosinophils in EGPA.

Patients with PsA are more likely than healthy individuals to have metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease. To include these comorbidities, 'psoriatic disease' has been suggested as an umbrella term. The management of PsA has changed tremendously over the past decade owing to early diagnosis and improvement in treatment strategies, including, early referral from dermatologists and primary-care physicians to rheumatologists, early initiation of therapy, treating to the target of remission or low disease activity, and advances in pharmacological therapy. Outcome assessment is also improving, because of validated instruments for clinical disease manifestations. The commercialization of TNF blockers, including adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab, is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA. A new anti-TNF agent, certolizumab pegol, and a fully human monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23, ustekinumab, are approved for the treatment of active PsA. The efficacy of ustekinumab suggests that inhibiting the type 17 T helper pathway might be an alternative to blocking TNF.

In animal models of rheumatic disease, autoimmune responses can be controlled by re-establishing the T-cell balance in favour of TREG cells. Here we discuss three potential strategies for the clinical use of TREG cells to treat autoimmune rheumatic disease: expansion of self-antigen-specific natural TREG cells in vivo; propagation of antigen-specific natural TREG cells ex vivo, by in vitro antigenic stimulation, and subsequent transfer back into the host; or conversion of antigen-specific conventional T cells into TREG cells in vivo or ex vivo. These strategies require depletion of the effector T cells that mediate autoimmunity before initiating TREG-cell-based therapies. Immunotherapies that target TREG cells, and the balance of TREG cells and autoreactive T cells, are therefore an important modality for the treatment of autoimmune rheumatic disease.

The clinical approach to the management of the patient with AAV should include testing for ANCA specificity; proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific ANCAs are most often associated with GPA, whereas myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are usually associated with MPA. Also important to the management of AAV is an assessment of the disease stage and severity, to enable tailored treatment based on an algorithm derived from controlled-trial data. Remaining questions pertain to the dosage and duration of corticosteroid treatment, the selection of patients for, and duration of, maintenance treatment after induction of remission, and the identification of safer and more effective therapies than are currently in use. Outcome measures should assess not only disease activity, but also damage and quality of life.

In recent years, this focus has evolved to include noncommunicable chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus but is novel in rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In order to prevent RA, the 'at-risk' populations need to be defined. To date, a number of studies have attempted to clarify our understanding of these cohorts and how they could be identified. Suggested terminology has now been published to define individuals who might go on to develop RA. This Review considers categories of these 'at-risk' individuals, with a focus on those with systemic autoimmunity. Trials in very early RA demonstrate that disease outcomes can be reduced with early intervention. These principles are widely accepted in other diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, in which steps have been taken to prevent disease in genetically predisposed individuals.

As clinicians, we distinguish one form of vasculitis from another on the basis of observed patterns of organ injury, the size of the vessels affected and histopathological findings. The terms 'small-vessel', 'medium-vessel' and 'large-vessel' vasculitis are useful clinical descriptors, but fail to inform us about why vessels of a certain calibre are favoured by one disease and not another. Classification based on vessel size also fails to consider that vessels of a specific calibre are not equally prone to injury. Distinct vulnerabilities undoubtedly relate to the fact that same-size vessels in different tissues may not be identical conduits. In fact, vessels become specialized, from the earliest stages of embryonic development, to suit the needs of different anatomical locations. Vessels of the same calibre in different locations and organs are as different as the organ parenchymal cells through which they travel. The dialogue between developing vessels and the tissues they perfuse is designed to meet special local needs. Added to the story of vascular diversity and vulnerability are changes that occur during growth, development and ageing. An improved understanding of the unique territorial vulnerabilities of vessels could form the basis of new hypotheses for the aetiopathogenesis of the vasculitides.

Neutrophils also contribute to the cytokine and chemokine cascades that accompany inflammation, and regulate immune responses via cell-cell interactions. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils also have a previously unrecognised role in autoimmune diseases: neutrophils can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) containing chromatin associated with granule enzymes, which not only kill extracellular microorganisms but also provide a source of autoantigens. For example, citrullinated proteins that can act as neoepitopes in loss of immune tolerance are generated by peptidylarginine deiminases, which replace arginine with citrulline residues, within neutrophils. Indeed, antibodies to citrullinated proteins can be detected before the onset of symptoms in patients with RA, and are predictive of erosive disease. Neutrophils from patients with RA have an increased tendency to form NETs containing citrullinated proteins, and sera from such patients contain autoantibodies that recognize these proteins. Thus, in addition to their cytotoxic and immunoregulatory role in RA, neutrophils may be a source of the autoantigens that drive the autoimmune processes underlying this disease.

In vitro and animal studies using this approach have had some success, but whether this success can be reproduced in degenerate human lumbar discs is unknown. Successful repair requires that the disc cells remain viable and active; they therefore need an adequate supply of nutrients. However, as the disc degenerates, the nutrient supply decreases, thereby limiting cell activity and viability. Current biologic approaches might place additional demands on an already precarious nutrient supply. Here, we discuss whether the loss of nutrients associated with disc degeneration limits the effectiveness of biologic approaches, and indicate that this neglected problem requires investigation if clinical application of such therapies is to succeed.

These approaches include placebo analgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, hidden administration of analgesics, and the manipulation of the pain-reward relationship. Overall, these studies show that different neurochemical systems are activated in different positive and negative contexts. Moreover, pain can activate reward mechanisms when experienced within contexts that have special positive meaning. Because routine medical practice usually takes place in contexts that use different rituals, these neurobiological insights might have profound clinical implications.","1577":"Understanding the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is complex, multiple genes and environmental factors are involved.

In addition to a possible role in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory conditions, such as infections and autoimmune diseases, EVs, including microvesicles (also known as microparticles), exosomes and apoptotic vesicles, have therapeutic potential and might be used as biomarkers for inflammatory diseases. Therefore, molecular diagnostics and targeted therapy could benefit from expanding knowledge in the field. In this Review, we summarize important developments and propose that extracellular vesicles could be used as therapeutic vehicles and as targets for the treatment and prevention of inflammatory diseases.

Eicosanoids form one of the most complex networks in the body controlling many physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. Persisting eicosanoid pathways are thought to be involved in the development of rheumatic diseases, and targeting this pathway might enable improved treatment strategies. Several enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade as well as eicosanoid receptors (all part of the eicosanoid pathway) are today well-recognized targets for anti-inflammatory drugs that can reduce symptoms of inflammation in rheumatic diseases. In this Review, we outline the evidence supporting pivotal roles of eicosanoid signalling in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases and discuss findings from studies in animals and humans. We focus first on rheumatoid arthritis and discuss the upregulation of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways as most data are available in this condition. Research into the roles of eicosanoids in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic lupus erythematosus and gout) is also progressing rapidly and is discussed. Finally, we summarize the prospects of targeting eicosanoid pathways as anti-inflammatory treatment strategies for patients with rheumatic diseases.

Approximately one-third of all neuropsychiatric syndromes in patients with SLE are primary manifestations of SLE-related autoimmunity, with seizure disorders, cerebrovascular disease, acute confusional state and neuropathy being the most common. Such primary neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) events are a consequence either of microvasculopathy and thrombosis, or of autoantibodies and inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis of NPSLE requires the exclusion of other causes, and clinical assessment directs the selection of appropriate investigations. These investigations include measurement of autoantibodies, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, electrophysiological studies, neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging to evaluate brain structure and function. Treatment involves the management of comorbidities contributing to the neuropsychiatric event, use of symptomatic therapies, and more specific interventions with either anticoagulation or immunosuppressive agents, depending upon the primary immunopathogenetic mechanism. Although the prognosis is variable, studies suggest a more favourable outcome for primary NPSLE manifestations compared with neuropsychiatric events attributable to non-SLE causes.

Numerous genetic and environmental risk factors for ARDs have also been identified, and many of these factors are likely to act before the clinical appearance of tissue injury to initiate and\/or propagate autoimmunity and autoimmune disease. Thus, biomarkers representative of these autoimmune processes could potentially be used in conjunction with other clinical parameters during the preclinical period of ARDs to predict the future development of clinically apparent disease. This Review focuses on the preclinical stages of RA and SLE, as our current understanding of these diseases can be used to present an overall model of the development of ARDs that might ultimately be used to develop screening programmes and preventive strategies. Important considerations for the future development of such approaches, in particular, the issues that require additional research and how they might be addressed, are also discussed. ","1589":"","1590":"Pain is the most common symptom of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and is arguably a more important factor in disability than the progression of the disease itself. Studies have highlighted the extent of this pain and its persistence in some young patients despite effective disease control. Understanding and effective management of pain in JIA is limited, and improved diagnosis and treatment would benefit from increased knowledge of the mechanisms underlying pain in childhood. This Review focuses upon the developmental neurobiology of pain, reviewing studies in animal models that increase clinical understanding and inform treatment of the painful manifestations of JIA. Pain processing in the juvenile nervous system differs from that in adults: nociceptive thresholds are lower and endogenous pain control systems are slow to mature. Furthermore, increasing evidence points to tissue injury in childhood having prolonged effects upon the developing pain system. Injury, inflammation and stress in early life can 'prime' peripheral nociceptors and central pain circuits, such that the pain associated with tissue inflammation is exacerbated in later life. A developmental, mechanism-based approach towards developing novel targets for the treatment of pain in JIA might therefore benefit the patient both as a child and as an adult if the disease recurs or persists.","1591":"","1592":"The prognosis for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were diagnosed in the years since 2010 is much better than for individuals who were diagnosed with the disease 20 years ago.

Nonetheless, current treatment strategies remain population-based, rather than individualized. Decision-making processes relevant to the provision of individualized treatment require appropriate prognostication with regard to a number of variables. Here, the methods available to evaluate the performance of predictive models are discussed. In addition, I highlight the advances in risk estimation that have been made concerning three treatment decisions relevant to the management of RA that are made daily in the clinic: when to initiate treatment with DMARDs in patients in the early stages of arthritis; the ideal intensity of initial treatment; and the likely responsiveness of the patient to a particular therapy.

In this context, arachidonic acid metabolites, such as the prostaglandin and leukotriene subfamilies, are of interest because they contribute to immune and nonimmune processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that prostaglandins and leukotrienes are involved in causing muscular pain and inflammation, and also in myogenesis and the repair of muscles. In this Review, we summarize novel findings that implicate prostaglandins and leukotrienes in the muscle atrophy and weakness that occur in inflammatory diseases of the muscles, with a focus on inflammatory myopathies.

For pharmacological management, more high-quality trials are needed, although evidence is available for short-term symptom alleviation of pain by topical and oral NSAIDs. The role of anti-inflammatory medication, such as corticosteroids and biologic agents, is controversial, and the same holds true for the efficacy of symptomatic slow acting drugs for OA.

Animal models of arthritis are superb experimental tools in demonstrating how T cells trigger joint inflammation, and thus can help to further our knowledge of disease mechanisms and potential therapies. In this Review, we discuss the similarities and differences in T-cell subsets and functions between RA and mouse arthritis models. For example, various T-cell subsets are involved in both human and mouse arthritis, but differences might exist in the cytokine regulation and plasticity of these cells. With regard to joint-homing T cells, an abundance of synovial T cells is present in humans compared with mice. On the other hand, local expansion of type 17 T-helper (TH17) cells is observed in some animal models, but not in RA. Finally, whereas T-cell depletion therapy essentially failed in RA, antibody targeting of T cells can work, at least preventatively, in most arthritis models.

Early case reports of serious respiratory adverse events (SRAEs) following treatment with anti-TNF agents have led to concerns about biologic therapy in patients with RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD), and a tendency for biologic agents targeting factors other than TNF to be prescribed in such patients. At present, the appropriateness of such decisions is not clear. Given that the therapeutic goal for RA is remission, clinicians increasingly face the challenge of choosing the optimal biologic agent in patients with RA-ILD and uncontrolled joint disease. However, no evidence-based guidelines exist to guide physicians in deciding whether to commence biologic therapy in this setting, or in selecting which drug is most appropriate. Herein, we review the evidence for the comparative pulmonary safety of anti-TNF agents and non-TNF-targeting biologic agents in RA-ILD.

This lack of reliability might be responsible for wrong or missed diagnoses, as well as additional costs due to assay repetition, unnecessary use of confirmatory tests and\/or consequent diagnostic investigations. To overcome such issues, the standardization of autoantibody testing requires efforts on all aspects of the assays, including the definition of the analyte, the pre-analytical stages, the calibration method and the reporting of results. As part of such efforts, the availability of suitable reference materials for calibration and quality control would enable the development of a reliable reference system. Strong-positive sera from patients have been used as reference materials in most of the autoantibody assays for rheumatic diseases; however, antigen-affinity-purified immunoglobulin fractions or in some cases reliable monoclonal antibody preparations offer more adequate tools for standardization.

Logistical and conceptual problems, however, beset this attractive therapeutic approach, including difficulties with ex vivo expansion of cells, specificity of targeting and the optimal time point of administration. Therefore, alternative avenues are being investigated, such as targeting B-cell effector functions and newly identified proinflammatory cytokines.

Mitochondrial dysfunction in T cells promotes the release of highly diffusible inflammatory lipid hydroperoxides, which spread oxidative stress to other intracellular organelles and through the bloodstream. Oxidative modification of self antigens triggers autoimmunity, and the degree of such modification of serum proteins shows striking correlation with disease activity and organ damage in SLE. In T cells from patients with SLE and animal models of the disease, glutathione, the main intracellular antioxidant, is depleted and serine\/threonine-protein kinase mTOR undergoes redox-dependent activation. In turn, reversal of glutathione depletion by application of its amino acid precursor, N-acetylcysteine, improves disease activity in lupus-prone mice; pilot studies in patients with SLE have yielded positive results that warrant further research. Blocking mTOR activation in T cells could conceivably provide a well-tolerated and inexpensive alternative approach to B-cell blockade and traditional immunosuppressive treatments. Nevertheless, compartmentalized oxidative stress in self-reactive T cells, B cells and phagocytic cells might serve to limit autoimmunity and its inhibition could be detrimental.

The multiple possible diagnoses associated with this symptom make correctly attributing back pain to a specific disease difficult. This dilemma necessitates an organized approach to separate patients with mechanical disorders from those with rare systemic disorders. The most common forms of back pain are mechanical. Gradual modifications in the axial skeletal structures over time result in pathological disorders that generally occur later in an individual's lifespan. The diagnostic process that identifies these mechanical disorders is straightforward and does not require expensive radiological or laboratory tests in the early phases of the evaluation. Most low back pain resolves without intervention, but some reports suggest that episodes of back pain are persistent or recurring for a substantial minority of patients. Therapies for back pain can be nonpharmacological, pharmacological or surgical. All interventions have limited capacity to resolve low back pain.

In rheumatic diseases, biologic agents have now been studied in more than 200 randomized clinical trials and over 100 subsequent meta-analyses; however, the information obtained does not always meet the needs of patients and clinicians. In this Review, we discuss the current issues concerning the evidence derived from such studies: potential biases favouring positive results; a paucity of head-to-head comparisons between biologically active agents; overwhelming involvement of manufacturer sponsors in trials and in the synthesis of the evidence; the preference for trials with limited follow-up; and the potential for spurious findings on adverse events, leading to endless debates about malignancy risk. We debate the responsibilities of regulatory authorities, the pharmaceutical industry and academia in attempting to solve these shortcomings and challenges. We propose that improvements in the evidence regarding biologic treatments that are continually being added to the therapeutic armamentarium for rheumatic diseases might require revisiting the design and conduct of studies. For example, trials with long-term follow-up that are independent of the pharmaceutical industry, head-to-head comparisons of therapeutic agents and the use of rigorous clinical outcomes should be considered, and public availability of raw data endorsed.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, glucocorticoids are widely and persistently used to treat a large number of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), despite the well-described adverse effects of these drugs. Annexin A1 is a glucocorticoid-induced molecule that is known to replicate many of the described anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. In addition to the well-documented roles of this protein in neutrophil function, emerging evidence suggests that annexin A1 is involved in the modulation of T-cell function and the adaptive immune responses relevant to RA. Interest in annexin A1 was renewed after the delineation of the receptors for this protein. This breakthrough also led to advances in our understanding of anti-inflammatory annexin A1 mimetic peptides and agonistic compounds targeting these receptors, particularly those specific for the receptor N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). Herein, we review the current knowledge of the biological activities of annexin A1 and their relevance to RA pathogenesis. We also discuss the potential of annexin A1 mimics and strategies aimed at potentiating annexin A1 signalling to become viable approaches to minimizing glucocorticoid use in RA and other inflammatory disorders.","1670":"Genetic studies have revealed that most loci associated with osteoarthritis (OA) show ethnic stratification, with limited overlap between Asian and European populations. Consequently, such studies have often focused on particular ethnic groups, with those performed in European cohorts yielding the most replicated associations. As for other common diseases, the OA susceptibility loci mapped to date account for only a fraction of disease heritability. Nevertheless, analysis of these loci could identify biological pathways related to OA pathogenesis. Such an approach is taken in this Review and provides valuable insights into OA aetiology. For example, several of the loci associated with OA contain genes encoding key regulators of skeletogenesis and endochondral ossification. Furthermore, direct and indirect regulation of gene transcription is highlighted as an important factor in this disease. Interestingly, genes encoding structural proteins of the cartilage extracellular matrix do not seem to be a repository for OA susceptibility. Therefore, susceptibility might operate at a regulatory rather than a structural level, which is a potentially promising finding, as the activities of regulators are amenable to therapeutic modulation. Greater clarity will emerge as more association signals are identified; nonetheless, patterns of aetiology are clearly discernible, from a molecular perspective, even with the relatively small number currently available.

Two subtypes have been described: pincer impingement, caused by an overcovered acetabulum; and cam impingement, which occurs as a result of an aspherical femoral head (cam abnormality). A strong correlation exists between cam impingement and the subsequent development of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Major cam abnormalities confer a high risk of OA. However, the association between cam abnormalities and the pathology of OA has been difficult to compare between studies, as different methods have been used to define the abnormality. Cam abnormalities are acquired during skeletal growth and could be influenced by high impact sporting activities. Preventative treatments aiming to reduce the incidence of cam abnormalities and subsequent OA could, therefore, be developed. In this Perspective, we discuss the current understanding of FAI, focusing on cam abnormalities and their association with OA.","1681":"Nanoscience has arrived. Biological applications of nanoscience are particularly prominent and can be useful in a range of disciplines. Advances in nanoscience are underpinning breakthroughs in biomedical research and are beginning to be adopted by the rheumatology and musculoskeletal science communities. Within these fields, nanoscience can be applied to imaging, drug delivery, implant development, regenerative medicine, and the characterization of nanoscale features of cells, matrices and biomaterials. Nanoscience and nanotechnology also provide means by which the interaction of cells with their environment can be studied, thereby increasing the understanding of disease and regenerative processes. Although its potential is clear, nanoscience research tends to be highly technical, generally targeting an audience of physicists, chemists, materials scientists and engineers, and is difficult for a general audience to follow. This Review aims to step back from the most technical aspects of nanoscience and provide a widely accessible view of how it can be applied to advance the field of rheumatology, with an emphasis on technologies that can have an immediate impact on rheumatology and musculoskeletal research. ","1682":"Osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent chronic condition with a striking impact on quality of life, represents an enormous societal burden that increases greatly as populations age. Yet no approved pharmacological intervention, biologic therapy or procedure prevents the progressive destruction of the OA joint. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-multipotent precursors of connective tissue cells that can be isolated from many adult tissues, including those of the diarthrodial joint-have emerged as a potential therapy. Endogenous MSCs contribute to maintenance of healthy tissues by acting as reservoirs of repair cells or as immunomodulatory sentinels to reduce inflammation. The onset of degenerative changes in the joint is associated with aberrant activity or depletion of these cell reservoirs, leading to loss of chondrogenic potential and preponderance of a fibrogenic phenotype. Local delivery of ex vivo cultures of MSCs has produced promising outcomes in preclinical models of joint disease. Mechanistically, paracrine signalling by MSCs might be more important than differentiation in stimulating repair responses; thus, paracrine factors must be assessed as measures of MSC therapeutic potency, to replace traditional assays based on cell-surface markers and differentiation. Several early-stage clinical trials, initiated or underway in 2013, are testing the delivery of MSCs as an intra-articular injection into the knee, but optimal dose and vehicle are yet to be established.","1683":"","1684":"","1685":null,"1686":"Beneficial effects of bone-acting drugs in osteoarthritis (OA) are increasingly reported, but reliable conclusions regarding their efficacy are hindered by methodological drawbacks in study design.

This is particularly true at the early stages of SLE, when an inadequate number of features to secure the diagnosis might be present, and for patients presenting with uncommon features, which can nonetheless be severe and require prompt treatment. Furthermore, the suboptimal performance of immunological testing in patients referred for possible SLE has been highlighted. As a result, SLE remains largely a clinical diagnosis that is made after excluding alternative diagnoses. Diagnostic criteria can expedite diagnosis and treatment, but are not available for SLE. Thus, SLE classification criteria are often used, but strict adherence to these criteria could delay diagnosis. Therefore, while eagerly awaiting diagnostic criteria for this disease, we propose interim potential solutions to facilitate its diagnosis.","1688":null,"1689":"","1690":"Treatments available to children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have improved dramatically in the past 15 years, largely because of the development of powerful new biologic treatments. However, the seeds of this development were sewed over 40 years ago with the formation of a group of paediatric rheumatologists who understood the necessity of performing clinical trials in children with JIA. From there, international paediatric rheumatology networks have grown, and are dedicated to and highly experienced in performing such clinical trials. Development of validated outcomes and methodologies has also been critical. The ability to perform these trials stems from legislation enabling the FDA and the European Medicines Agency to require studies to be performed in children before they can be licensed for use in children. Current efforts to enhance the understanding of treatment options for patients with JIA include the development of disease-specific rather than drug-specific consolidated registries, studies in personalized predictive medicine and the development of treatment protocols for regular clinical care of these patients.","1691":"Fibromyalgia is a common but contested illness. Its definition and content have changed repeatedly in the 110 years of its existence. The most important change was the requirement for multiple tender points and extensive pain that arose in the 1980s, features that were not required previously. By 2010, a second shift occurred that excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain, and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties ('fibro fog') that had never been part of past definitions or content. Fibromyalgia is closely allied with and often indistinguishable from neurasthenia, a disorder of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that lost favour when it was perceived as being a psychological illness. Fibromyalgia's status as a 'real disease', rather than a psychocultural illness, is buttressed by social forces that include support from official criteria, patient and professional organizations, pharmaceutical companies, disability access, and the legal and academic communities.","1692":"","1693":"Vaccination is a powerful tool to reduce the burden of infectious diseases in paediatric patients with chronic rheumatic diseases.

No severe vaccine-specific or disease-specific adverse events have been observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have been vaccinated with live or nonlive agents. The immune response to live vaccines is variable in these patients but generally adequate, despite concomitant use of immunosuppressive and biologic agents. The proposal that onset of autoimmune rheumatic diseases could be induced by vaccination is controversial and primarily based on case reports; however, patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency can experience febrile attacks after immunizations. Adequately powered studies of live and nonlive vaccination in patients with paediatric rheumatic diseases are necessary to clarify safety and efficacy issues. This narrative Review discusses vaccination in patients with JIA, childhood-onset SLE, juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile systemic sclerosis, primary vasculitis and autoinflammatory syndromes.

This pattern is mirrored in sepsis and other inflammatory states, suggesting systemic inflammation has the general effect of lowering circulating lipid levels. In line with such observations, suppressing inflammation with DMARDs, biologic therapies and small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors seems to elevate levels of lipid fractions in RA, albeit in a variable manner dependent presumably upon the mechanism of action of the different agents. In addition, limited epidemiological data in patients with RA suggest increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk at relatively low cholesterol levels, a pattern contrasting with that observed in the population without RA. Our understanding of the potential mechanisms behind these inflammation-associated lipid changes remains suboptimal and requires further study. In clinical terms, however, use of the total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio as the lipid component of CVD risk scoring in patients with RA would seem appropriate given that these lipid parameters generally change in parallel with inflammation and suppression of inflammation. Whether alternative lipid or lipoprotein measures (or simple markers of inflammation) could improve stratification of CVD risk in RA beyond the established risk factors requires future investigation.

A variety of theories have been proposed to explain the ageing process, including accumulation of DNA damage and resultant changes in biological processes.

Furthermore, alterations in biological function determine the biological age-as opposed to chronological age-of an individual, which strongly influences their ability to cope with disease. Moreover, comorbidities are more frequent in elderly individuals. Together, these factors complicate treatment of disease and necessitate careful patient management. Indeed, although evidence from clinical trials suggests that DMARDs and biologic agents have good efficacy and are well tolerated in elderly patients with RA, such individuals are often undertreated and inadequately managed. Unfortunately, insufficient data are available for the development of evidence-based guidelines for this population, as elderly patients are often excluded from clinical trials owing to age restrictions or comorbidities. Thus, additional clinical studies in elderly patients are warranted, with treatment regimens tailored according to vitality or frailty parameters.

Despite its burgeoning importance, translation of disease-modifying OA therapies from the laboratory into clinical practice has slowed. Differences between the OA models studied preclinically and the disease evaluated in human clinical trials contribute to this failure. Most animal models of OA induce disease through surgical or mechanical disruption of joint biomechanics in young individuals rather than the spontaneous development of age-associated disease. This instability-induced joint disease in animals best models the arthritis that develops in humans after an injurious event, known as post-traumatic OA (PTOA). Studies in genetically modified mice suggest that PTOA has a distinct molecular pathophysiology compared with that of spontaneous OA, which might explain the poor translation from preclinical to clinical OA therapeutic trials. This Review summarizes the latest data on potential molecular targets for PTOA prevention and modification derived from studies in genetically modified mice, and describes their validation in preclinical therapeutic trials. This article focuses on how these findings might best be translated to humans, and identifies the potential challenges to successful implementation of clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs for PTOA.

Vitamin D deficiency, due to insufficient sunlight exposure, dietary uptake and\/or abnormalities in its metabolism, has been associated with rheumatic diseases, and both the classical and nonclassical effects of vitamin D might be of relevance to patients with rheumatic disease. However, conclusive data from intervention trials demonstrating the relationship between vitamin D levels and pathogenetic processes separate from classical effects of this molecule are lacking. Furthermore, the majority of studies linking vitamin D to health outcomes, harmful or beneficial, are observational in nature, linking clinical events to vitamin D exposure or serum levels of vitamin D metabolites. Evidence from high quality, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials should be obtained before vitamin D supplementation is recommended in the treatment of the many rheumatic conditions in which deficiency of this compound has been implicated.

Growing evidence suggests that chronic pain conditions are associated with both physical and psychological triggers, which initiate pain amplification and psychological distress; thus, susceptibility is dictated by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Herein, we review phenotypic and genetic markers of common musculoskeletal pain conditions, selected based on their association with musculoskeletal pain in previous research. The phenotypic markers of greatest interest include measures of pain amplification and 'psychological' measures (such as emotional distress, somatic awareness, psychosocial stress and catastrophizing). Genetic polymorphisms reproducibly linked with musculoskeletal pain are found in genes contributing to serotonergic and adrenergic pathways.

Awareness of the increased risk of cervical spine manifestations in patients with rheumatologic disorders enables early recognition and initiation of the appropriate treatment regimen. For example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have spinal instability which, if left untreated, can lead to neurological deficits. Biologic agents are effective in slowing the progression of the skeletal abnormality as well as for treating the RA, and this approach is often sufficient. However, early surgical intervention is recommended for patients with RA who develop neurologic deficits, as conservative approaches have limited effectiveness in this group. Spinal stability should be the primary surgical objective. For patients with ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spine surgery might be required either for fracture repair or to correct severe kyphosis.

Strategies for screening patients at increased risk for fragility fracture, and treatment algorithms using both bone-targeted treatments and other therapeutic interventions, are being developed. Both bisphosphonates and denosumab have been evaluated as treatments to prevent or reverse the bone loss associated with cancer treatments. Zoledronic acid is the most extensively assessed agent and has been shown to prevent bone loss in patients with breast cancer experiencing a premature menopause, in postmenopausal women receiving an aromatase inhibitor and in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). To date, the improvements in bone mineral density have not translated into a reduced fracture rate. However, in a large phase III trial, denosumab has been shown to reduce vertebral fractures in men receiving ADT for prostate cancer.

DMOADs can slow the progression of joint damage. Cell-based therapies have evolved to do the same, through selection of the most potent cell types (and combinations thereof), as well as identification of permissive boundary conditions for indications. Joint distraction techniques, meanwhile, have now demonstrated the capacity to stimulate actual intrinsic tissue repair. Although this progress is promising, true biological joint reconstruction remains distant on the developmental pathway of 'regenerative medicine'. Prolonged functional repair--that is, cure of diseases such as OA--remains an unmet medical need and scientific challenge, for which comparative and constructive interaction between these physical, chemical and cellular approaches will be required.

Currently, no evidence-based criteria exist to guide physicians in this decision-making process, and this situation raises the possibility that conscious or unconscious biases may influence referral patterns, potentially leading to systematic inequities regarding which patients are eventually offered TJR.

Here, we focus on the differential diagnosis of diseases with features of the marfanoid habitus. Ectopia lentis (lens dislocation) and aortic root dilation or dissection are cardinal features of MFS. Distinguishing MFS from other HCDTs has important implications for treatment, as cardiovascular and ocular complications commonly seen in patients with MFS are not seen in all HDCTs. Joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also HDCTs, neither of which is associated with ectopia lentis or aortic changes.

Using biomarkers might reduce the costs of drug development by enabling individuals most likely to respond to be enrolled in clinical trials, thereby minimizing the number of participants required. In this Review, we discuss the current use and the potential of biomarkers in rheumatology and in select fields at the forefront of biomarker research. We emphasize the value of different types of biomarkers, addressing the concept of 'actionable' biomarkers, which can be used to guide clinical decision making, and 'mechanistic' biomarkers, a subtype of actionable biomarker that is embedded in disease pathogenesis and, therefore, represents a potentially superior biomarker.

Low ADA levels might not influence the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy, whereas high ADA levels impair treatment efficacy by considerably reducing unbound drug levels.

The results of such studies suggest that investigations to determine the optimal treatment regimen (drug dosing, treatment schedule and co-medication) required to minimize the likelihood of ADA formation might be an effective and practical way to deal with the immunogenicity of anti-TNF biologic agents for RA.","1759":"","1760":"","1761":"","1762":"Since the discovery of FOXP3+ regulatory T (T(REG)) cells over 15 years ago, intensive research has focused on their presence, phenotype and function in autoimmune disease. Whether deficiencies in T(REG) cells underlie autoimmune pathology and whether, or how, therapeutic approaches based on these cells might be successful is still the subject of debate. The potential role of T(REG)-cell extrinsic factors, such as proinflammatory cytokines and resistance of effector T cells to suppression, as the cause of regulatory defects in chronic autoimmune inflammation is an intensive area of research. It is now clear that, at the site of inflammation, antigen presenting cells (APCs) and proinflammatory cytokines drive effector T cell skewing and plasticity, and that these T cells can become unresponsive to regulation. In addition, expansion and function of T(REG) cells is affected by the inflammatory environment; indeed, new data suggest that, in certain conditions, T(REG) cells promote inflammation. This Review summarizes the latest findings on changes in effector T cell homeostasis in autoimmune disease and focuses on how mechanisms that normally regulate these cells are affected in the inflamed joints of patients with arthritis. These findings have important clinical implications and will affect the development of new therapeutic strategies for autoimmune arthritis.","1763":"The rheumatology community has witnessed remarkable advances in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) made possible by the development of highly effective biologic DMARDs. Robust randomized controlled trials of clinical efficacy, equipped with validated outcome measures, ensured these therapies could enter the clinical arena and thus substantially improve patient outcomes. Current management principles, which follow a 'treat-to-target' paradigm, advocate tight control of disease activity with the aim of achieving clinical remission. However, efficacy trials are not yet aligned with this approach, hampering patient recruitment. This impediment and the usual approach of inclusion of previously failed treatment arms (to protect methodological concerns) is prompting reappraisal of RA trial design and the consideration of more pragmatic studies that reflect real-life practice. In addition, the aspirations of the rheumatology community to strive for personalized medicine means innovative approaches to trial design are needed to complement the efficacy trial. This Review appraises the current trial landscape and provides insights and key concepts from other fields such as oncology as to the potential utility (as well as the limitations) of pragmatic trial designs such as adaptive trials and biomarker-driven trials.","1764":"","1765":"","1766":"Investigators have made key advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) genetics in the past 10 years. Although genetic studies have had limited influence on clinical practice and drug discovery, they are currently generating testable hypotheses to explain disease pathogenesis. Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC. Understanding how genetic variants translate into pathogenic mechanisms and ultimately into phenotypes remains a mystery for most of the polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to RA, but functional data are emerging. Interplay between environmental and genetic factors is poorly understood and in need of further investigation. Secondly, we review current knowledge of the role of epigenetics in RA susceptibility. Differences in the epigenome could represent one of the ways in which environmental exposures translate into phenotypic outcomes. The best understood epigenetic phenomena include post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation events, both of which have critical roles in gene regulation. Epigenetic studies in RA represent a new area of research with the potential to answer unsolved questions.","1767":"","1768":"","1769":"","1770":"","1771":"Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have advanced rapidly towards the development of therapeutic solutions for musculoskeletal disorders.

Semiquantitative assessment of the joints by expert interpreters of MRI data is a powerful tool that can increase our understanding of the natural history of this complex disease. Several reliable and validated semiquantitative scoring systems now exist and have been applied to large-scale, multicentre, cross-sectional and longitudinal observational epidemiological studies. Such approaches have advanced our understanding of the associations of different tissue pathologies with pain and improved the definition of joint alterations that lead to disease progression. Semiquantitative MRI outcome measures have also been applied in several clinical trials in OA. Indeed, interest in MRI-based semiquantitative scoring systems has led to the development of several novel scoring systems that can be applied to different joints: a knee synovitis scoring system based on contrast-enhanced MRI; the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS); the Hip Osteoarthritis MRI Score (HOAMS); and the Oslo Hand Osteoarthritis MRI score (OHOA-MRI). Although these new scoring systems offer theoretical advantages over pre-existing systems, whether they offer actual superiority with regard to reliability, responsiveness and validity remains to be seen.","1774":"A number of microRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various rheumatic diseases, and evidence in support of the therapeutic potential of microRNA-based strategies for these conditions is growing, as demonstrated by several new findings published in 2012.","1775":"In 2012, several new concepts emerged that widen our view of the regulation of bone mass in health and disease.

Together, these advances could go some way to addressing the urgent need for disease-modifying treatments for this common disease.","1779":"Obesity and knee osteoarthritis (OA), two of the most common chronic diseases, are often comorbid. Obesity increases the risk of knee OA by a variety of mechanisms, such as increased joint loading and changes in body composition, with detrimental effects related to metainflammation and behavioural factors, including diminished physical activity and subsequent loss of protective muscle strength. These complex interactions present a challenge to the managing physician. The risk of knee OA related to weight gain and obesity begins from an early age. Weight loss reduces the risk of incident knee OA, and, in established disease, reduces symptoms, improves function and is likely to reduce disease progression. We review strategies to facilitate weight loss, with particular reference to their application in people with knee OA. Although knee OA presents intrinsic barriers to weight management, weight loss is possible at all stages of disease. Exercise or muscle strengthening are desirable for general health and to improve function, but are not essential to achieve weight loss and a successful symptomatic result. The degree of weight loss required to achieve benefit might be greater with increasing disease severity. Finally, we outline the need for a societal approach to tackle obesity-related OA.","1780":"","1781":"","1782":"","1783":"Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal.

Observations from lupus centres worldwide revealed that the prevalence of damage occurring in the cardiovascular system in patients with SLE has increased over the past four decades. The results of a meta-analysis involving over 70 observational studies demonstrated that lupus-related organ damage involving the neuropsychiatric and renal systems also remains a major factor that limits survival improvement in patients with this disease. While efforts to halt acute lupus-related injury are continuing, through early diagnosis and effective use of immunosuppressive agents, a concomitant strategy to improve survival of patients with SLE would be early detection and timely treatment of lupus-related organ damage with meticulous monitoring. This Review discusses the pattern and trend of organ damage in patients with SLE worldwide, the potential serological and genetic mechanisms of organ damage, and the advances in research on potential tools for early detection of lupus-related organ damage, such as functional brain imaging techniques, measurement of endothelial function, identification of biomarkers from body fluids, and development of risk calculation models.","1788":"The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 has an important role in pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. In immune-mediated joint diseases, IL-17 can induce secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF, as well as matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, leading to inflammation, cartilage breakdown, osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion. In animal models of inflammatory arthritis, mice deficient in IL-17 are less susceptible to development of disease. The list of IL-17-secreting cells is rapidly growing, and mast cells have been suggested to be a dominant source of IL-17 in inflammatory joint disease. However, many other innate sources of IL-17 have been described in both inflammatory and autoinflammatory conditions, raising questions as to the role of mast cells in orchestrating joint inflammation. This article will critically assess the contribution of mast cells and other cell types to IL-17 production in the inflammatory milieu associated with inflammatory arthritis, understanding of which could facilitate targeted therapeutic approaches.","1789":"","1790":"","1791":"New data demonstrate that cobalt ions promote immune system activation through Toll-like receptor 4 signalling.

Diagnostic blocks (for example, medial branch blocks [MBBs]) are the only reliable approach to identify facet joints as the source of neck or back pain. In the absence of a reference standard, MBBs actually serve more of a prognostic than diagnostic role, enabling the selection of patients who might respond to radiofrequency denervation treatment--the standard treatment for facet joint pain. Using double blocks reduces the false-positive rate of MBBs, but will invariably reduce the overall treatment success rate. No studies have evaluated non-interventional treatments for confirmed facetogenic pain, but data from studies in non-specific back pain suggest a modest, short-term beneficial effect for pharmacotherapy and some non-traditional treatments. Trials of intra-articular steroid injections for lumbar and cervical facet joint pain have yielded disappointing results, but evidence suggests that a subpopulation of patients with acute inflammation derive intermediate-term benefit from this therapy. Radiofrequency denervation provides some benefit for up to a year in approximately 60% of individuals. Increasing this success rate might involve enhancing diagnostic specificity and phenotyping, as well as techniques that increase the likelihood of successful nerve ablation, such as maximizing lesion size.","1797":"","1798":"","1799":null,"1800":"","1801":"","1802":"The management of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) can be challenging because disease-associated damage is often difficult to reverse and curative therapies are not yet available. Early identification and appropriate monitoring of patients with SSc is, therefore, critical so that active disease can be controlled and tissue damage prevented or delayed. However, early diagnosis of SSc is often difficult because the early clinical stages of the disease can be very similar to that of other autoimmune conditions. Screening for major organ manifestations of SSc, particularly interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, renal involvement and cardiac disease is a priority because involvement of these organs is associated with shorter life expectancies and early intervention might prevent disease progression. The prevention and management of digital ischaemia is also important as appropriate therapy often prevents substantial morbidity and functional loss. Treating gastrointestinal dysmotility can usually be managed using proton pump inhibitors and promotility agents, although in severe cases total parenteral nutrition is required. Calcinosis in patients with SSc is another common challenge that requires appropriate disease management and pain control. Each of these topics, which are relevant to both physicians and patients with SSc, are reviewed in further detail herein.","1803":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by hyperplastic synovial pannus tissue, which mediates destruction of cartilage and bone. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are a key component of this invasive synovium and have a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of destructive joint inflammation. The pathogenic potential of FLS in RA stems from their ability to express immunomodulating cytokines and mediators as well as a wide array of adhesion molecule and matrix-modelling enzymes. FLS can be viewed as 'passive responders' to the immunoreactive process in RA, their activated phenotype reflecting the proinflammatory milieu. However, FLS from patients with RA also display unique aggressive features that are autonomous and vertically transmitted, and these cells can behave as primary promoters of inflammation. The molecular bases of this 'imprinted aggressor' phenotype are being clarified through genetic and epigenetic studies. The dual behaviour of FLS in RA suggests that FLS-directed therapies could become a complementary approach to immune-directed therapies in this disease. Pathophysiological characteristics of FLS in RA, as well as progress in targeting these cells, are reviewed in this manuscript.","1804":"A fundamental change in management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis in the past 10 years is the early focussed use of aggressive immunosuppression, using regimens comprised of widely available medications. Using a clinical framework to quantify morbidity, we can induce remission in most patients within 3-6 months using glucocorticoids plus methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or rituximab, with additional plasmapheresis when indicated. Difficulty in maintaining remission probably relates to the difference between true pathophysiological remission and the absence of clinical, serological or radiological evidence of disease activity. For surviving patients, the cumulative problems of relapse, burden of disease, or its treatment are coupled with pre-existing diseases or new conditions arising since diagnosis. Initial early control should reduce subsequent damage, but what effect it will have on relapse is not clear. In the absence of a cure, future trials should focus on reducing toxicity and comorbidity as well as controlling disease.","1805":"Anaemia is frequently observed in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Depending on its severity, anaemia negatively affects cardiovascular performance, physical activity and the quality of life of patients. However, anaemia is considered to be a symptom of the underlying inflammatory disease and, thus, neglected as a complex medical condition that warrants specific diagnosis and treatment. Although inflammation-induced alterations in iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis have a dominant role in the pathogenesis of this type of anaemia, multiple other factors such as chronic blood loss, haemolysis, disease and treatment-associated adverse effects or vitamin deficiencies can also take part in the development of anaemia. Accordingly, the prevalence of anaemia is positively associated with the severity of the underlying disease. This Review will summarize epidemiological data on anaemia in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, along with a detailed description of underlying pathophysiological pathways, available diagnostic tools and practical diagnostic strategies. Discussion of established and newly emerging treatment regimens, as well as the need for further research in this clinically relevant field, will also be included.","1806":"The peripheral nervous system takes an active part in inflammatory processes by regulating effector cell function and reallocation of energy to the immune system. During acute inflammation, rapid neuronal reorganization and change of activity takes place. The hallmarks of this process are an increase in systemic sympathetic activity, a decrease in systemic parasympathetic activity and loss of sympathetic nerve fibres from sites of inflammation concomitant with increased innervation with sensory nerve fibres and increased sensory nerve fibre activity. On a systemic level, the increase in sympathetic activity (and decrease in parasympathetic activity) is necessary to provide enough energy to nourish the activated immune system. In locally inflamed tissue, the decrease in sympathetic nerve fibre density results in reduced anti-inflammatory signalling and, together with neuropeptides released from sensory nerve fibres, promotes local inflammation. In acute inflammation, this 'inflammatory configuration' of the peripheral nervous system favours the rapid clearance of antigenic threats. However, in chronic autoimmune inflammation, these changes of the peripheral nervous system lead to an unfavourable situation with ongoing energy reallocation and continuous local destruction. As an example of a chronic inflammatory condition, we discuss evidence for neuroimmune regulation in autoimmune arthritis with a focus on the sympathetic nervous system.","1807":"Osteoarthritis (OA) of the spine involves the facet joints, which are located in the posterior aspect of the vertebral column and, in humans, are the only true synovial joints between adjacent spinal levels. Facet joint osteoarthritis (FJ OA) is widely prevalent in older adults, and is thought to be a common cause of back and neck pain. The prevalence of facet-mediated pain in clinical populations increases with increasing age, suggesting that FJ OA might have a particularly important role in older adults with spinal pain. Nevertheless, to date FJ OA has received far less study than other important OA phenotypes such as knee OA, and other features of spine pathoanatomy such as degenerative disc disease. This Review presents the current state of knowledge of FJ OA, including relevant anatomy, biomechanics, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations. We present the view that the modern concept of FJ OA is consonant with the concept of OA as a failure of the whole joint, and not simply of facet joint cartilage.","1808":"Physical activity is paramount in the treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia, although some interventions use indirect methods to increase activity levels rather than address physical dysfunction head-on.

As well as their structural relationship the IL-12 family cytokines share some biological characteristics but have functional differences. These cytokines contribute to immune-mediated inflammation and our improved knowledge of their actions has led to alteration of the T(H)1-T(H)2 paradigm. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), leukocyte migration, bone erosions and angiogenesis are modulated by an IL-23-IL-17 cascade, which can be negated in part by IL-12, IL-27 and IL-35 function. However, the IL-12 family members are a relatively new area of research and data have been generated mostly at the preclinical stage. Further studies in patients with RA are, therefore, required to determine whether these cytokines are valid targets for RA therapy.","1811":"","1812":"Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that have gained increasing interest as regulators of a variety of tissue responses, including cartilage development and remodelling. These proteoglycans are composed of a core protein to which extracellular glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached. Through these GAG chains, syndecans can interact with a variety of extracellular matrix molecules and bind to a number of soluble mediators including morphogens, growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. The structure and post-translational modification of syndecan GAG chains seem to differ not only from cell to cell, but also during different stages of cellular differentiation, leading to a complexity of syndecan function that is unique among membrane-bound HSPGs. Unlike other membrane-bound HSPGs, syndecans contain intracellular signalling motifs that can initiate signalling mainly through protein kinase C. This Review summarizes our knowledge of the biology of syndecans and the mechanisms by which binding of molecules to syndecans exert different biological effects, particularly in the joints. On the basis of the structural and functional peculiarities of syndecans, we discuss the regulation of syndecans and their roles in the developing joint as well as during degenerative and inflammatory cartilage remodelling as understood from expression studies and functional analyses involving syndecan-deficient mice.","1813":"RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the most exciting and important discoveries of the past few decades. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can silence gene activity and be used to interfere with pathophysiological processes. Substantial research has focused on introducing 'drug-like' properties-stability, selectivity and potency-to RNAi molecules, and clinical trials have been initiated. Despite initial success, the current challenge that remains is to develop optimized vehicles that avoid off-target effects whilst efficiently delivering the therapeutic siRNA to specific cell types. As for many other diseases, siRNA-based therapy is emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of rheumatic disorders. Although the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases is complex, identification of candidate genes able to influence either inflammation or structural damage has been successful. Here, we will discuss advances in the field and potential applications of siRNA therapeutics in clinical trials for rheumatic conditions.","1814":"","1815":"","1816":"Dysregulation of gene expression can cause complex disease phenotypes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well known to fine-tune cellular gene expression to control immune cell development and regulate adaptive and innate immune responses. Discoveries over the past decade have indicated that aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple immunological diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, profiling miRNA expression in blood cells, body fluid and target tissues taken from patients with SLE has revealed unique miRNA signatures when compared with healthy individuals or those with other diseases. Moreover, dysregulation of these miRNAs has also been found to be associated with disease activity and major organ involvement. In our opinion, therefore, miRNAs have the potential to act as biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of patients with SLE. This Review provides an overview of the novel cellular and molecular mechanisms that seem to underlie the roles of miRNAs in SLE disease processes, as well as the future therapeutic potential of targeting miRNAs in the management of patients with SLE.","1817":"Investigations into interactions between the skeletal and immune systems were developed during research into arthritis, with characterization of T-cell-mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis. A new interdisciplinary field--osteoimmunology--was created, and has since expanded to encompass disciplines including signal transduction, stem cell niches and fundamental immunology. We have witnessed rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms of bone damage in arthritis and the roles of immune molecules in bone, but comparatively less evidence has been provided for the role of bone-derived factors in the immune system. Nevertheless, regulation of immune cells, including haematopoietic stem cells, by bone cells is now a hot topic in this field.

Consideration of evolutionary and comparative biology provides clues that a key driving force for the emergence of these hormonal pathways was the development of a large, energy-expensive musculoskeletal system. Specialized bone cells also evolved and produced endocrine hormones to integrate the skeleton in global mineral and nutrient homeostasis. The recognition of bone as a true endocrine organ represents a fertile area for further research and should improve the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus.","1824":"Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory effects and have been used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis for more than 60 years. However, severe adverse effects of glucocorticoid treatment, including loss of bone mass and increased risk of fractures, are common. Data from studies of glucocorticoid-mediated gene regulation, which utilized conditional knockout mice in animal models of arthritis or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, have substantially increased our understanding of the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids act via the glucocorticoid receptor. Following glucocorticoid binding, the receptor regulates gene expression either by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors as a monomer or by binding directly to DNA as a dimer. In contrast to the old hypothesis that transrepression mechanisms involving monomeric glucocorticoid receptor actions were responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, whereas dimeric glucocorticoid receptor binding resulted in adverse effects, data from animal models have shown that the anti-inflammatory and adverse effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by both monomeric and dimeric glucocorticoid receptor binding. This improved knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial and adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy might lead to the development of rationales for novel glucocorticoid receptor ligands that could potentially have anti-inflammatory efficacy without adverse effects on bone.","1825":"","1826":"","1827":"","1828":"","1829":"","1830":null,"1831":null,"1832":"Molecular and multimodal imaging procedures that complement the use of existing anatomical modalities for the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have undergone substantial developmental advances.

This review provides an update on the genetics of hyperuricaemia and gout, including findings from genome-wide association studies. Most of the genes that associated with serum uric acid levels or gout are involved in the renal urate-transport system. For example, the urate transporter genes SLC2A9, ABCG2 and SLC22A12 modulate serum uric acid levels and gout risk. The net balance between renal urate absorption and secretion is a major determinant of serum uric acid concentration and loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia due to reduced urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. However, the variance in serum uric acid explained by genetic variants is small and their clinical utility for gout risk prediction seems limited because serum uric acid levels effectively predict gout risk. Urate-associated genes and genetically determined serum uric acid levels were largely unassociated with cardiovascular-metabolic outcomes, challenging the hypothesis of a causal role of serum uric acid in the development of cardiovascular disease. Strong pharmacogenetic associations between HLA-B*5801 alleles and severe allopurinol-hypersensitivity reactions were shown in Asian and European populations. Genetic testing for HLA-B*5801 alleles could be used to predict these potentially fatal adverse effects.","1841":"Uric acid is a waste product of purine catabolism. This molecule comes to clinical attention when it nucleates to form crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) in joints or other tissues, and thereby causes the inflammatory disease of gout. Patients with gout frequently suffer from a number of comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Why MSU crystals trigger inflammation and are associated with comorbidities of gout has been unclear, but recent studies provide new insights into these issues. Rather than simply being a waste product, uric acid could serve a pathophysiological role as a local alarm signal that alerts the immune system to cell injury and helps to trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses. The inflammatory component of these immune responses is caused when urate crystals trigger both inflammasome-dependent and independent pathways to generate the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. The resulting bioactive IL-1 stimulates the inflammation of gout and might contribute to the development of other comorbidities. Surprisingly, the same mechanisms underlie the inflammatory response to a number of irritant particles, many of which also cause disease. These new insights help to explain the pathogenesis of gout and point to potential new therapeutic targets for this and other sterile inflammatory diseases.","1842":"","1843":"","1844":"","1845":"Metabolic osteoarthritis (OA) has now been characterized as a subtype of OA, and links have been discovered between this phenotype and metabolic syndrome (MetS)--both with individual MetS components and with MetS as a whole. Hypertension associates with OA through subchondral ischaemia, which can compromise nutrient exchange into articular cartilage and trigger bone remodelling. Ectopic lipid deposition in chondrocytes induced by dyslipidemia might initiate OA development, exacerbated by deregulated cellular lipid metabolism in joint tissues. Hyperglycaemia and OA interact at both local and systemic levels; local effects of oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products are implicated in cartilage damage, whereas low-grade systemic inflammation results from glucose accumulation and contributes to a toxic internal environment that can exacerbate OA. Obesity-related metabolic factors, particularly altered levels of adipokines, contribute to OA development by inducing the expression of proinflammatory factors as well as degradative enzymes, leading to the inhibition of cartilage matrix synthesis and stimulation of subchondral bone remodelling. In this Review, we summarize the shared mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, common metabolites and endothelial dysfunction that characterize the aetiologies of OA and MetS, and nominate metabolic OA as the fifth component of MetS. We also describe therapeutic opportunities that might arise from uniting these concepts.","1846":"Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including rheumatic disease. Although the association of the two disorders can be coincidental, an underlying pathogenic link can occur in many instances, which can affect treatment options.

Furthermore, understanding the diagnostic strategy will help physicians treating patients with rheumatic disease who develop peripheral neuropathy. Finally, although available treatment options have greatly reduced the risk of patients with inflammatory disorders developing systemic complications, among which includes peripheral neuropathy, new therapeutic agents can trigger toxic or immune-mediated neuropathies and treatment will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Pregnancy is increasingly common in the setting of SLE, as survival and quality of life of patients improve. Although live births can be achieved in the most cases, pregnancy in patients with SLE remains a high-risk condition. Maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity are considerably increased, compared with the general population. Aberrations in pregnancy-related maternal immune adaptations are likely contributors. Active maternal disease, renal involvement, specific autoantibody subsets and advanced organ damage are predictors of poor outcome. Therapeutic options are limited during pregnancy as maternal benefit has to be weighed against fetal risk. Prevention of preterm birth and refractory pregnancy loss, as well as management of established neonatal heart block remain unmet needs. Further research should address these important issues that affect young patients with SLE and their babies.","1849":"Multiple proven and potential risk factors for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been identified, and represent interactions between genes and the environment. Proven risk factors include genetic influences on the function of the innate and adaptive immune systems, smoking, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), and rheumatoid factors (RF). Potential risk factors include epigenetic control of gene expression, the microbiome and other environmental factors, Toll-like receptors, cytokines, and Fc receptors. Preclinical abnormalities such as circulating RF and ACPAs may occur more than 10 years prior to the onset of clinical disease. However, the precise mechanisms whereby these risk factors lead to clinical disease remain unclear. It is possible that, combined with activation of the innate immune system, a subset of ACPAs initiates the disease in the cartilage or synovium after binding to endogenous citrullinated proteins. Subsequent engagement of Fc receptors and complement activation would lead to secondary inflammation in the synovium with induction of a perpetuating cycle of chronic synovitis.","1850":"Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common musculoskeletal disorder, is complex, multifaceted, and characterized by degradation of articular cartilage and alterations in other joint tissues. Although some pathogenic pathways have been characterized, current knowledge is incomplete and effective approaches to the prevention or treatment of OA are lacking. Understanding novel molecular mechanisms that are involved in the maintenance and destruction of articular cartilage, including extracellular regulators and intracellular signalling mechanisms in joint cells that control cartilage homeostasis, has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets in OA. MicroRNAs control tissue development and homeostasis by fine-tuning gene expression, with expression patterns specific to tissues and developmental stages, and are increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. The emergent roles of microRNAs in cartilage homeostasis and OA pathogenesis are summarized in this Review, alongside potential clinical applications.","1851":null,"1852":"","1853":"","1854":"","1855":"Nearly one trillion platelets circulate in the blood to monitor and preserve the integrity of the vasculature. However, haemostasis is not their only function. Platelets are also potent immune cells capable of a range of effector responses. Studies have shown that platelets can have unexpected roles in rheumatic diseases. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL-1-containing platelet-derived vesicles called microparticles are abundant in arthritic joint fluid. These microparticles can elicit production of inflammatory mediators from resident synovial fibroblasts, which have an integral role in the development of arthritis. Platelets also serve as a source of prostaglandins that contribute to synovial inflammation. Furthermore, serotonin released by platelets helps drive the persistent vascular permeability that characterizes the microvasculature of the inflamed synovium, an unexpected function for a cell that more typically serves as a guardian of vascular integrity. Beyond RA, platelet activation has been observed in systemic lupus erythematosus, mediated at least in part through the interaction of circulating immune complexes with platelet Fc receptors and by promotion of interferon release from plasmacytoid dendritic cells. These findings point to a distinct role for platelets in autoimmunity and support the possibility that platelets are an attractive target in rheumatic disease.","1856":"","1857":"The classical view of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is that subchondral sclerosis is associated with, and perhaps causes, age-related joint degeneration. Recent observations have demonstrated that OA is associated with early loss of bone owing to increased bone remodelling, followed by slow turnover leading to densification of the subchondral plate and complete loss of cartilage. Subchondral densification is a late event in OA that involves only the subchondral plate and calcified cartilage; the subchondral cancellous bone beneath the subchondral plate may remain osteopenic. In experimental models, inducing subchondral sclerosis without allowing the prior stage of increased bone remodelling to occur does not lead to progressive OA. Therefore, both early-stage increased remodelling and bone loss, and the late-stage slow remodelling and subchondral densification are important components of the pathogenetic process that leads to OA. The apparent paradoxical observations that OA is associated with both increased remodelling and osteopenia, as well as decreased remodelling and sclerosis, are consistent with the spatial and temporal separation of these processes during joint degeneration. This Review provides an overview of current knowledge on OA and discusses the role of subchondral bone in the initiation and progression of OA. A hypothetical model of OA pathogenesis is proposed.","1858":"","1859":"Sports participation is associated with an increased risk of future osteoarthritis (OA), much of which results from joint injury. No strong evidence exists that moderate sporting activity in the presence of normal joints predisposes to OA. Whether high-level participation in sport, particularly impact-type sports, is truly associated with OA is unclear owing to difficulties in differentiating the confounding effect of joint injury. Attention to strategies that prevent joint injury in athletes is paramount. Evidence does support the use of targeted neuromuscular exercise programmes, ankle taping and\/or bracing and equipment or rule changes to prevent joint injuries in athletes. Optimal injury management, including rehabilitation and surgery if appropriate, is needed to facilitate healing and address biomechanical and neuromuscular impairments to reduce the risk of re-injury and minimize the onset and extent of joint symptoms. Management of OA in athletes requires attention to load-reducing strategies, activity modification, muscle strengthening and weight control.","1860":"The past decade has seen exciting progress in the management of lupus nephritis, a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that accounts for its major morbidity and mortality.

These agents continue to enjoy success as the initial pharmacotherapy for SLE even in the era of targeted therapies. Antimalarial agents have numerous biological effects that are responsible for their immunomodulatory actions in SLE. Their inhibitory effect on Toll-like receptor-mediated activation of the innate immune response is perhaps the most important discovery regarding their putative mechanism of action, but some other, previously known properties, such as antithrombotic and antilipidaemic effects, are now explained by new research. In the 1980s and 1990s, these antihyperlipidaemic and antithrombotic effects were demonstrated in retrospective clinical studies, and over the past few years prospective studies have confirmed those findings. Knowledge about the risk-benefit profile of antimalarial agents during pregnancy and lactation has evolved, as has the concept of retinal toxicity. Antimalarial agents have unique disease-modifying properties in SLE and newer iterations of this class of anti-inflammatory agents will have a profound effect upon the treatment of autoimmune disease.","1872":"Patients with rheumatic disease must adjust psychosocially and behaviourally in order to manage the impact of symptoms and treatment on their daily lives, and the emotional consequences of the disease. However, patients can improve their well-being by taking a proactive role in self-management, for example by using coping strategies. Support for patient self-management from clinical teams usually comprises information and advice on disease management; however, this largely didactic approach often focuses on the biomedical aspects of rheumatic disease, without addressing how these aspects interact with psychosocial factors to influence health behaviours and thus outcomes. A cognitive-behavioural approach based on the biopsychosocial model of rheumatic disease can facilitate the identification of effective self-management strategies through collaboration between patients and clinicians. Most patients do not require intense cognitive-behavioural therapy from a clinical psychologist; rather, basic cognitive-behavioural techniques and tools could be used by rheumatology clinical teams to expand and enhance the support already offered to patients.","1873":"","1874":"The past 10 years have seen the publication of results from several multicentre clinical trials in primary and systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related Raynaud phenomenon. The publication of these studies has occurred as a result of new insights into the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon, which are directing new treatment approaches, and increased international collaboration between clinicians and scientists. Although the pathogenesis of Raynaud phenomenon is complex, abnormalities of the blood vessel wall, of neural control mechanisms and of intravascular (circulating) factors are known to interact and contribute. Key players relevant in drug development include nitric oxide, endothelin-1, alpha adrenergic receptor activation, abnormal signal transduction in vascular smooth muscle, oxidative stress and platelet activation. The main advances in diagnosis have been a clearer understanding of autoantibodies and of abnormal nailfold capillary patterns as independent predictors of SSc, and widespread use and increased availability of capillaroscopy. The ultimate aim is to translate the advances made in the pathophysiology and early diagnosis into development of treatments to prevent and reverse digital vascular dysfunction and injury. This Review provides an update of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of Raynaud phenomenon. Current and future treatment approaches are discussed, and some key unanswered questions are highlighted.","1875":"Joint destruction occurs in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Even in the era of biologic agents, this destruction can be delayed but not averted. As cartilage has limited ability to self-regenerate, joint arthroplasty is required. Here, we outline current tissue engineering procedures (including autologous chondrocyte implantation and in situ mesenchymal stem cell recruitment) that are routinely applied for the regenerative treatment of injured or early osteoarthritic cartilage. Potential future regenerative therapies, including administration of multipotent or pluripotent stem cells, are also discussed. In the future, cell-free, material-based (for cartilage lesions) or cell-free, factor-based (for osteoarthritic cartilage) therapies to facilitate the recruitment of repair cells and improve cartilage metabolism are likely to become more important. Moreover, delivery of anti-inflammatory factors or immunomodulatory cells could be a regenerative treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis. Tissue engineering faces a crucial phase to translate products into clinical routine and the regulatory framework for cell-based products in particular is an important issue.","1876":"Osteoporosis, through its association with fragility fracture, is a major public health problem, costing an estimated $34.8 billion worldwide per annum. With projected demographic changes, the burden looks set to grow. Therefore, the prevention of osteoporosis, as well as its identification and treatment once established, are becoming increasingly important. Osteoporosis is secondary when a drug, disease or deficiency is the underlying cause. Glucocorticoids, hypogonadism, alcohol abuse and malnutrition are among the most frequently recognized causes of secondary osteoporosis but the list of implicated diseases and drugs is growing and some of the more recently recognized associations, such as those with haematological conditions and acid-suppressing medications, are less well publicized. In some cases, advancement in treatment of the primary disease has led to people living long enough to develop secondary osteoporosis; for example, successful treatment for breast and prostate malignancies by hormonal manipulation, improved survival in HIV with the advent of anti-retroviral therapies, and improved treatment for cystic fibrosis. This Review emphasizes the importance of secondary osteoporosis, discusses familiar and less well-known causes and what is known of their mechanisms, provides guidance as to the pragmatic identification of secondary osteoporosis and summarizes treatment options, where available.","1877":"","1878":"","1879":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder.

In this Perspectives, we describe the rationale and design of the OAI and its cohort, discuss imaging protocols and summarize image analyses completed to date. We include descriptive analyses of publicly available longitudinal (2-year) data of changes in cartilage thickness in a core sample of 600 knees from 590 participants in the OAI progression subcohort.

Glucocorticoids are used in patients with IIM to suppress inflammatory and immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Nevertheless, potential inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on skeletal muscle mass, myogenesis and immune responses that promote skeletal muscle regeneration after muscle injury warrant attention. Glucocorticoids lead to skeletal muscle catabolism by modulating major pathways involved in regulating muscle mass. Glucocorticoids also inhibit muscle regeneration by decreasing myogenic cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, glucocorticoids might have inhibitory effects on immune cells that have been shown to be an important component of the muscle regenerative response. Better understanding of the signalling pathways involved in restorative versus adverse effects of glucocorticoids in IIM could yield additional insight into the aetiopathogenesis of persistent muscle weakness in patients with IIM after glucocorticoid treatment, and help in the development of novel, targeted treatment options with fewer adverse effects.","1889":"","1890":"Biochemical markers of bone turnover (bone turnover markers, BTMs) can be used to study changes in bone remodelling in osteoporosis. Investigators and clinicians should be aware of the appropriate sample collection and storage conditions for optimum measurements of these markers. Improvements in the variability of BTM measurements have resulted from the development of assays for automated analysers, and from international consensus regarding their use. Appropriate reference intervals should be used for the optimum interpretation of results. BTMs can provide information that is useful for the management of patients with osteoporosis, for both the initial clinical assessment and for guiding and monitoring of treatment. BTMs are clinically useful to determine possible causes of secondary osteoporosis by identifying patients with high bone turnover and rapid bone loss. In the follow-up of treatment response, BTM levels respond rapidly to both anabolic and antiresorptive treatments. BTM changes can also be used for understanding the mechanism of action of drugs in development and identifying the correct dose; they are also potentially useful as surrogate biomarkers for fracture.","1891":"The complement system has vital protective functions as a humoral component of the innate immune system and also through interactions with the adaptive immune system; however, when inappropriately activated or regulated, complement can cause inflammation and organ damage, and such processes are involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, not least rheumatic diseases. Furthermore, states of complement deficiency can predispose not only to infections, but also to autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. In this Review, the mechanisms behind the pathogenic activities of complement in rheumatic diseases are discussed. Potential approaches to therapeutic intervention that focus on regulating complement activities in these disorders are also considered.","1892":"Patents for many key biological agents will soon expire. Third-party companies are, therefore, in the process of developing their own versions, termed biosimilar agents, of these innovator products. However, manufacture of biosimilar agents is complicated by the requirement for their production in biological systems, small variations in which can influence the structure, activity and metabolism of the biosimilar product. The development of biosimilar therapies for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases could potentially result in substantial cost savings for patients and health care providers, and consequently, increased availability of effective therapies. However, legislation that regulates the manufacture, registration and approval of biosimilar therapies varies considerably between different countries. In addition, major safety and efficacy concerns must be addressed before a rheumatologist can routinely substitute an innovator pharmaceutical with a biosimilar product.","1893":"","1894":"Rheumatologists see patients with a range of autoimmune diseases. Phenotyping these diseases for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of therapies is an ever increasing problem. Advances in multiplexed assay technology at the gene, protein, and cellular level have enabled the identification of 'actionable biomarkers'; that is, biological metrics that can inform clinical practice. Not only will such biomarkers yield insight into the development, remission, and exacerbation of a disease, they will undoubtedly improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of classification, and ultimately guide treatment. This Review provides an introduction to these powerful technologies that could promote the identification of actionable biomarkers, including mass cytometry, protein arrays, and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor high-throughput sequencing. In our opinion, these technologies should become part of routine clinical practice for the management of autoimmune diseases. The use of analytical tools to deconvolve the data obtained from use of these technologies is also presented here. These analyses are revealing a more comprehensive and interconnected view of the immune system than ever before and should have an important role in directing future treatment approaches for autoimmune diseases.","1895":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is partly heritable; genetic and serological markers are known to confer risk of developing pathology.

Meniscus damage might be considered a signifying feature of incipient OA in middle-aged and elderly people. As approximately every third knee of people in these groups has a damaged meniscus, tears are common incidental findings of knee MRI. However, as most tears do not cause symptoms, careful clinical evaluation is required to determine if a damaged meniscus is likely to directly impact a patient's symptoms. Conservative management of patients with knee pain and a degenerative meniscal tear should be considered as a first-line therapy before surgical treatment is contemplated. Patients with mechanical interference of joint movements, such as painful catching or locking, might need surgical treatment with meniscal repair if possible. In a subset of patients, meniscal resection might relieve pain and other symptoms that potentially originate directly from the torn meniscus. However, the possibility of an increased risk of OA if functional meniscal tissue is removed cannot be overlooked.","1907":"","1908":"Mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses causing human rheumatic disease are globally                 distributed and include chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus,                 Sindbis virus, o'nyong-nyong virus and Mayaro virus. These viruses cause endemic                 disease and, occasionally, large epidemics; for instance, the 2004-2011                 chikungunya epidemic resulted in 1.4-6.5 million cases, with imported                 cases reported in nearly 40 countries. The disease is usually self-limiting and                 characterized by acute and chronic symmetrical peripheral                 polyarthralgia-polyarthritis, with acute disease usually including fever,                 myalgia and\/or rash. Arthropathy can be debilitating, usually lasts weeks to months                 and can be protracted; although adequate attention to differential diagnoses is                 recommended. The latest chikungunya virus epidemic was also associated with some                 severe disease manifestations and mortality, primarily in elderly patients with                 comorbidities and the young. Chronic alphaviral rheumatic disease probably arises                 from inflammatory responses stimulated by the virus persisting in joint tissues,                 despite robust antiviral immune responses.

As such, our understanding of the genesis of T(FH) cells in humans and their role in the development of autoimmunity remains incomplete. However, evidence from animal models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and patients with systemic autoimmune diseases suggests that these cells are necessary for pathogenic autoantibody production, in a manner analogous to their role in promotion of B-cell maturation during normal immune responses. In this Review, I discuss the findings that have increased our knowledge of T(FH)-cell development and function in normal and aberrant immune responses. Such information might improve our understanding of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, and highlights the potential of T(FH) cells as therapeutic targets in these diseases.","1916":"","1917":"","1918":"New evidence suggesting an X chromosome effect underlies the development and progression of male systemic lupus erythematosus comes from a study of sex chromosome aneuploidy in men with this disease.

Intriguingly, microscopic gut inflammation, which occurs frequently in patients with SpA, is an important risk factor for clinically overt Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. This Review describes current insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to chronic gut inflammation in patients with SpA. We propose that the development of chronic bowel inflammation in these individuals occurs through a transition phase, in which inflammation evolves from an acute into a chronic state. Our transition model implies that different cell types are involved at different stages during disease progression, with stromal cells having an important role in chronicity. In addition, deficient regulatory feedback mechanisms or genetically determined alterations in antigen presentation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy or cytokine signaling might also favor a transition from self-limiting acute inflammation to chronic inflammation. We anticipate that this transition phase might be an important window for therapeutic intervention.","1921":"Juvenile spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a distinct disease to adult SpA, and usually manifests as peripheral arthritis and enthesitis. Importantly, many patients with juvenile SpA continue to be at risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis during their disease course. In this Review, the classification and diagnostic criteria, clinical manifestations and treatment guidelines for juvenile SpA will be discussed.

Anti-TNF agents can be used when NSAIDs fail, but their efficacy has potentially been limited in previous trials by inclusion criteria requiring the presence of established, active disease. Now, not only patients with axial SpA (axSpA) with radiographic signs of sacroiliitis (that is, with ankylosing spondylitis), but also patients in whom structural damage is not-yet-visible radiographically (non-radiographic axSpA) can be included in trials of therapy for axSpA. TNF blockers, it seems already, are at least similarly effective in patients with non-radiographic axSpA as in those with established AS. Short symptom duration and a positive C-reactive protein test at baseline are currently the best predictors for a good response to TNF-blocking agents. Biologic agents besides anti-TNF therapies have so far failed in the treatment of axSpA. New bone formation seems currently to be best prevented by NSAIDs, not by TNF blockers. Whether earlier effective treatment of bony inflammation with anti-TNF therapy will be able to prevent ossification at a later stage has yet to be determined. New classification criteria for peripheral SpA will also allow treatment trials to be conducted more systematically than has previously been possible in this subgroup of patients.","1925":null,"1926":null,"1927":"","1928":"","1929":"","1930":"","1931":"Imaging assessments of the joints of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are challenging, owing to the unique features of the growing skeleton. Traditionally, imaging studies in childhood arthritis have been based on conventional radiography. However, in the past few years, interest in the use of MRI and ultrasonography has increased. As a result, imaging has become a main area of clinical and research investigation in paediatric rheumatology. The chief advance in the field of conventional radiography has been the development and validation of paediatric scoring systems for the assessment of radiographic progression. Several studies have shown that MRI provides a precise quantification of synovitis in children with JIA. Furthermore, a high frequency of bone marrow oedema and bone erosions has been found early in the disease course. Ultrasonography has been proven to be superior to clinical examination in detecting synovitis, tenosynovitis and enthesitis. A high frequency of subclinical synovitis has been demonstrated in patients with JIA who have clinically inactive disease using both MRI and ultrasonography. However, more information from healthy children is needed to enable differentiation of the bone and cartilage abnormalities that reflect damage from those that are part of normal development using MRI or ultrasonography. This Review provides a summary of the current information on conventional radiography, ultrasonography and MRI in JIA and highlights the advantages and limitations of each imaging modality.","1932":"Spondyloarthritis (SpA) defines a group of interrelated diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic-related spondylitis and arthritis, and undifferentiated SpA. The clinical presentation of SpA is heterogeneous, and no single shared distinguishing feature exists for the conditions comprising SpA; in daily practice, diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a combination of symptoms, the findings of physical examination, imaging and laboratory investigations. Several classification criteria have been developed for AS and SpA, which are useful in a research setting but cannot be automatically applied to the diagnosis of individual patients. Currently, MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality available for detection of sacroiliitis, often enabling detection of axial inflammation long before structural lesions are observed radiographically, thus facilitating early diagnosis of axial SpA. However, MRI will never capture all facets of SpA and the expert opinion of a rheumatologist will remain the crucial step in recognition of this disease. In this Review, we discuss diagnosis and classification of AS and SpA, and highlight how MRI might facilitate both processes.","1933":"Adaptation to hypoxia is a critical cellular event both in pathological settings, such as cancer and ischaemia, and in normal development and differentiation. Oxygen is thought to be not only an indispensable metabolic substrate for a variety of in vivo enzymatic reactions, including mitochondrial respiration, but also a key regulatory signal in tissue development and homeostasis by controlling a specific genetic program. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) HIF-1 and HIF-2 are central mediators of the homeostatic response that enables cells to survive and differentiate in low-oxygen conditions. Genetically altered mice have been used to identify important roles for HIF-1 and HIF-2 as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-a potent angiogenic factor and a downstream target of the HIF pathway-in the regulation of skeletal development, bone homeostasis and haematopoiesis. In this Review, we summarize the current knowledge of HIF signalling in cartilage, bone and blood, and pay particular attention to the complex relationship between HIF and VEGF in these tissues revealed by data from research using animal models. The study of these models expands our understanding of the cell autonomous, paracrine and autocrine effects that mediate the homeostatic responses downstream of HIFs and VEGF.","1934":"","1935":"","1936":"","1937":"Despite their different targets, biologic agents used for blockade of TNF and IL-6, inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation and B-cell depletion all have similar beneficial effects on the outcome of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

However, blockade of TNF and IL-6 has a similar inhibitory effect on joint damage progression in patients with either early or late disease. In comparison, B-cell depletion and inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation seem to have a somewhat delayed effect on joint damage (compared with cytokine inhibition), which suggests that these approaches affect upstream pathogenetic events.

This Review provides an overview of validated techniques that are currently available to determine subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatic conditions. Techniques for early assessment of endothelial dysfunction include brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation and laser Doppler flowmetry. Coronary circulation can be assessed by measuring coronary flow reserve using CT, MRI or PET based techniques. The standard indicators of arterial stiffness are pulse-wave velocity and the augmentation index. Carotid atherosclerosis is determined by the common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT) measurement or by the assessment of plaques and plaque areas. The combination of ccIMT with plaque assessment is likely to increase the predictive value of this approach. The potential use of a multimarker approach to increase the diagnostic and prognostic value of these clinical assessments is also discussed.","1947":"","1948":"Rapid-onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major concern for many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cardiovascular events occur more frequently and with earlier onset in patients with SLE compared with healthy individuals. Traditional risk factors, such as altered lipid levels, aging and smoking, do not fully explain this increased risk of CVD, strongly suggesting that autoimmunity contributes to accelerated atherosclerosis. Altered immune system function is recognized as the primary contributor to both the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Multiple manifestations of autoimmunity, including changes in cytokine levels and innate immune responses, autoantibodies, adipokines, dysfunctional lipids, and oxidative stress, could heighten atherosclerotic risk. In addition, multiple SLE therapeutics seem to affect the development and progression of atherosclerosis both positively and negatively. SLE-specific cardiovascular risk factors are beginning to be discovered by several groups, and development of a comprehensive, clinically feasible biomarker panel could be invaluable for identification and treatment of patients at risk of developing accelerated atherosclerosis.

Although early diagnosis is of paramount importance, there are no available validated strategies for assessing SScPAH because reliable evaluation of the structure and function of the right ventricle is difficult owing to its complex geometry. Additionally, myocardial fibrosis might affect cardiac contractility and contribute to heart failure. Modern imaging modalities, such as novel echocardiographic techniques and cardiac MRI, are highly sensitive, quantitative and reproducible methods that allow noninvasive assessment of regional and global myocardial performance without relying on geometric assumptions.

Although it poses a considerable health problem, relatively little remains known about the disease pathogenesis and etiology. In the past decade, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) have emerged as suspects in the development and\/or progression of RA. Citrullinated proteins--containing the amino acid citrulline, generated post-translationally from arginine--are found in the joints of patients with RA, but are not specific for the disease. This situation contrasts with the presence of ACPA, which are mostly found in individuals with RA. Intriguingly, ACPA can also be found in individuals before symptom onset. In these instances the ACPA response seems to be in its infancy, recognizing only a few citrullinated antigens and not using the full isotype repertoire. These characteristics of the ACPA response mature before clinical disease precipitates. Evidence is emerging that ACPA status can further characterize the heterogeneous RA phenotype, not only with respect to outcome, but perhaps also with respect to intervention. This Review summarizes the evolution of the ACPA response and its putative role in disease pathogenesis, as well as its relationship with clinical phenotype and diagnostic potential.","1957":"The importance of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well understood. This knowledge has resulted in the development of anti-inflammatory therapies--either broadly acting (such as steroids) or more specific approaches (such as antibodies against TNF)--with biologic therapies (including TNF inhibitors) revolutionizing the treatment of RA. However, what is less well appreciated in RA are the links between inflammation, blood-vessel formation (angiogenesis) and cellular responses to changes in oxygen tension. Inadequate oxygenation, termed hypoxia, is thought to drive the increase in synovial angiogenesis that occurs in RA, through expression of hypoxia-inducible molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This process promotes further infiltration of inflammatory cells and production of inflammatory mediators, perpetuating synovitis. This Review highlights the molecular pathways activated by hypoxia, and how these pathways might interact with inflammatory signaling to promote and maintain synovitis in RA, with a particular focus on the response of macrophages to hypoxia in the context of RA. Successful treatment of RA, for example with anti-TNF antibodies, reduces levels of proangiogenic factors, including VEGF, and leads to normalization of the vasculature. These processes emphasise the close links between hypoxia, angiogenesis and inflammation in this disease and supports the concept that angiogenesis blockade could be of therapeutic benefit in RA.","1958":"Optimal fracture treatment requires knowledge of the complex physiological process of bone healing. The course of bone healing is mainly influenced by fracture fixation stability (biomechanics) and the blood supply to the healing site (revascularization after trauma). The repair process proceeds via a characteristic sequence of events, described as the inflammatory, repair and remodeling phases. An inflammatory reaction involving immune cells and molecular factors is activated immediately in response to tissue damage and is thought to initiate the repair cascade. Immune cells also have a major role in the repair phase, exhibiting important crosstalk with bone cells. After bony bridging of the fragments, a slow remodeling process eventually leads to the reconstitution of the original bone structure. Systemic inflammation, as observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, multiple trauma or sepsis, can increase fracture healing time and the rate of complications, including non-unions. In addition, evidence suggests that insufficient biomechanical conditions within the fracture zone can influence early local inflammation and impair bone healing. In this Review, we discuss the main factors that influence fracture healing, with particular emphasis on the role of inflammation.","1959":"","1960":"HMGB1 is a non-histone nuclear protein that can serve as an alarmin to drive the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune disease. Although primarily located in the cell nucleus, HMGB1 can translocate to the cytoplasm, as well as the extracellular space, during cell activation and cell death; during activation, HMGB1 can undergo post-translational modifications. The activity of HMGB1 varies with the redox states of the cysteine residues, which are required for binding to TLR4. In addition to stimulating cells directly, HMGB1 can form immunostimulatory complexes with cytokines and other endogenous and exogenous factors. In the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as animal models of this disease, extranuclear expression of HMGB1 is increased and blockade of HMGB1 expression attenuates disease in animal models. In systemic lupus erythematosus, HMGB1 can be a component of immune complexes containing anti-DNA because of its interaction with DNA. In myositis, expression of HMGB1 is enhanced in inflamed muscle and can perturb muscle function. Together, these findings indicate that HMGB1 might be an important mediator and biomarker in rheumatic diseases as well as a target of new therapy.","1961":"Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain in the presence of widespread tenderness, and multiple somatic symptoms. Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for fibromyalgia, research has proliferated and, in a relatively short period, investigators have begun to unravel the etiology and long-term impact of this complex condition. Although the ACR 1990 criteria have been central to fibromyalgia research during the past two decades, a number of practical and philosophical objections have been raised in relation to them. Principally these objections have centered on the use (or lack thereof) of the tender point examination, the lack of consideration of associated symptoms, and the observation that fibromyalgia might represent the extreme end of a pain continuum. In developing the ACR 2010 criteria, experts have sought to address these issues and to simplify clinical diagnosis. An implicit aim was to facilitate more rigorous study of etiology. The purpose of this Review is to summarize research to date that has described the epidemiology, pathology and clinical course of fibromyalgia, and to assess the probable impact of the ACR 2010 criteria on future research efforts.","1962":"","1963":"","1964":"","1965":"The association between joint damage and disability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), especially in the later stages of disease, is a main reason why radiographic joint damage is a common and valid outcome measure in RA clinical trials. Most studies have assessed the effect of global joint damage, which has limited our knowledge regarding the individual effects of erosions and cartilage damage on physical function. However, recent data have indicated that joint space narrowing is more closely related to functional status than erosions. Modern imaging techniques that provide improved assessment of the cartilage itself, instead of only joint space narrowing, might help disentangle the separate associations of erosive bone damage and cartilage damage with physical function in patients with RA. The aim of this article is to discuss the current knowledge within this field and the clinical consequences thereof.","1966":"In almost all patients with incident fractures, the absolute risk of subsequent fracture and mortality is highest immediately after the fracture is incurred; the risk is substantially increased in frail elderly patients. The risk factors for incident fractures, such as bone fragility, tendency to fall and the presence of metabolic bone disease, remain underdiagnosed and undertreated. Here, we review the evidence that demonstrates the influence of these risk factors on susceptibility to subsequent fracture and mortality after an incident fracture, and discuss the tools available to predict these outcomes. In this Review, we also propose a systematic, coordinator-based approach to assessment of risk, allocation of treatment and follow-up in all patients over 50 years of age who present with a fracture. The aim of this proposed multistep procedure is to improve the prevention of secondary fracture, decrease mortality rates and reduce patient undertreatment or overtreatment.","1967":"","1968":"That primary osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related disorder is undoubted, but how aging contributes to OA is poorly understood. New insights from 2011 offer potential explanations, novel models for study, and the suggestion that a deeper understanding of what 'aging' actually is might pave the way to everlasting joints.","1969":"Osteoarthritis (OA) has a considerable hereditary component and is considered to be a polygenic disease. Data derived from genetic analyses and genome-wide screening of individuals with this disease have revealed a surprising trend: genes associated with OA tend to be related to the process of synovial joint development. Mutations in these genes might directly cause OA. In addition, they could also determine the age at which OA becomes apparent, the joint sites involved, the severity of the disease and how rapidly it progresses. In this Review, I propose that genetic mutations associated with OA can be placed on a continuum. Early-onset OA is caused by mutations in matrix molecules often associated with chondrodysplasias, whereas less destructive structural abnormalities or mutations confer increased susceptibility to injury or malalignment that can result in middle-age onset. Finally, mutations in molecules that regulate subtle aspects of joint development and structure lead to late-onset OA. In this Review, I discuss the genetics of OA in general, but focus on the potential effect of genetic mutations associated with OA on joint structure, the role of joint structure in the development of OA--using hip abnormalities as a model--and how understanding the etiology of the disease could influence treatment.","1970":"In 2011, new treatment recommendations for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) were proposed, inroads were made towards understanding the heterogeneity of this disease, and data were presented demonstrating the potential efficacy of DMARD combination therapies for JIA treatment.

Preventing joint damage is now a major focus of therapeutic intervention in gout. New light has been shed on the mechanisms leading to cartilage and bone damage in patients with this disease. Here, we discuss basic science studies focusing on the cellular immunology of bone and cartilage in gout and the effects of monosodium urate crystals on signaling pathways, cytokine release and the function of osteoclasts, osteoblasts and chondrocytes. We then explore the use of advanced imaging modalities (including MRI, ultrasonography, CT and dual-energy CT) to investigate pathology in gout, as they provide new ways to visualize joint tissues. These modalities vary in their ability to detect the various pathological features of gout and have different clinical applications. Imaging provides information about the inflammatory nature of the joint lesion, position and size of tophaceous deposits, and extent of bone and cartilage damage. Imaging is also increasingly being used to monitor the progression of joint damage and regression of tophi with effective urate-lowering therapy.","1976":null,"1977":"","1978":"","1979":"","1980":"","1981":"","1982":"","1983":"","1984":"Children and adults who present with severe, newly acquired neurological or psychiatric deficits should be evaluated for an underlying inflammatory brain disease-the inflammation could be reversible, if diagnosed and treated rapidly.

Distinct disease subtypes have been reported with characteristic disease courses, neuroimaging features and histopathological findings. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive comparison of childhood and adult PACNS, revealing distinct gender distributions, characteristic presenting clinical phenotypes and tailored differential diagnosis evaluations in the different subtypes of PACNS. Novel and traditional laboratory markers can help to define disease subtype and activity, whilst MRI and angiography can aid diagnosis in both children and adults. Characteristic patterns of parenchymal lesions and vessel involvement have been identified in PACNS and differ markedly between subtypes. Brain histopathology has also revealed distinct inflammatory pathways at different ages. Immunosuppressive treatment protocols have been shown to be effective and safe across the age spectrum; overall, in the past few years, the mortality of PACNS has decreased dramatically.","1985":"","1986":"","1987":"","1988":"","1989":"","1990":"","1991":"","1992":"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is defined as exposed bone in the oral cavity that persists despite appropriate therapy. Over the past decade, ONJ has been reported in about 5% of patients with cancer receiving high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates, and more recently in similar patients treated with denosumab, another potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. The condition has also been described in patients treated with bisphosphonates for benign diseases, such as osteoporosis, but whether bisphosphonates or denosumab increase the incidence above that seen in untreated patients of comparable age and frailty is yet to be established. The pathogenesis of ONJ is uncertain: the toxic effects of bisphosphonates in a wide variety of cells could increase susceptibility to infections in the oral cavity or impair mucosal healing, and denosumab might interfere with monocyte and macrophage function. Local osteolysis is an important defense against infection on bone surfaces that is blocked by both bisphosphonates and denosumab. Preventive dentistry prior to high-dose antiresorptive therapy is a critical measure in cancer patients, but is not usually justified in patients with osteoporosis. The management of established ONJ lesions is problematic: the greatest success seems to come from vigorous antimicrobial therapy with judicious use of surgical debridement.","1993":"Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disorder. Hand OA is not one single disease, but a heterogeneous group of disorders. Radiographic signs of hand OA, such as osteophytes or joint space narrowing, can be found in up to 81% of the elderly population. Several hand OA subsets--such as nodal interphalangeal OA, thumb base OA and erosive OA--can be discriminated. Furthermore, the experience of symptoms and the course of the disease differ between patients. Studies that used well-defined study populations with longitudinal follow-up have shown that similarities and differences can be observed in the pathogenesis, epidemiology and risk factors of the various hand OA subsets. Erosive OA in particular, characterized by erosive lesions on radiographical images, has a higher clinical burden and worse outcome than nonerosive hand OA. Imaging modalities (such as ultrasonography) have increased our knowledge of the role of inflammation of the disease. Our understanding of the heterogeneous nature of hand OA can eventually lead to increased knowledge of the pathogenesis of, and ultimately new treatment modalities for, this complex disease.","1994":"Reactive arthritis (ReA), an inflammatory arthritic condition that is commonly associated with Chlamydia infections, represents a significant health burden, yet is poorly understood. The enigma of this disease is reflected in its problematic name and in its ill-defined pathogenesis. The existence of persistent pathogens in the arthritic joint is acknowledged, but their relevance remains elusive. Progress is being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of ReA, whereby an imbalance between type 1 and type 2 immune responses seems to be critical in determining susceptibility to disease. Such an imbalance occurs prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response, suggesting that innate cellular and molecular mechanisms in ReA should be prioritized as fruitful areas for investigation.","1995":"","1996":"","1997":"","1998":"Cardiovascular disease represents a major source of extra-articular comorbidity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A combination of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and RA-related factors accounts for the excess risk in RA. Among RA-related factors, chronic systemic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. A growing body of evidence--mainly derived from observational databases and registries--suggests that specific RA therapies, including methotrexate and anti-TNF biologic agents, can reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events in patients with RA. The cardiovascular profile of other biologic therapies for the treatment of RA has not been adequately studied, including of investigational drugs that improve systemic inflammation but alter traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In the absence of large clinical trials adequately powered to detect differences in cardiovascular events between biologic drugs in RA, deriving firm conclusions on cardiovascular safety is challenging. Nevertheless, observational research using large registries has emerged as a promising approach to study the cardiovascular risk of emerging RA biologic therapies.","1999":"The perioperative care of patients with rheumatic diseases is hampered by a lack of evidence-based recommendations. Rheumatologists are called upon to 'clear' their patients for surgery, yet the evidence upon which to base decisions is fractionated and inconsistent. We have systematically reviewed the current literature and developed suggestions for three key areas that require particular deliberations in patients with rheumatic diseases scheduled for surgery: the management of cardiovascular risk, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and states of altered coagulation. For patients with rheumatic diseases associated with increased cardiovascular risk, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, we suggest following the American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association guidelines using the underlying disease as a risk modifier. Most evidence suggests a neutral effect of conventional DMARDs in the perioperative period, with no need to discontinue them prior to surgery. Conversely, we suggest minimizing perioperative steroid use and unnecessary 'steroid preps'. The potential benefits of discontinuing biologic drugs in the perioperative setting needs to be carefully balanced with the risks associated with a disease flare. We discuss the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, which classify individuals with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome as high-risk patients for perioperative thrombosis who are likely to require bridging therapy in most perioperative settings.","2000":"","2001":null,"2002":"","2003":"Biomarkers have an important influence on the clinical decision-making processes involved in diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, allocation of treatment, and determining prognosis. The clinical usefulness of a biomarker is dependant on demonstration of its validity. Ideally, biomarkers should provide information not available from currently available tests and should be tested as they would be used in clinical practice; however, potential biomarkers could be affected by many different clinical or patient variables-such as disease activity, therapeutic intervention, or the presence of comorbidities--and validation studies might not include all the design features that are required to ensure that the biomarker is a true measure of the clinical process it is intended to reflect. In this Review, we appraise studies that have been conducted to validate six promising new biomarkers for diagnosis, disease activity assessment, or prognosis in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. We discuss the validity of these six biomarkers with particular reference to the features of the studies that lend weight to or distract from their findings. The intent of this discussion is to draw attention to elements of validation study design that should be considered when evaluating the robustness of a biomarker, which differ according to the marker's intended use.","2004":"","2005":"Fibrosis in multiple organs is a prominent pathological finding and distinguishing hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Findings during the past 5 years have contributed to a more complete understanding of the complex cellular and molecular underpinning of fibrosis in SSc. Fibroblasts, the principal effector cells, are activated in the profibrotic cellular milieu by cytokines and growth factors, developmental pathways, endothelin 1 and thrombin. Innate immune signaling via Toll-like receptors, matrix-generated biomechanical stress signaling via integrins, hypoxia and oxidative stress seem to be implicated in perpetuating the process. Beyond chronic fibroblast activation, fibrosis represents a failure to terminate tissue repair, coupled with an expanded population of mesenchymal cells originating from bone marrow and transdifferentiation of epithelial cells, endothelial cells and pericytes. In addition, studies have identified intrinsic alterations in SSc fibroblasts resulting from epigenetic changes, as well as altered microRNA expression that might underlie the cell-autonomous, persistent activation phenotype of these cells. Precise characterization of the deregulated extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways, mediators and cellular differentiation programs that contribute to fibrosis in SSc will facilitate the development of selective, targeted therapeutic strategies. Effective antifibrotic therapy will ultimately involve novel compounds and repurposing of drugs that are already approved for other indications.","2006":"","2007":"","2008":"","2009":"The introduction of targeted therapies has dramatically changed the prognosis of patients with chronic joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). As control of inflammation, and hence of symptoms of disease, is increasingly achieved, more attention is given towards the long-term consequences of these disorders, to the structural damage in the skeletal tissues and to the resulting disability. In AS, bone remodeling with new cartilage and bone formation leading to ankylosis is a striking feature. Clinically successful TNF antagonists do not inhibit radiographic progression of disease. New insights into the molecules involved in ankylosis (such as bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnts) have suggested that the classical paradigm linking inflammation and ankylosis can be challenged, and new concepts of disease onset and progression, with a focus on cell stress and damage, are rapidly evolving. In RA, inhibition of Wnt signaling and defective osteoblast function have been associated with lack of repair. As restoration of tissue integrity and homeostasis is the ultimate goal of therapy, these findings suggest new roads for therapeutic intervention. For patients with AS or RA, such strategies will be critically dependent on further research that defines individual risk factors and need for interventions.","2010":"","2011":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, with glomerulonephritis representing a frequent and serious manifestation. SLE is characterized by the presence of various autoantibodies, including anti-DNA antibodies that occur in approximately 70% of patients with SLE and which contribute to disease pathogenesis. Consequently, immunosuppressive therapies are applied in the treatment of SLE to reduce autoantibody levels. However, increasing evidence suggests that DNA--especially double--stranded DNA-constitutes an important pathogenic factor that is able to activate inflammatory responses by itself in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, modifying the structure of DNA to reduce its pathogenicity might be a more targeted approach for the treatment of SLE than immunosuppression. This article presents information in support of this strategy, and discusses the potential methods of DNA structure manipulation--in light of data obtained from mouse models of SLE--including topoisomerase I inhibition, administration of DNase I, or modification of histones using heparin or histone deacetylase inhibitors.","2012":"","2013":"","2014":"","2015":"Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of rheumatic diseases in the past decade.

Other safety concerns with biologic agents, such as congestive heart failure, demyelinating disease, and hyperlipidemia, are associated with individual agents. Despite all these concerns, the therapeutic indices for biologic agents remain fairly high in relation to non-biologic DMARDs. Available safety data for all biologic agents approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are reviewed in this manuscript. With careful patient selection and appropriate vigilance on the part of treating physicians and other care providers, these compounds can be safely integrated into the therapeutic plan.","2016":"","2017":"During the past 10 years, descriptions of large registries of children with juvenile systemic sclerosis (jSSc) have improved our knowledge of this disease. jSSc differs from the adult disease in presentation as well as disease course.

Subclinical disease, especially cardiac and pulmonary disease, should be specifically sought and appropriately monitored, particularly in the first years of disease. Use of screening pulmonary function tests and high-resolution CT increases the chance of detecting interstitial lung disease. Close attention needs to be paid to cardiac health, with improved understanding of the specific causes of death to aid in the development of preventive measures. Therapies that best balance risks and benefits are likely to differ between children and adults.

In general, compared with the disease in adults, children with DM have more vasculopathy and a greater likelihood of calcinosis, periungual and gingival telangiectasias, and ulceration, but have a better long-term prognosis with improved survival. Adults with DM are more likely to have myositis-specific antibodies, develop interstitial lung disease, have amyopathic disease, and have a marked association with malignancy and other comorbidities. Both diseases have similar features on muscle biopsy and interferon gene signature, although subtle differences can exist in pathogenesis and pathology, such as more capillary loss and a greater degree of C5b-9 complement deposition in affected muscle of juvenile patients. Initiatives are underway to improve classification, markers of disease activity and ability to predict outcome of juvenile and adult DM. The purpose of this Review is to compare and contrast the unique features between juvenile and adult disease and to outline new initiatives in the field.","2027":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unclear etiology that affects mostly women of childbearing age. Profound abnormalities in both innate and adaptive immunity triggered by genetic and environmental factors are well documented to play an important part in the pathogenesis of SLE. Nonetheless, the role of neutrophils--the most abundant immune cell type--in the pathology of this disease has been unclear. Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged that implicates neutrophils in the initiation and perpetuation of SLE and also in the resultant organ damage frequently observed in patients with this disease. SLE-derived low-density granulocytes (LDGs) induce vascular damage and synthesize increased amounts of type I interferons and, as such, could play a prominent part in the pathogenesis of SLE. Furthermore, increased cell death and enhanced extracellular trap formation observed in SLE-derived neutrophils might have key roles in the induction of autoimmunity and the development of organ damage in patients with SLE. Together, these events could have significant deleterious effects and promote aberrant immune responses in this disease. This Review highlights the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of SLE, with a particular focus on the putative deleterious effects of LDGs and neutrophil extracellular trap formation.","2028":"","2029":"","2030":null,"2031":"","2032":"","2033":"Rheumatic diseases are associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Understanding this variation will provide insight into the underlying pathogenesis of CVD in patients with rheumatic diseases, and aid in future studies of the detection and management of this complication. In general, although Asian patients seem to have fewer background CVD risk factors and are less affected by metabolic syndrome (MetS) than their non-Asian counterparts, those with rheumatic disease are equally as susceptible to CVD. Furthermore, it seems that systemic inflammation and mechanisms that do not involve conventional CVD risk factors and MetS have an important role in the development of atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatic diseases. Here we examine the frequency of conventional CVD risk factors and the prevalence of MetS in both Asian and non-Asian patients with selected rheumatic diseases.

Although the main assessment measures for PsA are borrowed from the standard criteria used to assess rheumatoid arthritis, a number of new criteria such as the PsAJAI and CPDAI are being developed specifically for PsA. Long-term consequences of untreated PsA include persistent inflammation, progressive joint damage and, in many cases, substantial functional limitations, pain and disability. Moreover, patients with PsA have an increased mortality risk and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Both GRAPPA and the AAD have developed treatment guidelines, which are discussed here. Psoriasis commonly precedes arthritic symptoms; thus, dermatologists are ideally placed to make the initial diagnosis of PsA and treat it appropriately, affording the opportunity to slow disease progression, improve physical function and enhance quality of life.

Over the past decade, the biological interactions between the particulate debris from various implant materials and the immune system have begun to be better understood. The wear debris induces a multifaceted immune response encompassing the generation of reactive oxygen species and damage-associated molecular patterns, Toll-like receptor signaling and NALP3 inflammasome activation.

The enhancement of such mechanisms could be a novel approach to reducing the risk of OA. Aging is one of the most important risk factors for OA; however, aging of joint cartilage is a process that is distinct from the subsequent cartilage changes that develop following the onset of OA. This Review focuses on the mechanisms that maintain cell and tissue homeostasis, and how these mechanisms fail during the aging process. Autophagy is a cellular homeostasis mechanism for the removal of dysfunctional organelles and macromolecules. Defective autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of aging-related diseases and recent observations indicate that this process is compromised in aging cartilage.

Despite the success of this general approach, the mechanisms by which B-cell-directed therapy ameliorates disease, and the role of autoantibodies as biomarkers of clinical response remain unclear. Importantly, although B-cell-directed therapy can reduce the production of some autoantibodies, the effects can be variable and heterogeneous, probably reflecting the critical (but ill-defined) roles of different B-cell and plasma cell populations in autoantibody production. Future studies during clinical trials of these agents are needed to define which B-cell and autoantibody populations are affected (or ought to be), and to discover informative biomarkers of clinical response that can be used to advance this therapeutic approach.","2054":"Biologic therapies have been licensed to treat rheumatic diseases for more than a decade.

In particular, we have sought information, or lessons, that could influence their application in rheumatic diseases. For example, we highlight the potential to stratify asthma into groups that might require different targeted approaches, and focus on some of the less common adverse events associated with biologic therapies in multiple sclerosis. Similarly, we examine type 1 diabetes mellitus in the context of potential therapeutic induction of immune tolerance. Working collaboratively, across specialties, there is significant synergy to be gained in regard to understanding how biologic therapies work, how best to use them, and the adverse effects we should be conscious of.","2055":"Important advances in our understanding of the relationships between adipokines, inflammation and the immune response have been achieved in the past 10 years.

Our rapidly growing knowledge of adipokine biology is revealing the complexity of these amazing proteins, thereby redefining white adipose tissue as a key element of the inflammatory and immune response in rheumatic diseases. Adipokines exert potent modulatory actions on target tissues and cells involved in rheumatic disease, including cartilage, synovium, bone and various immune cells.

The reliability and limitations of rheumatic ultrasonography remain a concern, although good interobserver and intraobserver agreement in results from ultrasonography have been demonstrated among experienced sonographers. International recommendations for assessments and ultrasonography training courses are available, and will improve the standardization of the use of these techniques. In clinical practice, ultrasonography can complement the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rheumatic disease and might have value in confirming and extending clinical findings. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography can also be a valuable follow-up tool to monitor disease activity and support treatment decisions for specific patients. Furthermore, ultrasonography-guided articular injections provide better precision and a higher success rate for synovial fluid aspiration than clinically-guided injections.

One-third or more of patients with sarcoidosis have chronic, unremitting inflammation with progressive organ impairment. Findings of family and genetic studies indicate a genetic susceptibility to sarcoidosis, with genes in the MHC region having a dominant role. Immunologic hallmarks of the disease include highly polarized expression of cytokines produced by type 1 T helper cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) at sites of inflammation. Increasing evidence obtained within the past decade suggests the etiology of sarcoidosis predominantly involves microbial triggers, with the most convincing data implicating mycobacterial or propionibacterial organisms. Innate immune mechanisms, possibly involving misfolding and aggregation of serum amyloid A, might have a critical role in the pathobiology of sarcoidosis. Despite these advances, there are no clinically useful biomarkers that can assist the clinician in diagnosis, prognosis or assessment of treatment effects. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy when organ function is threatened or progressively impaired. The role of immunosuppressive drugs and anti-TNF agents in the treatment of sarcoidosis remains uncertain, and there are no FDA-approved therapies.

Understanding of the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases has grown rapidly in the past decade owing to advances in genome research and technology. Genome-wide linkage analysis, positional cloning, homozygosity mapping and candidate gene screening have led to the identification of mutations in 12 genes that are associated with monogenic diseases. Genome-wide association studies have begun to elucidate the molecular basis of complex autoinflammatory diseases. The discovery of disease-causing genetic variants has defined autoinflammation as disorder within the innate immune system, implicating IL-1 as a master cytokine, and has led to a breakthrough in therapy, with IL-1 inhibitors producing rapid and sustained amelioration of symptoms. Despite major advances, however, a substantial number of patients have no mutations in the known autoinflammatory genes. The challenge now is to find the undiscovered genes, considering that most cases are sporadic or occur within small families. New approaches and tools such as next-generation sequencing are discussed.","2070":"","2071":"","2072":"In the past decade, the availability and abundance of individual-level molecular data, such as gene expression, proteomics and sequence data, has enabled the use of integrative computational approaches to pose and answer novel questions about disease. In this article, we discuss several examples of applications of bioinformatics techniques to study autoimmune and rheumatic disorders. We focus our discussion on how integrative techniques can be applied to analyze gene expression and genetic variation data across different diseases, and discuss the implications of such analyses. We also outline current challenges and future directions of these approaches. We show that integrative computational methods are essential for translational research and provide a powerful opportunity to improve human health by refining the current knowledge about diagnostics, therapeutics and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.","2073":"","2074":"","2075":"","2076":"","2077":"","2078":"","2079":"Stress resilience factors, and interventions to ease stress and enhance resilience, are gaining increasing attention for the treatment of rheumatic conditions. This Review presents a digest of empirical work on the factors that determine the risk of adapting poorly to a rheumatic condition, and on the resilience factors that counteract such risks. We consider the types of stress-management and resilience treatments that are most effective in promoting the physical and psychological functioning of patients at risk of long-term adjustment problems. Prospective research shows that cognitive-behavioral and social risk and resilience factors predict the long-term physical and psychological functioning of patients with rheumatic conditions. Furthermore, validated screening instruments are becoming increasingly useful in clinical practice to identify and select patients at risk. Stress-management and resilience interventions offer promising ways to improve the long-term functioning of patients. These treatment methods might be especially useful when they are tailored to the specific risk and resilience factors of patients, and when they incorporate innovative approaches to the delivery of services, including internet applications such as eHealth, to increase efficiency and availability of treatments, and to optimize patient empowerment in rheumatic conditions.","2080":"","2081":"Bone remodeling consists of two phases--bone resorption and bone formation--that are normally balanced. When bone resorption exceeds bone formation, pathologic processes, such as osteoporosis, can result. Cathepsin K is a member of the papain family of cysteine proteases that is highly expressed by activated osteoclasts. Cathepsin K readily degrades type I collagen, the major component of the organic bone matrix. With such a major role in the initial process of bone resorption, cathepsin K has become a therapeutic target in osteoporosis. The antiresorptive properties of cathepsin K inhibitors have been studied in phase I and phase II clinical trials. Phase III studies are currently underway for odanacatib, a selective cathepsin K inhibitor.","2082":"Various early arthritis clinics have provided extensive data on presentation, disease course and outcomes of early inflammatory arthritis (EIA). The present Review summarizes the epidemiological data from these early arthritis cohorts (EACs), which provide information about the frequency of, risk factors for, and outcomes of EIA and undifferentiated arthritis (UA). The studies demonstrate the large variation in selection criteria and outcome definitions in EACs, which demands careful interpretation of the results. The annual incidence of EIA ranges from 115 to 271 per 100,000 adults, and the incidence of UA ranges from 41 to 149 per 100,000 adults. Depending on the selection criteria used by the specific EACs, 13-54% of patients with UA will develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in 21-87% UA will persist. Epidemiological data from the various EACs has enabled the development of prediction models for persistent and erosive arthritis. These data formed the basis of new classification criteria developed in 2010, which could enable earlier diagnosis and treatment. Future clinical research should focus on the role of imaging techniques in the early detection of synovitis and on the effect of early treatment on the outcomes of EIA.","2083":"","2084":"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) has long been recognized as unique among childhood arthritides, because of its distinctive clinical and epidemiological features, including an association with macrophage activation syndrome. Here, we summarize research into sJIA pathogenesis. The triggers of disease are unknown, although infections are suspects. Once initiated, sJIA seems to be driven by innate proinflammatory cytokines. Endogenous Toll-like receptor ligands, including S100 proteins, probably synergize with cytokines to perpetuate inflammation. These and other findings support the hypothesis that sJIA is an autoinflammatory condition. Indeed, IL-1 is implicated as a pivotal cytokine, but the source of excess IL-1 activity remains obscure and the role of IL-1 in chronic arthritis is less clear. Another hypothesis is that a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis underlies sJIA, with varying degrees of its expression across the spectrum of disease. Alternatively, sJIA with MAS might be a genetically distinct subtype. Yet another hypothesis proposes that inadequate downregulation of immune activation is central to sJIA, supporting evidence for which includes 'alternative activation' of monocyte and macrophages and possible deficiencies in IL-10 and T regulatory cells. Some altered immune phenotypes persist during clinically inactive disease, which suggests that this stage might represent compensated inflammation. Despite much progress being made, many questions remain, providing fertile ground for future research.","2085":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies against citrullinated antigens. The importance of citrulline for the epitopes bound by these autoantibodies, referred to as ACPA (anti-citrullinated peptide\/protein antibodies), was first described in 1998. In addition to citrullinated proteins, cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) can also be used as test substrates for detecting ACPA. The standard test for these antibodies is the second-generation CCP (CCP2) test, which is one of the best in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The generation of ACPA is an early event in the disease course, and is dependent on the presence of certain MHC class II alleles. ACPA in the inflamed synovium have been shown to associate with citrullinated antigens to form immune complexes, resulting in progression of the inflammatory process. The involvement of ACPA in the chronicity of RA is probably the reason why ACPA-positive patients have a more erosive disease course than ACPA-negative patients. The presence of ACPA has been included in the 2010 RA classification criteria. Thus, it is important to further standardize ACPA testing, for example by including an internal serum standard, which may lead to a better distinction between low and high ACPA levels.","2086":null,"2087":"","2088":"","2089":"","2090":"","2091":"","2092":"","2093":"","2094":"","2095":"","2096":"","2097":"The excess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with inflammatory rheumatic diseases has long been recognized. Patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have higher mortality compared with the general population. Over 50% of premature deaths in RA are attributable to CVD. Excess mortality in SLE follows a bimodal pattern, with the early peak predominantly a consequence of active lupus or its complications, and the later peak largely attributable to atherosclerosis. Patients with RA or SLE are also at increased risk of nonfatal ischemic heart disease. The management and outcome of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in patients with RA or SLE differs from that in the general population. Traditional CVD risk factors (TRF) include increasing age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Whereas some TRFs are elevated in patients with RA or SLE, several are not, and others exhibit paradoxical relationships. Risk scores developed for the general population based on TRFs are likely, therefore, to underestimate CVD risk in RA and SLE. Until additional research and disease-specific risk prediction tools are available, current evidence supports aggressive treatment of disease activity, and careful screening for and management of TRFs.","2098":"","2099":"","2100":"","2101":"","2102":"Prepared from the collective plasma of several thousand people, therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) consists mostly of human polyspecific IgG. In addition to its use in primary and secondary immune deficiencies, IVIg is used in the treatment of several rheumatic conditions, including Kawasaki disease, dermatomyositis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis. In these diseases, IVIg therapy generally involves the use of 2 g\/kg administered over either 2 or 5 consecutive days. However, dosage regimens have not been thoroughly explored, and indications for IVIg in most rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, derive from its off-label usage. Randomized clinical trials are warranted to support the evidence-based use of IVIg, and to identify the ideal administration protocols to maximize the benefits of what is a limited resource. Further research to improve the therapeutic application of IVIg relies essentially on the conception of next-generation immunoglobulin preparations and optimization of combined therapies with immunomodulatory drugs and biologic agents.","2103":"","2104":"Glucocorticoids have been exploited therapeutically for more than six decades through the use of synthetic glucocorticoids as anti-inflammatory agents, and are still used in as many as 50% of patients suffering from inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Better understanding of the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids could enable the development of therapies that dissociate the broad-spectrum benefits of glucocorticoids from their adverse metabolic effects. The glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ; also known as TSC22 domain family protein 3) is a glucocorticoid-responsive molecule whose interactions with signal transduction pathways, many of which are operative in RA and other inflammatory diseases, suggest that it is a key endogenous regulator of the immune response. The overlap between the observed effects of GILZ on the immune system and those of glucocorticoids strongly suggest GILZ as a critical mediator of the therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids. Observations of the immunomodulatory effects of GILZ in human RA synovial cells, and in an in vivo model of RA, support the hypothesis that GILZ is a key glucocorticoid-induced regulator of inflammation in RA. Moreover, evidence that the effect of GILZ on bone loss might be in contrast to those of glucocorticoids suggests manipulation of GILZ as a potential means of dissociating the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids from their negative metabolic repercussions.","2105":null,"2106":"Two recent papers that examined the association between oral bisphosphonates and the risk of esophageal cancer reported seemingly discrepant findings, despite both studies using data from the UK General Practice Research Database, from similar time periods. Each paper set out brief conclusions within their abstracts, generating two opposing impressions: that the risk of incident esophageal cancer is not significantly increased with bisphosphonate use, or that the risk is increased when bisphosphonates have been prescribed ten or more times, or for longer than 5 years. Of course, the latter conclusion was more widely reported in the popular press, and with patients arriving at the clinic wanting to discuss the reports, clinicians must be able to interpret the existing evidence correctly. In this article we discuss important methodological issues regarding the two observational studies, define areas of consensus and discrepancy, examine possible bias and confounding, and condense the results into a clinically useful summary.","2107":"","2108":"","2109":"","2110":"","2111":"","2112":"","2113":"","2114":"","2115":null,"2116":"","2117":"","2118":"","2119":"","2120":"","2121":"","2122":"","2123":"A number of studies published over the past 10 years have examined the long-term health, functional and quality of life outcomes of adults with childhood-onset rheumatic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis and localized scleroderma. As increasing numbers of patients with these conditions survive into adulthood, understanding the adult outcomes of these pediatric conditions has become ever-more important. Identifying modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes is vital to improving care for these patients. In addition, as these conditions and their treatments can affect cardiovascular health, bone health and fertility, particular attention needs to be paid to these outcomes.

Insufficient knowledge of the molecular pathways that drive pathogenesis (and underlie the clinical differences between subtypes) has hindered accurate classification, which in turn has been detrimental for clinical research. Nevertheless, new insights into pathogenesis are paving the way for improvements in diagnosis, classification and treatment. Accumulating data suggest that both immune and nonimmune mechanisms cause muscle weakness. Phenotyping of the T cells that accumulate in muscle tissue has identified proinflammatory, apoptosis resistant and cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) CD28(null) populations. Several myositis-specific autoantibodies have been identified, associated with distinct clinical phenotypes. Thus, adaptive immunity is involved in pathogenesis, and both T and B cells are interesting targets for therapy. Furthermore, genotyping has revealed activation of the type I interferon pathway in patients with dermatomyositis or with expression of particular autoantibodies. Decreased release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as a consequence of release of proinflammatory cytokines and high mobility group protein B1, might contribute to muscle weakness, and nonimmune mechanisms potentially include a role for endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and hypoxia. Deeper understanding, careful phenotyping of patients-and new classification criteria-will expedite clinical research.","2129":"Progress in our understanding of the genetics and immunology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has translated into clinical practice with the introduction of a first generation of biologic agents that effectively interfere with the inflammatory cascade by blocking a key component. This evolution has not only changed the way we practice, but perhaps also the way we think about RA and its treatment. In our view direct manipulation of specific pathogenic pathways is increasingly being used to replace generalized pharmacological immune suppression. The next leap forward will be to develop therapeutic approaches that will lead to maintenance of disease remission with a minimal-treatment or even drug-free regimen, relying on the induction of immune tolerance rather than the suppression of the immune system. Immune tolerance has the potential to prevent tissue damage secondary to inflammatory responses while at the same time maintaining homeostasis through physiologic recognition of self and the ability to perceive and react to 'danger'. Novel therapeutic approaches are emerging from these concepts. Such therapies will hopefully be safe and efficacious, and will complement the first generation of biologic agents that are currently available.","2130":"Measurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is in widespread clinical use as a sensitive marker of inflammation. CRP has a role in the clearance of bacteria and of dying and altered cells, and might also have more complex immunomodulatory functions. Impaired clearance of apoptotic cells is important in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), raising the possibility that CRP dysregulation plays a part in this process. We review the available functional and genetic evidence supporting a role for CRP in the pathogenesis of SLE, but recognize that inconsistencies in the existing data mean that conclusions have to be interpreted with caution. More consistent is the evidence that the genetic variants influencing basal CRP level also influence the magnitude of the acute-phase rise in CRP level in active inflammation. Initial reports suggest that these genetic effects might be large enough to directly influence clinical decision-making processes that are based on an interpretation of CRP thresholds. This concept is explored further in this article, particularly in relation to the use of the CRP-based disease activity score in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, where a systematic under-scoring or over-scoring of disease activity could result from a failure to consider the genetic influences on CRP level.","2131":"Seemingly contrasting genetic backgrounds in anti-citrullinated-protein antibody (ACPA)-positive and ACPA-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) support the notion that these are in fact two distinct disease subsets, with different underlying pathogenesis, that might need tailored treatment strategies.","2132":null,"2133":"","2134":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists are effective treatments for immune-mediated inflammatory disorders. The most dreaded adverse events associated with these agents are severe infections. Occasionally, patients develop autoimmune-like syndromes (AILS), which include episodes of lupus-like syndrome, multiple-sclerosis-like demyelination and inflammatory neuropathies. The underlying pathologic mechanisms of these syndromes remain, however, matters of debate. Evidence indicates that the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory nervous system demyelination or peripheral neuropathies in the general population may have infectious etiologies. This article discusses whether infectious agents might also have a role in the development of AILS during anti-TNF therapy. TNF antagonists might facilitate the dissemination of dormant or newly acquired viral or bacterial infections, which either directly promote symptoms that mimic autoimmune diseases or break immunological tolerance and induce autoimmunity in predisposed individuals. The occurrence of AILS during TNF blockade should, therefore, lead to reliable infection screening strategies to identify infection-induced autoimmunity and autoimmune mimics.","2135":"The advent of biologic therapies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has radically changed this therapeutic area. The currently available biologic agents have been studied extensively as part of their development and also during their subsequent years of use in clinical practice; as a result, the knowledge base regarding these therapeutics is very large. Nonetheless, a number of important questions remain and some key issues are still incompletely understood. In this Review, I discuss a number of these unresolved issues, including: the correct placement of biologic therapies in the long-term evolution of the RA disease process, and the expectations associated with such use; comparisons of therapeutic strategies that include conventional as well as biologic agents; optimal dosing of biologic agents; the elusive goal of personalized therapy; and an appraisal of the real impact of biologic therapy on patients' lives. It is concluded that, despite these unresolved issues, important progress has been made and many additional advances in our understanding can be expected during the coming years.","2136":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) results from complex abnormalities of the innate and acquired immune systems. For reasons that are currently not well understood, the disease course and phenotype associated with SLE, although quite variable, are generally more severe when the diagnosis is made during childhood. Active disease, infections, lupus nephritis, and neuropsychiatric SLE manifestations are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Unlike in adult-onset SLE, systemic glucocorticoid therapy and immunosuppressive medications are needed for the treatment of the majority of children and adolescents with SLE. The complex nature of childhood-onset SLE demands a comprehensive, multidisciplinary management approach that considers the patients' growth and development, their educational needs, and the unpredictable course of SLE and its complications.","2137":"The maintenance of adequate bone mass is dependent upon the controlled and timely removal of old, damaged bone. This complex process is performed by the highly specialized, multinucleated osteoclast. Over the past 15 years, a detailed picture has emerged describing the origins, differentiation pathways and activation stages that contribute to normal osteoclast function. This information has primarily been obtained by the development and skeletal analysis of genetically modified mouse models. Mice harboring mutations in specific genetic loci exhibit bone defects as a direct result of aberrations in normal osteoclast recruitment, formation or function. These findings include the identification of the RANK-RANKL-OPG system as a primary mediator of osteoclastogenesis, the characterization of ion transport and cellular attachment mechanisms and the recognition that matrix-degrading enzymes are essential components of resorptive activity. This Review focuses on the principal observations in osteoclast biology derived from genetic mouse models, and highlights emerging concepts that describe how the osteoclast is thought to contribute to the maintenance of adequate bone mass and integrity throughout life.","2138":"OA is not a disease in short supply of phenotypic definitions.

Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression and are sensitive to external stimuli, bridging the gap between environmental and genetic factors. Considerable evidence of epigenetic changes, particularly altered patterns of DNA methylation, exists in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. The importance of such changes in the pathology of rheumatic diseases has been demonstrated by examining the relationship between gene-specific methylation and SLE in monozygotic twins discordant for the disease, in whom genetic variability is excluded as a cause for discordance. Several studies have highlighted the importance of the tissue-specificity of DNA methylation changes, an aspect which-in contrast with genetic analysis-must be considered when designing epigenetic studies. Here I discuss the proposed mechanisms and implications of DNA methylation changes in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, the prospects for future epigenetic studies in rheumatology, the relevance of specific DNA methylation markers and the potential use of drugs with an epigenetic effect in the clinical management of these diseases.","2147":"Several new recommendations for the vaccination of adults with autoimmune inflammatory diseases could represent an important step forward in the prevention of infections in these high-risk patients.","2148":"A substantial proportion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to tumor necrosis factor blocking therapy.

The direction of external forces and limb orientation during walking results in an adduction moment that acts around the knee, and this parameter is regarded as a surrogate measure of medial knee compression. The knee adduction moment is intimately linked with the development and progression of knee OA and is, therefore, a target for conservative biomechanical intervention strategies, which are the focus of this Review. We examine the evidence for walking barefoot and the use of lateral wedge insoles and thin-soled, flexible shoes to reduce the knee adduction moment in patients with OA. We review strategies that directly affect the gait, such as walking with the foot externally rotated ('toe-out gait'), using a cane, lateral trunk sway and gait retraining. Valgus knee braces and muscle strengthening are also discussed for their effect upon reducing the knee adduction moment.","2151":"","2152":"","2153":"","2154":"","2155":"","2156":"","2157":"Persistent and disabling pain is the hallmark of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and various other rheumatologic conditions. However, disease severity (as measured by 'objective' indices such as those that employ radiography or serology) is only marginally related to patients' reports of pain severity, and pain-related presentation can differ widely between individuals with ostensibly similar conditions (for example, grade 4 osteoarthritis of the knee). Increasing evidence in support of the biopsychosocial model of pain suggests that cognitive and emotional processes are crucial contributors to inter-individual differences in the perception and impact of pain. This Review describes the growing body of literature relating depression and catastrophizing to the experience of pain and pain-related sequelae across a number of rheumatic diseases. Depression and catastrophizing are consistently associated with the reported severity of pain, sensitivity to pain, physical disability, poor treatment outcomes, and inflammatory disease activity, and potentially with early mortality. A variety of pathways, from cognitive to behavioral to neurophysiological, seem to mediate these deleterious effects. Collectively, depression and catastrophizing are critically important variables in understanding the experience of pain in patients with rheumatologic disorders. Pain, depression, and catastrophizing might all be uniquely important therapeutic targets in the multimodal management of a range of such conditions.","2158":"Aberrant production of autoantibodies by inappropriately self-reactive plasma cells is an inherent characteristic of autoimmune diseases. Several therapeutic strategies aim to deplete the plasma cell pool, or to prevent maturation of B cells into plasma cells. However, accepted views of B-cell biology are changing; recent findings show that long-lived plasma cells refractory to immunosuppressants and B-cell depletion therapies contribute to the maintenance of humoral memory and, in autoimmunity, to autoreactive memory. As a consequence of their longevity and persistence, long-lived plasma cells can support chronic inflammatory processes in autoimmune diseases by continuously secreting pathogenic antibodies, and they can contribute to flares of symptoms. As long-lived plasma cells are not sufficiently eliminated by current therapies, these findings are extremely relevant to the development of novel concepts for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Thus, long-lived plasma cells appear to be a promising new therapeutic target.","2159":"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a key process in the regulation of immune cell development and peripheral immune homeostasis. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as well as a number of alternative cell death mechanisms, account for immune cell PCD induced by cell-intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In animal models, compelling evidence has emerged that genetic defects in PCD can result in autoimmune disease. Autoimmune disease can arise from single-gene mutations that affect PCD, and defective PCD has been observed in some tissues and cells from patients with rheumatic disease. Selectively inducing PCD in autoreactive B and T cells is very attractive as a therapeutic strategy because it offers the possibility of permanent elimination of these pathogenic cell subsets. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of apoptotic cells may add to the therapeutic benefit of induced PCD. Immune cell subsets vary widely in their sensitivity to specific inducers of cell death, and understanding these differences is key to predicting the outcome of inducing apoptosis for therapeutic means. Here, we review approaches that have been used to induce PCD in the treatment of autoimmune disease, and describe the prospects of bringing these experimental strategies into clinical practice.","2160":"Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recent data suggest that they also suffer greater disability than men with this disease. The reasons for these sexually dimorphic patterns of disease incidence and progression are unknown, but investigations into the underlying mechanisms could provide useful insights into RA pathogenesis and may also suggest new treatment approaches. The processes of sexual differentiation involve genetic input, gonadal hormone signaling and responses from target cells and tissues. Layered upon these processes are behavioral characteristics of males and females acquired as a result of their social context. Differences in disease presentation between the sexes could be the result of complex combinations of all these factors. Recent research suggests that the developmental processes of sexual differentiation might render women more susceptible than men to similar levels of immune or inflammatory burden by virtue of sex-specific differences in body composition and structure.","2161":"Although tens of millions of individuals worldwide use nsaids daily, balancing the competing risks and benefits of these agents continues to be a challenge.

Sulfasalazine and azathioprine are among the most important causes of acute hepatotoxicity. Because such a large number of people take NSAIDs, even the rare occurrence of hepatotoxicity from these agents might contribute substantially to the total burden of drug-induced liver disease. A wide spectrum of hepatotoxic effects is described with antirheumatic drugs. Studies investigating genetic susceptibility to diclofenac hepatotoxicity have expanded our understanding of the potential drug-specific, class-specific and general factors involved in its pathogenesis, and methotrexate-associated liver disease demonstrates the interaction between drug, host and environmental factors that determines the likelihood and magnitude of liver disease. Infliximab therapy is associated with typical drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Although validated causality assessment methods have been used to objectively assess the strength of the association between a drug and a clinical event, in practice the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) involves a clinical index of suspicion, pattern recognition, the establishment of a temporal relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event, and the exclusion of alternative explanations for the clinical presentation. Detailed understanding of genetic and environmental factors underlying an individual's susceptibility would enable risk reduction and potentially primary prevention of hepatotoxicity.","2163":"","2164":"","2165":"","2166":"","2167":"","2168":"","2169":"","2170":"","2171":"","2172":"Mitochondria are important regulators of cellular function and survival that may have a key role in aging-related diseases. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and oxidative stresses are known to contribute to aging-related changes. Osteoarthritis (OA) is an aging-associated rheumatic disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation and elevated chondrocyte mortality. Articular cartilage chondrocytes survive and maintain tissue integrity in an avascular, low-oxygen environment. Recent ex vivo studies have reported mitochondrial dysfunction in human OA chondrocytes, and analyses of mitochondrial electron transport chain activity in these cells show decreased activity of Complexes I, II and III compared to normal chondrocytes. This mitochondrial dysfunction may affect several pathways that have been implicated in cartilage degradation, including oxidative stress, defective chondrocyte biosynthesis and growth responses, increased cytokine-induced chondrocyte inflammation and matrix catabolism, cartilage matrix calcification, and increased chondrocyte apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction in OA chondrocytes may derive from somatic mutations in the mtDNA or from the direct effects of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. Polymorphisms in mtDNA may become useful as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of OA, and modulation of serum biomarkers by mtDNA haplogroups supports the concept that mtDNA haplogroups may define specific OA phenotypes in the complex OA process.","2173":"A 71-year-old woman presented to a rheumatologist with what she believed to be a 2-year history of Lyme disease, progressing from erythema migrans to Lyme arthritis.

This case illustrates the natural history of untreated Lyme disease, which is rarely observed in most patients since diagnosis almost always leads to successful antibiotic treatment.

Current pathophysiological concepts focus on OA as a disease of the whole joint. Within these models, the functional unit formed by the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone seems to be of particular interest. Cartilage and bone receive and dissipate the stress associated with movement and loading, and are therefore continuously challenged biomechanically. Recent data support the view that cartilage and bone can communicate over the calcified tissue barrier; vessels reach out from bone into the cartilage zone, patches of uncalcified cartilage are in contact with bone, and microcracks and fissures further facilitate transfer of molecules. Several molecular signaling pathways such as bone morphogenetic proteins and Wnts are hypothesized to have a role in OA and can activate cellular and molecular processes in both cartilage and bone cells. In addition, intracellular activation of different kinase cascades seems to be involved in the molecular crosstalk between cartilage and bone cells. Further research is required to integrate these different elements into a comprehensive approach that will increase our understanding of the disease processes in OA, and that could lead to the development of specific therapeutics or treatment strategies.","2183":"","2184":"Glucocorticoids are widely used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The disease-modifying potential of low to medium doses of glucocorticoids has been reconfirmed in the past decade, and co-administration of DMARDs and glucocorticoids has become standard in many treatment protocols, especially those for early disease stages but also for long-standing RA. The glucocorticoid regimens used range from continuous low doses to intermittent high doses. Studies of the rationale for and clinical use of glucocorticoids as co-therapy with DMARDs in RA have shown that this approach has a place in modern (tight control) treatment strategies, and that glucocorticoid co-therapy has disease-modifying effects during the first 2 years of treatment in patients with early RA. Furthermore, medium and high doses of glucocorticoids are useful for bridging the interval between initiation of DMARDs and onset of their therapeutic effect. Intra-articular glucocorticoids give good local control and have been used in tight control strategies. New glucocorticoid compounds are becoming available for clinical use that might have an enhanced risk:benefit ratio.

However, new data about the early processes in articular cartilage and new tools to identify the early stages of OA are providing fresh insights into the pathological sequence of events. The progressive destruction of cartilage involves degradation of matrix constituents, and rather active, yet inefficient, repair attempts. The release of fragmented molecules provides opportunities to monitor the disease process in patients, and to investigate whether these fragments are involved in propagating OA, for example, by inducing inflammation. The role of bone has not been fully elucidated, but changes in bone seem to be secondary to alterations in articular cartilage, which change the mechanical environment of the bone cells and induce them, in turn, to modulate tissue structure.","2191":"","2192":"Lower-extremity muscle strength and afferent sensory dysfunction, such as reduced proprioceptive acuity, are potentially modifiable putative risk factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Findings from current studies suggest that muscle weakness is a predictor of knee OA onset, while there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of muscle weakness in OA progression. In contrast, the literature suggests a role for afferent sensory dysfunction in OA progression but not necessarily in OA onset. The few pilot exercise studies performed in patients who are at risk of incident OA indicate a possibility for achieving preventive structure or load modifications. In contrast, large randomized controlled trials of patients with established OA have failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of strengthening exercises. Subgroups of individuals who are at increased risk of knee OA (such as those with previous knee injuries) are easily identified, and may benefit from exercise interventions to prevent or delay OA onset.","2193":"Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition (CPPD) is associated with ageing and osteoarthritis, and with uncommon disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, hemochromatosis and hypophosphatasia. Elevated levels of synovial fluid pyrophosphate promote CPP crystal formation. This extracellular pyrophosphate originates either from the breakdown of nucleotide triphosphates by plasma-cell membrane glycoprotein 1 (PC-1) or from pyrophosphate transport by the transmembrane protein progressive ankylosis protein homolog (ANK). Although the etiology of apparent sporadic CPPD is not well-established, mutations in the ANK human gene (ANKH) have been shown to cause familial CPPD. In this Review, the key regulators of pyrophosphate metabolism and factors that lead to high extracellular pyrophosphate levels are described. Particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms by which mutations in ANKH cause CPPD and the clinical phenotype of these mutations is discussed. Cartilage factors predisposing to CPPD and CPP-crystal-induced inflammation and current treatment options for the management of CPPD are also described.","2194":null,"2195":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and disabling condition for which few safe and effective therapeutic options are available.

This Review describes disease modification and discusses some of the challenges involved in the discovery and development of disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs). A variety of targeted agents are in mature phases of development; specific agents that are beyond preclinical development in phase II and III trials and show promise as potential DMOADs are discussed.

This Review provides a detailed update of the scientific understanding of DD and its clinical management, with perspectives on emerging research and therapy. Established risk factors include genetic predisposition and ethnicity, as well as sex and age. Several environmental risk factors (some considered controversial) include smoking, alcohol intake, trauma, diabetes, epilepsy and use of anticonvulsant drugs, and exposure to vibration. DD has been variously attributed to the presence of oxygen free radicals, trauma to the palmar fascia, or aberrant immune responses with altered antigen presentation, or to interactions between these proposed mechanisms. The presence of immune cells and related phenomena in DD-affected tissue suggests that DD is possibly immune-related. Mechanically, digital contracture is caused by myofibroblasts in the DD palmar fascia; however, the exact origin of this cell type remains unknown. The mainstay of treatment is surgical release or excision of the affected palmodigital tissue, but symptoms often recur. Nonsurgical correction of DD contractures can be achieved by Clostridium histolyticum collagenase injection, although the long-term safety and recurrence rate of this procedure requires further assessment.","2204":null,"2205":"Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common of the hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Although the typical clinical course of FMF is characterized by bouts of painful inflammation, this presentation represents only the tip of the iceberg. In many patients inflammation can persist in attack-free periods, as shown by high levels of acute-phase proteins, cytokines and inflammation-induced proteins. This subclinical inflammation puts patients at risk of developing complications such as anemia, splenomegaly, decreased bone mineral density, heart disease and life-threatening amyloid A amyloidosis, among others. In this article, we review the published data on markers and other factors involved in the persistence of inflammation in patients with FMF during attack-free periods, examine the risk factors for the development of this subclinical inflammation, summarize the complications of chronic inflammation in FMF and propose a new strategy for treatment, based on these data.","2206":"New MRI techniques have been developed to assess not only the static anatomy of synovial hyperplasia, bone changes and cartilage degradation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but also the activity of the physiological events that cause these changes. This enables an estimation of the rate of change in the synovium, bone and cartilage as a result of disease activity or in response to therapy. Typical MRI signs of RA in the pre-erosive phase include synovitis, bone marrow edema and subchondral cyst formation. Synovitis can be assessed by T2-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI or diffusion tensor imaging. Bone marrow edema can be detected on fluid-sensitive sequences such as short-tau inversion recovery or T2-weighted fast-spin echo sequences. Detection of small bone erosions in the early erosive phase using T1-weighted MRI has sensitivity comparable to CT. Numerous MRI techniques have been developed for quantitative assessment of potentially pathologic changes in cartilage composition that occur before frank morphologic changes. In this Review, we summarize the advances and new directions in the field of MRI, with an emphasis on their current state of development and application in RA.","2207":"Clinical trials demonstrate that intensive treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of DMARDs improves short-term outcomes. an extension study from a pivotal trial has now shown that such intensive early therapy can achieve a reduction in the rate of erosive progression over a period of 11 years.","2208":"Bacterial infection is known to trigger a number of autoimmune disorders, an observation that indicates a potentially important role for antibiotics in treating these diseases.

We also review the impact of MRI research on the understanding of disease mechanisms. In our view, the pivotal role of synovitis in RA and its predilection for sonographically accessible joints makes it likely that MRI will be used diagnostically in joints that are inaccessible to ultrasonography or where the differential diagnosis is unclear. Additionally, MRI will probably assume an even more prominent role in clinical trials where the aim of therapy is the complete ablation of synovitis. Given the ever-increasing sophistication of MRI, we anticipate that it will continue to be a key research tool in the coming years.","2222":"","2223":"","2224":"","2225":"","2226":"","2227":"","2228":"","2229":"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) include Wegener granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and renal-limited vasculitis. This Review highlights the progress that has been made in our understanding of AAV pathogenesis and discusses new developments in the treatment of these diseases. Evidence from clinical studies, and both in vitro and in vivo experiments, supports a pathogenic role for ANCAs in the development of AAV; evidence is stronger for myeloperoxidase-ANCAs than for proteinase-3-ANCAs. Neutrophils, complement and effector T cells are also involved in AAV pathogenesis. With respect to treatment of AAV, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide and other conventional therapies are commonly used to induce remission in generalized disease. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide is equivalent in efficacy to oral cyclophosphamide but seems to be associated with less adverse effects. Nevertheless, alternatives to cyclophosphamide therapy have been investigated, such as the use of methotrexate as a less-toxic alternative to cyclophosphamide to induce remission in non-organ-threatening or non-life-threatening AAV. Furthermore, rituximab is equally as effective as cyclophosphamide for induction of remission in AAV and might become the standard of therapy in the near future. Controlled trials in which specific immune effector cells and molecules are being therapeutically targeted have been initiated or are currently being planned.","2230":"Sacroiliitis on conventional radiography, a key diagnostic feature of axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), often appears only late in the disease course. With the introduction of potent biologic agents that may also be effective in early disease, diagnostic techniques that can identify SpA early in the disease course would be highly beneficial to patients. MRI has been proposed as a novel diagnostic tool for early axial SpA based on the visualization of active inflammatory lesions in established axial SpA, as well as in pre-radiographic axial SpA. Accordingly, MRI is already widely used in clinical practice and has been included in new classification criteria. However, the specificity and predictive value of MRI lesions for the development of axial SpA remain to be fully defined and validated. Most data come from cross-sectional analyses and have not been validated in prospective studies, and the few available prospective studies were performed in highly selected patient populations and have assessed the value of MRI for the prediction of sacroiliitis rather than axial SpA. Also, some studies have indicated considerable diversity in the pattern and extent of MRI lesions, and suggest that many lesions are not specific for SpA. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to validate the utility of this new imaging modality for the diagnosis of axial SpA.","2231":"New classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) have been developed and validated. MRI of the sacroiliac joints is an important feature in these criteria. This is rightfully so, as MRI can identify active lesions in the subchondral bone marrow that are thought to be related to the underlying pathophysiological process at the cartilage-bone junction. Follow-up studies using various imaging techniques, including MRI, in unselected patients with undiagnosed back pain of short symptom duration will provide more information on the differential diagnostic capacity of MRI and its predictive value for long-term outcomes. Even longer-term follow-up (&gt;10 years) is necessary to provide reliable data; however, the validity of MRI in the diagnostic process can only be approximated, as it will never cover the entire gestalt of SpA.","2232":"Osteoarthritis (OA), one of the most common rheumatic disorders, is characterized by cartilage breakdown and by synovial inflammation that is directly linked to clinical symptoms such as joint swelling, synovitis and inflammatory pain. The gold-standard method for detecting synovitis is histological analysis of samples obtained by biopsy, but the noninvasive imaging techniques MRI and ultrasonography might also perform well. The inflammation of the synovial membrane that occurs in both the early and late phases of OA is associated with alterations in the adjacent cartilage that are similar to those seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Catabolic and proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E(2) and neuropeptides are produced by the inflamed synovium and alter the balance of cartilage matrix degradation and repair, leading to excess production of the proteolytic enzymes responsible for cartilage breakdown. Cartilage alteration in turn amplifies synovial inflammation, creating a vicious circle. As synovitis is associated with clinical symptoms and also reflects joint degradation in OA, synovium-targeted therapy could help alleviate the symptoms of the disease and perhaps also prevent structural progression.","2233":"","2234":"","2235":null,"2236":"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology, for which there is no cure. This heterogeneous, cutaneous, inflammatory disorder is clinically characterized by prominent epidermal hyperplasia and a distinct inflammatory infiltrate. Crosstalk between immunocytes and keratinocytes, which results in the production of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, is thought to mediate the disease. Given that psoriasis is only observed in humans, numerous genetic approaches to model the disease in mice have been undertaken. In this Review, we describe and critically assess the mouse models and transplantation experiments that have contributed to the discovery of novel disease-relevant pathways in psoriasis. Research performed using improved mouse models, combined with studies employing human cells, xenografts and patient material, will be key to our understanding of why such distinctive patterns of inflammation develop in patients with psoriasis. Indeed, a combination of genetic and immunological investigations will be necessary to develop both improved drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and novel curative strategies.","2237":"Over a decade has now passed since the concept of B cells with a regulatory function was resurrected--B cells that produce antibodies with a suppressive effect were first reported in the 1960s and suppressor B cells in the 2000s. In the meantime, some aspects of regulatory B (B(REG))-cell biology have been elucidated. Not only have scientists begun to unravel the mechanism of how B(REG) cells suppress immune responses and which cells they target, but their ontogeny and development has also begun to be determined. To date, key roles for B(REG) cells have been identified in the regulation of several immune-mediated processes, including autoimmunity and responses to infectious disease and cancer. This Review highlights these advances in the study of B(REG) cells, and outlines what is known about their phenotype as well as their suppressive role in autoimmunity from studies in both mice and humans.

These agents block the production of prostaglandins (PGs) at sites of inflammation by inhibiting the activity of two COX enzymes necessary for PG production and normal organ homeostasis. Inhibition of PG production at sites unrelated to pain is associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The degree of analgesic efficacy, as well as the incidence and the localization of ADRs, are critically influenced by the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution and elimination) of these drugs. Ideally, sufficient and permanent inhibition of COX enzymes should be achieved in target tissues, with minimal ADRs. To minimize underdosing or overdosing, which result in therapeutic failure or ADRs, the COX inhibitor with the most appropriate pharmacokinetic properties should be selected on the basis of a thorough pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis. In this Review, the pharmacokinetics of the prevailing COX inhibitors will be discussed and enigmatic aspects of these intensively used drugs will be considered.","2240":"","2241":"","2242":"","2243":"","2244":"","2245":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic inflammation leading to joint destruction.

In this Review, we discuss the mutual interactions between the opposing forces of T(REG) cells and inflammation in the context of RA. Therapeutic approaches that enhance T(REG)-cell function whilst controlling inflammation are likely to be the most effective strategies for restoring immune tolerance in patients with this disease.","2246":"The treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) has been revolutionized by the use of novel biologic agents that have much improved patients' short-term and, according to early evidence, long-term outcomes. Currently available biologic agents used to treat patients with JIA include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, various agents that target interleukin (IL)-1 and the IL-6 receptor, T-cell co-stimulation inhibitors and antibodies to B-lymphocyte antigen CD20. These agents are increasingly used early in the course of the disease (often in combination with other immunosuppressive medications) and often for long periods of time, as patients can be difficult to wean from their use. Safety concerns (especially the long-term effects of biologic therapy) are, therefore, being examined more closely. For instance, in 2009, the FDA issued a warning related to the development of malignancies in patients with JIA who had used anti-TNF medications for &gt;2.5 years. In this Review, data related to the safety profile of all currently available biologic agents used to treat JIA are examined, with a particular focus on anti-TNF therapy, the most studied biologic agent for JIA. Safety issues that need further study, including the implementation of registries to monitor long-term drug safety, are also discussed.","2247":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that disproportionally affects women, especially in their reproductive years. SLE is associated with considerable pregnancy-related morbidity--including fetal loss, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia. CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(REG)) cells have a potent immunosuppressive function and contribute to immunological self-tolerance. These cells might be essential for successful placental development by ensuring fetal tolerance. The numbers of T(REG) cells are augmented during normal pregnancy and, conversely, diminished numbers are associated with pregnancy loss and pre-eclampsia. Several studies have shown that patients with SLE have decreased numbers of T(REG) cells that might be functionally defective. This defective T(REG) cell functioning could predispose women with SLE to pregnancy complications. This article provides an overview of current knowledge of the role and function of T(REG) cells in SLE and pregnancy and how these cells might contribute to improving pregnancy-related outcomes in patients with SLE in the future.","2248":"Arthritis Research UK published a report in 2009 entitled \"Osteoarthritis and obesity\" in which they highlight the severe consequences of obesity for musculoskeletal health. Throughout the report, however, the mechanical effect of excess body weight is assumed to be the direct cause of osteoarthritis (OA). Although this assumption is common, is it supported by the evidence? A survey of the studies associating OA with obesity is inconclusive on whether body weight is the causative factor. The increase in direct-loading on joints due to weight-gain is not as great as is often believed, and compensatory gait patterns ameliorate much of the kinematic effects. One manifestation of obesity, however, is increased adipose tissue--a rich source of proinflammatory endocrine factors. I propose that body weight might not be the main problem in OA pathogenesis, but that increased adipose tissue itself might be both an indicator and a driver of widespread disease.","2249":"","2250":"","2251":"","2252":"","2253":"","2254":"","2255":"","2256":"","2257":"Microvascular damage and dysfunction represent the earliest morphological and functional markers of systemic sclerosis (SSc), a progressive connective tissue disease characterized by vascular abnormalities and diffuse fibrosis in the skin and internal organs.

Morphological and functional assessment of the cutaneous microvasculature have crucial implications for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in SSc and secondary Raynaud phenomenon. Most importantly, imaging with nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) enables the early differentiation between primary and secondary Raynaud phenomenon by identifying morphological patterns specific to various stages of SSc ('early', 'active' and 'late' patterns); the inclusion of these NVC patterns could increase the sensitivity of classification criteria for SSc. Findings on NVC are also markers of SSc severity and progression, as reduced capillary density has been associated with a high risk of developing digital skin ulcers and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Laser Doppler imaging and thermal imaging demonstrate the dysfunctional cutaneous blood flow in response to cold stimuli. Therapies targeting underlying vascular disease in SSc have been successfully designed to improve the symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon and to reduce ischemic injury to involved organs, and NVC patterns have been found to improve following targeted therapy; however, treatment of later fibrosis remains a challenge.","2258":"Human disorders of hereditary and nonhereditary heterotopic ossification are conditions in which osteogenesis occurs outside of the skeleton, within soft tissues of the body. The resulting extraskeletal bone is normal. The aberration lies within the mechanisms that regulate cell-fate determination, directing the inappropriate formation of cartilage or bone, or both, in tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Specific gene mutations have been identified in two rare inherited disorders that are clinically characterized by extensive and progressive extraskeletal bone formation-fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and progressive osseous heteroplasia. In fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, activating mutations in activin receptor type-1, a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor, induce heterotopic endochondral ossification, which results in the development of a functional bone organ system that includes skeletal-like bone and bone marrow. In progressive osseous heteroplasia, the heterotopic ossification leads to the formation of mainly intramembranous bone tissue in response to inactivating mutations in the GNAS gene. Patients with these diseases variably show malformation of normal skeletal elements, identifying the causative genes and their associated signaling pathways as key mediators of skeletal development in addition to regulating cell-fate decisions by adult stem cells.","2259":null,"2260":"Osteoporosis is an important and complex disorder that is highly prevalent worldwide. This disease poses a major challenge to modern medicine and its treatment is associated with high costs. Numerous studies have endeavored to decipher the pathogenesis of this disease. The clinical assessment of patients often incorporates information about a family history of osteoporotic fractures. Indeed, the observation of an increased risk of fracture in an individual with a positive parental history of hip fracture provides strong evidence for the heritability of osteoporosis. The onset and progression of osteoporosis are generally controlled by multiple genetic and environmental factors, as well as interactions between them, with rare cases determined by a single gene. In an attempt to identify the genetic markers of complex diseases such as osteoporosis, there has been a move away from traditional linkage mapping studies and candidate gene association studies to higher-density genome-wide association studies. The advent of high-throughput technology enables genotyping of millions of DNA markers in the human genome, and consequently the identification and characterization of causal variants and loci that underlie osteoporosis.

Pediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) represents 10-20% of all SLE cases, and is associated with higher disease severity, including more-rapid damage accrual, than adult-onset SLE. As in adults, pSLE disease expression varies according to ethnicity, with a milder disease course in white patients. The majority of pSLE patients will have developed damage within 5-10 years of disease onset, most frequently involving the musculoskeletal, ocular, renal and neuropsychiatric systems. Owing to improvements in disease management and recognition over the past 20-30 years, patients now live longer, but as a result have increased disease damage. Premature atherosclerosis and osteoporosis have become increasingly prevalent morbidities in pSLE patients. Early atherosclerosis leads to a considerable rise in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and failure to develop adequate peak bone mass during adolescence-a crucial period of bone accrual-is likely to lead to early osteoporosis and fractures. Patients with pSLE have an incurable, potentially devastating disease that occurs during a vulnerable period of psychosocial development, leading to specific and unique psychosocial stressors. Additional large, long-term follow-up studies in pSLE are needed to better understand the disease prognosis and to facilitate development of tailored treatments.","2263":"","2264":"","2265":"","2266":"The aim of this Review is to give a short presentation of the manifestations, assessment methods, and mechanisms underlying localized and widespread musculoskeletal pain, deep somatic tissue hyperalgesia and chronification. Hyperalgesia can be explained by increased pain sensitivity of nociceptors located in deep tissue (peripheral sensitization) or by increased responses from dorsal horn neurons (central sensitization). The spreading of pain and sensitization is related to increased synaptic activity in central neurons and to changes in descending control from supraspinal centers. Manifestations related to the different aspects of sensitization can be assessed quantitatively using sensory tests, such as pressure algometry (quantitative palpation) and cuff-algometry. Repeated pressure stimulation can evaluate the degree of temporal summation, which is a proxy for the level of central sensitization, as is expanded referred muscle pain area. The transition of acute localized musculoskeletal pain into chronic widespread pain is related to the progression of peripheral and central sensitization. This sensitization for the chronification of pain should be assessed by adequate pain biomarkers.

There is a clear need for new therapeutic agents that overcome these issues, and biologic agents offer exciting opportunities. B cells, T cells, cytokines and complement are potential targets for these therapies. It is anticipated that the role of B-cell depletion in lupus nephritis will be clarified and that other biologic agents will be developed.

SpA often begins as an 'undifferentiated' disease, the presentation of which differs in children and adults; most notably, spinal involvement is uncommon, while hip arthritis and enthesitis are frequently seen in juvenile-onset disease. Currently, the classification of SpA in adults and children is approached differently. Using the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) system for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, most childhood SpA is classified as enthesitis-related arthritis. However, in contrast to adult SpA classification, the presence of, or a family history of, psoriasis dictates a separate category of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. More importantly, the ILAR system does not specifically recognize the presence of axial disease in juvenile SpA. Resolution of these issues will improve communication and the transitioning of patients from pediatric to adult clinics, will facilitate research in genetics and pathogenesis, and will be particularly important in the evaluation of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and other biologic agents for early, axial SpA.","2281":"Takayasu arteritis, a rare granulomatous vasculitis affecting young people, is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality. In most patients the diagnosis is delayed until after the development of substantial arterial injury. Studies of noninvasive imaging techniques suggest that these approaches might facilitate earlier diagnosis and have a role in monitoring disease progress; however, they remain limited in their ability to accurately quantify inflammatory disease activity in the arterial wall. A lack of controlled clinical trial data complicates the choice of therapy for Takayasu arteritis, and clinical indices for monitoring disease activity are currently suboptimal. Increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of the large vessel vasculitides might eventually lead to novel targeted therapies. Preliminary data from open-label trials of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy are encouraging, but there is an urgent need for controlled clinical trials to establish optimum therapeutic approaches for this disease.

Vascular insufficiency manifests early in the disease, and although there is evidence of an active repair process, capillaries deteriorate and regress. Factors that contribute to the failure of vascular regeneration might include persistent injury, an imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic mediators, intrinsic abnormal properties of the cellular components of the vessels, and the presence of fibroblast-derived antiangiogenic factors. In addition, circulating dysfunctional endothelial progenitor cells might further exacerbate vessel deterioration. Abnormal expression of transcription factors, including Fra2 and Fli1, has been proposed to contribute to SSc vasculopathy. Fli1 regulates genes that are involved in vessel maturation and stabilization, suggesting that reduced levels of Fli1 in SSc vasculature could contribute to the development of unstable vessels that are prone to regression. Conversely, proliferating endothelial cells and pericytes, in the presence of an appropriate stimulus, might transdifferentiate into collagen-producing cells, and thus contribute to the initiation of fibrosis. Despite progress in treating the symptoms of vascular disease in SSc, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. An improved knowledge of the molecular and cellular pathways that contribute to SSc vasculopathy could help in the design of effective therapies in the future.","2287":null,"2288":"Amyloidosis comprises a group of diseases characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins.

Interest in targeting B cells has also been fostered by the successful use of similar interventions to treat other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and by the initial promise shown by B-cell depletion to treat SLE in early studies. Although the initial high enthusiasm has been tempered by negative results from phase III trials of the B-cell-depleting agent rituximab in SLE, renewed vigor should be instilled in the field by the convergence of the latest results using agents that inhibit B-cell-activating factor (BAFF, also known as BLyS and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily, member 13b), further analysis of data from trials using rituximab and greatly improved understanding of B-cell biology. Combined, the available information identifies several new avenues for the therapeutic targeting of B cells in SLE.","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"The prognosis for patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) has improved in the past three decades, with fewer patients succumbing to renal-crisis-related death. While pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension are currently the most frequent causes of death, there is evidence that cardiovascular disease will have an important role in the long-term prognosis of SSc in the future. Ischemia-reperfusion injury and endothelial dysfunction are cardinal features of SSc, and may predispose a patient to microvascular disease and atherosclerosis. In order to alleviate the cardiovascular burden in patients with SSc, it is important to detect endothelial dysfunction, microvascular flow disturbance and atherosclerosis. Noninvasive techniques that evaluate flow-mediated dilatation and arterial pulse waves (endothelial function measurements), microvascular blood flow (measurement of the microcirculation), carotid intima-media thickness and left ventricular hypertrophy (detection of atherosclerosis) are recommended. In addition, these measurements will facilitate trials of therapeutic strategies that, in addition to controlling conventional risk factors, prevent and treat cardiovascular disease in patients with SSc.","2300":"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a potentially disabling form of seronegative spondyloarthritis. The main symptom of AS is inflammatory spinal pain; with time, some patients develop ankylosis and spinal immobility. The pathology mainly affects the entheses, where ligaments, tendons and capsules are attached to the bone. Three processes are observed at the entheses: inflammation, bone erosion and syndesmophyte (spur) formation. Tumor necrosis factor is an important mediator of the inflammatory processes, but this proinflammatory cytokine is not closely involved in bone erosion or syndesmophyte formation. The major causative factors of AS are genetic, with the gene encoding HLA-B27 being the most important genetic factor. Several other susceptibility genes have also been identified. An enormous number of papers have been published and many diverse hypotheses have been generated regarding the pathogenesis of AS. This Review outlines the key areas of current research in this field, describes several hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of AS, which are under intense investigation, and concludes with a dissection of the processes involved in bone erosion and syndesmophyte formation.","2301":"A 19-year-old girl was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, based on findings of arthritis, malar rash, positive antinuclear antibody test and high levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA. Two months after diagnosis, the patient presented with a sudden drop in blood hemoglobin level. Several days later, she developed bloody sputum, rapidly progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia. High-resolution CT showed diffuse alveolar infiltrates in both lung fields. Physical examination, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urinalysis, 24-h urine protein excretion, fecal occult blood test, d-dimer test, acid hemolysis test, activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, direct and indirect Coombs tests, bone marrow smear, arterial blood gas, sputum smear and culture, and high-resolution CT scan of the chest. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient did not respond to pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (two courses of 500 mg per day for 3 days) and intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g per day for 5 days). The patient was referred to a specialist treatment center for allogenic transplantation using umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells. She underwent transplantation with an infusion of 8 x 10(7) mesenchymal stem cells. After showing dramatic improvements in her clinical condition, oxygenation level, radiographic and hematological status, the patient was discharged from hospital approximately 5 weeks after undergoing transplantation. ","2302":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, noncoding, single-stranded RNAs of 19-25 nucleotides in length. They regulate gene expression and are important in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. MiRNAs are attractive as potential biomarkers because their expression pattern is reflective of underlying pathophysiologic processes and they are specific to various disease states. Moreover, miRNAs can be detected in a variety of sources, including tissue, blood and body fluids; they are reasonably stable and appear to be resistant to differences in sample handling, which increases their appeal as practical biomarkers. The clinical utility of miRNAs as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers has been demonstrated in various malignancies and a few nonmalignant diseases. There is accumulating evidence that miRNAs have an important role in systemic rheumatic diseases and that various diseases or different stages of the same disease are associated with distinct miRNA expression profiles. Preliminary data suggest that miRNAs are promising as candidate biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, disease activity and severity in autoimmune diseases. MiRNAs identified as potential biomarkers in pilot studies should be validated in larger studies designed specifically for biomarker validation.","2303":"T cells contribute to the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and seem to be directly involved in the development of related organ pathology. Defects associated with CD8(+) and T-regulatory (T(REG)) cell function manifest in parallel with the expanded CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cell lineage. The cytokine expression pattern is uniquely characterized by decreased expression of interleukin (IL)-2 and increased production of IL-17 and related cytokines. Therapeutic approaches that limit the cognate interaction between T cells and B cells, prevent inappropriate tissue homing and restore T(REG) cell function and the normal cytokine milieu have been entertained. Biochemical characterization of SLE T cells has revealed distinct early and late signaling aberrations, and has enabled the identification of novel molecular targets that can be corrected with small molecules, and biomarkers that may foretell disease activity and predict organ damage.","2304":"Neuropsychiatric events are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but less than one-third of these events can be directly attributed to SLE. Increased generalized SLE disease activity or damage, previous or concurrent major neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) events, and persistently positive moderate-to-high antiphospholipid antibody titers are established risk factors, and their presence could facilitate proper attribution to the disease itself. Diagnostic evaluation is guided by the presenting manifestation; MRI is used to visualize brain or spinal pathologies. For neuropsychiatric events believed to reflect an immune or inflammatory process, or when these events occur in the context of active generalized disease, evidence (primarily from uncontrolled studies) supports the use of glucocorticoids alone or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy. Antiplatelet and\/or anticoagulation therapy is recommended for NPSLE manifestations related to antiphospholipid antibodies, especially for thrombotic cerebrovascular disease. For the future, we anticipate that novel biomarkers and advanced neuroimaging tests will better define the underlying pathologic mechanisms of SLE-related neuropsychiatric disease, and help guide therapeutic decisions.","2305":"Nucleic acids represent the main source of autoantigens in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). DNA and RNA can exit the cell during cell death and, in the extracellular space, can be immunostimulatory. Also extracellularly, DNA and RNA can be incorporated into microparticles (MPs)-small, membrane-bound vesicles released from dying cells by blebbing. We suggest that MPs display autoantigens, such as RNA and DNA, in a highly immunostimulatory manner, enabling them to function as autoadjuvants. In the bone marrow, nucleic-acid-containing MP autoadjuvants might induce B-cell tolerance, whereas in the periphery, they might stimulate mature B cells that have escaped central tolerance. Indeed, because MP autoadjuvants can trigger several receptors, they could effectively provide apoptotic or activating signals to B cells. We would therefore advance the idea that a model for SLE based on MP autoadjuvants can provide a new paradigm to elucidate the mechanisms by which DNA and RNA affect the immune system and critically influence B-cell fate.","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"Great progress has been made in the field of lupus genetics in the past few years, notably with the publication of genome-wide association studies in humans and the identification of susceptibility genes (including Fcgr2b, Ly108, Kallikrein genes and Coronin-1A) in mouse models of spontaneous lupus. This influx of new information has revealed an ever-increasing interdependence between the mouse and human systems for unraveling the genetic basis of lupus susceptibility. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s established that mice prone to spontaneous lupus constitute excellent models of the genetic architecture of human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This notion has been greatly strengthened by the convergence of the functional pathways that are defective in both human and murine lupus. Within these pathways, variants in a number of genes have now been shown to be directly associated with lupus in both species. Consequently, mouse models will continue to serve a pre-eminent role in lupus genetics research, with an increased emphasis on mechanistic and molecular studies of human susceptibility alleles.","2313":"Staggering advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic basis of human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but has this been sufficient to fulfill early predictions that we could use genetics to provide personalized healthcare? Our current understanding of the genetic etiology of SLE indicates a strong underlying genetic predisposition, mediated by multiple gene variants. Compared with other complex genetic diseases, the disease risk imparted by many of these variants is strong. We argue that, for SLE, this particular combination of genetic effects means that the personalized prediction of disease onset or manifestation is certainly a realistic possibility, although further large-scale genetic studies will be required before this becomes a reality. We speculate that, in the future, genetic information could help guide targeted therapeutic intervention.","2314":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease involving most immune cells. Studies in both experimental animal models of lupus and patients with SLE have revealed a number of cytokine pathways that are important in the disease process. Among these are B-cell activating factor, which promotes B-cell survival and autoantibody production, interferon-alpha, which acts as an immune adjuvant, and tumor necrosis factor, which contributes to organ inflammation. This knowledge, in combination with the successful use of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, has spurred the development of several biologic agents targeting different cytokines or their receptors in SLE. Consequently, many trials of anticytokine therapies for SLE are underway. Although most of these trials are small or in early phases, the results of some large studies have also been reported. In this Review, we discuss the rationale for anticytokine therapies in SLE and review agents currently in use, and those being developed and tested experimentally. We present the results from published trials and discuss the tentative conclusions that can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the new agents. Finally, we provide suggestions for the future of treatment for SLE, including new therapeutic strategies.","2315":"The inefficient clearance of dying cells can result in the accumulation of apoptotic cell remnants. This occurrence is considered an intrinsic defect that can cause the permanent presence of cellular debris responsible for the initiation of systemic autoimmunity in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). If postapoptotic debris accumulates in germinal centers, activates complement and functions as a survival signal for B cells that have become autoreactive by somatic hypermutation, autoimmunity could arise (etiology). The accumulation of postapoptotic remnants and fragments derived from secondary necrotic cells in the presence of autoantibodies against apoptotic cells or adaptor molecules obliges their pathological elimination and maintains autoinflammation. The autoimmunity that occurs in patients with SLE involves complex antigens that contain nucleic acids, which can function as virus mimetics. Complexes of autoantibodies, proteins and nucleic acids are likely to be mistaken by the immune system for opsonized viruses, resulting in the production of type I interferons, a hallmark of SLE (pathogenesis). The pathogenicity of autoantibodies is thought to strongly increase if autoantigens are accessible for immune-complex formation. The immune complex could be considered a binary pyrogen formed from less proinflammatory components. The accessibility of cognate autoantigens, in turn, is likely to be related to impaired or delayed clearance of apoptotic cells.","2316":"Anti-C1q antibodies were first identified as low-molecular weight C1q precipitins in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) over 30 years ago. Anti-C1q antibodies are strongly associated with the development of proliferative lupus nephritis, so much so that active renal inflammation in SLE patients is very unlikely if these antibodies are not present. These antibodies seem to develop through mechanisms that are similar to those of other SLE autoantibodies.","2317":"The management of rheumatoid arthritis has greatly improved in the past decade, owing to new treatment strategies and the introduction of agents that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients will discontinue therapy with their first TNF inhibitor for various reasons (for example, non-response, loss of efficacy, or toxicity). Until recently, treatment options for these patients were limited and most rheumatologists chose to switch to treatment with an alternative TNF inhibitor. However, biologic agents with different modes of action have now become available. Hence, the dilemma now facing rheumatologists presented with patients who fail to respond to anti-TNF therapy is whether to switch to an alternative TNF inhibitor or to change to a biologic agent of a different drug class. This article discusses the evidence relating to these two options.","2318":"The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies has been shown to be related to an increased risk of thrombotic events. In patients with definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), that is, those who have had thrombosis and at least two positive determinations of antiphospholipid antibodies, secondary thromboprophylaxis with long-term anticoagulation therapy results in a low rate of recurrent thrombotic events, ranging from 0.016 to 0.031 events per patient per year. Thrombotic complications are, however, the most common cause of death in APS. The mortality rate in a large European cohort of patients with APS during a 5-year study period was 5.3%, and up to 40% of the deaths in this cohort were attributed to severe thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism. Catastrophic APS is an unusual form of the disease, being observed in less than 1% of reported cases of APS, which is associated with a much higher mortality rate than classical APS. The combined use of anticoagulation, corticosteroids, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy could result in a dramatic reduction in mortality, by approximately 20%, in patients with catastrophic APS.","2319":"Despite recent etiopathogenetic advances, systemic sclerosis continues to be one of the most complex systemic autoimmune disease in terms of its therapeutic management. There is no drug tested for any autoimmune disease that has not also been tested for systemic sclerosis, but none have proven effective. Substantial changes have occurred in the last decade, however, with the appearance of new therapeutic targets and the consequent development of highly selective drugs, some of which, such as endothelin antagonists, are now widely used and others, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, in which much hope has been placed. There is also increasing interest in evaluating drugs that are capable of blocking fibrotic processes mediated by transforming growth factor beta, which are currently used in nonautoimmune diseases (such as antidiabetic drugs or statins). Unfortunately, recent trials on these new molecules have produced negative results. Increasing research into disease-specific therapies targeting distinct biological pathways should continue. In the future, it is hoped that the simultaneous or sequential use of different drugs will provide better results than currently available monotherapies in patients with systemic sclerosis.","2320":"Despite the clinical importance of pain in patients with rheumatic diseases, rheumatologists have not delegated a proportionate amount of effort to its investigation and treatment. Some of the assumptions that have hindered progress in pain management for rheumatologists include a preference for immunologic research over pain research, a reluctance to provide opioid therapy, and inadequate compensation. Contrary to these assumptions, pain management is becoming an area of increasing research and clinical effort in the field of rheumatology. This article discusses how the barriers to effective pain management can be overcome, although the relative differential compensation for psychosocial versus interventional therapy remains a concern. In the future, rheumatologists will need to expend greater time and effort in the study of pain management to remain pertinent to the needs of their rheumatic disease patients.","2321":"Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in the community, which can arise from diverse causes. Regardless of the cause, mild cases can often be effectively treated conservatively, with options including rest, physiotherapy, pain relief and glucocorticoid injections. If conservative strategies fail after a 3-6 month period then surgery might be considered. Generally, the proportion of patients with shoulder pain who require surgery is small. When surgery is considered, a clear diagnosis and structural information from imaging are required. The indications for surgery, and success rate, depend on the specific diagnosis as well as on the individual clinical presentation. Evidence from case series suggest that surgical interventions for shoulder pain are effective when used appropriately. This article outlines the surgical management of the most common painful conditions that affect the shoulder, including impingement, rotator cuff tear, frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and calcific tendonitis.","2322":"Arthritis pain has traditionally been evaluated from a biomedical perspective, but there is increasing evidence that psychological factors have an important role in patients' adjustment to arthritis pain. The evolution of pain theories has led to the development of models, such as the cognitive-behavioral model, which recognize the potential involvement of psychological factors in pain. Emotional, cognitive, behavioral and social context variables are useful in understanding pain in patients with arthritis, and have led to the development of psychological approaches for treating arthritis pain. These include pain coping skills training, interventions that include patients' partners, and emotional disclosure strategies.","2323":"Chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis are two musculoskeletal problems that are highly prevalent in the general population, are frequently episodic and persistent, and are associated with high costs to society, both direct and indirect. This epidemiological picture provides the background that justifies the use of self-management strategies in managing these problems. For this Review, relevant systematic reviews were included that related to effectiveness; other study designs were included that addressed other aspects of the topic. The accepted definition of self-management includes liaison between health professionals and individuals with these problems, as well as independent health-promotion activities. Independent self-management strategies, such as exercise and self-medication, are practiced by individuals in the general population. Consistent evidence shows that self-management programs for osteoarthritis are effective in addressing pain and function, but effect sizes are small and might be clinically negligible. Educational programs for patients with back pain are effective in an occupational setting and if combined with an exercise program. Exercise is an effective strategy in the management of both chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, although it is unclear what the optimum exercise is. Exercise, supported by advice and education, should be at the core of self-management strategies for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis.","2324":"The use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain has increased dramatically over the past decade. Whether these drugs provide considerable benefits in terms of pain reduction and improved function to balance the risks associated with their use, however, is unclear. Of particular importance to clinicians treating chronic musculoskeletal pain is opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the activation of pronociceptive pathways by exogenous opioids that results in central sensitization to pain. This phenomenon results in an increase in pain sensitivity and can potentially exacerbate pre-existing pain. Opioids also have powerful positive effects on the reward and reinforcing circuits of the brain that might lead to continued drug use, even if there is no abuse or misuse. The societal risk of increased opioid prescription is associated with increased nonmedical use, serious adverse events and death. Patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain should avoid the long-term use of opioids unless the benefits are determined to outweigh risks, in which case, the use of chronic opioids should be regularly re-evaluated.","2325":"","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a reduced life expectancy when compared with the general population, largely attributable to cardiovascular disease. Factors that contribute to this increased cardiovascular risk include traditional risk factors, which account for only part of the excess, along with manifestations of the disease itself. RA is characterized by inflammation, which also is a key component in the development of atherosclerosis. Inflammation leads to the activation of endothelial cells, which, through an increase in the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, promotes a pro-atherosclerotic environment. Endothelial dysfunction is an early preclinical marker of atherosclerosis, and is commonly found in patients with RA. Several methods are available for the assessment of endothelial function, such as flow-mediated dilatation and laser Doppler flowmetry combined with iontophoresis, each with its own advantages and limitations. Studies have shown that endothelial dysfunction in RA is closely associated with inflammation, and therapeutic reduction of inflammation leads to improvements in endothelial function. As such, assessments of endothelial function could prove to be useful tools in the identification and monitoring of cardiovascular risk in patients with RA. Given the increase in cardiovascular mortality associated with RA, effective management must involve prevention of cardiovascular risk, in addition to control of disease activity and inflammation.","2330":"Tendons are designed to withstand considerable loads. Mechanical loading of tendon tissue results in upregulation of collagen expression and increased synthesis of collagen protein, the extent of which is probably regulated by the strain experienced by the resident fibroblasts (tenocytes). This increase in collagen formation peaks around 24 h after exercise and remains elevated for about 3 days. The degradation of collagen proteins also rises after exercise, but seems to peak earlier than the synthesis. Despite the ability of tendons to adapt to loading, repetitive use often results in injuries, such as tendinopathy, which is characterized by pain during activity, localized tenderness upon palpation, swelling and impaired performance. Tendon histological changes include reduced numbers and rounding of fibroblasts, increased content of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and water, hypervascularization and disorganized collagen fibrils. At the molecular level, the levels of messenger RNA for type I and III collagens, proteoglycans, angiogenic factors, stress and regenerative proteins and proteolytic enzymes are increased. Tendon microrupture and material fatigue have been suggested as possible injury mechanisms, thus implying that one or more 'weak links' are present in the structure. Understanding how tendon tissue adapts to mechanical loading will help to unravel the pathogenesis of tendinopathy.","2331":"Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are generally considered multifactorial-that is, they involve both genetic and environmental factors. Technical advances in human genetics over the past 5 years have enabled the survey of the entire human genome for disease susceptibility genes and have contributed to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmunity. Among the genetic predisposition factors identified to date, some variants have been found to be restricted to specific ethnic groups, which might reflect migration history and the natural selection that shaped genetic variation in these populations. Other genetic factors could also have exerted different magnitudes of risk for the disease among the different populations, which might be explained by their interactions with other genetic and environmental factors. These pieces of evidence suggest that substantial heterogeneity exists in the genetics underlying autoimmunity among different ethnic populations. This Review discusses the genetic heterogeneity in autoimmunity, with a focus on rheumatoid arthritis, between Asian and European populations. In addition to the most-studied and well-characterized gene HLA-DRB1, we will also describe examples of the gene-environment interactions between PADI4 and smoking, and the gene-gene interactions between PTPN22 and FCRL3.","2332":"Methotrexate remains a cornerstone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Folate antagonism is known to contribute to the antiproliferative effects that are important in the action of methotrexate against malignant diseases, but concomitant administration of folic or folinic acid does not diminish the anti-inflammatory potential of this agent, which suggests that other mechanisms of action might be operative. Although no single mechanism is sufficient to account for all the anti-inflammatory activities of methotrexate, the release of adenosine from cells has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Methotrexate might also confer anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of polyamines. The biological effects on inflammation associated with adenosine release have provided insight into how methotrexate exerts its effects against inflammatory diseases and at the same time causes some of its well-known adverse effects. These activities contribute to the complex and multifaceted mechanisms that make methotrexate efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"","2336":"","2337":"Interleukin (IL)-1 was first cloned in the 1980s, and rapidly emerged as a key player in the regulation of inflammatory processes. The term IL-1 refers to two cytokines, IL-1alpha and IL-1beta, which are encoded by two separate genes. The effects of IL-1 are tightly controlled by several naturally occurring inhibitors, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII), and other soluble receptors. Numerous IL-1 inhibitors have been developed and tested primarily in rheumatoid arthritis, with only modest effects. By contrast, the use of IL-1 antagonists has been uniformly associated with beneficial effects in patients with hereditary autoinflammatory conditions associated with excessive IL-1 signaling, such as cryopyrinopathies and IL-1Ra deficiency. Successful treatment with IL-1 blockers has also been reported in other hereditary autoinflammatory diseases, as well as in nonhereditary inflammatory diseases, such as Schnizler syndrome, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult Still disease. The role of microcrystals in the regulation of IL-1beta processing and release has provided the rationale for the use of IL-1 inhibitors in crystal-induced arthritis. Finally, preliminary results indicating that IL-1 targeting is efficacious in type 2 diabetes and smoldering myeloma have further broadened the spectrum of IL-1-driven diseases.","2338":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a prototypical immune-mediated inflammatory disease that is characterized by increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The chronic inflammatory state--a hallmark of RA--is considered to be a driving force for accelerated atherogenesis. Consequently, aggressive control of RA disease activity is thought to be instrumental for cardiovascular risk reduction. Currently, statin-mediated reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels is considered to be the cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention. In addition to their lipid-lowering capabilities, statins exert immunomodulatory effects, which could be of dual benefit in the treatment of RA. Guidelines on the reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with RA are lacking, however, largely owing to the absence of data from randomized controlled trials. This Review focuses on the pathophysiology of cardiovascular events in RA, as well as the need to adjust cardiovascular risk engines to better-accommodate the impact of chronic inflammatory disease over and above the established risk factors to predict cardiovascular risk in patients with RA.","2339":"Evidence strongly suggests that excessive or protracted signaling, or both, by cell-surface or intracellular innate immune receptors is central to the pathogenesis of most autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases. The initiation of aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune diseases can be triggered by microbes and, at times, by endogenous molecules--particularly nucleic acids and related immune complexes--under sterile conditions. By contrast, most autoinflammatory syndromes are generally dependent on germline or de novo gene mutations that cause or facilitate inflammasome assembly. The consequent production of proinflammatory cytokines, principally interferon-alpha\/beta and tumor necrosis factor in autoimmune diseases, and interleukin-1beta in autoinflammatory diseases, leads to the creation of autoamplification feedback loops and chronicity of these syndromes. These findings have resulted in a critical reappraisal of pathogenetic mechanisms, and provide a basis for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for these diseases.","2340":"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers are widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Many studies have demonstrated an increased risk of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and fungal infection in patients treated with TNF blockers, which is thought to be related to the primary role of TNF both in host defense and in the immune response. Little is known, however, about the association between TNF blockade and the development of viral infection. Owing to the critical role of TNF in the control of viral infection, depletion of this cytokine with TNF blockers could facilitate the development or reactivation of viral infection. A number of large observational studies have found an increased risk of herpes zoster in patients receiving TNF blockers for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This Review draws attention to the risk of several viral infections, including HIV, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human papillomavirus, in patients receiving TNF-blocking therapy for chronic inflammatory conditions. In addition, implications for clinical practice and possible preventative approaches are discussed.","2341":"Sciatica is a set of symptoms rather than a specific diagnosis, and is caused by a herniated lumbar disc in the vast majority of cases. The most important symptom is lower limb pain radiating below the knee and into the foot and toes. The clinical course of acute sciatica is generally favorable, with most pain and related disability improving within 2-4 weeks with or without treatment. Diagnosis mainly involves history taking and physical examination. Imaging is warranted if there is evidence of an underlying pathology other than disc herniation, such as infection or malignancy, and in patients with severe symptoms that do not improve after 6-8 weeks of conservative treatment. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, as it can visualize soft tissues better than CT and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation. Conservative treatment is generally the first-line option in patients with sciatica; however, the currently available evidence does not show any intervention--including a broad range of conservative and surgical approaches--to have clearly superior outcomes. Thus, patient preference seems to be an important factor in the clinical management of sciatica.","2342":"The pathogenetic role of autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis (SSc) remains unclear, but these autoantibodies have been established as strong predictors of disease outcome and the pattern of organ complications in patients with this condition. The three most frequently observed types of SSc-specific autoantibody-anti-centromere antibodies, anti-topoisomerase antibodies and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies-are found in over 50% of patients; the presence of each is generally exclusive of the others. Although a lot less frequently observed, antibodies directed against U3RNP and Th\/To are also specific for scleroderma, whereas anti-Pm\/Scl, anti-Ku and anti-U1RNP antibodies are seen mainly in patients with overlap syndromes. Up to 11% of patients with SSc can test negative for antinuclear antibodies. Strong links exist between autoantibody specificities and disease presentation and outcome, which make autoantibodies essential assessment tools in patients with SSc.","2343":null,"2344":"Osteoporosis is a major public health problem through associated fragility fractures. The most common sites of fracture are the hip, spine and wrist, and these have an enormous health and economic impact. All fractures result in some degree of morbidity, but fractures at the hip are associated with the worst outcomes. The worldwide direct and indirect annual costs of hip fracture in 1990 were estimated at US$34.8 billion, and are expected to increase substantially over the next 50 years. Fracture incidence varies between populations, and is set to increase over coming decades as the global population becomes more elderly. This effect will be particularly marked in the developing world, which is additionally assuming more-westernized lifestyles that predispose to increased fracture risk. Strategies to target those at high risk of fracture have been developed, but preventative measures at the public health level are also urgently needed to reduce the burden of this devastating disease.","2345":"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are an innate T-cell lineage known to recognize a range of endogenously derived and exogenously derived glycolipid antigens. Advances in our understanding of this T-cell subset have enabled researchers to investigate the immunomodulatory activity of iNKT cell ligands in experimental models of diseases such as cancer, allergy and chronic inflammatory joint disease. To a large extent, the ability of iNKT cells to regulate such disease models has been ascribed to their capacity to promote a polarized cytokine environment, which is understood to skew adaptive immune responses. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of how iNKT-cell polarization is regulated and relate this basic theory to the proposed role for iNKT cells in models of rheumatologic disease.","2346":"Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a common condition that results in significant morbidity and mortality. The skeletal effects of glucocorticoids include both direct and indirect actions on bone that result in an early, transient increase in bone resorption accompanied by a decrease in bone formation, which is maintained for the duration of glucocorticoid therapy. Rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk occur soon after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and are dose dependent. The increase in fracture risk is partly independent of bone mineral density, probably as a result of changes in bone material properties and an increased risk of falling. Bisphosphonates are the front-line choice for prevention of fracture in glucocorticoid-treated patients, with teriparatide as the second-line option; calcium and vitamin D supplements should be co-prescribed in the majority of individuals. Future guidelines for the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should recognize the limitations of FRAX in assessing fracture risk in glucocorticoid-treated patients, and should include recently approved interventions, such as zoledronate and teriparatide.","2347":"The concept of disease modification in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) incorporates aspects of inflammation, bone destruction and new bone formation. The degree to which inflammation and new bone formation are linked remains conjectural, but data from MRI studies of spinal inflammation support the concept of such coupling; however, these studies also suggest a role for the involvement of noninflammatory pathways, such as those involving bone morphogenetic proteins, wingless proteins and Dickkopf-1, in the formation of new bone. The main clinical outcome that reflects disease modification is the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score, which assesses abnormalities in the anterior vertebral corners of the cervical and lumbar spine. However, radiographic progression can only be reliably detected using this method after at least 2 years, and this delay precludes the conduct of placebo-controlled trials on ethical grounds. Preliminary data using this scoring tool suggest that cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs might reduce disease progression if used continuously over 2 years. By contrast, three different anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies have shown no impact on radiographic progression. Therapeutic trials recruiting patients early in their disease course and at high risk of radiographic progression constitute a high priority for clinical research in AS.","2348":"To date, understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bone metabolism has centered on three tumor necrosis factor family members--RANK, its ligand RANKL and its decoy receptor osteoprotegrin. This view should now be modified, however, to incorporate the role of interferon regulatory factor-8.","2349":"Interactions between HLA and PTPN22 genotypes and smoking have been implicated in overall susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis as well as the incidence of particular disease phenotypes in case-control and case-only studies. As recent epidemiological evidence shows, deciphering these interactions demands consideration of the analytical approach used.","2350":"Minimizing the potential adverse effects of clinical investigators' financial conflicts of interest involves, in part, determining how much of an investigator's \"business\" should be disclosed to participants in research studies.

How will we know if disclosure matters?","2351":"Since the introduction of new biologic agents and intensive treatment strategies that aim to tightly control disease activity, clinical remission has become a realistic target in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Once patients are in continuous remission, however, is it realistic to consider withdrawing DMARD therapy?","2352":"Several lines of evidence both from experimental models and from clinical studies reveal that TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A) and its interaction with death receptor 3 (DR3) is critically involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.","2353":"The main inflammatory myopathies within the myositis group include polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion-body myositis (IBM). Although potentially treatable, various practical issues have an impact on the response of these conditions to therapy. The most common reason for therapeutic failure is that the treatment targets the wrong disease, often owing to poor distinction of polymyositis from difficult-to-treat mimics such as sporadic IBM, necrotizing myopathies and inflammatory dystrophies. Evidence from uncontrolled studies suggests that polymyositis and dermatomyositis respond to treatment with prednisone at least to some degree. Empirically, adding an immunosuppressive drug might offer a 'steroid-sparing' effect or perhaps additional benefit. Intravenous immunoglobulin is proven effective as a second-line agent in patients with dermatomyositis and also seems to be effective for those with polymyositis, but offers only minimal and transient benefit to a small proportion of patients with IBM. Small, uncontrolled series suggest other agents such as rituximab or tacrolimus might offer some benefit in disease refractory to the aforementioned therapies, although IBM is resistant to most therapies. Novel agents are emerging as potential treatment options for all forms of myositis. This Review highlights common pitfalls in therapy, discusses emerging new therapies, and provides a practical therapeutic algorithm.","2354":"Aging and a sedentary lifestyle conspire to reduce bone quantity and quality, decrease muscle mass and strength, and undermine postural stability, culminating in an elevated risk of skeletal fracture. Concurrently, a marked reduction in the available bone-marrow-derived population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) jeopardizes the regenerative potential that is critical to recovery from musculoskeletal injury and disease. A potential way to combat the deterioration involves harnessing the sensitivity of bone to mechanical signals, which is crucial in defining, maintaining and recovering bone mass. To effectively utilize mechanical signals in the clinic as a non-drug-based intervention for osteoporosis, it is essential to identify the components of the mechanical challenge that are critical to the anabolic process. Large, intense challenges to the skeleton are generally presumed to be the most osteogenic, but brief exposure to mechanical signals of high frequency and extremely low intensity, several orders of magnitude below those that arise during strenuous activity, have been shown to provide a significant anabolic stimulus to bone. Along with positively influencing osteoblast and osteocyte activity, these low-magnitude mechanical signals bias MSC differentiation towards osteoblastogenesis and away from adipogenesis. Mechanical targeting of the bone marrow stem-cell pool might, therefore, represent a novel, drug-free means of slowing the age-related decline of the musculoskeletal system.","2355":"A significant body of data implicates the type I interferon (IFN) pathway in the pathogenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In these disorders, a self-reinforcing cycle of IFN production can contribute to immunopathology through multiple mechanisms. Type I IFN cytokines are pleiotropic in their effects, mediating antiviral and antitumor activities, and possess numerous immunomodulatory functions for both the innate and adaptive immune responses. A key principle of the type I IFN system is rapid induction and amplification of the signaling pathway, which generates a feed-forward loop of IFN production, ensuring that a vigorous antiviral immune response is mounted. Although such feed-forward pathways are highly adaptive when it comes to rapid and effective virus eradication, this amplification can be maladaptive in immune responses directed against host tissues. Such feed-forward loops, however, create special opportunities for therapy.","2356":"Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane-bound vesicles that are emerging as important elements in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases owing to their pleiotropic effects on thrombosis, vascular reactivity, angiogenesis and inflammation. Released from cells during activation and apoptosis, MPs carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, and serve as platforms for enzymatic processes in thrombosis. Furthermore, MPs can transfer cytokines, receptors, RNA and DNA to modulate the properties of target cells. As MPs appear in the blood in increased numbers during rheumatic disease, they represent novel biomarkers that can be used to assess events in otherwise inaccessible tissues. Future research will define further the pathogenetic role of MPs and explore therapeutic strategies to block their release or signaling properties.","2362":"Lupus nephritis is a challenging clinical condition for which current therapies are unsatisfactory with respect to both remission induction and unwanted toxic effects. Despite intervention, the rates of end-stage renal disease seem to be increasing in the USA. Discoveries over the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of immune activation and effector inflammatory pathways in lupus nephritis; however, this increased understanding has not yet translated into the approval of an effective new therapeutic agent. An analysis of the mechanisms of action of novel immunomodulatory drugs in multiple models of murine lupus clearly shows that interacting networks of immune and effector pathways are recruited as the disease progresses. Reversing established disease by targeting a single cell population or inflammatory pathway is, therefore, difficult once long-lived autoreactive lymphocyte populations are present and peripheral organs are inflamed. Data from murine models of lupus suggest that we need to consider new paradigms for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus that include earlier immune intervention, long-term maintenance therapies and protection of target organs.","2363":"Analogous to the successful introduction of biologic agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it was widely envisaged that similar successful studies would follow in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as much was known about the etiopathogenesis of the disease and appropriate agents to block the key cells and molecules were available. The reality, however, has been different. The failure of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that induces B-cell depletion, to meet its primary and secondary end points in trials of nonrenal SLE (EXPLORER) and renal (LUNAR) lupus nephritis has been disappointing given the success reported in many open-label studies. Concluding that B-cell-depletion therapy is not effective in SLE seems rather extreme. Further analysis of the as-yet unpublished results and their comparison with data from published studies might provide insight into whether B-cell depletion will eventually be accepted as a useful approach for the treatment of SLE.","2364":"A 54-year-old previously healthy white man presented to hospital with fever, right parasternal pain and swelling over the right second and third costochondral joints. The symptoms had developed 1 week earlier. Physical examination, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, blood and urine culture, plain radiography and CT of the chest, (99m)Tc bone scintigraphy, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of soft tissue mass, Gram staining and culture of aspirated fluid. Meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus costochondritis. CT revealed a 2 x 5 cm soft tissue mass at the posterior aspect of the right second and third costochondral joints. The fluid aspirated contained Gram-positive cocci, and culture revealed the presence of meticillin-sensitive S. aureus. The patient received a 6-week course of flucloxacillin (2 g by intravenous injection every 6 h for 2 weeks, then 1 g orally every 6 h for 4 weeks). He responded well to treatment, and was discharged from hospital.

Sustained inflammation is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Apart from traditional vasculoprotective agents, biologic agents may also exert favorable effects on the vasculature. Indeed, agents that inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF) seem to transiently improve endothelial function. Data regarding the effects of biologic agents on atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness are inconsistent. The effects of the various TNF blockers on dyslipidemia might differ: long-term infliximab therapy could be pro-atherogenic, whereas some studies suggest that etanercept and adalimumab may exert beneficial effects on the lipid profile. TNF blockers have been shown to decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Preliminary data suggest that rituximab also improves endothelial function and dyslipidemia. Further studies are needed to determine the net effects of biologic agents on the vasculature.","2371":"The key to successful management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is early objective quantification of inflammation and ongoing precise, tailored therapy to ensure long term suppression of inflammatory disease activity. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSKUS) has emerged as a tool with the potential to enhance disease assessment and management in this area. This includes applications in patients with undifferentiated arthropathy attending an early inflammatory arthritis clinic, in which the diagnosis of inflammatory disease may be confirmed or refuted at an early stage, and those with treated RA where accurate measurement of outcomes, such as response to therapy, structural damage and disease remission, are extremely important. This imaging modality is safe and portable, making it ideal for outpatient and inpatient settings, and can be used to assess many joints in multiple planes and to demonstrate changes in disease activity and structural damage over time. MSKUS is gaining popularity among rheumatologists, as increasing evidence supports the added value of a physician-performed ultrasonography assessment above traditional clinical, laboratory and radiographic measures, enabling greater confidence in diagnostic and management decisions. Although additional longitudinal data are required and further applications are likely to arise, MSKUS may well possess the necessary attributes to facilitate best practice in inflammatory arthritis management.","2372":"The clinical augmentation of bone currently involves the use of autogenous or allogeneic bone grafts and synthetic materials, all of which are associated with limitations. Research on the safe enhancement of bone formation concerns the potential value of scaffolds, stem cells, gene therapy, and chemical and mechanical signals. Optimal scaffolds are engineered to provide mechanical stability while supporting osteogenesis, osteoconduction and\/or osteoinduction. Scaffold materials include natural or synthetic polymers, ceramics, and composites. The resorption, mechanical strength and efficacy of these materials can be manipulated through structural and chemical design parameters. Cell-seeded scaffolds contain stem cells or progenitor cells, such as culture-expanded marrow stromal cells and multipotent skeletal progenitor cells sourced from other tissues. Despite extensive evidence from proof-of-principle studies, bone tissue engineering has not translated to clinical practice. Much of the research involves in vitro and animal models that do not replicate potential clinical applications. Problem areas include cell sources and numbers, over-reliance on existing scaffold materials, optimum delivery of factors, control of transgene expression, vascularization, integration with host bone, and the capacity to form bone and marrow structures in vivo. Current thinking re-emphasizes the potential of biomimetic materials to stimulate, enhance, or control bone's innate regenerative capacity at the implantation site.","2373":"In the pathogenesis of bone destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the synovium is a site of active interplay between immune and bone cells. The interaction between T cells and osteoclasts is a critical issue in the field of osteoimmunology. Accumulating evidence lends support to the theory that interleukin-17-producing T-helper cells induce the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand in synovial cells, which, together with inflammatory cytokines, stimulates the differentiation and activation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In addition to cellular interactions via cytokines, the immune and skeletal systems share various other molecules, including transcription factors, signaling molecules and membrane receptors. Studies of intracellular signaling mechanisms in osteoclasts have revealed that numerous immunomodulatory molecules are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism. The regulation of immune cells by bone cells is a new feature of the investigative area of osteoimmunology that implies the novel concept of the bone marrow being a crucial part of the immune system. The emerging field of osteoimmunology is important for increasing our understanding of how antirheumatic drugs (including anti-cytokine biologics) work, as well as contributing to the development of new therapeutic strategies for rheumatic diseases.","2374":"Vaccines have been used for over 200 years and are the most effective way of preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with infections. Like other drugs, vaccines can cause adverse events, but unlike conventional medicines, which are prescribed to people who are ill, vaccines are administered to healthy individuals, thus increasing the concern over adverse reactions. Most side effects attributed to vaccines are mild, acute and transient; however, rare reactions such as hypersensitivity, induction of infection, and autoimmunity do occur and can be severe and even fatal. The rarity and subacute presentation of post-vaccination autoimmune phenomena means that ascertaining causality between these events can be difficult. Moreover, the latency period between vaccination and autoimmunity ranges from days to years. In this article, on the basis of published evidence and our own experience, we discuss the various aspects of the causal and temporal interactions between vaccines and autoimmune phenomena, as well as the possible mechanisms by which different components of vaccines might induce autoimmunity.","2375":"A 55-year-old, HLA-B27-positive Finnish woman presented with migratory, sterile polyarthritis. Physical examination, chest radiography, serologic testing, microscopy, M. tuberculosis-specific interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, smear and culture of synovial fluid for acid-fast bacilli, and PCR. The patient's assayed blood and synovial fluid lymphocytes were reactive, and the numbers of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, as determined by ELISPOT, were twofold to sixfold higher in synovial fluid than in blood. Cultures for acid-fast bacilli remained negative, while PCR specific for DNA of the M. tuberculosis complex was positive in synovial fluid cells. These results suggested that the patient had either active or latent M. tuberculosis infection. This finding, coupled with the presence of polyarthritis, led to a diagnosis of Poncet disease. Standard antituberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. Inflamed joints were treated with methylprednisolone injections. The polyarthritis resolved within 4 months of initiating antituberculous therapy.

This Review describes the instruments and imaging techniques available for monitoring SpA in clinical practice. Specifically, questionnaires, physical examination and laboratory tests that can be used to measure physical function, disease activity and pain are discussed. Furthermore, the value of different imaging techniques, including conventional radiography, MRI and ultrasonography, for use in the clinic is described. In the past decade, most of the work on standardizing the monitoring of outcome measures in SpA has focused on ankylosing spondylitis, and similar developments are currently in progress for the monitoring of psoriatic arthritis. This Review, therefore, will focus on these disorders.","2381":"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) refers to a group of chronic childhood arthropathies of unknown etiology, currently classified into subtypes primarily on the basis of clinical features. Research has focused on the hypothesis that these subtypes arise through distinct etiologic pathways. In this Review, we discuss four subtypes of JIA: persistent oligoarticular, extended oligoarticular, rheumatoid-factor-positive polyarticular and rheumatoid-factor-negative polyarticular. These subtypes differ in prevalence between ethnic groups and are associated with different HLA alleles. Non-HLA genetic risk factors have also been identified, some of which reveal further molecular differences between these subtypes, while others suggest mechanistic overlap. Investigations of immunophenotypes also provide insights into subtype differences: adaptive immunity seems to have a prominent role in both polyarticular and oligoarticular JIA, and the more-limited arthritis observed in persistent oligoarticular JIA as compared with extended oligoarticular JIA may reflect more-potent immunoregulatory T-cell activity in the former. Tumor necrosis factor seems to be a key mediator of both polyarticular and oligoarticular JIA, especially in the extended oligoarticular subtype, although elevated levels of other cytokines are also observed. Limited data on monocytes, dendritic cells, B cells, natural killer T cells and neutrophils suggest that the contributions of these cells differ across subtypes of JIA. Within each subtype, however, common pathways seem to drive joint damage.","2382":"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disorder associated with a heterogeneous disease presentation, varied disease expression and an unpredictable but often chronically destructive clinical course. Joint damage can occur early in the disease; indeed, several imaging modalities have demonstrated subclinical joint involvement in psoriasis patients without musculoskeletal signs or symptoms. Efforts are underway to validate questionnaires that will enable dermatologists to screen patients with psoriasis for the presence of musculoskeletal disease. To date, the use of therapies in patients with early PsA has not been reported in randomized controlled trials. Moreover, conventional agents are partially effective in established PsA but, in general, trials with DMARDS have not included validated outcome measures for the different manifestations of PsA. Tumor necrosis factor antagonists can alleviate the signs and symptoms of established psoriatic arthritis and inhibit radiographic progression, but the therapeutic impact of early intervention with these agents requires further study. The extent of disease and the presence of comorbidities should be used to guide treatment decisions and to minimize adverse events.","2383":"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the aging process of the immune system is accelerated. Formerly, this phenomenon was suspected to be a consequence of chronic inflammatory activity. However, newer data strongly suggest that deficiencies in maintaining telomeres and overall DNA stability cause excessive apoptosis of RA T cells, imposing proliferative pressure and premature aging on the system. Already during the early stages of their life cycle, and long before they participate in the inflammatory process, RA T cells are lost owing to increased apoptotic susceptibility. A search for underlying mechanisms has led to the discovery of defective pathways of repairing broken DNA and elongating and protecting telomeric sequences at the chromosomal ends. Two enzymatic machineries devoted to DNA repair and maintenance have been implicated. RA T cells fail to induce sufficient amounts of the telomeric repair enzyme telomerase, leaving telomeric ends uncapped and thus susceptible to damage. Of equal importance, RA T cells produce low levels of the DNA repair enzyme ataxia telangiectasia mutated and the complex of nucleoproteins that sense and fix DNA double-strand breaks. The inability to repair damaged DNA renders naive T cells vulnerable to apoptosis, exhausts T-cell regeneration and reshapes the T cell repertoire. Therapeutic attempts to reset the immune systems of patients with RA and prevent premature immunosenescence should include restoration of DNA repair capability.","2384":"Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are expressed at high levels in rheumatoid joint tissue, where they contribute significantly to inflammation and articular destruction. TNF was the first cytokine to be fully validated as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In nearly a decade since anti-TNF agents-such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab-were launched as the first biologic therapies to be licensed for RA, much has been learnt about how and when in the disease course this class of drug can be used to achieve optimal therapeutic benefit. Other cytokine targets, such as interleukin (IL)-6 or IL-1, have also been validated and several are in the process of being tested. However, TNF is likely to remain the preferred target of first-line biologic therapy for the foreseeable future as, in populations with active RA despite ongoing, nonbiologic, DMARD therapy, biologic inhibition of either IL-6 or IL-1 demonstrates no obviously superior outcomes to TNF blockade. Furthermore, new approaches to blockade of signaling mediated by bioactive TNF might have the potential to generate higher-magnitude clinical responses than are currently elicited.","2385":"B-cell depletion with unconjugated CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. CD20-targeted immunotherapy depletes mature B cells through monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, but does not effectively deplete pre-B or immature B cells, certain peripheral B cell subpopulations, most antibody-producing cells, or their malignant counterparts. As immature B cells expressing autoreactive antigen receptors are not depleted by anti-CD20 mAb, a new strategy for eliminating autoantigen-selected B cells and for treating early lymphoblastic leukemias and\/or lymphomas was developed using CD19-specific mAbs that induce Fcgamma receptor-dependent and monocyte-dependent B-cell depletion. Preclinical studies using transgenic mice expressing human CD19 have shown that pre-B cells and their malignant counterparts, as well as pre-existing antibody-producing and autoantibody-producing cells, are depleted. Therefore, CD19-directed immunotherapy is expected to treat diverse pre-B-cell-related and plasmablast-related malignancies, and humoral transplant rejection. Moreover, in contrast to CD20-directed immunotherapies, CD19 mAbs could purge the B cell repertoire of autoreactive clones and reset the developmental clock to a point that curtails the extent of emerging self-reactivity, in addition to reducing autoreactive T-cell activation through the elimination of mature B cells. Humanized CD19 mAbs are expected to enter clinical trials in 2009, offering a new approach for the treatment of autoimmune disease that removes both immature B cells and antibodies with autoreactive specificities. CD19-directed immunotherapy could, therefore, offer a new horizon in B-cell depletion for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases.","2386":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are central in inducing immunity and in mediating immune tolerance in their role as professional antigen-presenting cells. In the absence of DCs, a fatal autoimmunity develops in animal models. Although the role of DCs has been investigated extensively in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), it remains unclear whether DCs initiate autoimmunity in this disease. Nevertheless, evidence points towards a significant role for DCs in disease maintenance and progression. Current biologic therapies target cytokine products of antigen-presenting cells, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Emerging therapies for RA exploit the tolerogenic capacity of DCs. 'Tolerogenic' DCs can be generated from myeloid precursors ex vivo, loaded with antigen, and manipulated to suppress autoimmune responses in vivo, through the induction of activation-induced cell death, anergy, and\/or regulatory T cells. Cells that are primed by DCs, such as B cells, type 1 and type 17 T helper cells, and that have been implicated in certain models of autoimmunity, are also being considered as additional targets for immune-based therapy. Studies to validate these approaches to ameliorate autoimmunity will be necessary before their application in the clinic.","2387":"Regulatory T cells (TREG) are a subset of CD4+ T cells with a critical role in the prevention of autoimmunity. Whether defects in TREG contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. However, a variety of approved and experimental drugs for RA may work, in part, by promoting the function or increasing numbers of TREG. Furthermore, animal studies demonstrate that direct injection of TREG ameliorates a wide range of experimental models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Thus, cell-based therapy with TREG has the potential to produce durable disease remission in patients with RA.","2388":"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are well-recognized regulators of hematopoiesis and have an established role as growth factors in clinical practice. G-CSF and GM-CSF regulate myeloid cell production, differentiation and activation, and might also be important for driving inflammatory responses. Inappropriate engagement of this pathway could be a critical amplification mechanism when maladaptive immune responses predispose to autoimmunity and sterile tissue inflammation. We postulate that antagonism of G-CSF or GM-CSF could represent a novel therapeutic approach for a variety of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.","2389":"The discovery of interleukin (IL)-17 and its major cell source, the type 17 T-helper (TH17) lymphocyte, has been a major step in the understanding of erosive arthritis. This Review summarizes current knowledge of the role of IL-17 in this context derived from both animal models and studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Evidence shows that IL-17 is present at sites of inflammatory arthritis and that, in synergistic interactions, it amplifies the inflammation induced by other cytokines, primarily tumor necrosis factor. In several animal models of arthritis, inhibition of IL-17 limits inflammation and joint erosion. Initial observations from phase I trials show that signs and symptoms of RA are significantly suppressed following treatment with anti-IL-17 antibodies, without notable adverse effects. The emergence of IL-17 blockade as a future therapy in rheumatoid arthritis is highlighted, along with the potential goals and limitations of this therapeutic approach.","2390":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, debilitating autoimmune disease that results in inflammation and structural destruction of the joints. A hallmark of RA pathogenesis is an imbalance of the osteoblast-osteoclast axis driven by inflammatory processes, resulting in elevated bone resorption by osteoclasts. Current therapies used to treat this disease have focused on inhibition of synovitis, but such treatments do not adequately repair damaged bone. A key pathway of osteoclast formation involves the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) pathway acting on myeloid progenitor cells. The Wnt pathway has been shown to be important for the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal lineage precursors, and endogenous Wnt inhibitors, such as Dickkopf1 and sclerostin, might have important roles in osteoclast dysregulation in RA. Inhibition of the RANKL pathway, or blockade of Dickkopf1 and sclerostin, might serve to restore the osteoblast-osteoclast balance and repair bone erosion in RA joints. Such treatments, in combination with anti-inflammatory therapies, could stabilize and repair damaged joints and have the potential to be valuable additions to the armory of RA treatments.","2391":"Few, if any, areas of medical therapeutics have witnessed such dramatic changes as those that have occurred in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during the past two decades. Improvements in clinical trials methodologies, the introduction of no fewer than nine biologic agents with distinct mechanisms of action, and the development of better strategies for the use of such agents have all contributed to the new age in RA therapeutics. Here, we review these developments and attempt to describe the current landscape of RA therapy in terms of available treatments, agreed-upon principles of RA management, as well as some important controversies in this field. Despite the great pace at which developments are moving, a treatment-free remission for patients with RA remains an elusive goal and unmet medical needs remain. The quest for better therapies for this potentially devastating disease is still as important as ever; research in this exciting area is ongoing, and it is reasonable to hope that, during the next decade, developments will lead to improved, rationally designed, targeted therapies for RA.","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"","2395":"","2396":"Several advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis, as well as in the clinical evaluation and treatment, of early inflammatory arthritis. The presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) has emerged as a major new biomarker for use in clinical practice. The presence of ACPAs can be used to divide patients with early arthritis into subsets that are phenotypically similar but have varying pathogenetic and prognostic features. Although the detection of ACPAs is a major development in the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), prediction of the outcome of arthritis at the individual level can still be much improved. For patients diagnosed with RA, and who have active polyarthritis, treatment is not dependent on the assessment of prognostic factors, as these patients are best treated with combination therapy; over 40% of these patients achieve remission with such treatment. In patients who present with oligoarthritis, however, management should be based on the assessment of prognostic factors. The success of early treatment of inflammatory arthritis and the recognition of a measurable preclinical phase of RA offer hope that treating the disease before it becomes clinically active might be possible.","2397":"Lesions in articular cartilage can result in significant musculoskeletal morbidity and display unique biomechanical characteristics that make repair difficult, at best. Several surgical procedures have been devised in an attempt to relieve pain, restore function, and delay or stop the progression of cartilaginous lesions. Advanced MRI and ultrasonography protocols are currently used in the evaluation of tissue repair and to improve diagnostic capability. Other nonoperative modalities, such as injection of intra-articular hyaluronic acid or supplementary oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have shown potential efficacy as anti-inflammatory and symptom-modifying agents. The emerging field of tissue engineering, involving the use of a biocompatible, structurally and mechanically stable scaffold, has shown promising early results in cartilage tissue repair. Scaffolds incorporating specific cell sources and bioactive molecules have been the focus in this new exciting field. Further work is required to better understand the behavior of chondrocytes and the variables that influence their ability to heal articular lesions. The future of cartilage repair will probably involve a combination of treatments in an attempt to achieve a regenerative tissue that is both biomechanically stable and, ideally, identical to the surrounding native tissues.","2398":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide. Evidence-based guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of OA consider non-pharmacological modalities as the cornerstone of modern OA management. Nonetheless, research evidence from clinical trials on non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hand and hip OA is scarce and considerably less than that for knee OA. In addition, research on non-pharmacological interventions for OA appears highly on the list of patients' research priorities. Thus, there is a clear mismatch between the available research evidence for non-pharmacological interventions for hip and hand OA and both the treatment guidelines and the interests of patients.","2399":"A previously healthy 50-year-old man presented with thickening and hardening of the skin on his trunk, neck and upper extremities that had started after the appearance of a 5 cm web-like patch of blood vessels on his upper chest and progressed over 4 months.

Patients are often asymptomatic, but a subset experience considerable morbidity that can include bone pain and skeletal deformity, as well as a variety of regional complications, such as hearing loss associated with cranial involvement, degenerative arthritis of the hip or knee, fractures of the lower extremities and, rarely, sarcoma or giant cell tumors. Bisphosphonates have proven to be effective in controlling disease activity because they inhibit osteoclast function. Administration of these agents can relieve bone pain, decrease biochemical markers of bone resorption and bone formation, and retard or reverse the early osteolytic phase of the disease. Future studies are needed to determine whether these drugs, if used in an early stage of the disease, can prevent complications in asymptomatic patients.","2408":"Acute or progressive sensorineural hearing loss, with or without vertigo and tinnitus, has a considerable impact upon an individual's quality of life. Sensorineural hearing disorders are more commonly observed in patients with rheumatic disease than in the general population, are more likely to be accompanied by the presence of serum autoantibodies, and might respond to steroid therapy. A subgroup of these disorders seem to be immune mediated, but audiologic presentation and serologic testing do not enable this subgroup to be further defined. Rheumatologists should be prepared to manage patients with known rheumatic disease who develop acute hearing loss and to evaluate referred patients without known rheumatic illness experiencing progressive or refractory sensorineural hearing loss. In this article, we summarize the literature and outline a rational approach for the evaluation and treatment of such patients.","2409":"The incidence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is decreasing, and rheumatologists perceive that their patients are presenting with less-disabling disease. This impression coincides with the availability of improved therapeutic options, including biologic agents. In RA, the term 'disease severity' can be defined from various perspectives: that of the patient, or by measures of disease activity and damage. This Perspectives article examines the scientific basis for a perceived decrease in RA severity over time, as determined by patient-reported outcomes and measures of disease severity and structural damage. An improved health care system and better treatment strategies with access to new therapeutic modalities are likely to have contributed to a milder RA disease course in more-recent years. The focus needs to be kept on these issues to further improve disease severity in patients with RA.","2410":"A 70-year-old female with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was administered etanercept to treat active disease that persisted despite therapy with conventional DMARDs.

Physical examination, neurological examination, nerve conduction studies, measurement of serum inflammatory markers and autoantibodies, MRI of the cranium and cervical spine, and X-rays of the chest and hands. The patient underwent neurosurgery to resect a 1 x 2 cm mass in the cervical spine at C6-C7. Histopathologic examination of the excised mass revealed it to be a meningioma. Etanercept was discontinued because of a possible association between the drug and development of meningioma; however, shortly afterwards the patient experienced a flare of RA symptoms. High-dose NSAIDs and prednisolone were administered, but the patient died because of gastric perforation. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of meningioma developing following use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy, and the first to suggest a cause-effect relationship. ","2411":"Fractures are a clinical consequence of osteoporosis, and represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several treatments have been shown to decrease the risk of fracture, but problems arise in identifying individuals at high fracture risk so that treatments can be effectively targeted. The case for widespread population screening using bone mineral density testing is weak, as these tests lack sensitivity. Case-finding algorithms are available in many countries, but differ markedly in their approaches. Recent developments in fracture risk assessment include the availability of the FRAX (WHO Collaborating Center for Bone Metabolic Disease, Sheffield, UK) tool, which integrates the weight of clinical risk factors for fracture risk with or without information on bone mineral density, and computes the 10-year probability of fracture. The tool increases sensitivity without trading specificity, and is now being used in the reappraisal of clinical guidelines.","2412":"The choice of optimum second-line DMARDs for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is fraught with challenges. The implementation of evidence-based guidelines designed to inform clinicians' decisions requires careful consideration of several important issues.","2413":"Several high-profile institutions are now following the trend of limiting doctors' ties to industry by way of implementing stringent new guidelines. But do the recommendations go far enough?","2414":"Molecules involved in developmental signaling pathways have emerged as therapeutic targets for various rheumatic diseases. New research sheds light on the consequences of interfering with these processes.","2415":"In April 2009, efalizumab was withdrawn from the market for the treatment of psoriasis after reports emerged of an association between long-term therapy and the development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This event highlights an urgent need for greater awareness and research into the screening, diagnosis and treatment of this potentially fatal disease in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for chronic inflammatory disorders.","2416":"As of May 1, 2009, Pubmed listed approximately 30,000 citations on the topic of vitamin D in humans, highlighting the medical community's avid interest in this field. Two articles published in the Archives of Internal Medicine diverge with previous reports on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D and the capability of vitamin D to reduce fractures.","2417":"The lifetime risk of experiencing a fracture in 50-year-old men is lower (20%) than the risk in women (50%). Consequently, much less research has been carried out on osteoporosis and fracture risk in men. Differences in the risk and incidence of fractures between men and women are related to differences in bone-related and fall-related factors between the sexes. During the past decade, progress has been achieved in case finding and fracture prevention in men. Epidemiology studies have better specified the prevalence and incidence of fractures, and insight into the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and fractures in men has progressed considerably. Case finding for men and women at the highest risk of fracture is now possible using the FRAX algorithm, which includes clinical risk factors, with and without bone mineral density, and allows calculation of an individual's 10-year fracture risk. Although strategies to prevent fractures are much less common in men than in women, several treatment options are now available for this purpose. Bisphosphonates, in particular, consistently demonstrate a positive effect on bone mineral density, and some data also indicate decreased rates of vertebral fractures. For men with severe osteoporosis, treatment with the anabolic agent teriparatide might be an effective option.","2418":"The management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed dramatically in recent years, largely because of the unrivaled efficacy of biologic agents in ameliorating clinical disease activity and in preventing joint damage; however, the use of biologic agents is associated with medical risks and socioeconomic costs. Guidance is, therefore, needed to identify those patients who might benefit most from this intensive treatment approach--and to identify those individuals who can be spared the potential adverse effects of such treatment without risking disease progression. As reviewed here, a variety of serological, clinical, immunological, radiological, and genetic markers have been proposed to predict clinical outcome in RA. These markers can all be determined without difficulty; however, with the notable exception of the genetic markers and erosions, these parameters are for the most part indicative of inflammatory disease activity and, therefore, subject to variation. As tight control of disease activity dissociates the prognostic markers from the clinical course, these predictive parameters should be assessed at baseline for every patient and used to guide individualized treatment strategies.","2419":"The discovery of molecular sensors that enable eukaryotes to recognize microbial pathogens and their products has been a key advance in our understanding of innate immunity. A tripartite sensing apparatus has developed to detect danger signals from infectious agents and damaged tissues, resulting in an immediate but short-lived defense response. This apparatus includes Toll-like receptors, retinoid acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors and other cytosolic nucleic acid sensors, and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors; adaptors, kinases and other signaling molecules are required to elicit effective responses. Although this sensing is beneficial to the host, excessive activation and\/or engagement by self molecules might induce autoimmune and other inflammatory disorders.","2420":"Osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from a common pluripotent precursor, the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). Studies have identified numerous transcription factors, and multiple extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways that regulate the closely linked processes of adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. Interestingly, inducers of differentiation along one lineage often inhibit differentiation along the other; for example, the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a prime inducer of adipogenesis that inhibits osteoblastogenesis. The latest research has shown that inducers of osteoblastogenesis (such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 and Wnt ligands) use different mechanisms to suppress the transactivation function of PPARgamma during osteoblastogenesis from MSCs. Signaling via the canonical Wnt-beta-catenin pathway inhibits PPARgamma mRNA expression, whereas signaling via the noncanonical Wnt pathway results in activation of a histone methyltransferase SETDB1 that represses PPARgamma transactivation through histone H3K9 methylation of target genes. This article summarizes Wnt and PPARgamma signaling in MSCs and the crosstalk between these pathways, and speculates on future clinical application of this knowledge as the basis of novel approaches for regeneration therapy.","2421":null,"2422":"A variety of opportunistic pathogens have been reported to infect patients receiving tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. These pathogens are numerous, and include coccidioides, histoplasma, nontuberculous mycobacteria, Mycobacteria tuberculosis, and others of public health concern. Accordingly, TNF antagonists should be used with caution in patients at risk for tuberculosis, and screening for latent tuberculosis infection should be undertaken before anti-TNF therapy is initiated. Although screening and prevention efforts have decreased the risk of tuberculosis in this setting, optimal screening methods represent an area of evolving controversy. This article discusses the latest developments in screening methodologies for latent tuberculosis infection, as well as potential preventive and therapeutic considerations for opportunistic infections associated with anti-TNF agents and other biologic therapies.","2423":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells as they are also known, have been identified in bone marrow as well as in other tissues of the joint, including adipose, synovium, periosteum, perichondrium, and cartilage. These cells are characterized by their phenotype and their ability to differentiate into three lineages: chondrocytes, osteoblasts and adipocytes. Importantly, MSCs also potently modulate immune responses, exhibit healing capacities, improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties might be explained at least in part by the trophic effects of MSCs through the secretion of a number of cytokines and growth factors. However, the mechanisms involved in the differentiation potential of MSCs, and their immunomodulatory and paracrine properties, are currently being extensively studied. These unique properties of MSCs confer on them the potential to be used for therapeutic applications in rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, genetic bone and cartilage disorders as well as bone metastasis.","2424":"With recent advances in molecular medicine and disease treatment in osteoporosis, quantitative image processing of three-dimensional bone structures is critical in the context of bone quality assessment. Biomedical imaging technology such as MRI or CT is readily available, but few attempts have been made to expand the capabilities of these systems by integrating quantitative analysis tools and by exploring structure-function relationships in a hierarchical fashion. Nevertheless, such quantitative end points are an important factor for success in basic research and in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. CT is key to these developments, as it images and quantifies bone in three dimensions and provides multiscale biological imaging capabilities with isotropic resolutions of a few millimeters (clinical CT), a few tens of micrometers (microCT) and even as high as 100 nanometers (nanoCT). The technology enables the assessment of the relationship between microstructural and ultrastructural measures of bone quality and certain diseases or therapies. This Review focuses on presenting strategies for three-dimensional approaches to hierarchical biomechanical imaging in the study of microstructural and ultrastructural bone failure. From this Review, it can be concluded that biomechanical imaging is extremely valuable for the study of bone failure mechanisms at different hierarchical levels.","2425":"","2426":"","2427":"","2428":"","2429":"","2430":"A desire for children or the presence of pregnancy limits the drug therapy options for a woman with rheumatoid arthritis. Combination therapies that include methotrexate or new drugs that have not been studied or used in pregnant patients must be excluded, even though they might be highly efficacious. With few exceptions, the reason for this exclusion is not the proven teratogenicity of the drugs, but the absence of proven safety for the fetus. Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Antimalarial agents, sulfasalazine, azathioprine and ciclosporin are compatible with pregnancy, and so can be administered until birth. Corticosteroids and analgesics such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) can also be used throughout pregnancy. NSAIDs can be safely administered until gestational week 32. The most important consideration when managing rheumatoid arthritis medications during pregnancy is that therapy must be tailored for the individual patient according to disease activity.","2431":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, relapsing-remitting, multisystemic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Much has been written about the clinical course and long-term damage associated with SLE, as well as the reduced life expectancy of patients with this condition. In addition, studies have emphasized the socioeconomic and psychosocial impact of SLE, although the monetary cost of caring for patients with the disorder has only been evaluated in a modest number of studies and a restricted number of countries. SLE has a negative impact on quality of life and is associated with high health-care costs and significant productivity loss. Factors associated with increased cost of SLE include long disease duration, high disease activity and damage, poor physical and mental health, and high education and employment levels. Similarly, high disease activity and damage, poor physical health, certain disease manifestations, as well as poor family and social support are associated with poor health-related quality of life outcomes. SLE incurs a great burden on both the patient and society. Long-term prospective studies should be encouraged to monitor the costs and psychosocial impact of this condition, and to better understand the factors that are associated with poor outcomes.","2432":"Since the current standards for drug approval were established nearly half a century ago, no drug has been approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite this sobering history, interest in drug development for SLE has heightened in the past few years. This enthusiasm has been fueled in large part by the success of biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, despite considerable clinical trial activity, this interest has not yet translated into the discovery of an effective treatment for SLE. This article provides an analysis of the major clinical trials in SLE, and offers an interpretation of the results that could illuminate the path forward.","2433":"A 55-year-old woman with a 5-year history of osteoporosis treated for 4 years with an oral aminobisphosphonate presented with a recent vertebral fracture. A bone biopsy specimen revealed giant osteoclasts with more than 40 nuclear profiles. Bone mineral density determinations, measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact parathyroid hormone, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and creatinine levels, urinary excretion levels of the N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen, and bone biopsy. Examination of the patient and review of the bone specimen. Giant osteoclasts after long-term bisphosphonate use, without evidence of malignancy. Interpretation of the bone biopsy specimen listed several bone disorders. The bone specimen was reviewed and the histological differential diagnosis was carefully considered. The giant osteoclasts were detached from bone and frequently apoptotic in a normal marrow stroma, with low-to-normal amounts of osteoid and osteoblasts. These features are typical of giant osteoclast formation after long-term aminobisphosphonate therapy. the patient was reassured that the bone findings were unlikely to be detrimental. Aminobisphosphonate treatment was reinstituted, and 1 year later the patient was asymptomatic. ","2434":"As critical regulators of numerous cell signaling pathways, tyrosine kinases are implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the absence of disease, synoviocytes produce factors that provide nutrition and lubrication for the surrounding cartilage tissue; few cellular infiltrates are seen in the synovium. In RA, however, macrophages, neutrophils, T cells and B cells infiltrate the synovium and produce cytokines, chemokines and degradative enzymes that promote inflammation and joint destruction. In addition, the synovial lining expands owing to the proliferation of synoviocytes and infiltration of inflammatory cells to form a pannus, which invades the surrounding bone and cartilage. Many of these cell responses are regulated by tyrosine kinases that operate in specific signaling pathways, and inhibition of a number of these kinases might be expected to provide benefit in RA.","2435":"Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a progressive disease that ultimately damages the entire joint. Knee OA should initially be treated conservatively, but surgery should be considered if symptoms persist. Surgical treatments for knee OA include arthroscopy, osteotomy and knee arthroplasty; determining which of these procedures is most appropriate will depend on several factors, including the location and severity of OA damage, patient characteristics and risk factors. Arthroscopic lavage and debridement do not alter disease progression, and should not be used as a routine treatment for the osteoarthritic knee. Bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture are primarily used to treat focal chondral defects; the evidence for the use of these techniques for knee OA remains unclear. The goal of osteotomy for unicompartmental knee OA is to transfer the weight load from the damaged compartment to undamaged areas, delaying the need for joint replacement. This procedure should be considered in young and active patients who are not suitable candidates for knee arthroplasty. For patients with severe OA, total knee arthroplasty can be a safe, rewarding and cost-effective treatment. In selected patients with isolated medial or patellofemoral OA, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and patellofemoral replacement, respectively, can be successful.","2436":"In clinical trials testing new treatments for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the failure of the 15-year drug development program for riquent (abetimus sodium) is the latest in a string of disappointments for a disease that has seen no new drugs approved in over 50 years.","2437":"Two consecutive trials of rituximab, a B-cell-depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, have threatened the future of B-cell-targeted therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While rumors of the demise of this approach might be greatly exaggerated, the outcomes of these studies should force academics and the pharmaceutical industry back to the drawing board.","2438":"The comprehensiveness of clinical guidelines is a major determinant of their usefulness, but covering a broad range of topics in depth can prove difficult.","2439":"A set of recommendations developed by an international panel of experts could have an impact on the care of patients with systemic sclerosis.","2440":"Many people with chronic rheumatic diseases choose to use complementary and alternative therapies on the basis of information from unreliable sources. Does a report from a UK-based arthritis charity meet the need for rigorous, evidence-based recommendations for the public and for health-care providers?","2441":"Emerging evidence points to a critical role for the skeleton in several homeostatic processes, including energy balance. The connection between fuel utilization and skeletal remodeling begins in the bone marrow with lineage allocation of mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes or osteoblasts. Mature bone cells secrete factors that influence insulin sensitivity, and fat cells synthesize cytokines that regulate osteoblast differentiation; thus, these two pathways are closely linked. The emerging importance of the bone-fat interaction suggests that novel molecules could be used as targets to enhance bone formation and possibly prevent fractures. In this article, we discuss three pathways that could be pharmacologically targeted for the ultimate goal of enhancing bone mass and reducing osteoporotic fracture risk: the leptin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and osteocalcin pathways. Not surprisingly, because of the complex interactions across homeostatic networks, other pathways will probably be activated by this targeting, which could prove to be beneficial or detrimental for the organism. Hence, a more complete picture of energy utilization and skeletal remodeling will be required to bring any potential agents into the future clinical armamentarium.","2442":"Rheumatic disease is characterized by inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can restore dysfunctional endothelium and thereby protect against atherosclerotic vascular disease. The number and function of EPCs are, however, affected in rheumatic diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis. rheumatic disease is often characterized by decreased numbers, and impaired function, of EPCs, although numbers of these cells might increase during the initial years of systemic sclerosis. Pioneering studies show that EPC dysfunction might be improved with pharmacological treatment. How best to restore EPC function, and whether achieving this aim can prevent long-term cardiovascular complications in rheumatic disease, remain to be established.","2443":"Type 17 T helper (TH17) cells are a population of CD4+ effector T cells that are distinct from TH1 and TH2 cells owing to their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-17. Although TH1 and TH2 cells are similar in mice and humans, TH17 cells differ in several ways. The differentiation of mouse TH17 cells requires transforming growth factor beta and IL-6, whereas human naive T cells can develop into TH17 cells in the presence of IL-1beta and IL-23 alone, transforming growth factor beta having an indirect role in their development via the selective inhibition of TH1 cell expansion. in both mice and humans, a late developmental plasticity of TH17 cells towards the TH1 lineage has been shown. Mainly based on mouse gene knockout studies, TH17 lymphocytes have been found to have a pathogenic role in several autoimmune disorders; however, whether human autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, are prevalently TH1-mediated or TH17-mediated, is still unclear. research suggests that both TH1 and TH17 cells are involved in RA pathogenesis, raising the possibility that interventions that target both the IL-23-IL-17 (TH17) and the IL-12-interferon gamma (TH1) axes might be successful future therapeutic approaches for RA.","2444":"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of infection compared with the general population. As new DMARDs, in particular biologic agents, become more widely prescribed for the treatment of RA, adverse events that were not previously identified in randomized, controlled trials might develop, including opportunistic and serious infections. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of data derived from randomized clinical trials, registries and meta-analyses is necessary to interpret the results of these studies. Whereas the risk of infection might be increased for the majority of biologic agents that have been approved for use in RA, differences between these agents might affect patients' susceptibility to specific types of infection, immunocompetence and relative risk of infection.","2445":"A 57-year-old Afro-Jamaican woman with an 8-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus, including lupus nephritis, was admitted to hospital with intractable back pain accompanied by fever and severe malaise. At the time of presentation she was receiving immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoids and azathioprine. She also had gout, hypertension and type II diabetes. Physical and neurological examination and laboratory analyses, including biochemical, hematological and electrophoresis tests, X-ray of the lumbar spine, pelvis and chest, mammography, MRI of the lumbar spine, thoracic and abdominal CT, and biopsy of a peripheral lymph node and bone marrow with immunohistochemistry and serology for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) 1 and 2. HTLV-1-associated acute adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration and hypercalcemia. Reaching the correct diagnosis was difficult and only possible through close collaboration with the pathologist and with consideration of the patient's ethnic and geographical background. Chemotherapy with high-dose prednisone and adjusted doses of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. The patient developed tumor lysis syndrome and died 3 weeks after the diagnosis was made. ","2446":"Lupus mesenteric vasculitis (LMV) is a unique clinical entity found in patients who present with gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and is the main cause of acute abdominal pain in these patients. LMV usually presents as acute abdominal pain with sudden onset, severe intensity and diffuse localization. Other causes of abdominal pain, such as acute gastroenteritis, peptic ulcers, acute pancreatitis, peritonitis, and other reasons for abdominal surgery should be ruled out. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of LMV is critical to ensure implementation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and avoidance of unnecessary surgical intervention. The pathology of LMV comprises immune-complex deposition and complement activation, with subsequent submucosal edema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis and thrombus formation; most of these changes are confined to small mesenteric vessels. Abdominal CT is the most useful tool for diagnosing LMV, which is characterized by the presence of target signs, comb signs, and other associated findings. The presence of autoantibodies against phospholipids and endothelial cells might provide information about the likelihood of recurrence of LMV. Immediate, high-dose, intravenous steroid therapy can lead to a favorable outcome and prevent serious complications such as bowel ischemia, necrosis and perforation.","2447":"Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) are the effector cells of cartilage and bone destruction. These cells show an 'intrinsically' activated and aggressive phenotype that results in the increased production of matrix-degrading enzymes and adhesion molecules, and is conserved over long-term passage in vitro. The three main mechanisms of epigenetic control -- DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNA activity -- interact in the development of the RASF phenotype. The extent of global DNA methylation is reduced in synoviocytes in situ and RASFs in vitro. In addition, histone hyperacetylation occurs and specific microRNAs are expressed in RASFs. Normal synovial fibroblasts cultured in a hypomethylating milieu acquire an activated phenotype similar to that of RASFs. These findings suggest that epigenetic control, in particular the control of DNA methylation, is deficient in RASFs. Genome-wide analyses of the epigenome will enable the detection of additional genes involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, the identification of epigenetic biomarkers, and potentially the development of a therapeutic regimen that targets activated RASFs.","2448":"Gene-expression profiling is a powerful tool for the discovery of molecular fingerprints that underlie human disease. Microarray technologies allow the analysis of messenger RNA transcript levels for every gene in the genome. However, gene-expression profiling is best viewed as part of a pipeline that extends from sample collection through clinical application. Key genes and pathways identified by microarray profiling should be validated in independent sample sets and with alternative technologies. Analysis of relevant signaling pathways at the protein level is an important step towards understanding the functional consequences of aberrant gene expression. Peripheral blood is a convenient and rich source of potential biomarkers, but surveying purified cell populations and target tissues can also enhance our understanding of disease states. In rheumatic disease, probing the transcriptome of circulating immune cells has shed light on mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. As these discoveries advance through the pipeline, a variety of clinical applications are on the horizon, including the use of molecular fingerprints to aid in diagnosis and prognosis, improved use of existing therapies, and the development of drugs that target relevant genes and pathways.","2449":"Rheumatologists are likely to be asked to evaluate patients with recurrent febrile syndromes, so it is important that they are familiar with the clinical and diagnostic features, pathophysiology and therapeutic options for these rare autoinflammatory disorders. These syndromes are all characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and systemic inflammation; however, some syndromes have unique historical and physical features that can help with making a diagnosis. The primary associated morbidity is systemic amyloidosis, usually with renal involvement. Diagnostic testing is mostly limited to genetic testing. NSAIDs, colchicine and corticosteroids have roles in the treatment of some of these disorders, but biologic drugs that target interleukin-1beta are emerging as consistently effective therapies.","2450":"The current treatment options for Raynaud phenomenon are often ineffective and can have undesirable adverse effects. Topical, or transdermal, treatments that increase digital blood flow without systemic adverse effects are, therefore, an attractive option. A novel topical nitroglycerin formulation has shown promise in treating Raynaud attacks.","2451":"Studies performed during the past 2 years have provided a deeper understanding into the role of CTLA-4, which is expressed on regulatory T cells, in preventing autoimmunity, and also provide mechanistic insight into protein-based therapeutics such as abatacept for rheumatic diseases.","2452":"Opioids are increasingly used for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, but this practice remains controversial. A new set of clinical recommendations attempts to guide clinicians through the issues.","2453":"Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors are an effective treatment for psoriatic arthritis, but no single agent is effective in all patients. Novel therapies that target other cytokines have now been tested, with encouraging results.","2454":"The efferent vagus nerve can regulate inflammation via its principal neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), a concept referred to as the 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway'. ACh interacts with members of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family, in particular with the alpha7 subunit (alpha7nAChR), which is expressed not only by neurons but also macrophages and other cells involved in the inflammatory response. In these inflammatory cells, the stimulation of alpha7nAChR by ACh and other alpha7nAChR-specific agonists suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent work has suggested that alpha7nAChR could represent a new target for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. In this Perspective, we describe the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and the therapeutic potential of modulating this pathway in rheumatoid arthritis.","2455":"A 36-year-old woman developed new-onset Raynaud phenomenon and rapidly progressive dyspnea over a 2-week period. A lung biopsy demonstrated pauci-inflammatory nonspecific pneumonitis, which proved refractory to systemic corticosteroid and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy. Her preterminal course in an intensive care unit was typified by sequential organ failure. Postmortem examination showed extensive organ fibrosis, including severe diffuse alveolar damage and parenchymal fibrosis, and a notable lack of potentially treatable tissue inflammation. Chest radiography, physical examination, screening for autoantibodies, measurement of serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, and brain natriuretic peptide levels, cardiac examination, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiography, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, right heart catheterization, high-resolution thoracic CT, pulmonary ventilation\/perfusion scan, lung biopsy. Interstitial lung disease associated with diffuse systemic sclerosis. Treatment with oxygen, oral and intravenous corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous cyclophosphamide. ","2456":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by loss of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, and is a major cause of tooth loss. Results from clinical and epidemiologic studies have suggested that periodontitis and tooth loss are more prevalent in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the strength and temporality of the association are uncertain. Several biologically plausible causal and noncausal mechanisms might account for this association between periodontitis and RA. There is evidence to suggest that periodontitis could indeed be a causal factor in the initiation and maintenance of the autoimmune inflammatory response that occurs in RA. If proven, chronic periodontitis might represent an important modifiable risk factor for RA. In addition, patients with RA might show an increased risk of developing periodontitis and tooth loss through various mechanisms. Moreover, exposure to common genetic, environmental or behavioral factors might contribute to a noncausal association between both conditions.","2457":"Patients with chronic inflammatory disorders are at increased risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the effects of inflammatory pathways on the vasculature, clear guidelines on the management of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with systemic autoimmunity are lacking. Thus, rigorous studies assessing the individual contributions of the various treatments used in autoimmune disorders, as well as their effects on atherosclerosis development in these conditions, are needed. Furthermore, effective screening methods are needed to identify those patients with inflammatory disease who are at the highest risk for atherosclerotic complications, and who would benefit from early intervention. There is a clear need for a unifying explanation of the factors that promote premature cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Nevertheless, ongoing advances in the understanding of immune-mediated vascular damage mean that we are edging closer to the development of disease-specific preventive strategies to ameliorate or abrogate premature cardiovascular disease in these patients.","2458":"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine with vital homeostatic functions. Aberrant TGF-beta expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc); thus, TGF-beta represents a molecular therapeutic target in this disease. Anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibody has been evaluated in a small trial of early SSc, with disappointing results. Antibodies against the alphavbeta6 integrin that prevent latent TGF-beta activation, however, have shown promise in preclinical studies. Small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-beta-receptor activity are effective in animal models of fibrosis. Imatinib mesylate and related tyrosine kinase inhibitors also block TGF-beta pathways and abrogate fibrotic responses. The blocking of TGF-beta activity might lead to spontaneous immune activation, epithelial hyperplasia and impaired wound healing. Loss of immune tolerance is a potential concern in an autoimmune disease such as SSc. Novel insights from microarray-based gene expression analyses and studies of genetic polymorphisms in TGF-beta signaling could aid in identifying patients who are most likely to respond to anti-TGF-beta treatment. This intervention promises to have a major impact on the treatment of SSc. Concerns regarding efficacy and safety and whether biomarkers can indicate these features, questions regarding appropriate dosing and timing of therapy, and identification of potential responders are critical challenges ahead.","2459":"Fibromyalgia is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by widespread pain along with numerous other symptoms, including fatigue, poor sleep, mood disorders, and stiffness. Previous guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia recommended an approach that integrates pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies selected according to the symptoms experienced by individual patients. However, they offered no recommendations for a system of patient assessment that would provide a basis for individualized treatment selection. We present a simple, rapid and easily remembered system for symptom quantitation and pharmacologic management of fibromyalgia that combines visual analogue scale symptom scores from a modified form of the disease-neutral Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, with a review of medications that can be used to treat the individual symptoms. This symptom-based approach is amenable to caring for patients with fibromyalgia in a busy clinical practice.","2460":"","2461":"","2462":"","2463":"","2464":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Mechanisms and
