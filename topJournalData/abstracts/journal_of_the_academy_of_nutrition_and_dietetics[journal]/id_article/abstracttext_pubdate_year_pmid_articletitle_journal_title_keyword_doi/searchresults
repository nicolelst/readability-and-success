different food groups and nutrients can have differential effects on body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. The aim was to identify how food group, nutrient intake, and diet quality change relative to usual-diet controls after 16 weeks on a low-fat vegan diet and what associations those changes have with changes in body weight, body composition, and measures of metabolic health. Secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial conducted between October 2016 and December 2018 in four replications. Participants included in this analysis were 219 healthy, community-based adults in the Washington, DC, area, with a body mass index (BMI) between 28 and 40 kg\/m2, who were randomly assigned to follow either a low-fat vegan diet or make no diet changes. A low-fat, vegan diet deriving approximately 10% of energy from fat, with weekly classes including dietary instruction, group discussion, and education on the health effects of plant-based nutrition. Control group participants continued their usual diets. Changes in food group intake, macro- and micronutrient intake, and dietary quality as measured by Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), analyzed from 3-day diet records, and associations with changes in body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity were assessed. A repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included the factors group, subject, and time, was used to test the between-group differences throughout the 16-week study. Interaction between group and time (Gxt) was calculated for each variable. Within each diet group, paired comparison t-tests were calculated to identify significant changes from baseline to 16 weeks. Spearman correlations were calculated for the relationship between changes in food group intake, nutrient intake, AHEI-2010 score, and changes in body weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. The relative contribution of food groups and nutrients to weight loss was evaluated using linear regression. Fruit, vegetable, legume, meat alternative, and whole grain intake significantly increased in the vegan group. Intake of meat, fish and poultry; dairy products; eggs; nuts and seeds; and added fats decreased. Decreased weight was most associated with increased intake of legumes (r=-0.38; p&lt;.0001) and decreased intake of total meat, fish, and poultry (r=+0.43; p&lt;.0001). Those consuming a low-fat vegan diet also increased their intake of carbohydrates, fiber, and several micronutrients and decreased fat intake. Reduced fat intake was associated with reduced body weight (r=+0.15; p=0.02) and, after adjustment for changes in BMI and energy intake, with reduced fat mass (r=+0.14; p=0.04). The intervention group's AHEI-2010 increased by 6.0 points on average in contrast to no significant change in the control group (treatment effect +7.2 [95% CI +3.7 to +10.7]; p&lt;0.001). Increase in AHEI-2010 correlated with reduction in body weight (r=0.14; p=0.04), fat mass (r=-0.14; p=0.03), and insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR (r=-0.17; p=0.02), after adjustment for changes in energy intake. When compared with participants' usual diets, intake of plant foods increased, and consumption of animal foods, nuts and seeds, and added fats decreased on a low-fat vegan diet. Increased legume intake was the best single food group predictor of weight loss. Diet quality as measured by AHEI-2010 improved on the low-fat vegan diet, which was associated with improvements in weight and metabolic outcomes. These data suggest that increasing low-fat plant foods and minimizing high-fat and animal foods is associated with decreased body weight and fat loss, and that a low-fat vegan diet can improve measures of diet quality and metabolic health. ","3":"The use of mobile apps for dietary evaluation avoids some of the disadvantages of costly and time-consuming traditional diet assessment. However, few studies have compared dietary intake data in smartphone apps with a conventional diet assessment. This study aimed to compare the dietary data collected on energy and macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) consumed for 3 nonconsecutive days using both a mobile application (Noom) and a conventional dietary assessment tool (CAN Pro). This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 119 healthy adults (68 males and 51 females) aged 19 to 65 years were recruited from the National Cancer Center in Korea between May and September 2019. The mean daily energy and macronutrient intake data were obtained for the dietary intakes consumed for 3 nonconsecutive days using Noom and CAN Pro. The estimates of energy and macronutrient intake between the two tools were compared using correlation coefficients and cross-classification. While mean daily fat intake and % total energy from carbohydrate estimated by Noom were comparable with values provided by CAN Pro, mean daily estimated energy intake (kcal), protein (g, % total energy), and carbohydrate (g) were significantly higher with Noom than with CAN Pro. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.99 for crude intake and from 0.77 to 0.88 for energy-adjusted values of intake after adjustment for sex and age. The percentages of participants classified into quartiles of \"exact agreement and plus adjacent\" varied between 95% and 99% for crude intake and between 93% and 97% for energy-adjusted values of intake. The findings indicate that Noom may be useful for monitoring the dietary intake of energy and macronutrients and reducing workload compared with that of a traditional dietary assessment in Korea. However, further research is needed to assess the validity and usability of Noom for estimating intake of micronutrients and other dietary components. ","4":"Food marketing influences consumers' preferences for and selection of marketed products. Although a substantial body of research has described food marketing practices in brick-and-mortar stores, no research has examined food marketing in online grocery retail despite its growing importance as a source of food-at-home purchases. To develop and apply a coding instrument to describe food marketing and the nutritional quality of marketed products in online grocery stores. Quantitative content analysis and review of product Nutrition Facts labels and ingredients lists to calculate nutrient density and level of processing using the NOVA classification system. \/setting: Foods and beverages (n=3,473) marketed in the top revenue-generating online grocery retailers and those participating in the United States Department of Agriculture Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Online Purchasing Pilot (n=21) in 2019-2020. Use of marketing mix strategies (i.e., product, placement, promotion, and pricing) across retailers and nutritional quality of marketed products. Products were considered of poor nutritional quality if they were ultra-processed (NOVA category 4) and excessive in sodium, saturated fat, free sugars, and\/or other sweeteners. Products were also classified into 13 mutually exclusive food groups. The proportion of retailers using each marketing strategy, proportion of products of poor nutritional quality, and proportion of products in each food group were calculated. Retailers commonly used product recommendations, search result ordering, branded website content, user-generated content, and social media engagement to market products online. Candy, sweets, and snacks made up the largest percentage of marketed products (17.3%), followed by fruit, vegetables, and legumes (16.7%). Most (62%) marketed products were of poor nutritional quality. Staple food categories such as fruits, vegetables, and grains were frequently marketed, particularly through price reductions and product recommendations. Online grocery retailers use a variety of customizable food marketing strategies on their websites. Although most marketed products are of poor nutritional quality, there is potential for marketing of staple food categories online that is not feasible in the brick-and-mortar store.

Past studies reveal that grandparents provide their grandchildren with cariogenic foods and beverages (e.g., those with free sugars and\/or modified starches). Qualitative research can help identify what drives this phenomenon. To examine mothers' explanations for why grandparents in north central and central Appalachia give their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. A qualitative study on children's oral health in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from 2018-2020 was performed. In-person, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Qualitative data from interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then coded using NVivo. Data analysis for this study was performed using thematic analysis with iterative theme development. The participants were 126 mothers of children aged 3-5 years from West Virginia (n=66) and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (n=60). Mothers' perspectives about why grandparents give their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. In the study sample, 85% (n=107\/126) of mothers named at least one of their children's grandparents as a member of their social network responsible for their children's oral health. From these interviews, 85% (n=91\/107) of mothers discussed that grandparents gave their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages. The mothers described four themes to explain why grandparents gave their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages: 1) Privilege of the grandparent role; 2) Responsibilities of the grandparent role; 3) Symbol of care and affection; and 4) Limited consideration or understanding of the detrimental impact. Grandparents play a role in giving their grandchildren cariogenic foods and beverages, which could potentially contribute to childhood caries. Research is needed to develop effective social interventions to help some grandparents understand the implications of a cariogenic diet on their grandchildren's oral health and\/or decrease their provision of cariogenic foods and beverages. ","8":"Accurately estimating portion sizes remains a challenge in dietary assessment. Digital images used in online 24-hour dietary recalls may be conducive to accuracy. The current analyses were conducted to examine the accuracy of portion size estimation by women with low incomes who completed 24-hour dietary recalls using the online Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24) in the Food and Eating Assessment STudy (FEAST) II. True dietary intake was observed for three meals on one day through a controlled feeding study conducted from May through July, 2016. The following day, participants completed an unannounced 24-hour dietary recall using ASA24, independently or with assistance in a small group setting. Participants included 302 women aged 18 to 82 years living in the Washington, DC area who met the income thresholds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The accuracy of portion size estimation was assessed by comparing the weight truly consumed (observed) and the weight reported for pre-determined categories of foods and beverages. The differences between observed and reported portions were examined and linear regression tested differences by recall condition. Analyses were conducted by condition and repeated with stratification by racial\/ethnic identity, education, and body mass index. On average across foods and beverages, reported portion sizes were 7.4 grams (95% CI, 4.3-10.5) and 6.4 grams (95% CI, 2.8-10.0) higher than observed portion sizes in the independent and assisted conditions, respectively. Portion sizes were overestimated for small pieces and shaped foods in both conditions, as well as for amorphous\/soft foods in the assisted condition and underestimated for single unit foods in both conditions. Misestimation was fairly consistent by participants' race\/ethnicity, education, and body mass index, to varying magnitudes. Women with low incomes overestimated the amounts of foods and beverages consumed across several categories using online 24-hour dietary recalls with digital images to support portion size estimation. Assistance with ASA24 had little impact on accuracy. ","9":"The iodine status of the U.S. population is adequate overall, but some people might have insufficient or overly high iodine intakes and would benefit from certain dietary changes. Identifying these individuals can be challenging, however, due to a lack of data on the iodine content of foods and dietary supplements. To fill this gap, a new online database--the USDA, FDA, and ODS-NIH Database for the Iodine Content of Common Foods--was released in 2020. It contains about 430 foods and beverages, such as dairy products and eggs, baby foods, vegetables, meats, mixed dishes, juices, seafood, various types of salt, restaurant foods, and baked goods, including breads made with and without iodate-containing dough conditioners. Data are presented as mean iodine content for both standard serving sizes and per 100 g of food, along with standard deviations, value ranges, and sample sizes. The new database, combined with the existing Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database, which contains chemically analyzed values for the iodine content of dietary supplements, and the newly updated Dietary Supplement Label Database, which contains label information from thousands of dietary supplements on the market, provides comprehensive data to help assess the iodine intakes of individuals and populations.","10":null,"11":null,"12":"The transition from student to dietitian is an implicit expectation of dietetic education. While there has been an expanding literature around elements of competency based education, little attention has focussed on sociocultural aspects of learning and professional identity formation in dietetic education. The aim of this study was to explore sociocultural factors in dietetics education influencing the transition into the profession from the perspective of dietetics students and educators. An exploratory qualitative study underpinned by social constructionism. From March 2018 until June 2019, interviews (individual and group) with final year students (n = 22), dietetic preceptors (n = 27) and university faculty members (n = 51) from 17 of the 18 universities in Australia and New Zealand with accredited dietetic programs were undertaken and explored sociocultural factors in dietetic education. Data were analysed into key themes using framework analysis and applying the sociocultural theory of landscapes of practice. Sociocultural factors are powerful influences on the student-professional transition. Dietetic cultures and mini-cultures of cohesion, conformity, competition and conflict aversion exist. Boundaries exist within learning environments which can limit or pose challenges to professional identity formation and transition into the profession. Stakeholders involved in dietetics education play pivotal roles in shaping the micro-cultures students learn and work within, which influence and impact socialisation and transition into the profession. Opportunities exist to re-vision curriculum and foster positive learning cultures with a focus on sociocultural learning, including supporting boundary crossing and professional identity development. ","13":"","14":null,"15":"","16":"","17":"Many research questions focused on characterizing usual, or long-term average, dietary intake of populations and subpopulations rely on short-term intake data. The objective of this paper is to review key assumptions, statistical techniques, and considerations underpinning the use of short-term dietary intake data to make inference about usual dietary intake. The focus is on measurement error and strategies to mitigate its effects on estimated characteristics of population-level usual intake, with attention to relevant analytic issues such as accounting for survey design. Key assumptions are that short-term assessments are subject to random error only (i.e., unbiased for individual usual intake) and that some aspects of the error structure apply to all respondents, allowing estimation of this error structure in data sets with only a few repeat measures per person. Under these assumptions, a single 24-hour dietary recall per person can be used to estimate group mean intake; and with as little as one repeat on a subsample and with more complex statistical techniques, other characteristics of distributions of usual intake, such as percentiles, can be estimated. Related considerations include the number of days of data available, skewness of intake distributions, whether the dietary components of interest are consumed nearly daily by nearly everyone or episodically, the number of correlated dietary components of interest, time-varying nuisance effects related to day of week and season, and variance estimation and inference. Appropriate application of assumptions and recommended statistical techniques allows researchers to address a range of research questions, though it is imperative to acknowledge systematic error (bias) in short-term data and its implications for conclusions.","18":null,"19":"","20":"","21":"","22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":"","26":null,"27":null,"28":null,"29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":"","33":"","34":null,"35":"In 2021, the National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative (NSSRI) released voluntary sugar reduction targets for packaged foods and drinks in the United States. The objectives of this study were to describe trends in added sugar intake from NSSRI foods and beverages among children and youth and estimate possible reductions if industry were to meet the targets. This study consisted of cross-sectional and trend analyses of demographic and 24-hour dietary recall data from eight survey cycles (2003-2004 to 2017-2018) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study sample included 23,248 children and youth (aged 2 to 19 years). The main outcome measure was the percent of daily calories from added sugar for foods and beverages in NSSRI categories. Foods and beverages reported by participants were mapped to one of the NSSRI's categories or coded as a non-NSSRI item. Trends over time in added sugar intake were assessed using regression models. To assess possible reductions in added sugar intake if industry were to meet the targets, sales-weighted mean percent reductions for 2023 and 2026 targets were applied to NSSRI items in the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Suvey data. Results were examined overall and by demographic characteristics. From 2003-2004 to 2017-2018, added sugar intake from NSSRI foods and beverages declined, but consumption remained high. During 2017-2018, NSSRI categories accounted for 70% of US child and youth added sugar intake. If industry met the NSSRI targets, US children and youth would consume 7% (2023 targets) to 21% (2026 targets) less added sugar. Although added sugar intake from NSSRI foods and drinks has declined over the past decade, added sugar intake from all sources remains high and consumption of added sugar from certain NSSRI categories has remained steady over time. If met, the NSSRI targets are expected to result in meaningful reductions in added sugar intake for US children and youth.

An overview of current systematic reviews provided evidence-based results from a range of nutrition interventions according to developmental age group (ages 2 to 5, 6 to 12, and 13 to 17 years). Twenty-one current systematic reviews of nutrition interventions demonstrated a beneficial effect of nutrition and physical activity interventions on body mass index measures and no adverse events were identified. RDNs impart nutrition expertise in a wide range of settings to provide comprehensive care for children and adolescents as their nutrition and developmental needs change over time. This Position Paper outlines the current roles of, and proposed directions for, RDNs engaged in pediatric overweight and obesity prevention. Prevention of pediatric overweight and obesity requires comprehensive strategies ranging from policy-level to individual-level interventions in settings that will have the most beneficial impact for children according to their developmental stage. This Position Paper advocates for increased availability of nutrition and food access programs and interventions to reduce risk of pediatric obesity and associated adverse health outcomes both now and for future generations.","43":"","44":"This Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Position Paper describes current evidence on multi-component interventions with nutrition to treat pediatric overweight and obesity and discusses implications for RDNs. An umbrella review of eight systematic reviews provides evidence that multi-component interventions that include nutrition improve body mass index z-scores in all ages and in a variety of settings. More evidence is needed regarding appropriate body mass index measures to track weight and health status changes in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Current evidence indicates that multi-component interventions that include nutrition do not negatively impact psychosocial outcomes, but research on long-term outcomes is needed. Evolving technology and societal circumstances have created opportunities to provide innovative, collaborative, and engaging interventions through telehealth. RDNs specializing in pediatric overweight and obesity treatment play a crucial role in providing a wide range of evidence-based interventions in a variety of settings.

Despite the available treatments, there is continued demand for novel and natural strategies to promote better sleep. Dietary modifications could be a viable new target to improve sleep. A literature review using PubMed was conducted on studies that examined the relationship between diet composition (ie, macronutrients or special diets) and objectively assessed sleep quality. Twenty human studies (6 observational and 14 interventional) published between 1975 and March 2021 met the eligibility criteria and were included. The amount of dietary carbohydrates and fats was associated with both better and worse sleep quality indices. However, the type of carbohydrate and fat was an important factor in these associations, with diets higher in complex carbohydrates (eg, fiber) and healthier fats (eg, unsaturated) being associated with better sleep quality. Diets higher in protein were associated with better sleep quality. In general, diets rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and anti-inflammatory nutrients and lower in saturated fat (eg, Mediterranean diet) were associated with better sleep quality. The connection between diet and sleep quality warrants further investigation. Rigorous interventional studies of longer duration assessing the effects of whole foods, rather than isolated nutrients, and under free-living conditions, rather than in a research laboratory setting, as well as mechanistic studies are needed to better understand how dietary patterns relate to sleep quality. Future research could provide insights into whether dietary modifications could be an effective, personalized strategy for improving sleep quality in millions of Americans.","46":null,"47":null,"48":null,"49":"","50":null,"51":null,"52":"Dietary factors like sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption are known to influence disease course in a variety of illnesses; however, long-term outcomes are not well documented for inflammatory bowel disease. Does high consumption of SSBs lead to high healthcare utilization (ie, hospitalizations and emergency department visits), inflammation, and disease severity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease? A prospective cohort study was conducted from 2015 to 2019. Patients enrolled in the discovery study cohort were followed for 3 years, whereas patients in the validation cohort were followed for 2 years. They underwent nutrition assessment and received routine care. Dietary intakes of SSBs and fiber were quantified by a validated, self-reported questionnaire. For the discovery study cohort, 1133 adult patients were recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Digestive Disease Clinic in Pittsburgh, PA. Eligible patients had a preexisting diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and had at least annual follow-up at this tertiary referral center. High SSB consumption was defined as 7 or more SSBs per week. Moderate was defined as &gt; 2 but &lt; 7 SSBs per week. Low SSB consumption was defined as 2 or fewer SSBs per week. Primary outcome was time to hospitalization and emergency department visits. Secondary outcomes assessed laboratory markers of disease severity and inflammation. Tertiary outcomes assessed time to hospitalization and emergency department visits in a subsequent independent cohort of patients. Multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards modeling RESULTS: The discovery cohort included of 1,133 adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (58% women, 70% with Chron's disease, 30% with ulcerative colitis, median age 46 years). Low SSB consumption, moderate SSB consumption, and high SSB consumption occurred in 57%, 17%, and 26% in the discovery cohort, respectively. Among patients without active disease at enrollment, high SSB consumption was associated with decreased time to hospitalization and emergency department visits when compared with low SSB consumption (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.27; and hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.13). In terms of disease severity and inflammatory biomarkers, high SSB consumption was associated with increase odds of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (odds ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.18), elevated C-reactive protein level (odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI, 1.07-2.37), eosinophilia (odds ratio 1.88, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.335), and monocytosis (odds ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.79) when compared with low SSB consumption after adjusting for baseline differences. Lastly, the validation cohort produced similar results to our primary outcome (ie, high SSB consumption was associated with decreased time to hospitalization and emergency department visits when compared with low SSB consumption). High SSB consumption was associated with decreased time to hospitalization and emergency department visits. Furthermore, high SSB consumption is associated with disease severity biomarkers and inflammation. Prospective studies assessing the therapeutic influence of nutrition counseling and decreased SSB consumption on long-term inflammatory bowel disease clinical course are warranted.

This study examined the trajectory of diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index 2015 before, during, and after the 2008-2009 Great Recession. Repeated cross-sectional survey data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. The analytic sample included 48,679 adults who completed at least one dietary recall from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018. Diet quality was assessed with a 24-hour dietary recall to calculate the Healthy Eating Index 2015 total scores, a measure of the conformance with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Least squares regression was used to adjust for demographic changes across waves. Diet quality improved noticeably during the Great Recession and deteriorated as economic conditions improved. Deteriorating economic circumstances may constrain choices, but that does not necessarily imply a worsening of dietary quality. During the Great Recession, American diets became more consistent with Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations, possibly because of a shift toward food prepared at home instead of prepared food bought away from home.

The study team conducted a content analysis of healthy kids' meal laws passed between January 2010 and August 2020 in the United States. Using a structured codebook, two researchers abstracted policy elements and implementation language from laws, regulations, fiscal notes, and policy notes. Nutritional criteria for kids' beverages and meals were compared with existing expert and industry nutrition standards for meals and beverages. Measures included law characteristics, implementation characteristics, enforcement characteristics, definitions of key terms, and nutritional requirements for meals and default beverage options and alignment with expert and industry nutrition standards. Interrater reliability of the coding tool was estimated using the Cohen kappa statistic, and researchers calculated descriptive statistics of policy elements. Twenty laws were identified. Eighteen were healthy default beverage policies, two were toy restriction policies, and one was a nutrition standards policy. The nutrition standards, default beverage offerings, and implementation characteristics varied by location. No law met the expert nutrition standards for kids' meals or beverages. The variations in policy specifications may influence how restaurants implement the policies, and, consequently, the policies' influences on children's consumption.

This multicenter cross-sectional study evaluated food and nutrient intake of nationally representative samples of urban populations of 8 LA countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela) in 2014-2015. The sample comprised 8714 participants from the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health, aged 15 to 65 years, randomly recruited according to geographical location, sex, age, and socioeconomic level. Two 24-hour recalls were used to examine dietary intake. Breakfast consumers were stratified by tertiles of Nutrient-Rich Foods Index 9.3 (NRF9.3) to assess the overall diet quality of individuals. Nutrient intake at breakfast of those in the upper tertile of NRF9.3 pooled for the 8 countries was used as a reference for the development of recommendations for LA adolescents and adults. Comparison of food and nutrient intake of breakfast across NRF9.3 tertiles were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Overall breakfast was an important contributor to protein, carbohydrate, and B vitamin intakes but also to added sugar and total and saturated fat intakes relative to daily intakes. Individuals in the upper NRF9.3 tertile had higher intake of key micronutrients such as calcium and potassium at breakfast compared with other tertiles. White breads\/rolls\/tortillas were the most consumed food group (60%), followed by butter\/margarine (40%) and coffee\/tea without milk (34%-50%). Breakfast contributed to the daily intake of B vitamins, protein, and carbohydrates but also added sugar and total and saturated fat intakes for all countries.

Lower intakes of healthy foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and higher intakes of unhealthy foods (eg, fast foods, added sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages) were observed in food-insecure students, and studies with the most representative samples of the student body found these trends. Some food-insecure students consumed breakfast and evening meals less frequently than food-secure students but the evidence was limited. Validated food security and dietary assessment tools were inconsistently used to assess diet quality among students with differing food security status. The heterogeneity of student sampling and data collection may contribute to inconsistent findings. Poorer dietary outcomes were found in university students with food insecurity compared with food-secure students, but statistical significance was only observed in a small number of studies. Future longitudinal studies using food security and dietary assessment tools validated in this population are recommended to confirm the observed associations between food insecurity and diet quality among university students.

Understanding relationships among food insecurity, diet, and health care utilization can inform strategies to reduce health disparities. Our aim was to determine associations between food security status and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization and whether they differed by dietary quality in lower-income adults. This was a cross-sectional study of data from the 2009-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were 13,956 lower-income (&lt;300% federal poverty level) adults 18 years and older in the United States. Self-reported health care utilization in the past 12 months included no usual source of care, any outpatient visit, any mental health service use, and any hospitalization. Multiple logistic regression was used to study the association between food insecurity and health care utilization. Analyses were stratified by diet-related comorbidities to account for potential confounding and mediation of health care utilization, and by dietary quality. In a sample of lower-income adults &lt;300% federal poverty level, 4,319 participants (27.4%) were food insecure, 2,208 (15.0%) were marginally food secure, and 7,429 (57.6%) were food secure. Food insecurity was associated with having no usual source of care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.30; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.52), any mental health service use (aOR 2.02; 95% CI 1.61 to 2.52), and any hospitalization (aOR 1.19; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.41). Food-insecure adults were more likely to report no outpatient visits if they had diet-related comorbidities (aOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.92) or the lowest dietary quality (aOR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.23). Marginal food security was associated with having no usual source of care (aOR 1.22; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.44). Adults with food insecurity were more likely to be hospitalized, use mental health services, and have no usual source of care. Food-insecure participants with diet-related comorbidities or poor diet were less likely to have outpatient visits. Hospitalizations and mental health visits represent underused opportunities to identify and address food insecurity and dietary intake in lower-income patients.

Online ordering options may improve the WIC shopping experience but are understudied. The objective of this study was to test feasibility and acceptability of a \"Click &amp; Collect\" model for WIC online ordering from the perspective of WIC participants. A Click &amp; Collect online ordering model was adapted to the WIC program and implemented at 1 grocery store. In the Click &amp; Collect model, WIC participants placed an online order (\"click\"), then completed payment and pickup at the store (\"collect\"). Twenty-five WIC participants in East Tennessee were included. Feasibility was assessed by examining online order summaries and store receipts to determine whether WIC transactions were completed successfully. Acceptability was assessed by qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with WIC participants after participating in the pilot. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze sociodemographic and purchase data in SPSS software, version 27. Qualitative interviews were transcribed and analyzed for themes using directed content analysis in NVivo, version 12.0. All WIC participants in the study placed an online order, and 96% picked up the order, indicating a high degree of feasibility. In follow-up qualitative interviews, WIC participants reported interest in the Click &amp; Collect model, and provided suggestions to improve practicality across the following 4 primary themes: website experience, curbside pickup, online shopping fee, and shopping preferences. The pilot was successfully implemented at 1 store. Click &amp; Collect online ordering was feasible and acceptable to WIC participants, although additional work is needed to make it practical. Online shopping options for the WIC program should be further explored to expand access to nutritious WIC foods in families with low income.

Five electronic databases were searched (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, and Cochrane) in April 2020. Data from the eligible studies were extracted, and the psychometric properties were critically appraised using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments. This review identified 129 studies that used a questionnaire to measure food service satisfaction in nursing homes. Of those, 107 studies representing 75 unique general nursing home satisfaction questionnaires were excluded for failing to adequately explore aspects related to food service. From the remaining 22 studies, 7 food service satisfaction questionnaires were identified; 5 intended for consumers (residents) and 2 intended for organizational stakeholders (staff). Using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments quality criteria, most questionnaires had flaws in content validity and construct validity, primarily due to small sample sizes. No questionnaires explored food service satisfaction from the family perspective. Nursing homes collect satisfaction information for accreditation, marketing, benchmarking, and quality improvement. Although questionnaires are easy to administer, the quality of the data they collect is impacted by the validity and reliability of the questionnaires used. Using unreliable satisfaction data may mean that nursing homes are not accurately able to understand the impact of changes in the system on stakeholder satisfaction.

Although some studies have implicated greater intake of dairy products, it is not clear how dairy intake is related to biomarkers of cardiometabolic health. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that associations of dairy foods with biomarkers of lipid metabolism, insulin-like growth factor signaling, and chronic inflammation may provide clues to understanding how dairy can influence cardiometabolic health. This was a cross-sectional study in the Women's Health Initiative using baseline food frequency questionnaire data to calculate dairy intake. Participants were 35,352 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years at 40 clinical centers in the United States. Baseline (1993-1998) concentrations of 20 circulating biomarkers were measured. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression was used to estimate percent difference in biomarker concentrations per serving of total dairy and individual foods (milk, cheese, yogurt, butter, and low-fat varieties). Lower triglyceride concentrations were associated with greater intake of total dairy (-0.8% [95% CI -1.2% to -0.3%]), mainly driven by full-fat varieties. Individual dairy foods had specific associations with circulating lipid components. For example, greater total milk intake was associated with lower concentrations of total cholesterol (-0.4% [95% CI -0.7% to -0.2%]) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.5% [95% CI -0.9% to -0.1%]), whereas greater butter intake was associated with higher total cholesterol (0.6% [95% CI 0.2% to 1.0%]) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6% [95% CI 1.1% to 2.0%]) concentrations. In contrast, higher total yogurt intake was associated with lower total cholesterol (-1.1% [95% CI -2.0% to -0.2%]) and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.8% [95% CI 0.5% to 3.1%]). Greater total dairy intake (regardless of fat content), total cheese, full-fat cheese, and yogurt were consistently associated with lower concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein. However, milk and butter were not associated with these biomarkers. Higher dairy intake, except butter, was associated with a favorable profile of lipids, insulin response, and inflammatory biomarkers, regardless of fat content. Yet, specific dairy foods might influence these markers uniquely. Findings do not support a putative role of dairy in cardiometabolic diseases observed in some previous studies.

The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which US adults meet these evidence-based recommendations and how adherence differs by weight status. This was a cross-sectional study using nationally representative data from the 2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary intake data for 30,888 adults 18 years and older with normal body mass index (BMI), overweight, or obesity were analyzed. Differences in dietary intakes and the proportion of adults meeting guidelines were compared across BMI categories. Logistic regression and 1-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze differences in adherence to recommendations, controlling for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, and family income as a percent of the federal poverty rate. Regarding fruit and nonstarchy vegetables, 62.8% of adults with normal BMI, 64.5% with overweight, and 70.1% with obesity fell short of recommendations.

The sample included a total of 38 purposively sampled participants from Grady Memorial Hospital (10 EBF mothers, 10 non-EBF, and 18 key stakeholders such as clinicians, community organizations' staff, and administrators). Key themes included that maternal perception of inadequate milk supply was a barrier to in-hospital EBF at the intrapersonal level. At the interpersonal level, a personable and individualized approach to breastfeeding counseling may be most effective in supporting EBF. At the institutional level, key determinants of EBF were gaps in prenatal breastfeeding education, limited time to provide comprehensive prenatal education to high-risk patients, and practical help with latching and positioning. Community-level WIC services were perceived as a facilitator due to the additional benefits provided for EBF mothers; however, the distribution of WIC vouchers for formula to mothers while they are in the hospital undermines the promotion of EBF.

Thirty-eight food-insecure women aged 50 years and older were purposively sampled from the Northern California, Georgia, and North Carolina sites of the Women's Interagency Human Immunodeficiency Virus Study. Interviews were conducted between November 2017 and July 2018 at the three Women's Interagency Human Immunodeficiency Virus Study sites. Three researchers thematically analyzed the data using an inductive-deductive approach. Participants described neighborhood-level drivers of food insecurity that centered around three themes: accessibility of food from traditional food stores, the role of food aid institutions, and the intersection of aging with the food environment. Participants explained that food insecurity was related to limited access to food stores largely due to long distances and poor public transportation in Georgia and North Carolina, and high food prices in Northern California. Most participants described being dependent on food aid programs, but found this difficult due to poor quality food and long wait times. Aging-related issues emerged as a cross-cutting theme, with fatigue, poor strength, and chronic illness amplifying barriers to accessing food. Findings from this study reveal the structural barriers that aging women face in accessing healthy food within their neighborhoods, and how experiences with aging and chronic illnesses exacerbate these barriers.

Breastfeeding and age at solid food introduction were associated with DPs using a 3-step approach for latent class modeling based on multinomial logistic regression models. The following childhood DPs were identified: processed\/energy-dense food (35%), variety plus high intake (41%), and healthy (24%). After weighting for loss to follow-up and covariate adjustment, compared with formula-fed children at 1 month, breastfed children had 0.41 times lower odds of the processed\/energy-dense food DP vs the healthy DP (95% CI 0.14 to 1.25) and 0.53 times lower odds of the variety plus high intake DP (95% CI 0.17 to 1.61), neither of which were statistically significant.

The outcome measures were change in servings of discretionary foods and key nutrients (energy, total fat, saturated fat, sugar, alcohol, sodium, trans fat) for the population, and by sex, age group, weight status, and socioeconomic status. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis were conducted. Scenarios reduced total energy intake by up to 26% across the population as a whole. The removal of discretionary foods (not beverages) resulted in the greatest reduction in servings and energy (74.8% and 25.6%, respectively), followed by the removal of discretionary items in portions greater than 143 kcal (59.1% and 24.3%) and not consuming discretionary items at main meals (51.2% and 17.8%).

The aim of this exploratory case study was to gain in-depth insights of key stakeholders (catering management, chefs, organizers, and dietitians) regarding the integration of nutrition into the catering operation of a major global sporting event, with a focus on future continuity, and map this to the foodservice systems model using a program logic model. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 stakeholders during and after the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Gold Coast, Australia. The 8 themes that emerged were related to planning and preparation, refining processes, improvement of the menu, better technology, increase in food allergies\/intolerances, organization controls, experience of the workforce, and increased client knowledge of nutrition. The logic model demonstrated that the system is driven by policy and budget at the level of control prior to and during the planning phase but modified by the environment during operation. Despite recognition by stakeholders on the importance of change, there are barriers to the provision of suitable food. Integration of nutrition expertise into tender documents and budgets in major event catering will help ensure nutritionally adequate, culturally suitable, and safe menus for future events.

The study tested the hypothesis that Ticket to Healthy Food would reduce child food insecurity (FI-C) among rural, low-income households. The study used a randomized controlled trial in which households were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Outcomes were measured using household surveys and administrative data. Survey data were collected at baseline (n=2,202) and follow-up (n=1,639) 8 to 11 months into the project. Households in 17 counties in southeastern Kentucky that had at least 1 child younger than 18 years and received a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit amount less than the maximum at baseline. Between January 2017 and March 2018, treatment households on SNAP received additional monthly benefits ranging from $1 to $122 based on distance to grocery store and earned income. Key outcomes included FI-C (primary), food insecurity among adults and households, and food expenditures (secondary). Logistic and linear regression models were used to estimate differences between the treatment and control groups, controlling for baseline characteristics. Socioeconomic subgroups were also analyzed. The Kentucky Ticket to Healthy Food project did not reduce the primary outcome, FI-C (treatment=37.1%, control=35.2%; P=0.812), or secondary outcomes of very low food security among children (treatment=3.7%, control=4.4%; P=0.204) or food insecurity among adults (treatment=53.9%, control=53.0%; P=0.654). The project increased households' monthly food spending by $20 (P=0.030) and led more households to report that monthly benefits lasted at least 3 weeks (treatment=65%, control=56%; P=0.009). A demonstration project to reduce FI-C by raising SNAP benefits for Kentucky households with children did not reduce FI-C or other food insecurity measures. Future research should explore the effect of different increases in SNAP benefits and collect repeated measures of FI-C to assess whether intervention effects change over time.

Households were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with outcomes measured using household surveys and administrative data. Survey data were collected at baseline (n=3,088) and follow-up (n=2,074) 8 to 12 months into the project. Eligible households in Las Vegas, NV, had children under age 5 years, received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and had incomes below 75% of the federal poverty level. Between June 2016 and May 2017, treatment households on SNAP received an additional $40 in monthly SNAP benefits per child under age 5 years. Key outcomes included FI-C (primary), food security among adults and households, and food expenditures (secondary). Differences between the treatment and control groups were estimated by a logistic regression model and controlling for baseline characteristics. Analyses were also performed on socioeconomic subgroups. The Nevada HHFK project did not reduce FI-C (treatment=31.2%, control=30.6%; P=0.620), very low food security among children (P=0.915), or food insecurity among adults (P=0.925). The project increased households' monthly food expenditures (including SNAP and out-of-pocket food purchases) by $23 (P&lt;0.001). A demonstration project to reduce FI-C by increasing SNAP benefits to Las Vegas households with young children and very low income did not reduce FI-C or other food-insecurity measures. This finding runs counter to prior research showing that SNAP and similar forms of food assistance have reduced food insecurity. This project was implemented during a period of substantial economic growth in Las Vegas.

Nearly 50% of the patients served at Federally Qualified Health Centers are enrolled in Medicaid; the lack of benefits and coverage for MNT is a barrier to care. Because the delivery of MNT provided by registered dietitian nutritionists is largely uncompensated, health centers are less likely to offer these evidence-based services and strengthen team-based care. The expected outcomes of MNT for adults with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other conditions align with the intent of several clinical quality measures of the Uniform Data System and quality improvement goals of multiple stakeholders. HRSA should designate MNT as an expanded service in primary care, require reporting of MNT and registered dietitian nutritionists in utilization and staffing data, and evaluate outcomes. Modification to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Prospective Payment System rules are needed to put patients over paperwork: HRSA health centers should be compensated for MNT provided on the same day as other qualifying visits. Facilitating the routine delivery of care by qualified providers will require coordinated action by multiple stakeholders.

Participants reported Complete Eats Rx was an important resource for families and improved food security, diet quality, and the ability to purchase healthy foods, including a greater variety of fruits and vegetables. Primary barriers to food security and fruit and vegetable consumption included limited geographic accessibility and the high cost of fruits and vegetables, exacerbated by other financial constraints such as rising housing costs. Participants reported supermarket checkout difficulty because of embarrassment, stigmatization, and inability to redeem incentives. The most frequently mentioned barrier to perceived program acceptability was having only one supermarket chain as the acceptor of the incentive. Partnering with supermarkets to accept fruit and vegetable incentives is a unique strategy to increase produce purchasing that can be adopted by other localities. Focus on geographic accessibility, appropriate price points, and positive shopping experiences via expansion to local grocers, improvements in staff interactions, and a transition to an electronic system may improve incentive redemption and usability.

The practices of mindful eating (ME) and intuitive eating (IE) have been developed to minimize external drivers of energy intake by helping individuals emphasize the sensory properties of foods and internal indicators of hunger and fullness. To enhance understanding about the effect of ME and IE interventions on dietary intake, this systematic review included randomized trials of ME and IE interventions that examined dietary intake, defined as energy intake or diet quality, in adults of varying weight status without a diagnosis of an eating disorder. The selection of literature followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses systematic review process, in which PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between January 1980 and November 2019. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: randomized trial design in which 1 arm was an intervention with an ME or IE component and there was at least 1 control or active comparison arm; enrolled participants were of a healthy weight or with overweight or obesity and reported not having an eating disorder (ie, anorexia, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder) or other health conditions in which dietary restrictions were applied; were at least 18 years of age; and outcomes of energy intake or diet quality were reported at baseline and post intervention. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess risk of bias for each study that met inclusion criteria.

To address this, the Academy convened a task force charged with developing research priorities relevant for its members. Specifically, it would define key issues of the nutrition and dietetics profession going into the second century and identify relevant research topics and questions related to the defined issues. The task force leveraged multiple data sources to develop the research priorities. These data sources included existing interviews from a previous Academy event (Nutrition Impact Summit) held in 2016 and answers from an Academy Member Engagement Zone survey. This led to the development of draft research priorities that were included in a more extensive survey e-mailed to all Academy members. Results of this member-wide survey, in addition to multiple stakeholder checks, informed the final Academy research priorities. Thirteen final priorities were established across 4 domains: nutrition-related discovery, clinical nutrition research, implementation science, and public health. These priorities have relevance for all nutrition and dietetics professionals across diverse areas of practice and will be used internally to prioritize research efforts, inform the allocation of resources across Academy units, and guide Academy advocacy for national nutrition research agendas and initiatives.

The objective of this scoping review was to identify and characterize literature examining Food as Medicine interventions within food retail settings and across consumer demographics. An electronic literature search of 8 databases identified 11,404 relevant articles. Results from the searches were screened against inclusion criteria, and intervention effectiveness was assessed for the following outcomes: improvement in health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. One-hundred and eighty-six papers and 25 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Five categories surfaced as single interventions: prescription programs, incentive programs, medically tailored nutrition, path-to-purchase marketing, and personalized nutrition education. Multiple combinations of intervention categories, reporting of health outcomes (nutritional quality of shopping purchases, eating habits, biometric measures), and cost-effectiveness (store sales, health care dollar savings) also emerged. The intervention categories that produced both improved health outcomes and cost-effectiveness included a combination of incentive programs, personalized nutrition education, and path-to-purchase marketing. Food as Medicine interventions in the food retail setting can aid consumers in navigating health through diet and nutrition by encompassing the following strategic focus areas: promotion of health and well-being, managing chronic disease, and improving food security.

Diet assessment included two 24-hour recalls from baseline. The 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) was used to measure diet quality, with higher scores indicating better quality. Complex survey linear regression estimated the association between HEI-2010 scores (continuous variable and categorized into tertiles) and birth-weight z score and birth weight for GA percentile. Mean (standard deviation) age of women was 25.8 (5.2) years and 36.4% were classified as underweight or normal weight, 30.0% were overweight, and 33.6% had obesity at baseline. Mean (standard deviation) HEI-2010 score was 56.5 (13.4), and by weight classifications was 54.4 (14.1) for underweight or normal weight and 57.7 (12.8) for overweight or obesity.

Moreover, results of the previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses were extended by evaluating the credibility of the evidence. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched to identify eligible studies published between May 15, 2017 and March 14, 2020. Pooled relative risk (RR) with 95% CI for highest vs lowest category of diet quality were estimated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic with 95% CI. Presence of publication bias was detected by using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. The NutriGrade tool was used to assess the credibility of evidence. The current update identified 47 new reports, resulting in a total of 113 reports including data from 3,277,684 participants. Diets of the highest quality, as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index, Alternate Healthy Eating Index, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension scores, were inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.82, I2 = 68%, n= 23), cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.82, I2 = 59%, n= 45), cancer incidence or mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89, I2 = 73%, n= 45), incidence of type 2 diabetes (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.85, I2 = 76%, n= 16), and incidence of neurodegenerative diseases (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89, I2 = 71%, n= 12). In cancer survivors, the highest diet quality was linked with lower risk of all-cause (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88, I2 = 45%, n= 12) and cancer mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89, I2 = 44%, n= 12). The credibility of evidence for identified associations between overall healthy dietary patterns and included health outcomes was moderate.

Fruit drinks carry many nutrition-related claims on the front of package (FOP). Nutrition-related claims affect individuals' perceptions of the healthfulness of products and purchase intentions, often creating a \"health halo\" effect. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of FOP nutrition-related claims on fruit drinks purchased by households with young children and to examine the association between claims and the nutritional profile of fruit drinks. The sample included 2059 fruit drinks purchased by households with children 0 to 5 years old participating in Nielsen Homescan in 2017. FOP labels were obtained from 2 databases that contain bar code-level information on all printed material on product labels. A codebook was used to code for presence of FOP nutrition-related claims. The coded claims data were linked by bar code with Nutrition Facts label data. Claim type prevalence was calculated, and the association between claim types and median calories and total grams of sugar per 100 mL was analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The percentages of products containing noncaloric sweeteners (NCSs) with and without each claim type were also calculated and compared. Almost all (97%) fruit drinks sampled had at least 1 nutrition-related FOP claim. Implied natural claims such as \"natural flavors\" were the most common (55% of products), followed by claims about the presence of juice or nectar (49%). Claims about vitamin C (33%), sugar (29%), and calories (23%) were also common. Fruit drinks with vitamin C, juice or nectar, fruit or fruit flavor, and overt natural claims were higher in calories and sugar and less likely to contain NCSs compared with products without these claims. Fruit drinks with calorie, sugar, NCS, implied natural, and other claims were lower in calories and sugar and more likely to contain NCSs compared with products without these claims. Claims are prevalent on fruit drinks purchased by households with young children. This is concerning given prior research demonstrating that claims can mislead consumers. Regulatory actions such as requiring a warning or disclosure on drinks that contain added sugars or NCSs should be considered.

However, little is understood about the nutritional composition of the diets of households receiving CFA, or the relationship between CFA and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) usage among low-income households. The aim of the study was to compare the nutritional quality of foods obtained by CFA clients to those of similar nonclients. Furthermore, the study examined the timing of CFA use relative to the timing of SNAP use among CFA clients during the week. Analyses were conducted using 2012 US Department of Agriculture National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), which collected data for 4826 households' food acquisitions during a 7-day survey week. Sixty-seven households reported using CFAs during the survey week. The nutritional quality of food was measured by the ratios between food acquisition quantities and the US Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food Plan consumption recommendations. The date of SNAP use was compared with that of CFA use for CFA clients who were also SNAP recipients. Propensity score matching was utilized to construct a matching sample of CFA clients and nonclients. T tests were used to compare the means of variables. CFA clients were more likely to be food insecure (48% vs 28%, P &lt; .001) and less likely to have access to a car (61.2% vs 84.8%, P &lt; .001) than CFA nonclients. CFAs represent an important source of foods for CFA clients, taking up 28% of their total food at home acquisitions. CFA clients obtained more nonstarchy vegetables than matched nonclients. Furthermore, among the 45% of CFA clients who also participated in SNAP, the majority (52.4%) of them used SNAP benefits within 10 days of SNAP benefits distribution while most (67.9%) of those households used CFAs starting on day 11 or later after SNAP benefits were allocated. CFAs provide a substantial portion of the diets of their clients and, in particular, for foods that constitute components of healthy diets. For the proportion of CFA clients who received SNAP, this study finds evidence that CFA clients relied more on CFAs when their SNAP benefits were likely to run low.

KIs indicated that program benefits (eg, health and nutrition benefits, reimbursement, guidelines, and training) outweighed challenges experienced. Challenges associated with revised CACFP standards implementation (eg, availability or acceptability of new, creditable foods) were impacted by enhanced CACFP standards status, reported revised standards, and availability or utilization of outside support. KIs desired more contact with their state representative. KIs found the training and technical assistance on the revised standards useful and suggestions to enhance future training and technical assistance (eg, increasing accessibility, training resources, and audience-specific training). Overall, KIs desired additional resources, training, and increased communication from CACFP state representatives specific to CACFP-approved and reimbursable products, menu ideas, recipes, and cooking demonstrations.

Over 12 months, participants completed up to 6 ASA24 recalls, 2 web-based FFQs, and 2 unweighed paper-and-pencil 4DFRs. Up to 3 attempts were made to obtain each ASA24 recall. Participants were administered doubly-labeled water to provide a measure of total energy expenditure and collected two 24-hour urine samples to assess concentrations of nitrogen, sodium, and potassium. From January through September 2012, 1,110 adult members of AARP, 50 to 74 years of age, were recruited from the Pittsburgh, PA, area to participate in the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study. After excluding 33 participants who had not completed any dietary assessments, 531 men and 546 women remained. Response rates, nutrient intakes compared to recovery biomarkers across each ASA24 administration day, and HEI-2015 total and component scores were measured. Means, medians, standard deviations, interquartile ranges, and HEI-2015 total and component scores computed using a multivariate measurement error model are presented. Ninety-one percent of men and 86% of women completed 3 ASA24 recalls. Approximately three-quarters completed 5 or more, higher than the completion rates for 2 4DFRs and 2 FFQs. Approximately, three-quarters of men and 70% of women completed ASA24 on the first attempt; 1 in 5 completed it on the second. Completion rates varied slightly by age and body mass index. Median time to complete ASA24-2011 (current version: ASA24-2020) declined with subsequent recalls from 55 to 41 minutes in men and from 58 to 42 minutes in women and was lowest in those younger than 60 years. Mean nutrient intakes were similar across recalls. For each recording day, energy intakes estimated by ASA24 were lower than energy expenditure. Reported intakes for protein, potassium, and sodium were closer to recovery biomarkers for women, but not for men. Geometric means of reported intakes of these nutrients did not systematically vary across ASA24 administrations, but differences between reported intakes and biomarkers differed by nutrient. Of 100 possible points, HEI-2015 total scores were nearly identical for 4DFRs and ASA24 recalls and higher for FFQs (men: 61, 60, and 68; women: 64, 64, and 72, respectively). ASA24, a freely available dietary assessment tool for use in large-scale nutrition research, was found to be highly feasible.

The databases search identified 1925 unique articles, 77 full-text articles were reviewed, and 48 studies were included in this scoping review, including 31 primary studies and 17 systematic reviews. Primary studies examined a range of interventions that varied by probiotic diversity and types, including 8 studies that focused on synbiotics, which include both pre- and probiotics. Several systematic reviews examined the effect of probiotics on ventilator-associated pneumonia and other infections. Although most systematic reviews concluded probiotics may improve these outcomes, most systematic review authors concluded that the evidence was low in quality and high in heterogeneity.

Previous research suggests that dietary polyphenol intake is protective against major chronic diseases. To our knowledge, no data on polyphenol intake for the US adult population are available. This study explored usual dietary polyphenol intake among US adults in 2013-2016 and examined trends in intake during 2007-2016 by demographic characteristics, and identified major dietary sources of polyphenols. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a series of cross-sectional surveys representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population. This study included 9,773 adults aged 20 years and older. Dietary and supplement data were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recalls. Polyphenol intake was estimated using the Phenol Explorer Database and adjusted for total energy intake. Usual intake was estimated both overall and by demographic characteristics using the National Cancer Institute method. Trends in intake on a given day over 10 years were evaluated using regression analysis. The complex survey design was incorporated in all analyses. In 2013-2016, the usual intake of dietary polyphenols was a mean (standard error) of 884.1 (20.4) mg per 1,000 kcal\/d. Polyphenol intake was higher in adults 40 years and older, women, non-Hispanic White adults, and college graduates. During 2007-2016, the mean daily polyphenol intake did not change significantly over time for overall and demographic groups.

To better understand the facilitators and barriers to WIC implementation from the perspective of DVS staff, we analyzed 36 in-depth interviews with employees of this DVS chain at corporate, manager, and store clerk levels. Most participants provided positive feedback about implementing and offering WIC. Many store employees had personal experience participating in WIC, which increased their understanding of the WIC shopping experience. Store staff's prior WIC participation and customers' proximity to DVS locations were facilitators to implementation. Primary barriers included limited choice of store products for customers, complicated or unclear labeling of WIC products, and difficulty training employees to process WIC vouchers. These findings suggest that whereas most employees viewed WIC positively, barriers related to product selection and training must be addressed. Notably, North Carolina's recent change to an electronic system to process WIC transactions requires minimal manual employee training and should address several barriers to implementation.

The databases search retrieved 2,519 articles, and 7 cross-sectional articles were included in the final narrative analysis. Three studies examined pediatric participants and 4 examined adults. None of the included studies reported on outcomes of mortality or quality of life. Very low certainty evidence described no apparent relationship between dietary macronutrient distribution and lung function, anthropometric measures, or lipid profile in individuals with CF. The current systematic review demonstrates wide ranges in the dietary macronutrient intakes of individuals with CF with little to no demonstrable relationship between macronutrient distribution and nutrition-related outcomes. No evidence is presented to substantiate an outcomes-related benefit to a higher fat-diet except in the context of achieving higher energy intakes in a lesser volume of food.","395":"There is a strong positive association between nutrition status and lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF). Improvements in clinical care have increased longevity for individuals with CF, and it is unknown how cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) modulation therapy affects nutrition status over time. The objective of this systematic review of the literature was to examine anthropometric (height, weight, and body mass index [BMI; calculated as kg\/m2]) and body composition outcomes of CFTR modulation therapy. A literature search of Medline (Ovid), Embase, and CINAHL (EBSCO) databases was conducted for randomized controlled trials examining the effect of CFTR modulation therapy on anthropometric and body composition parameters, published in peer-reviewed journals from January 2002 until May 2018. Articles were screened, data were synthesized qualitatively, and evidence quality was graded by a team of content experts and systematic review methodologists. Significant weight gain with ivacaftor was noted in children and adults with at least 1 copy of G551D mutation. In adults with at least 1 copy of R117H the effect of ivacaftor on BMI was not significant. Effects on BMI were mixed in adults with class II mutations taking ivacaftor with lumacaftor. There was no significant change in BMI in children homozygous for F508del who took ivacaftor with tezacaftor. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor increased BMI and body weight in individuals 12 years of age and older who were hetero- or homozygous for the F508del mutation. The effect of CFTR modulation therapy on anthropometric parameters depends on the genetic mutation and the type of modulation therapy used.

This study was a cross-sectional analysis of the Shahedieh cohort study, which began in 2015-2016 and continues to the present day. A total of 5,954 Iranian adults, aged 35 to 70 years, were included in the current analysis. To collect dietary data, the validated block-format 120-item semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire was used. MetS was defined using the criteria belonging to the Iranian-modified National Cholesterol Education Program for Adults. Enzymatic colorimetric tests were used to measure fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; blood pressure and waist circumference were measured using the standard protocols. Binary logistic regression with adjusted models was used to examine the association of DIL and DII with MetS. After taking potential confounders into account, moderate DIL was associated with increased odds of MetS in men, meaning that men in the third quartile of DIL had 61% greater odds for having MetS compared with those in the first quartile (odds ratio [OR]: 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.54). Such a significant association was not seen for DII. In women, DIL was significantly associated with increased odds of developing MetS. After controlling for potential confounders, women in the top quartile of DIL had 77% greater odds for having MetS compared with women in the bottom quartile (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.08-2.91). This significant positive association was also seen for DII, such that a higher score of DII was associated with 41% greater odds of MetS (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.08-1.83). Adherence to a diet with a high DIL and DII is associated with greater odds of having MetS in women. Also, moderate DIL was associated with increased odds of MetS in men.

Our aim was to establish health\/psychosocial profiles of US Army soldiers who participate in HIIT and\/or use WL\/PES DS. This cross-sectional observational study used data from the 2016 US Army Global Assessment Tool. Data were analyzed from respondents to the 2016 US Army Global Assessment Tool (n=299,996) who consented to have their data used for research purposes. Soldiers were classified into four groups based on HIIT and\/or WL\/PES DS use. Thirty-five percent of soldiers participated in HIIT and 10% took WL\/PES DS at least once per month in the last year. HIIT participation was associated with higher reported odds of healthy behaviors and higher emotional and social fitness. In contrast to HIIT, WL\/PES DS use was associated with higher reported odds of risky behaviors (hazardous drinking and tobacco use) and lower psychosocial fitness. The group participating in HIIT but not using WL\/PES DS reported fewer unhealthy behaviors compared to the HIIT+WL\/PES DS and WL\/PES DS-only groups. Engaging in HIIT is associated with higher reported odds of healthy behaviors and increased psychosocial fitness.

The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study is a multicenter prospective study of patients with CKD that used a validated food frequency questionnaire to capture dietary intake at the baseline visit. This is a cross-sectional analysis of 2,484 participants recruited in 2003-2006 from seven Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study centers. Food outlet data were used to construct a count of the number of fast-food restaurants, convenience stores, and grocery stores per 10,000 population for each geocoded census block group. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between measures of food outlet availability and dietary factors. The proportion of participants living in zero-, low-, and high-food outlet density areas differed by gender, race or ethnicity, and income level. Among male subjects, living in areas with zero or the highest number of outlets was associated with having the highest caloric intakes in multivariable models. Male subjects living in areas with zero outlets consumed the highest levels of sodium and phosphorous. Female subjects living in areas with zero outlets had the lowest average intake of calories, sodium, and phosphorous. Among low-income female subjects, close proximity to more outlets was associated with higher calorie consumption.

A national longitudinal observational study was conducted with participants initially enrolled in WIC in 2013. Telephone interviews were conducted with study mothers from 2013 to 2016. Duration of WIC participation was categorized as high, medium, or low based on the number of interviews during which participants reported receiving WIC benefits. Participants in the WIC Infant and Toddler Feeding Practices Study 2 who had completed a baseline interview and all interviews through 24 months were included; participants who reported discontinuing WIC due to perceived program ineligibility were excluded from analyses (N=1,250). Data were weighted to represent the study-eligible population. Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores of children at age 24 months were calculated based on 24-hour dietary recalls. Unadjusted analysis of variance examined Healthy Eating Index 2015 scores by WIC participation duration. Multivariate linear regression analysis tested independent effects of WIC duration on Healthy Eating Index 2015 total scores, controlling for sociodemographic factors.

The analysis used 1 week of school menu data from 1,206 schools at lunch and 1,110 schools at breakfast for SY 2014-2015, and 884 schools at lunch and 802 schools at breakfast for SY 2009-2010. Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores were estimated. Descriptive analyses were conducted to estimate mean Healthy Eating Index 2010 total and component scores for school meals. Scores are expressed as a percentage of maximum possible scores. Two-tailed t tests were used to assess differences in scores before and after updated standards were in place. Total Healthy Eating Index 2010 scores for school lunches and breakfasts increased significantly after the updated standards. Between SY 2009-2010 and SY 2014-2015, the total score for school lunches increased from 58% of the maximum score to 82%, and the total score for school breakfasts increased from 50% to 71% (P&lt;0.05). For both meals, component scores increased by more than 20 percentage points for whole grains, refined grains, and empty calories, as well as for greens and beans for lunches and whole fruit and sodium for breakfasts. The updated nutrition standards for schools meals significantly improved the nutritional quality of the meals and their consistency with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Descriptive evidence from the Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness trial delivered through local cooperative extension service offices in rural areas previously identified that behavioral modification with both nutrition education and coaching resulted in a lower program delivery cost per kilogram of weight loss maintained at 2-years compared with an education-only comparator intervention. This analysis extended earlier Rural Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Effectiveness trial research regarding weight loss outcomes to assess whether nutrition education with behavioral coaching delivered through cooperative extension service offices is cost-effective relative to nutrition education only in reducing T2D cases in rural areas. A cost-utility analysis was conducted. Trial participants (n=317) from June 2008 through June 2014 were adults residing in rural Florida counties with a baseline body mass index between 30 and 45, but otherwise identified as healthy. Trial participants were randomly assigned to low, moderate, or high doses of behavioral coaching with nutrition education (ie, 16, 32, or 48 sessions over 24 months) or a comparator intervention that included 16 sessions of nutrition education without coaching. Participant glycated hemoglobin level was measured at baseline and the end of the trial to assess T2D status. T2D categories by treatment arm were used to estimate participants' expected annual health care expenditures and expected health-related utility measured as quality adjusted life years (ie, QALYs) over a 5-year time horizon. Discounted incremental costs and QALYs were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each behavioral coaching intervention dose relative to the education-only comparator. Using a third-party payer perspective, Markov transition matrices were used to model participant transitions between T2D states. Replications of the individual participant behavior were conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. All three doses of the behavioral coaching intervention had lower expected total costs and higher estimated QALYs than the education-only comparator. The moderate dose behavioral coaching intervention was associated with higher estimated QALYs but was costlier than the low dose; the moderate dose was favored over the low dose with willingness to pay thresholds over $107,895\/QALY. The low dose behavioral coaching intervention was otherwise favored. Because most rural Americans live in counties with cooperative extension service offices, nutrition education with behavioral coaching programs similar to those delivered through this trial may be effective and efficient in preventing or delaying T2D-associated consequences of obesity for rural adults.

This study sought to assess and describe pregnant women's experiences and behaviors pertaining to food cravings. Eight focus groups were conducted with 68 pregnant women in their second trimester from March 2015 to October 2016. Using a semistructured approach, the facilitator asked women open-ended questions regarding their experience of eating behaviors and food cravings. The content from the focus groups was analyzed using a bottom-up approach based on grounded theory and constant comparison analysis. Participants described cravings as urgent, food-specific, and cognitively demanding occurrences that were differentiated from hunger. They described beliefs surrounding the physiological causes of cravings and rationales for satisfying their cravings. Strategies used to manage cravings included environmental modifications to limit proximity and availability of craved foods, cognitive and behavioral strategies like distraction, and acceptance through satisfying the craving. Participants described food cravings as a psychologically salient aspect of their pregnancy, reporting a variety of emotional precursors and reactions surrounding their cravings. A better understanding of food cravings may assist with the development of interventions to improve eating behaviors and reduce eating-related distress during pregnancy. Acceptance regarding food cravings was indicated as a way to diffuse pregnancy-related stress.

Our aim was to describe the frequency with which Arkansas food pantries offer foods included in Feeding America's Detailed Foods to Encourage (F2E) framework, and examine food pantry characteristics associated with increased frequency of offering F2E and other foods. This was a 27-item cross-sectional online survey that assessed food pantries' characteristics (eg, storage capacities, number of clients served) and typical food offerings. Partnering with five of Arkansas's six food banks, 764 e-mail invitations were sent to food agency managers across the state. A final sample of 357 food pantries was included in the analyses. The primary outcomes of interest were the frequencies of offering specific F2E and F2E in general. The F2E framework was developed by Feeding America to more accurately assess food banks' inventories, and its categories (Fruits and Vegetables; Protein; Dairy; and Grains) are generally consistent with MyPlate. Descriptive statistics were computed for all food pantry characteristics and frequency of foods offered. Associations between food pantry characteristics and the frequency of offering F2E were examined via multiple linear regression and path analysis. Only 18.5% of food pantries had written nutrition guidelines, and only 19.3% offered client choice distribution. The F2E most commonly offered were meat\/poultry\/seafood without breading and not fried (59.6%) and peanut butter (58.2%). The least commonly offered F2E were nuts\/seeds with nothing added (3.8%) and low-fat\/1%\/skim cheese (8.2%).

This review includes intervention and observational studies among women of any age with a history of GDM that reported on the effects of dietary interventions or association of dietary intake (energy, nutrients, foods, dietary patterns) with T2DM, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or prediabetes. The systematic review identified five articles reporting results from four intervention studies, and seven articles reporting results from four observational studies. Findings from intervention studies indicated trends toward beneficial effects of a low-glycemic index diet, a low-carbohydrate diet, and a diet in line with general population dietary guidelines, but studies had unclear or high risk of bias. Findings from two cross-sectional and one prospective study indicated poorer diabetes outcomes for women with higher intakes of branched-chain amino acids, total and heme iron, and a diet relatively low in carbohydrates and high in animal fat and protein, and better outcomes among those consuming diets rich in fruit, vegetables, nuts, fish, and legumes, and low in red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages, after adjustment for confounders, including body mass index.

The CEP has been linked to greater likelihood of eating school meals, but little is known about its impact on broader outcomes. The purpose of this study was to estimate the association between the CEP and school attendance among elementary school students (grades 1 to 5). This was a quasi-experimental study in which students' attendance records were observed over 1 baseline and 2 follow-up years in a sample of CEP and eligible non-CEP schools. The participants were elementary school students in Wisconsin during three consecutive school years beginning 2013-2014. The main sample included 92,126 observation-years for students in 37 CEP and 108 eligible non-CEP elementary schools. CEP-participating schools offered breakfast and lunch free to all students through the School Breakfast Program and the National School Lunch Program beginning in 2014-2015. The outcome measures were the attendance rate (defined as the percentage of school days attended) and low attendance (defined as attending fewer than 95% of available days) during the first and second implementation years. Difference-in-difference regression models with student fixed effects were estimated, with separate impacts for the first and second CEP years. Models adjusted for time-varying school and student characteristics. Implementing the CEP had no association with attendance in the initial year. The second year of CEP was associated with a 3.5 percentage point reduction in the percentage of students with low attendance (P=0.045).

In 2018, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics conducted the latest iteration of this survey. This article compares the results of the 2008, 2013, and 2018 surveys to examine changes in RDNs' knowledge of billing code use and reimbursement patterns over time; understand the potential influences on coding and billing practices in a changing health care environment; and understand the effects of newer practice settings and care delivery models on billing and reimbursement for medical nutrition therapy services. Results from these surveys demonstrate that during the past 10 years RDNs' knowledge of billing and coding has been stable and very low for RDNs not in supervisory roles or private practice. RDNs reported an increase in providing medical nutrition therapy services to patients with multiple conditions. Since 2013, a dramatic increase was noted in the reported proportion of reimbursement from private\/commercial health insurance plans.

Food pantry environmental interventions may improve diet quality of low-income, food insecure populations by encouraging healthy food choices. The two a priori exploratory research questions were: What strategies do food pantries and food banks undertake to implement healthy environments affecting the physical space or how clients are treated; and, What challenges do pantries and food banks face during these efforts? Interview data were collected March through May 2016 via in-depth telephone interviews and respondents were recruited by purposive and snowball sampling. Respondents were 43 key informants who represented food bank distributors (n=16), food pantries (n=14), community partners (n=6), and antihunger advocates (n=2) within the 13 western US states. Strategies to improve the healthfulness of food pantry environments were defined and their corresponding processes described. A thematic and descriptive analysis approach was used to elucidate healthy environment strategies. Data were analyzed by inductive modeling and network application of descriptive process codes to address the research question. Seven strategies to address the emotional and physical dimensions of a food pantry environment were identified and described. Associated challenges (n=12), characteristics of initiation (n=9), and evaluation methods (n=7) were revealed.

To investigate how exposure to different marketing techniques from television (TV) and online food advertising affects children's brand recall, recognition, and attitudinal responses toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the advertised products. Secondary analysis of data from a crossover experimental-control study. In all, 154 children (7 to 12 years) completed the study, conducted at four 6-day holiday camps from April 2016 to January 2017 in New South Wales, Australia. Children were assigned to a single-media (n=76) or multiple-media (n=78) condition. All children viewed 10 TV food advertisements in a cartoon on three occasions. For one of the brands, one set of children additionally played online \"advergames\" featuring the brand. Children's recognition and attitudes toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the product were reported via a brand recognition and attitude survey pre- and postintervention. Marketing techniques were categorized. Pre- and postintervention brand recognition and relationships between brand recognition and attitudes by media condition and desire to eat the product were examined using generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models. There was a significant increase in the number of brands recognized postexposure by children in both media groups (mean difference=3.8, P&lt;0.0001). The majority of brands appealed to children. Children who reported wanting to eat the advertised products rated brands more positively than children who did not express a desire to eat the products. A larger proportion of children who played the advergames (36%) rated brand consumers as \"cool\" than children who viewed the TV advertisements only (19%) (P&lt;0.001). Anti-adult themes, fun and humor, and parent pleasing were techniques unique to some of the most recognized and favored advertisements. The marketing communications increased children's brand recognition and elicited positive attitudinal responses. These findings indicate a need for policy makers to consider additional regulations to protect children from the persuasive influence of unhealthy food advertising.

Participants included 3,315 (55.5% female) subjects responding to in-home interviews across all five Waves of Add Health. BMI at each wave modeled over time. Latent class growth modeling and logistic regression analysis using population sample weights. Five classes of weight patterns best fit the sample. Twenty-nine percent of the sample had an always healthy BMI (class 1) and 34.9% changed from healthy weight to overweight (class 2). Moving from healthy weight to obese comprised 21.8% of the sample (class 3). BMI patterns increasing from overweight to obese (class 4) and from obese to severely obese (class 5) comprised 7.6% and 7.1% of the sample, respectively. Weight change was similar for males and females with some racial or ethnic minority participants more likely to be severely obese in adulthood. Results emphasize the importance of tracking weight longitudinally and point to a nationally representative trend of increasing BMI during the transition to adulthood. There was no substantive decreasing trend identified in the sample.

Data were analyzed from 6,267 respondents to the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and its supplemental data source, the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey, to assess reported knowledge of typical daily calorie requirements and associations with demographic and other characteristics of interest. Logistic regression for complex sample surveys was used to estimate associations between self-reported daily calorie needs for men and women aged 21 years and older and participant characteristics. Most respondents accurately reported typical daily calorie needs for a person of their sex, age group, and physical activity level, however, distinct differences emerged between demographic groups. Women, non-Hispanic whites, and those with higher income and education levels were more likely to estimate typical daily calorie needs accurately; men were almost four times more likely than women to indicate a lack of knowledge of daily calorie needs.

Thematic analysis drawn from a constructivist grounded theory approach. Information from colleagues and experts of the field were favored when facing unfamiliar situations in clinical practice. Critically selecting evidence-based information was considered challenging, but dietitians declared they were at ease to integrate patients' preferences and values, and their clinical expertise and judgment, in decision making, which are fundamental elements of EBP. A major reported barrier to KT was the perception that time to identify and read scientific literature was not expected during working hours and that instead, this time should be spent in clinical activities with patients. On the other hand, dietitians identified that their frequent involvement in educational activities such as knowledge dissemination or tailoring favored the integration of evidence into practice. Finally, dietitians struggled more to identify evidence-based information about counseling and communication than about biomedical knowledge. Dietitians mentioned being involved in each step of the KT process (ie, synthesis, dissemination, exchange, and ethically sound application of knowledge). Barriers and facilitators identified in this study need to be explored in a larger population to develop strategies to facilitate KT and EBP in dietetics practice.

Dietary data collected from US adults aged 20 years and older completing at least one valid 24-hour diet recall from nine cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2016) were used to evaluate the trends in mean consumption of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, and fish\/shellfish. This was a nationally representative sample of 43,995 US adults aged 20 years and older. We measured survey-weighted, energy-adjusted mean consumption of processed meat, unprocessed red meat, poultry, and fish\/shellfish. Trends in mean intake were assessed by treating the 2-year survey cycle as a continuous variable in survey-weighted linear regression models. Changes in mean intake were computed as the difference in mean intake between the earliest (1999-2000) and latest (2015-2016) cycles.

A systematic review was performed according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library process to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on both maternal and infant health outcomes of pregnancy. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies published from years 2000 to 2015 that examined the health effects of pregnancy after bariatric surgery. Experimental studies and observational studies with a control group were included. Outcomes of interest were gestational weight gain, maternal complications (ie, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, hypertension, and postpartum hemorrhage), miscarriage and\/or stillbirth, cesarean section, birth weight in grams, birth weight in categories (ie, macrosomia, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and large for gestational age), gestational age and preterm birth, infant illness and complications (ie, perinatal death, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal illness, and congenital malformation rates), and Apgar scores. Thirteen of 246 studies were included. Compared to body mass index-matched controls without surgery, bariatric surgery before pregnancy reduced infant birth weight in grams, with no effect on total maternal gestational weight gain or Apgar scores. Surgery did not increase risk of adverse outcomes, such as miscarriage and\/or stillbirth, preterm birth, or infant complications. Effects of surgery on maternal complications, infant birth weight categories, and surgical delivery rates were inconsistent.

To date, taste preference evaluations have not been conducted on commercially available sugar-free fruit drinks. The study tested the hypothesis that children would have equal preference for sugar-free and sugar-sweetened fruit drinks. This was an experimental two-alternative forced-choice paired preference test. The study focused on a convenience sample of Yup'ik children, aged 7 to 10 years, recruited and enrolled from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation dental clinic in Bethel, AK (N=89). Children evaluated four different commercially available sugar-free fruit drinks paired with the sugar-sweetened versions of each flavor. Order of flavor pair presentation was alternated across children, and order of presentation within each of the four pairs was randomized across pairs. The outcome was taste preference for the sugar-free versus the sugar-sweetened version of a fruit drink. A test of equivalence was run across all four flavors and separately for each flavor using two one-sided tests. The data failed to demonstrate equivalence of the sugar-free and sugar-sweetened fruit drinks across all four flavors (P=0.51) or separately for each flavor. However, this was not because of a preference for sugar-sweetened drinks. The preference for sugar-free drinks overall and for each flavor was &gt;50%. Although the lower bounds of the 90% CIs were within the range of equivalence (40% to 60%), the upper bounds were outside the range of equivalence (&gt;60%). According to post hoc analyses, similar preferences were observed for Yup'ik and non-Yup'ik children, boys and girls, and children of different ages. Taste preference findings suggest that sugar-free fruit drinks may be a well-tolerated alternative to sugar-sweetened fruit drinks for Yup'ik children in Alaska Native communities.

These summer nutrition programs are designed to decrease food insecurity and improve health outcomes among at-risk populations. However, the characteristics of these programs, including the types of participants reached, and the programs' influence on outcomes such as academics, behavior, and physical and mental health, have not been summarized. The aims of this narrative review are to present existing knowledge about the characteristics of summer nutrition programs and their influence on students, to identify knowledge gaps, and to identify future research needs. An extensive search identified eight peer-reviewed articles and 10 reports, briefs, or other documents reporting research on the Summer Food Service Program. A variety of additional literature was reviewed to provide relevant information about summer nutrition programs. The review revealed a dearth of research regarding current Summer Food Service Program implementation. Summer nutrition programs alleviated food insecurity among at-risk populations; however, little research was found about the influence of summer programs on students' dietary intake or weight outcomes.

Nearly 40 years later, added sugar consumption still exceeds 2015-2020 DGA recommendations among most of the population. The reinforcing value of food influences eating behaviors, and foods high in added sugars are highly reinforcing. Restricting intake of foods high in added sugars as part of a low-sugar diet may increase their reinforcing value such that reducing consumption may be difficult to maintain. If so, this would present a mechanistic barrier to making the necessary dietary changes to meet 2015-2020 DGA recommendations. To determine whether the relative reinforcing value of foods high in added sugars is altered when reducing intake of all foods high in sugars. Obese (n=19) and normal weight (n=23) men and woman who habitually consumed over 10% of their calories from added sugars completed the study. Reinforcing value of foods high in added sugars was measured via progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement before and on day 7 of a weeklong controlled feeding intervention where added sugars comprised 2.5% to 4.0% of daily calories and total sugars 7.3% to 8.6% of daily calories. The reinforcing value of foods high in added sugars increased (P&lt;0.01) after consuming a diet low in total added sugars for 1 week in both obese and normal weight participants. Adhering to a low-sugar diet for 1 week increases the reinforcing value of foods high in added sugars. Future studies should examine whether consuming a diet low in added sugars, but not other sugar, increases reinforcing value of foods high in added sugars and whether high-added sugar food reinforcement returns to baseline after longer-term reductions in added sugars.

This study assessed the utilization of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) and its association with the number of 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions of adult malnourished patients in comparison with the readmissions rates of their malnourished counterparts who did not receive ONS. This was a retrospective cohort study. Of 153,161 inpatient encounters analyzed, a total of 8,713 (5.7%) malnourished adults admitted to an academic medical center hospital in the United States between October 1, 2016, and September 30, 2017 were included in the analyses. The study utilized records of patients at risk of malnutrition on admission and subsequently diagnosed as malnourished by a registered dietitian following established criteria. ONS utilization rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), and 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions data were obtained from electronic medical records. The associations between the number of 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions and ONS use were analyzed using mixed-effects negative binomial regression models, with coefficients and 95% CIs reported. Important covariates such as age, sex, and the severity of illness index were included in the regression models. Only 3.1% of malnourished patients received ONS. ONS users had 38.8% fewer readmissions compared with non-ONS counterparts (P=0.017). The reduction in hospital readmissions by ONS was even greater for oncology patients (46.1%, P&lt;0.001). A 50% reduction in time from hospital admission to ONS provision was associated with a 10.2% (P&lt;0.01), 10.2% (P=0.014), and 16.6% (P&lt;0.01) decrease in LOS for overall, oncology, and intensive care unit encounters, respectively. In a large cohort of malnourished adult inpatient encounters, ONS provision rate was low, but when used, ONS intervention was associated with 38.8% fewer 30-day readmissions. This association was more pronounced for oncology encounters. Shorter LOS was observed when the interval between admission and ONS initiation was shorter.

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is effective in managing hypertension and other chronic conditions, yet it is not clear whether behavioral weight control interventions improve DASH adherence. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a behavioral weight loss intervention that did not emphasize diet quality and examined whether the intervention impacted DASH adherence in medically vulnerable community health center patients. Participants (n=306) were enrolled in Track, a randomized controlled weight loss intervention for patients with elevated cardiovascular risk. The trial compared usual care to an intervention with weekly self-monitoring, tailored feedback on diet and exercise goals, and dietitian and provider counseling in community health centers. Dietary intake was measured using the Block Food Frequency Questionnaires collected at baseline and 12 months. DASH adherence was determined using previously validated scoring indices that assessed adherence based on recommended nutrient or food group targets. Total scores for both indices ranged from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater DASH adherence. The mean (and standard deviation [SD]) age of participants was 51.1 (SD=8.8) years and the mean body mass index was 35.9 (SD=3.9). Most were female (69%) and black (51%); 13% were Hispanic.

There were no significant predictors of change in DASH score and no association between DASH adherence and changes in blood pressure. Within the intervention arm, improvements in DASH nutrient score were associated with greater weight loss (r=-0.28; P=0.003). Although the intervention was not designed to increase adoption of DASH, the Track intervention produced significant weight loss and small improvements in DASH adherence. Despite these small improvements, overall adoption of DASH was poor among the medically vulnerable patients enrolled in Track.

The aim of this study was to conceptualize and define professionalism for the purpose of teaching nutrition and dietetics. This study included a critical systematic literature review of original research and a targeted and systematic search of national and international dietetics competency standards, exploring the concept and definitions of professionalism in nutrition and dietetics. Competency standards were chosen as an additional focus in the systematic literature search, as they are the key framework documents that guide curriculum development and education standards internationally. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize extracted data and an inductive, interpretivist approach was then applied in conceptualizing a definition of professionalism. Seven studies and six national and international sets of competency standards were included in the literature review. Four major themes conceptualizing a definition of professionalism for nutrition and dietetics were identified from the integration of the original research and targeted gray literature reviews: 1) personal attributes; 2) interpersonal communication; 3) approach to practice; and 4) commitment to lifelong learning. Defining professionalism for nutrition and dietetics supports progress toward shared understandings, building trust, and assisting in dietetics education and practice.

We conducted a cross-sectional study in which the participants recorded dietary intake from 2016 to 2017. Specifically developed nutritional composition databases were used to obtain nutritional data, including macronutrients and food groups, according to previously standardized criteria. Two hundred and seven pediatric patients with CF from six European centers were involved in the My App for Cystic Fibrosis self-management project. Participants reported dietary intake with a detailed 4-day food record. Descriptive analyses of nutrient intake, food group consumption, and dietary origin of macronutrients were conducted with R software. Similar patterns were found in nutrient and food group intake; both sugar and saturated fatty acids contributed &gt;10% each to the total daily energy intake in all the centers. Large mean and median percent differences were observed in the intake of other nutrient and food groups, because sweets and snacks were consumed once or twice a day, and fruit and vegetables were consumed two or three times a day. Milk, meat, sweets and snacks, and oils were the main sources of fat in all centers. Study findings indicated less than optimal nutrient profiles, especially for sugars and saturated fatty acids, resulting from the high consumption of meat, dairy, and processed products and low consumption of fish, nuts, and legumes. These results can serve as a basis for future tailored interventions that target improved adherence to nutritional recommendations for patients with CF.

Ninety-nine studies and 209 study arms were included in the analysis. An exploratory meta-analysis using alternative meta-analytic methods designed for complex, heterogenous interventions was conducted to identify relative contributions by intervention provider category at selected time points. Meta-regression analyses were used to evaluate significant differences from the reference category for each provider category. The nutrition specialist-only condition resulted in increased reductions in BMI z score compared with behavioralist-only, combined nutrition specialist and behavioralist, and neither nutrition specialist or behavioralist category (reference) throughout the analysis. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the difference in BMI z score between the nutrition specialist-only category and the reference category was significant at 3 to &lt;6 months, 6 months to &lt;1 year, and 1-year to 2-year time points (P=0.01, P=0.05, and P=0.01, respectively).

A literature search to identify articles published up to March 31, 2018, was conducted utilizing PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Individuals at aged 18 years or older with T2DM from randomized controlled trials investigating prebiotics or substances with prebiotic properties were included. Metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers associated with T2DM were the primary outcome measures. Twenty-seven publications were analyzed. All but seven of these publications reported a beneficial effect on metabolic and\/or inflammatory biomarkers. Interventions included mostly women, lasted 4 days to 12 weeks, and diabetes duration ranged from 6 months to 11 years.

Benefits from resistant starch, resistant dextrin, and oligofructose-enriched inulin were most frequent. A smaller number of studies utilizing other substances with prebiotic properties also yielded improvements. Based on these results, there is fair evidence that prebiotics and substances with prebiotic properties may improve metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers related to T2DM in women aged 18 years at least. Interventions with resistant starch, resistant dextrin, and oligofructose-enriched inulin exhibited the strongest evidence for improvements due to the quantity of publications and quality grades.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between within-subjects and between-subjects predictors and KPB, and to develop a model of KPB that improves over previous models of KPB. Within-subjects predictors included time since last bite, food item enjoyment, premeal satiety, and time in meal. Between-subjects predictors included body mass index, mouth volume, and sex. Seventy-two participants (39 female) consumed two random meals out of five possible meal options with known weights and energy densities. There were 4,051 usable bites measured. The outcome measure of the first analysis was KPB. The outcome measure of the second analysis was meal-level kilocalorie intake, with true intake compared to three estimation methods. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the influence of the seven predictors of KPB. The accuracy of the model was compared to previous methods of estimating KPB using a repeated-measured analysis of variance. All hypothesized relationships were significant, with slopes in the expected direction, except for body mass index and time in meal.

Recruitment occurred through primary care clinics serving low-income populations in Minnesota. The main outcomes were participants' self-reports of whether they served fruits, vegetables, and whole grains at a meal, and reports were made within hours of the meal. Within-group estimator methods were used to estimate the associations between meal preparation and types of food served. These models held constant time-invariant characteristics of families and adjusted for whether the meal was breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack and whether it was a weekend meal. For all racial\/ethnic and poverty status groups, meals that were fully or partly home-cooked were more likely to contain fruits and vegetables than pre-prepared meals (P&lt;0.001).

Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the relationship between baseline and persistence of breakfast consumption and family breakfast over a 3-year period and change in BMI and %BF. Breakfast and family breakfast were assessed by questions on frequency of consumption. Both variables were classified as regular, intermediate, and no consumption at baseline. Persistence was divided into persistently regular, persistently irregular, changing from regular to irregular, and contrariwise. Overall, frequent breakfast consumption and family breakfast did not have protective effects against adiposity. At baseline, these behaviors were associated with low BMI and %BF among girls. During follow-up, these behaviors and persistence of regular breakfast consumption were associated with an increase in %BF (P&lt;0.05).

For those assigned to the intervention, registered dietitian nutritionists used a treatment protocol to initiate and titrate therapies for blood glucose, hypertension, and lipid levels in addition to providing medical nutrition therapy; telemedicine visits supplemented usual care. Primary outcomes included composite and individual diabetes optimal care goals: hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, not using tobacco, and taking a statin and aspirin (as appropriate). Secondary measures included physical activity, breakfast, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and medication adherence. Mixed-model regression was used to examine outcomes between baseline and 1-year follow-up.

Mean daily 100% juice, milk, SSB, water\/sugar-free beverage, and energy intakes and MARs averaged over ages 2 to 4.7, 5 to 8.5, 9 to 10.5, 11 to 12.5, 13 to 14.5, or 15 to 17 years were predictors. BMI z score was the outcome. Linear mixed models were fit for each beverage, energy, and MAR variable, with the beverage, energy, or MAR variable as the predictor and BMI z score as the outcome. Beverage models were adjusted for energy and MAR and baseline socioeconomic status. SSB intake adjusted for energy intake, MAR, and baseline socioeconomic status was associated with BMI z score; each additional 8 oz SSB consumed\/day throughout childhood and adolescence increased the BMI z score an average 0.050 units (95% CI 0.022 to 0.079; P=0.001). Adjusted water\/sugar-free beverage intake (0.026 units; 95% CI 0.006 to 0.046; P=0.013) was modestly associated with BMI z score, while 100% juice (-0.001 units; 95% CI -0.059 to 0.057; P=0.97) and milk (0.022 units; 95% CI -0.007 to 0.052; P=0.13) intakes were not associated with BMI z scores. Higher SSB intakes were associated with increased BMI z scores throughout childhood and adolescence in Iowa Fluoride Study participants. Public health initiatives targeting SSB consumption during childhood and adolescence remain relevant. ","648":"Many American adults have one or more chronic diseases related to a poor diet, resulting in significant direct and indirect economic impacts. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recognized that dietary patterns may be more relevant for predicting health outcomes compared with individual diet elements and recommended three healthy patterns based on evidence of favorable associations with many chronic disease risk factors and outcomes. Health economic assessments provide a model to estimate the potential influence on costs associated with changes in chronic disease risk resulting from improved diet quality in the US adult population. To estimate the impact on health care costs associated with increased conformance with the three healthy patterns recommended in the 2015-2020 DGA, including the Healthy US-Style, the Healthy Mediterranean-Style, and the Healthy Vegetarian eating patterns. Recent moderate- to high-quality meta-analyses of health outcomes associated with increased conformance with the Healthy US-Style eating pattern as measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) or the Healthy Mediterranean-Style eating pattern measured by a Mediterranean diet score (MED) were identified. Given the lack of quantification of the association between an increased conformance with a vegetarian pattern and health outcomes, the analysis was limited to studies that evaluated Healthy US-style and Healthy Mediterranean-style eating patterns. The 2013-2014 What We Eat in America data provided estimates of conformance with these two eating patterns using the HEI-2015 and the 9-point MED among the US adult population. Risk estimates quantifying the association between eating patterns and health outcomes were combined with the eating pattern score increase under two conformance scenarios: increasing the average HEI-2015 and MED by 20% and increasing the average HEI-2015 and MED to achieve 80% of complete conformance. The resulting change in risk was combined with published data on annual health care and indirect costs, inflated to 2017 US dollars to estimate cost. To address double counting, costs were adjusted to minimize potential overlap of comorbidities. Overall modeled cost savings were $16.7 billion (range=$6.7 billion to $25.4 billion) to $31.5 billion (range=$23.9 billion to $38.9 billion) based on a 20% increase in the MED and HEI-2015, respectively, resulting from reductions in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes for both patterns and including Alzheimer's disease and hip fractures for the MED. In the case that diet quality of US adults were to improve to achieve 80% of the maximum MED and HEI-2015, cost savings were estimated at $88.2 billion (range=$35.7 billion to $133 billion) and $55.1 billion (range=$41.8 billion to $68.2 billion), respectively. This is the first study quantifying savings from all health outcomes identified to be associated with the HEI and the MED to assess conformance with two eating patterns recommended as part of the 2015-2020 DGA. Findings from this study suggest that increasing conformance with healthy eating patterns among US adults could reduce costs, with billions of dollars in potential savings.

Public utilization of the DGA, specifically the MyPyramid or MyPlate tool, is not well studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between public knowledge of the 2010 DGA assessed by use of the MyPyramid or MyPlate dietary plan and various markers of diet intake (including dietary energy density and Food Patterns Equivalents Database component scores) in US adults. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a large, cross-sectional survey conducted continuously to monitor the health and nutritional status of US residents. The sampling design of NHANES allows for collection of a nationally representative sample. Data from a nationally representative sample of 3,194 adults&gt;18 years with 1 complete day of dietary recall data during the 2011-2014 NHANES were used for this study. During NHANES, participants were asked about knowledge and use of the MyPyramid or MyPlate plan. Mean daily dietary intake was compared between MyPyramid or MyPlate users and nonusers. Multivariable regression models were then used to evaluate the relationship between use of MyPlate or MyPyramid and various food pattern components consumed daily. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, household size, family income (using NHANES-provided poverty-to-income ratio), smoking status, beverage energy density, and physical activity. Subjects who reported using the MyPyramid or MyPlate plan had better diets than subjects who had not tried the MyPyramid or MyPlate plan. Users of MyPyramid or MyPlate had significantly lower dietary energy density (1.8 vs 1.9 kcal\/g, P=0.0003) and significantly fewer servings of refined grains (5.9 vs 6.5 oz equivalents, P=0.0007) but more servings of whole grains (1.1 vs 0.8 oz equivalents, P=0.007), more dark green and leafy vegetables (P=0.006), and lower intake of added sugars (18 vs 21 tsp, P=0.0005) and solid fats (34 vs 39 g, P&lt;0.0001) after adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, household size, family income (using NHANES-provided poverty-to-income ratio), smoking status, beverage energy density, and physical activity.

","658":"Evidence suggests that physical activity may be related to improved eating regulation, helping people self-regulate their eating in a healthier way. Yet the positive associations between physical activity and eating-related behaviors appear to depend on the goals pursued by individuals when they engage in physical activity. This study investigated differences in eating motivations (informed by Self-Determination Theory) and intuitive eating between women who did physical activity to lose weight (PA-Wt) vs for non-weight goals (PA-NWt), and explores whether eating motivations mediate associations between weight-focused physical activity and intuitive eating. A sample of 1,435 physically active women (40 to 50 years) participated in a nationally representative survey conducted in 2009 in New Zealand. Women were asked whether they did physical activity predominantly to lose weight and were dichotomized into PA-Wt and PA-NWt groups. Questions assessing eating in response to hunger and satiety cues (intuitive eating) and eating-related motivations were completed by participants. Analyses of covariance, t tests, correlations, and mediation analyses were conducted to test the study hypotheses. PA-Wt participants reported lower levels of intuitive eating than did PA-NWt (0.26&lt;Cohen's effect size d&lt;2.38; all, P&lt;0.001), and higher levels of both autonomous (0.16&lt;d&lt; 0.41; P&lt;0.010) and controlled eating motivations (introjected: d=0.60, P&lt;0.001; external: d=0.24; P&lt;0.001). Associations between PA-Wt and intuitive eating were mediated by introjected motivation (effect ratios=0.18 to 0.29), and less prominently by intrinsic and integrated motivation. Whether women are active to lose weight or for other reasons seems important when it comes to regulating their eating: weight-focused physical activity appears to be linked to higher eating motivation (ie, quantity), while the presence of poorer-quality motivation (ie, introjected motivation) is related to a less intuitive eating style.

The implementation process has been evaluated in specific countries and in smaller international studies; however, no large international study comparing implementation between countries has been completed. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the level of NCP\/NCPT implementation across 10 countries. A previously tested web-based survey was completed in 2017 by 6,719 dietitians across 10 countries. Participants were recruited through e-mail lists, e-newsletters, and social media groups for dietitians. Nondietitians were excluded through screening questions and targeted dissemination channels. The main outcome of interest was the level of implementation of each of the four NCP steps. Differences in implementation between the NCP (process) and NCPT (terminology) were also measured. Differences between groups were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple linear regression was used to assess relationships between the main outcomes and respondent demographic information. Australia, New Zealand, and the United States had higher implementation rates compared with other countries surveyed. Awareness of the NCP was high in most countries (&gt;90%) but lower in Greece (50%). All countries had a higher implementation level of the NCP (process) compared with the NCPT (terminology). Dietitians working with inpatients reported the highest implementation levels while those working in public health reported the lowest. Dietitians in countries with more experience in NCP\/NCPT implementation and a clear implementation strategy had higher levels of implementation. To achieve a successful NCP\/NCPT implementation among dietitians, there is a need to promote the value of a standardized dietetic language together with the more easily implemented process. There is also a need to promote NCP\/NCPT for all areas of practice, and develop strategic plans for implementation of the NCP and NCPT.

To identify factors that may be associated with organization-level food system resilience, how these factors may play out in disaster response, and how they may relate to organizations' confidence in their ability to withstand disruptive events. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with representatives of key food system businesses and organizations identified by means of stratified purposive sampling and snowball sampling. Representatives of 26 food system businesses and organizations in Baltimore stratified by two informant categories: organizations focused on promoting food access, such as governmental offices and nonprofits, and businesses and organizations involved in supplying and distributing food in Baltimore City, such as retailers, wholesalers, and producers. Interviews were analyzed using a phronetic iterative approach. The following 10 factors that may contribute to organization-level resilience were identified: formal emergency planning; staff training; staff attendance; redundancy of food supply, food suppliers, infrastructure, location, and service providers; insurance; and post-event learning. Organizations that were larger, better resourced, and affiliated with national or government partners typically demonstrated more resilience factors compared with smaller, independent, and nonprofit organizations. To ensure reliable access to safe food for all people, food system organizations must strengthen their operations to safeguard against a variety of potential threats.

This article applies behavioral economics principles to explore the retail experience of WIC participants and ways in which it may be improved. The authors designed and conducted semistructured interviews and focus groups with WIC participants. A convenience sample of WIC participants aged 18 years and older were recruited through WIC clinics in Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, and Illinois (n=55, 27 participants from four focus groups and 28 individual interviews). Responses were analyzed qualitatively using principles of content analysis. Challenges in identifying WIC-allowable items throughout the store as well as perceived stigmatization during the checkout process were the chief complaints. Study participants described a learning curve in successful use of WIC in retail environments over time. Study participants also reported acceptance of restrictions, such as a requirement to purchase the least expensive brand. Dissatisfaction with the retail experience may lead to the underutilization of WIC benefits or program exit. Behavioral economics strategies that facilitate a better shopping experience, such as creating a section for WIC items in the store or improving in-store education, may improve the retail experience for WIC customers. Further research is needed to ensure such strategies are effective and do not contribute to stigma.

However, providers appeared to fall short when it came to greens and beans, seafood and plant proteins, total vegetables, whole grains, and fatty acids. They also exceeded recommended limits for sodium and refined grains. Although FCCHs are serving some healthy food, mainly fruit, dairy, and few empty calories, there is room for improvement with regards to vegetables, grains, seafood and plant protein, fatty acids, and sodium.

This article explains validity and cross-context equivalence of measures (and important related concepts) and clarifies how to establish them. Validation is the process of determining whether a measure or indicator is suitable for providing useful analytical measurement for a given purpose and context. Cross-context equivalence means that a measure performs comparably across contexts. Four types of equivalence are construct, item, measurement, and scalar. Establishing validity and cross-context equivalence requires representing mathematically the errors (ie, imprecision, undependability, and inaccuracy) of a measure and using appropriate statistical methods to quantify these errors. Studies aiming to provide evidence about the validity of a measure need to clarify the purpose and context for use of that measure. Choose one of the two conceptual systems for validation; obtain data to establish the extent to which the measure is well constructed, reliable, and accurate; and use analytic methods beyond simple correlations to provide a basis for making reasoned judgment about whether the measure provides useful analytic measurement for the particular purpose(s) and context.

For construct validity, the HEI-2015 yielded high scores for exemplary menus as four menus received high scores (87.8 to 100). The mean score for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was 56.6, and the first to 99th percentile were 32.6 to 81.2, respectively, supporting sufficient variation. Among smokers, the mean score was significantly lower than among nonsmokers (53.3 and 59.7, respectively) (P&lt;0.01), demonstrating differentiation between groups. The correlation between diet quality and diet quantity was low (all &lt;0.25) supporting these elements being independent. The components demonstrated multidimensionality when examined with a scree plot (at least four dimensions). For reliability, most of the intercorrelations among the components were low to moderate (0.01 to 0.49) with a few exceptions, and the standardized Cronbach's alpha was .67. For criterion validity, the highest vs the lowest quintile of HEI-2015 scores were associated with a 13% to 23% decreased risk of all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality. The results demonstrated evidence supportive of construct validity, reliability, and criterion validity.

","713":"The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure of diet quality that can be used to examine alignment of dietary patterns with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The HEI is made up of multiple adequacy and moderation components, most of which are expressed relative to energy intake (ie, as densities) for the purpose of calculating scores. Due to these characteristics and the complexity of dietary intake data more broadly, calculating and using HEI scores can involve unique statistical considerations and, depending on the particular application, intensive computational methods. The objective of this article is to review potential applications of the HEI, including those relevant to surveillance, epidemiology, and intervention research, and to summarize available guidance for appropriate analysis and interpretation. Steps in calculating HEI scores are reviewed and statistical methods described. Consideration of salient issues in the calculation and interpretation of scores can help researchers avoid common pitfalls and reviewers ensure that articles reporting on the use of the HEI include sufficient details such that the work is comprehensible and replicable, with the overall goal of contributing to knowledge on dietary patterns and health among Americans.","714":"The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) is a measure for assessing whether a set of foods aligns with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). An updated HEI is released to correspond to each new edition of the DGA, and this article introduces the latest version, which reflects the 2015-2020 DGA. The HEI-2015 components are the same as in the HEI-2010, except Saturated Fat and Added Sugars replace Empty Calories, with the result being 13 components. The 2015-2020 DGA include explicit recommendations to limit intakes of both Added Sugars and Saturated Fats to &lt;10% of energy. HEI-2015 does not account for excessive energy from alcohol within a separate component, but continues to account for all energy from alcohol within total energy (the denominator for most components). All other components remain the same as for HEI-2010, except for a change in the allocation of legumes. Previous versions of the HEI accounted for legumes in either the two vegetable or the two protein foods components, whereas HEI-2015 counts legumes toward all four components. Weighting approaches are similar to those of previous versions, and scoring standards were maintained, refined, or developed to increase consistency across components; better ensure face validity; follow precedent; cover a range of intakes; and, when applicable, ensure the DGA level corresponds to a score &gt;7 out of 10.

There is a need to explore the application and use of ethnographic methodology in nutrition and dietetics research to inform future research and practice. Our aim was to examine the extent, range, nature, and contribution of ethnographic methodology in nutrition and dietetics research. Eight electronic databases were searched using a defined search strategy until November 2017. No restrictions were placed on language, date, or study design of original research. Two authors independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-text records, against inclusion criteria. Hand-searching of reviews identified in the database search was undertaken. Quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Data were described narratively. A total of 2,185 records were identified, with 92 studies from public health nutrition (n=72), clinical nutrition (n=13), and foodservice (n=7) practice areas meeting inclusion criteria. Common research areas included infant\/child feeding, food choice, diabetes, nutrition in schools and food insecurity. In addition to observation, frequently reported data collection techniques were interview (n=85), focus groups (n=17), and document analysis (n=10). Ethnographic research was most often reported from North America (n=31), Europe (n=16), and Australia\/Oceania (n=13). This research approach was shown to inform dietetic research and practice by illuminating sociocultural factors that influence dietary beliefs and practices, practitioner training opportunities, evaluating nutrition education methods, informing programs and interventions, identifying nutrition policy and guideline focus areas, and the need for new approaches and communication strategies. Ethnography can increase understanding of complex food and nutrition-related health issues and their contributing factors across public health nutrition, foodservice, and clinical dietetic practice. It can be used to explain health inequalities, direct policy, and inform more effective intervention design and delivery. Wider uptake of this research approach as a stand-alone or complementary study design will advance efforts to improve health and wellbeing through food and nutrition.","722":null,"723":"Understanding how adherence to dietary self-monitoring with apps has been defined is a first step toward examining the relationship between adherence and weight loss. The purpose of this review was to explore how adherence to dietary self-monitoring has been defined in the empirical literature that addresses weight loss app use by overweight and obese adults. The integrative review method and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guided this review. Scientific databases (n=5) were searched, which yielded 29 studies. Studies were screened, evaluated for data quality, and then analyzed according to the constant comparison method. Most studies were weak to moderate quality. Results indicated that adherence was operationally defined in two ways. Adherence was defined as either adherent or nonadherent based on the completion of recording a minimum amount of calorie intake or a calorie amount within a specific range of calories. Another way that adherence was defined was the frequency of dietary self-monitoring, which included the frequency of dietary intake recording, interaction with apps, and the timing of recording. Some studies defined adherence in both ways. Most included studies lacked diversity in study samples. Until a consensus is reached, it may be prudent to study multiple indicators of adherence to dietary self-monitoring using apps, and their respective relationships with weight loss. Studies are needed that address the type and degree of adherence to dietary self-monitoring with an app that is associated with weight loss in diverse populations.","724":"","725":"Early childhood educators have the potential to influence children's dietary outcomes through daily interactions. However, existing research suggests that educator practices are often suboptimal. Previous research has often focused on individual characteristics that affect practices. There is less study of contextual influences of practices of early childhood educators. The purpose of this study was to understand and describe contextual factors evident in narratives of early childhood educators influencing mealtime and nutrition promotion practices. We use the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework to consider how contextual factors related to practices of early childhood educators. This cross-sectional, qualitative study collected data through in-depth interviews with early childhood educators. Analyses of the data reflected a factist perspective and semantic approach to complete thematic content analysis of in-depth interviews. The study used a stratified purposive sampling approach to recruit 28 educators to balance across educator role, agency type (Head Start vs state-funded), and obesity prevalence in the community. Early childhood educators were mostly lead teachers (62%), between the ages of 30 and 49 (82.1%), and white (75%) or African American (14.3%). The coders identified three primary themes: Mealtime Structures, Resources, and Classroom\/Center Atmosphere. Mealtime Structures associated with detrimental practices included cafeteria meals with rigid schedules. Mealtime Structures associated with evidence-based practices (EBPs) included classroom meal service. Resources associated with detrimental practices included limited funding. Resources associated with EBPs included meals paid for early childhood educators and classroom food experiences. Classroom\/Center Atmosphere factors associated with detrimental practices included poor food offerings and policies that conflicted (eg, allowing children to bring in outside foods). Classroom\/Center Atmosphere factors associated with EBPs included clarity around meal service rules and healthy, appealing food offerings. This study highlighted that it may be difficult for an early childhood educator to adopt and maintain EBPs in certain contexts.

The emphasis in basic combat training is on \"soldierization\" (transforming a civilian into a soldier), and drill sergeants are instrumental in this process. Limited information about how drill sergeants use their influence to have an impact on nutrition behaviors of new soldiers is available. This study aimed to determine nutrition attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge of drill sergeants; the ways drill sergeants instill new soldiers with an army identity (eg, warrior athlete, army strong); and how healthy eating is perceived to fit with this new identity. This qualitative, phenomenological study used in-depth interviews conducted with army drill sergeants at two southeast US Army posts between July and August 2011 (n=30). Interviews emphasized drill sergeants' perceptions of the eating environment during basic training, the drill sergeant role, and drill sergeants' main duties. An iterative process of group coding using a constant comparative method was used to find distinct themes. Data were analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Drill sergeants described their main duty as training new soldiers. Drill sergeants identified the ideal soldier as lean and physically fit but did not identify training soldiers how to eat to become the ideal soldier as part of their duties. Confusion about nutrition concepts was common. Overall, drill sergeants recognized that what soldiers eat affects their physical performance and appearance, but they did not see helping soldiers establish healthy eating behaviors as one of their duties or responsibilities during basic combat training. Drill sergeants are key individuals in the process by which new recruits develop a soldier identity. Additional resources are necessary to help drill sergeants emphasize nutrition and health during basic combat training and help them guide soldiers toward adopting healthy eating as part of their soldier identity to improve weight management, health, and performance.

However, there is limited evidence on how these interventions affect children's snacking behaviors. Our aim was to determine the impact of an afterschool intervention focused at the school district, site, family, and child levels on dietary consumption of foods and beverages served at snack. This was a secondary analysis of a group-randomized controlled trial. Data were collected from 400 children at 20 afterschool sites in Boston, MA before (fall 2010) and after (spring 2011) intervention implementation. The Out-of-School Nutrition and Physical Activity intervention aimed to promote fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and water, while limiting sugary drinks and trans fats. Researchers worked with district foodservice staff to change snack foods and beverages. Teams of afterschool staff participated in three 3-hour learning collaborative sessions to build skills and created action plans for changing site practices. The intervention included family and child nutrition education. Research assistants observed dietary snack consumption using a validated measure on 2 days per site at baseline and follow-up. This study used multivariable regression models, accounting for clustering of observations, to assess the intervention effect, and conducted post-hoc stratified analyses by foodservice type. Children in intervention sites had greater decreases in consumption of juice (-0.61 oz\/snack, 95% CI -1.11 to -0.12), beverage calories (-29.1 kcal\/snack, 95% CI -40.2 to 18.0), foods with trans fats (-0.12 servings\/snack, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.04), total calories (-47.7 kcal\/snack, 95% CI -68.2 to -27.2), and increases in consumption of whole grains (0.10 servings\/snack, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18) compared to controls.

This is a cross-sectional study. Four hundred sixty-six primary food shoppers were included from two counties in South Carolina during 2013-2014. Participants' self-reported food acquisition and shopping habits, including shopping distance; frequency; store type; transportation mode; use of farmers' markets, food banks\/pantries, and church\/social service organizations, were used to develop shopping patterns and group residents. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation, food security, income, and education, nutrition knowledge, and perceptions of the food environment were used to characterize these groups. Latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used to identify and characterize patterns, respectively. Three patterns were identified, including those who use community food resources, are infrequent grocery shoppers, and use someone else's car or public transportation when shopping (Class 1) (35%), those who use community food resources and are more frequent and proximal shoppers (Class 2) (41%), and those who do not use community food resources and are distal shoppers (Class 3) (24%). Compared with Class 3, Class 1 had comparatively lower socioeconomic status. Class 2 also had comparatively lower socioeconomic attributes except for income. Class 2 was not significantly different from Class 1 except that a higher proportion in Class 1 saw food access as a problem. No significant differences across classes were found regarding fruit and vegetable recommendation knowledge.

Approximately 13% of young adults valued gluten-free food, a characteristic most strongly related to valuing food production practices (eg, organic, locally grown); factors such as Nutrition Facts use and having a weight goal were also related to gluten-free food values. Valuing gluten-free food was related to engagement in both healthy behaviors (eg, eating breakfast daily, eating more fruits and vegetables) and unhealthy behaviors (eg, using diet pills to control weight). Young adults valuing gluten-free food generally engaged in healthier behaviors and had better dietary intake; of concern, they were also more likely to engage in unhealthy weight control behaviors.

This review examined research on MPMs in the United States and specifically aimed to assess the relationship between MPM use and fruit and\/or vegetable intake, and facilitators and barriers related to MPM use within a social ecological framework. A systematic review of the literature consistent with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was conducted. Articles published through December 2017 were identified using the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Agricola, and CAB Abstracts. MPM studies published in English and in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion if they were based on primary research of MPMs in the United States, included results, and if MPMs were analyzed separately from other market venues and sold predominantly fruits and\/or vegetables. A total of 24 studies were identified for inclusion, which varied in study types as follows: quantitative (n=15), qualitative (n=3), and mixed methods (n=6). An association was found between MPM use and higher reported fruit and\/or vegetable intake, although existing studies that measured fruit and vegetable intake were not rigorous in study design (eg, lack of control group, use of convenience sample, small sample size). MPM location was the most commonly cited facilitator of MPM use. Other institutional factors (eg, nutrition education), as well as policy factors (eg, food-assistance programs), community factors (eg, market site liaisons), interpersonal factors (eg, socializing at market), and intrapersonal factors (eg, awareness of the benefits of fruit and\/or vegetable intake) were identified. MPMs offer a promising strategy to improve access to fruits and vegetables and may further support healthful-food purchasing and consumption through food-assistance incentives and enticements for consumers (eg, opportunities for social networking and nutrition education). Future research on MPMs would benefit from more rigorous experimental designs, such as including a control group, and examining multiple levels within a social ecological framework.

Pooled effects of identified types were examined using random effects meta-analysis models. Differences in effects among types were examined using meta-regression. Context-level effects are examined using qualitative comparative analysis. Three distinct types (or families) of PWM interventions were identified: medical nutrition, behavioral, and missing components. Medical nutrition and behavioral types showed statistically significant improvements in BMIZ across all time points. Results were less consistent for BMI and waist circumference, although four distinct patterns of weight status change were identified. These varied by intervention type as well as outcome measure. Meta-regression indicated statistically significant differences between the medical nutrition and behavioral types vs the missing component type for both BMIZ and BMI, although the pattern varied by time period and intervention type. Qualitative comparative analysis identified distinct configurations of context characteristics at each time point that were consistent with positive outcomes among the intervention types.

The key themes that emerged were the customer in context, customers' food relief needs, connecting with customers, and barriers to utilization. The application of Jobs to Be Done Theory to rural food pantry customers demonstrates that demographic segmentation does not capture the social, emotional, and functional dimensions for this sample. Investigation of customer experiences, circumstances, and obstacles is important for improving dietetics services.

Management of diabetes is also critical for the prevention of diabetes-related complications such as cardiovascular and renal disease. The Diabetes Care and Education Dietetic Practice Group along with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Management Committee have updated the Standards of Practice (SOP) and Standards of Professional Performance (SOPP) for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) in Diabetes Care. The SOP and SOPP for RDNs in Diabetes Care provide indicators that describe three levels of practice: competent, proficient, and expert. The SOP utilizes the Nutrition Care Process and clinical workflow elements for care and management of those with diabetes and prediabetes. The SOPP describes six domains that focus on professionalism: Quality in Practice, Competence and Accountability, Provision of Services, Application of Research, Communication and Application of Knowledge, and Utilization and Management of Resources. Specific indicators outlined in the SOP and SOPP depict how these standards apply to practice. The SOP and SOPP are complementary resources for RDNs caring for individuals with diabetes or specializing in diabetes care or practicing in other diabetes-related areas, including research. The SOP and SOPP are intended to be used for RDN self-evaluation for ensuring competent practice and for determining potential education and training needs for advancement to a higher practice level in a variety of settings.","785":"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, School Nutrition Association (SNA), and Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior (SNEB) that comprehensive, integrated nutrition programs in preschool through high school are essential to improve the health, nutritional status, and academic performance of our nation's children.

The objective was to understand factors that inhibit or facilitate breastfeeding practices of low-income mothers, including how they are linked to broader social, cultural, and economic processes. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with women about their feeding practices and food environments, including their experiences with breastfeeding and formula feeding. The sample was comprised of 98 low-income mothers with at least one child between 2 and 9 years old at the time of interview. Sixteen mothers (16.7%) breastfed for 6 months, and six (6.3%) were still breastfeeding at 12 months. Only 11 mothers (11.5%) exclusively breastfed for 6 months. Women reported several factors influencing infant feeding: interactions with medical providers, work environments, shared living spaces and family supports, and concerns about supply and production. This research highlights the complex interplay of economic and social barriers that shape how and what low-income women feed their infants.

We collected qualitative and quantitative data from 57 small stores in four states (Arizona, Delaware, Minnesota, and North Carolina) that accepted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program but not Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children benefits. Data from semistructured, in-depth interviews with managers\/owners were transcribed, coded, and analyzed. We collected quantitative store inventory data onsite and later performed descriptive analyses. Store interviews revealed a reluctant willingness to stock healthy food and meet new recommendations. No stores met recommended fruit and vegetable stocking, although 79% carried at least one qualifying fruit and 74% carried at least one qualifying vegetable. Few stores met requirements for other food categories (ie, whole grains and low-fat dairy) with the exception of lean proteins, where stores carrying nuts or nut butter were more likely to meet the protein recommendation. Water and 100% juice were widely available and 68% met basic healthy beverage criteria. In contrast to the inventory observed, most owners believed store stock met basic recommendations. Further, findings indicate that small stores are capable of stocking healthy products; however, technical and infrastructure support, as well as incentives, would facilitate shifts from staple to healthier staple foods. Retailers may need support to understand healthier product criteria and to drive consumer demand for new products.

This was a cross-sectional study using data from the Clustering of Lifestyle Risk Factors and Understanding its Association with Stress on Health and Well-Being among School Teachers in Malaysia study collected between August 2014 and November 2015. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Participants were teachers from selected public schools from three states in Peninsular Malaysia (n=4,618). Dietary patterns derived using factor analysis. Separate factor analysis was conducted by sex, ethnicity, and urban status to identify dietary patterns. Eigenvalue &gt;2, scree plot, Velicer's minimum average partial analysis, and Horn's parallel analysis were used to determine the number of factors to retain. The interpretability of each dietary pattern was evaluated. The consistency and generalizability of dietary patterns across subgroups were assessed using the Tucker congruence coefficient. There was no subgroup-specific dietary pattern found. Thus, dietary patterns were derived using the pooled sample in the final model. Two dietary patterns (Western and Prudent) were derived. The Western dietary pattern explained 15.4% of total variance, characterized by high intakes of refined grains, animal-based foods, added fat, and sugar-sweetened beverages as well as fast food. The Prudent dietary pattern explained 11.1% of total variance and was loaded with pulses, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. The derived Western and Prudent dietary patterns were consistent and generalizable across subgroups of sex, ethnicity, and urban status.

Qualitative methods using semistructured interviews were used to uncover participants' experiences with and explanations for the development of obesity. A grounded theory approach using the constant comparative method was used to analyze transcripts for categories and themes. Thirty pre-bariatric surgery patients (24 women, 6 men) were recruited from a bariatric surgery center; 25 participants were available for follow-up. Participants were interviewed before surgery and at 6 and 12 months postsurgery. Four weight history groups were created based on patterns of weight changes from adolescence through adulthood: Always Heavy, Late Peak, Steady Progression, and Weight Cycling. Participants' explanations for weight changes centered around themes of transitions and life-course events or stressors. Differences in the weight history groups could be explained by the timing of transitions, life events, and responses to stress. The development of obesity does not follow the same pattern for all individuals.

Ten plant and one animal food have been approved for commercialization in the United States. Today, foods and ingredients from genetically engineered (GE) crops are present throughout the food supply, which has led to varying levels of acceptance. Much discussion exists among consumers and health professionals about the believability of statements made regarding benefits or risks of GE foods. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence on the association of consumption of GE foods and ingredients derived from them on human health, specifically allergenicity, food safety, pesticide consumption, nutrient adequacy, inflammation, and antibiotic resistance. An expert panel conducted a systematic review on advanced technology in food production. The 30 developed questions focused on effects of human consumption of GE foods and the effects of human consumption of foods containing pesticide residues on human health. Primary research published from 1994 to 2014 were identified using PubMed and Agricultural Online Access databases. Additional studies were identified by searching references of review articles. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Relevant research addressed five of 30 questions. Four questions focused on food allergenicity, the fifth on nutrient adequacy, and all received a Grade III (limited\/weak) rating. No human studies addressed 25 questions on the consumption of foods produced using genetic engineering technologies on gene translocation, cancer, food safety, phenotype expression, inflammation and inflammatory markers, or antibiotic resistance. These questions received a Grade V (grade not assignable). Evidence from human studies did not reveal an association between adverse health effects and consumption of foods produced using genetic engineering technologies. Although the number of available human studies is small, they support that there are no clear adverse health effects-as they relate to allergenicity and nutrient adequacy-associated with consumption of GE foods.

Maternal diet plays an important role in pregnancy-related outcomes, but little is known about the extent of added sugar intake during pregnancy. To assess intake and identify the top sources of added sugars in the diets of pregnant vs nonpregnant women in the United States. Cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2004 to 2011-2012. Four thousand one hundred seventy-nine pregnant and nonpregnant women (aged 20 to 39 years) who completed a dietary recall. Survey-weighted analyses were used to estimate means (95% CIs) in total grams and as percentage of total energy for added sugar intake by pregnancy status and by demographic subgroup and to identify leading sources of added sugar. Added sugar intake trended toward being higher in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women in absolute grams, 85.1 g (95% CI: 77.4 to 92.7) vs 76.7 g (95% CI: 73.6 to 79.9), respectively (P=0.06), but was lower among pregnant women when total energy intake was accounted for, 14.8% (95% CI: 13.8 to 15.7) vs 15.9% (95% CI: 15.2 to 16.6) of total energy, respectively (P=0.03). Among pregnant women, added sugar intake was similar among demographic subgroups. However, in multivariable regression, pregnancy status significantly modified the associations of education and income with added sugar intake, whereby less educated and lower-income women who were pregnant had lower added sugar intakes compared with those who were not pregnant, but more educated or higher-income women did not exhibit this pattern. The top five sources of added sugar for all women were sugar-sweetened beverages; cakes, cookies, and pastries; sugars and sweets; juice drinks and smoothies; and milk-based desserts. Although pregnant women had higher energy intakes, this was not attributed to higher intakes of added sugar. Although education and income affected consumption during pregnancy, intake of added sugar among all women, regardless of pregnancy status, exceeded recommendations.

The US Department of Agriculture's Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) provides F\/V as snacks to children during the school day, outside of school meals. School-based initiatives are successful in changing behaviors in school settings; however, their influence on behaviors outside of schools needs investigation. To examine whether FFVP participation is associated with F\/V requests at stores, self-efficacy to ask for and choose F\/V at home, and F\/V consumption. Cross-sectional study. Fourth graders in six classrooms (n=296) from three urban, low-income school districts in Phoenix, AZ, were surveyed during 2015; one FFVP and one non-FFVP school from each district that were similar in school size, percent free\/reduced-price meal eligibility, and race\/ethnicity of enrolled students were selected. Children's self-reported F\/V requests during shopping, their self-efficacy to ask for and choose F\/V at home, and F\/V consumption on the previous day (non-FFVP school day) were measured using questions adapted from validated surveys. Multivariable mixed-effect regression models, adjusting for clustering of students within classes and classes within schools were explored. In models adjusting for individual-level factors (ie, age and sex) only, several significant positive associations were observed between school FFVP participation and healthier F\/V outcomes. After additionally adjusting for school-level factors (ie, total enrollment and % Hispanic\/Latino students) significant associations were observed between school FFVP participation and more requests for vegetables during shopping (P&lt;0.001), higher scores on self-efficacy to choose vegetables at home (P=0.004), stronger preferences for vegetables (P&lt;0.001), and more frequent consumption of fruit (P=0.006).

For individuals with impaired renal potassium excretion caused by chronic kidney disease and for those taking certain medications that interfere with the rennin-angiotensin aldosterone axis, the need to limit dietary potassium is important in view of the risk for development of hyperkalemia and fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of the reduction of sodium in packaged meat and poultry products (MPPs) on the content of potassium and phosphorus from food additives. This was a cross-sectional study comparing chemically analyzed MPPs (n=38, n=19 original, n=19 sodium-reduced), selected from the top three grocery chains in Canada, based on market share sales. All MPPs with a package label containing a reduced sodium content claim together with their non-sodium-reduced packaged MPP counterparts were selected for analysis. The protein, sodium, phosphorus, and potassium contents of sodium-reduced MPPs and the non-sodium-reduced (original) MPP counterparts were chemically analyzed according to the Association of Analytical Communities official methods 992.15 and 984.27 and compared by using a paired t test. The frequency of phosphorus and potassium additives appearing on the product labels' ingredient lists were compared between groups by using McNemar's test. Sodium-reduced MPPs (n=19) contained 44% more potassium (mg\/100 g) than their non-sodium-reduced counterparts (n=19) (mean difference [95% CI): 184 [90-279]; P=0.001). The potassium content of sodium-reduced MPPs varied widely and ranged from 210 to 1,500 mg\/100 g. Potassium-containing additives were found on the ingredient list in 63% of the sodium-reduced products and 26% of the non-sodium-reduced products (P=0.02). Sodium-reduced MPPs contained 38% less sodium (mg\/100 g) than their non-sodium-reduced counterparts (mean difference [95% CI]: 486 [334-638]; P&lt;0.001). The amounts of phosphorus and protein, as well as the frequency of phosphorus additives appearing on the product label ingredient list, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Potassium additives are frequently added to sodium-reduced MPPs in amounts that significantly contribute to the potassium load for patients with impaired renal handling of potassium caused by chronic kidney disease and certain medications. Patients requiring potassium restriction should be counseled to be cautious regarding the potassium content of sodium-reduced MPPs and encouraged to make food choices accordingly.

To expand understanding of the dietary acculturation paradox, this study examined how bicultural Mexican-American women construct ethnic identity and how these identities and identity-making processes relate to perceptions of health and nutrition. We utilized embedded mixed methods (in-depth interviews; survey). We analyzed a purposive sample of English-speaking Mexican-American women aged 18 to 29 years (n=24) in rural California to assess ethnic identity and diet beliefs. Participants described food as central to expressing cultural identity, usually in terms of family interactions. Mexican food traditions were characterized as unhealthy; many preferred American foods, which were seen as healthier. Specifically, Mexican-American women perceived Mexican patterns of food preparation and consumption as unhealthy. In addition, traditional Mexican foods described as unhealthy were once considered special-occasion foods. Among the participants who expressed a desire to eat healthfully, to do so meant to reject Mexican ways of eating. This study raises questions about the nature of the \"dietary acculturation paradox.\" While food-the eating of Mexican foods-is central to the maintenance of ethnic identity throughout acculturation, negative perceptions about the healthfulness of Mexican foods introduce tension into Mexican-American women's self-identification. This study suggests a subtle contradiction that may help to explain the dietary acculturation paradox: While previous research has suggested that as Mexicans acculturate to the United States they adopt unhealthy diets, this study finds evidence that they do so at least in part due to perceptions that American diets are healthier than Mexican diets. Implications for interventions to improve Latinos' diets include an emphasis on the family and use of Spanish linguistic cues. Finally, messages that simply advocate for \"traditional\" diets should be reconsidered because that message is discordant with perceptions of the healthfulness of such foods.

In-depth interviews (n=10) and eight focus groups (n=62) were held with dietitians who offer treatment in a physical environment designed according to the medical model and\/or in a physical dynamic environmental design according to the dynamic model. Most dietitians in Israel treat their patients in a physical environment arranged according to the medical model. The participants reported that the physical environment affects the interaction. However, the idea of transforming the physical environment according to the dynamic model raised reservations. Barriers include upsetting therapeutic boundaries, challenging professional authority, and lack of therapeutic tools suitable for the change. Changes in the spatial design in which the therapeutic interaction occurs might support the dietitians' transformation from counseling into therapy. The barriers toward such change suggest that professional training is needed to enable dietitians to overcome them. We recommend conducting further research to evaluate the current physical environment, as well as raising dietitians' awareness and training them to work in the new environment, reflecting a counseling\/therapeutic mindset. These changes should be followed by additional research among practitioners to report on their effects.

Describe methods used to measure food waste and respective results in the NSLP across time. A systematic review using PubMed, Science Direct, Informaworld, and Institute of Scientific Information Web of Knowledge was conducted using the following search terms: waste, school lunch, plate waste, food waste, kitchen, half method, quarter method, weight, and photography. Studies published through June 2015 were included. The systematic review followed preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommendations. The final review included 53 articles. Food waste methodologies included in-person visual estimation (n=11), digital photography (n=11), direct weighing (n=23), and a combination of in-person visual estimation, digital photography, and\/or direct weighing (n=8). A majority of studies used a pre-post intervention or cross-sectional design. Fruits and vegetables were the most researched dietary component on the lunch tray and yielded the greatest amount of waste across studies. Food waste is commonly assessed in the NSLP, but the methods are diverse and reporting metrics are variable. Future research should focus on establishing more uniform metrics to measure and report on food waste in the NSLP. Consistent food waste measurement methods will allow for better comparisons between studies. Such measures may facilitate better decision making about NSLP practices, programs, and policies that influence student consumption patterns across settings and interventions.

Identifying behavioral factors associated with CVD risk in this population may provide novel targets for further research to reduce chronic disease disparities. Dysfunctional eating patterns (emotional eating [EE], uncontrolled eating [UE], and cognitive restraint of eating [CR]) may be associated with CVD risk but little is known about this relationship in Latinos. The aim of this study was to examine associations between dysfunctional eating patterns and metabolic risk factors for CVD in Latinos. The study used a cross-sectional design. Latino individuals (n=602), aged 21 to 84 years, were enrolled in the study from September 2011 to May 2013 from a community health center that serves 80% to 85% of the Latino population in Lawrence, MA. Individuals with complete data were included in this analysis (n=578). Dysfunctional eating patterns were measured with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18V2. CVD risk factors examined included obesity assessed by body mass index and waist circumference and diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia abstracted from electronic health records. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regressions adjusting for age, sex, perceived income, employment, education, physical activity, and perceived stress were performed. The no dysfunctional eating category (ie, no EE, no UE, or no CR) was used as the reference category in all analyses. High EE was associated with greater odds of obesity (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.45) and central obesity (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.81 to 4.87), and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.48) and hypertension (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.48). High UE was associated with obesity (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.21) and central obesity (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.94). Low and high CR were associated with obesity (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.56 and OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.37, respectively) and central obesity (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.32 and 2.51, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.08, respectively) and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.16 and OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.58 to 4.70, respectively) and hyperlipidemia (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.24 and OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.55, respectively). Lastly, high EE and low and high CR were associated with increased odds of having a greater number of metabolic CVD risk factors (incidence-rate ratio [IRR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; IRR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; and IRR 1.44, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.71, respectively).

The objectives of this review are to summarize research on state and local policies germane to weight-related health equity among young children in the United States and on how federal policies and regulations may provide supports for child-care providers serving families with the most limited resources. In addition, a third objective is to comprehensively review studies of whether there are differences in practices and policies within US child-care facilities according to the location or demographics of providers and children. The review found there is growing evidence addressing disparities in the social and physical child-care environments provided for young children, but scientific gaps are present in the current understanding of how resources should best be allocated and policies designed to promote health equity. Additional research is needed to address limitations of prior studies relating to the measurement of supports for weight-related health; complexities of categorizing socioeconomic position, ethnicity\/race, and urban and rural areas; exclusion of legally nonlicensed care settings from most research; and the cross-sectional nature of most study designs.

The Malaysian Breast Cancer Survivorship Cohort (MyBCC) study aims to study lifestyle factors that affect survival in BC survivors. These are the preliminary findings on the nutritional status of Malaysian BC survivors. Our aim was to evaluate the nutritional status of BC survivors at 1 year after diagnosis. This was a cross-sectional study of 194 participants from the MyBCC study, recruited within 1 year of their diagnosis. Participants completed a 3-day food diary. Malaysian women (aged 18 years and older) who were newly diagnosed with primary BC, managed at the University Malaya Medical Center, and able to converse either in Malay, English, or Mandarin were included. Dietary intake and prevalence of overweight or obesity among participants 1 year after diagnosis were measured. Student's t test and analysis of variance or its equivalent nonparametric test were used for association in continuous variables. About 66% (n=129) of participants were overweight or obese and &gt;45% (n=86) had high body fat percentage 1 year after diagnosis. The participants' diets were low in fiber (median=8.7 g\/day; interquartile range=7.2 g\/day) and calcium (median=458 mg\/day; interquartile range=252 mg\/day). Ethnicity and educational attainment contributed to the differences in dietary intake among participants. Higher saturated fat and lower fiber intake were observed among Malay participants compared with other ethnic groups.

Our aim was to examine whether 6-month changes in diet, physical activity, and weight were moderated by the food and physical activity environment in a rural adult population receiving an intervention designed to improve diet and physical activity. We examined associations between self-reported and objectively measured changes in diet, physical activity, and weight, and perceived and objectively measured food and physical activity environments. Participants were followed for 6 months. Participants were enrolled in the Heart Healthy Lenoir Project, a lifestyle intervention study conducted in Lenoir County, located in rural southeastern North Carolina. Sample sizes ranged from 132 to 249, depending on the availability of the data. Participants received four counseling sessions that focused on healthy eating (adapted Mediterranean diet pattern) and increasing physical activity. Density of and distance to food and physical activity venues, modified food environment index, Walk Score, crime, and perceived nutrition and physical activity neighborhood barriers were the potential mediating factors. Diet quality, physical activity, and weight loss were the outcomes measured. Statistical analyses included correlation and linear regression and controlling for potential confounders (baseline values of the dependent variables, age, race, education, and sex). In adjusted analysis, there was an inverse association between weight change and the food environment, suggesting that participants who lived in a less-healthy food environment lost more weight during the 6-month intervention period (P=0.01). Also, there was a positive association between self-reported physical activity and distance to private gyms (P=0.04) and an inverse association between private gym density and pedometer-measured steps (P=0.03), indicating that those who lived farther from gyms and in areas with lower density of gyms had greater increases in physical activity and steps, respectively. Contrary to our hypotheses, results indicated that those living in less-favorable food and physical activity environments had greater improvements in diet, physical activity, and weight, compared to those living in more favorable environments.

To reduce BP in adults with HTN, there is strong evidence to recommend provision of medical nutrition therapy by an RDN, adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern, calcium supplementation, physical activity as a component of a healthy lifestyle, reduction in dietary sodium intake, and reduction of alcohol consumption in heavy drinkers. Increased intake of dietary potassium and calcium as well as supplementation with potassium and magnesium for lowering BP are also recommended (fair evidence). Finally, recommendations related to lowering BP were formulated on vitamin D, magnesium, and the putative role of alcohol consumption in moderate drinkers (weak evidence).

A stratified, purposeful sample of 21 New York City elementary and middle schools participated in this study throughout the 2013\/2014 school year. The sample was stratified in their garden budgets and purposeful in that each of the schools' gardens were determined to be well integrated and sustained. The processes and strategies used by school gardeners to establish well-integrated school gardens were assessed via data collected from surveys, interviews, observations, and concept mapping. Descriptive statistics as well as multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to examine the survey and concept mapping data. Qualitative data analysis consisted of thematic coding, pattern matching, explanation building and cross-case synthesis. Nineteen components within four domains of school garden integration were found through the mixed-methods concept mapping analysis. When the analyses of other data were combined, relationships between domains and components emerged. These data resulted in the development of the GREEN (Garden Resources, Education, and Environment Nexus) Tool. When schools with integrated and sustained gardens were studied, patterns emerged about how gardeners achieve institutionalization through different combinations of critical components. These patterns are best described by the GREEN Tool, the first framework to identify how to operationalize school gardening components and describe an evidence-based strategy of successful school garden integration.

There is always a relationship between stress (the stimulus) and coping (the response). The relationship between snacking and snackers' diet quality and stress coping is a topic overlooked in research. The study was primarily designed to determine whether energy provided by snacks and diet quality were associated with coping behaviors to manage stress. We analyzed a baseline cohort of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (2004 to 2009). The sample was composed of 2,177 socioeconomically diverse African-American and white adults who resided in Baltimore, MD. Energy from snacks was calculated from 2 days of 24-hour dietary recalls collected using the US Department of Agriculture's Automated Multiple Pass Method. Snack occasions were self-reported as distinct eating occasions. Diet quality was evaluated by the Healthy Eating Index-2010. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine whether coping factors were associated with either energy provided by snacks or Healthy Eating Index-2010, adjusting for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, education, literacy, and perceived stress. Coping was measured by the Brief COPE Inventory with instrument variables categorized into three factors: problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and use of support. Perceived stress was measured with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale. Adjusting for perceived stress and selected demographic characteristics, emotion-focused coping strategies were associated with greater energy intakes from snacks (P=0.020), and use of coping strategies involving support was positively associated with better diet quality (P=0.009). Energy contributed by snacks and diet quality were affected by the strategy that an individual used to cope with stress. The findings suggest that health professionals working with individuals seeking guidance to modify their eating practices should assess a person's coping strategies to manage stress.

Although effective at reducing symptoms, the diet can be complex and restrictive. In addition, there are still large gaps in the literature and many foods with unclear effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, like fruit juice. Although many fruits are allowable on a low-FODMAP diet, consumption of all fruit juice is generally cautioned due to the large fructose load contained in juice, regardless of the glucose concentration. Very little research exists regarding the importance of limiting fructose load during a low-FODMAP diet; therefore, individuals following a low-FODMAP diet may be unnecessarily restricting their diets. To determine whether there is a difference in GI tolerance between juice from a high-FODMAP fruit (apple juice) and juice from a low-FODMAP fruit (white grape juice) in healthy human subjects. The goal is to provide insight into the role of juice in a low-FODMAP diet. A double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover study was conducted with 40 healthy adults. Fasted subjects consumed 12 oz of either apple juice or white grape juice. Breath hydrogen measures were taken at baseline, 1, 2, and 3 hours. Subjective GI tolerance surveys were completed at the same time intervals and at 12 and 24 hours. Breath hydrogen and GI symptoms were assessed with area under the curve analysis. Significance was determined with a two-sided t test with a P value &lt;0.05. Consumption of apple juice resulted in a greater mean breath hydrogen area under the curve at 23.3 ppm\/hour (95% CI 13.0 to 33.6) compared with white grape juice at 5.8 ppm\/hour (95% CI -4.6 to 16.1) (P&lt;0.001). No differences in reported GI symptoms were seen between treatments. Both juices were well tolerated and neither produced any severe symptoms in healthy adults. White grape juice consumption resulted in only a small rise in breath hydrogen, which may suggest excluding foods only because of the high fructose load could be unnecessarily restrictive. The results of this study suggest that the fructose-to-glucose ratio is likely more important than the total fructose load of the food when considering the acceptability of a food on a low-FODMAP diet. More research is needed in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome to determine whether white grape juice and other juices from low-FODMAP fruits could be additional beverage options for individuals following a low-FODMAP diet.

Cross-sectional data from the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. Males and females (n=9,046) aged 20 to 65 years were included. The weight history questionnaire assessed weight-loss attempts and use of weight-loss strategies in the past year. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of race\/ethnicity with strategies to lose weight. Models controlled for age, sex, education, and body mass index. In fully adjusted models, interactions of race\/ethnicity by sex were tested. Lower proportions of Mexican Americans (35%) and non-Hispanic blacks (35%) than non-Hispanic whites (39%) reported trying to lose weight. Among those who tried to lose weight, non-Hispanic blacks were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to use diet (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90) or exercise (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99) for weight loss.

Ten scientific databases, information technology conference proceedings, and gray literature were searched. Two reviewers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality assessments. Interventions were included if they used social media or electronic games. Comparisons were made pre- to post-intervention, or between intervention and control arms. Outcomes of interest included change in nutrition knowledge, attitudes, behavior, or weight and\/or body composition. Eleven social media-based (randomized controlled trials [RCT] n=7) and six game-based [RCT n=1]) interventions were included. Overall quality of studies was low. Social media-based strategies included forum\/blogs (n=5), Facebook (n=5), Twitter (n=1), YouTube (n=1), and chat rooms (n=1). Eight (RCT n=6) of 11 social media-based studies demonstrated improvements in outcomes. Findings suggested that social media may be more effective when combined with other strategies.

The purpose of this systematic review was to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis to synthesize the effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of lifestyle diabetes prevention interventions and compare effects by intervention delivery agent (dietitian vs non-dietitian) and channel (in-person vs technology-delivered). English and full-text research articles published up to July 2015 were identified using the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Education Resources Information Center, CAB Direct, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Sixty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Most employed both dietary and physical activity intervention components (four of 69 were diet-only interventions). Changes in weight, fasting and 2-hour blood glucose concentration, and hemoglobin A1c were extracted from each article. Heterogeneity was measured by the I2 index, and study-specific effect sizes or mean differences were pooled using a random effects model when heterogeneity was confirmed. Participants receiving intervention with nutrition education experienced a reduction of 2.07 kg (95% CI 1.52 to 2.62; P&lt;0.001; I2=90.99%, 95% CI 88.61% to 92.87%) in weight at 12 months with effect sizes over time ranging from small (0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30; P=0.012; I2= 86.83%, 95% CI 80.42% to 91.14%) to medium (0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.82; P&lt;0.001; I2=98.75%, 95% CI 98.52% to 98.94).

The meta-regression analysis revealed a larger relative weight loss in dietitian-delivered interventions than in those delivered by nondietitians (full sample: -1.0 kg; US subsample: -2.4 kg), and did not find statistical evidence that the delivery channel was an important predictor of weight loss. The average cost per kilogram weight loss ranged from $34.06 over 6 months to $1,005.36 over 12 months. The cost of intervention per participant delivered by dietitians was lower than interventions delivered by non-dietitians, although few studies reported costs.

Intake of nutrients and food groups were averaged for the two FFQs and the two 24-hour food recalls, and adjusted for energy intake. Spearman correlations were performed for intakes of energy, nutrients, and foods between administrations and between instruments. Correlation coefficients were de-attenuated to account for variation in the 24-hour recalls. A total of 241 participants completed the study. Intake of all nutrients and foods were significantly correlated between FFQs and 24-hour recalls and between the means of FFQs and 24-hour food recalls. The de-attenuated correlation for nutrients between the FFQs and 24-hour recalls ranged from 0.26 (folate) to 0.77 (energy), with a mean correlation of 0.53.

The main outcome was intervention feasibility, measured by recruitment and retention goals. Hospital readmissions, caloric intake, and satisfaction with the intervention were also evaluated. Univariate and bivariate parametric statistics were used to evaluate differences between groups. Goals for success were identified to assess feasibility of conducting a full-scale study and outcomes were measured against the goals.

Grantees (eight states and two Indian Tribal Organizations) selected school districts serving many low-income children. Schoolchildren were eligible in cases where they had been certified for free or reduced-price meals during the school year. Before the demonstration, households in the demonstration sample had lower incomes and lower food security, on average, than households with eligible children nationally. Grantees provided selected households with benefits worth $60 per child per summer month using SNAP or WIC EBT systems. SNAP-model benefits covered most foods. WIC-model benefits could only be used for a specific package of foods. Key outcomes were children's food security (assessed using the US Department of Agriculture food security scale) and food consumption (assessed using food frequency questions). Differences in mean outcomes between the benefit and control groups measured impact, after adjusting for household characteristics. In WIC sites, benefit-group households redeemed a lower percentage of SEBTC benefits than in SNAP sites. Nonetheless, the benefit groups in both sets of sites had similar large reductions in very low food security among children, relative to no-benefit controls. Children receiving benefits consumed more healthful foods, and these impacts were larger in WIC sites. Results suggest the WIC SEBTC model deserves strong consideration.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial with four parallel groups: plain spinach, creamed spinach, spinach ravioli, and green beans.

Children aged 2 to 4 years were recruited from six child-care centers located in Wageningen, the Netherlands, and randomly assigned to one of the four groups, with vegetable products provided by the researchers. The study was performed between September 2014 and January 2015. In total, 103 children participated, with 26, 25, 26, and 26 in the plain spinach, creamed spinach, spinach ravioli, and green beans groups, respectively. Preference for and ad libitum intake of cooked spinach were assessed during a test meal at the day-care center pre- and postintervention. Food neophobia was assessed via the Child Food Neophobia Scale. General linear model repeated measures analysis, including food neophobia, spinach liking, exposure, and consumption scores as covariates, was performed to test for effects of group on intake. Logistic regression was used to assess changes in preference between pre- and postintervention. All four groups significantly increased their spinach intake from pre- (53 g) to postintervention (91 g) by an average of 70%. For preference, no significant shift toward the target vegetable was found from pre- to postintervention. The effect on intake depended on the child's neophobia status and preintervention spinach consumption, with children with neophobia being less responsive to the intervention and with children who ate more spinach before the intervention being more responsive to the intervention. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to differently prepared spinach products, or even another green vegetable, improved children's spinach intake. However, children with neophobia may need a different approach.

YRBSS monitors priority health-risk behaviors among a nationally representative sample of US high school students and representative samples of students in states and selected large urban school districts. However, YRBSS measures intake in times per day and not the cup equivalents that national goals use, which limits interpretation. To help states track youth progress, scoring algorithms were developed from external data and applied to 2013 YRBSS data to estimate the percentages of high school students in the nation and 33 states meeting the US Department of Agriculture's Food Patterns F\/V intake recommendations. Twenty-four-hour dietary recalls were used from the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to fit sex-specific models for 14- to 18-year-olds that estimate probabilities of meeting recommendations as a function of reported frequency of consumption and race\/ethnicity, adjusting for day-to-day dietary variation. Model regression parameters were then applied to national cross-sectional YRBSS data (n=12,829) and to data from the 33 states (n=141,006) that had complete F\/V data to estimate percentages meeting recommendations.

The purpose of this review was to identify the effectiveness of gardening interventions that have been implemented to increase F\/V consumption among children. A systematic review was conducted using four electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. English language studies conducted in developed countries between January 2005 and October 2015 were included in this review. Included studies measured F\/V consumption among children aged 2 to 15 years before and after implementation of a gardening intervention in a school, community, or afterschool setting. All study designs were included in this review. A total of 891 articles were identified through database searching and cross-referencing. After removing duplicates, 650 articles remained and were screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-seven full-text articles were analyzed and 14 articles were included in this review. Of the 14 articles reviewed, 10 articles found statistically significant increases in fruit or vegetable consumption among participants after implementation of a gardening intervention. However, many studies were limited by the use of convenience samples, small sample sizes, and self-reported measurements of F\/V consumption. Although the evidence is mixed and fraught with limitations, most studies suggest a small but positive influence of gardening interventions on children's F\/V intake.

This study tested prospective associations between intakes of alcohol, energy-dense beverages, and low-calorie beverages and cardiometabolic risk in midlife women. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a 14-year, multisite prospective cohort study (1996-2011). Beverage intake and cardiometabolic risk factors that define the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, abdominal obesity, impaired fasting glucose, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and hypertriglyceridemia) were assessed throughout follow-up. Participants (N=1,448) were African American, Chinese, Japanese, and non-Hispanic white midlife women from six US cities. The primary outcomes were incident metabolic syndrome and the individual metabolic syndrome components. Generalized linear mixed models tested associations between intakes within each beverage category and odds of meeting criteria for metabolic syndrome and each of the metabolic syndrome components. Energy-dense beverage consumption was highest among African-American women and lowest among women with college degrees. Non-Hispanic white women consumed the largest quantities of alcohol. Independent of energy intake and potential confounders, each additional 355 mL energy-dense beverages consumed per day was associated with higher odds of developing metabolic syndrome in each successive year of follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08). Greater energy-dense beverage intake was associated with more rapidly increasing odds of developing hypertension (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11) and abdominal obesity (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) over time, but not with the other metabolic syndrome components. Intakes of alcohol and low-calorie coffees, teas, and diet cola were not associated with metabolic syndrome risk. Over 14 years of follow-up, energy-dense nonalcoholic beverage consumption was associated with incident metabolic syndrome in midlife women. The observed differences in intakes by ethnicity\/race and education suggest that consumption of these beverages may contribute to disparities in risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Our aim was to evaluate whether the association between dietary protein and lean mass differs by physical activity level, amino acid composition, and body mass index categories. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort. Participants were postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative with body composition measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (n=8,298). Our study measured percent lean mass, percent fat mass, and lean body mass index. Linear regression models adjusted for scanner serial number, age, calibrated energy intake, race\/ethnicity, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and recreational physical activity were used to determine the relationship between protein intake and body composition measures. Likelihood ratio tests and stratified analysis were used to investigate physical activity and body mass index as potential effect modifiers. Biomarker-calibrated protein intake was positively associated with percent lean mass; women in the highest protein quintile had 6.3 percentage points higher lean mass than the lowest quintile (P&lt;0.001). This difference rose to 8.5 percentage points for physically active women in the highest protein quintile (Pinteraction=0.023). Percent fat mass and lean body mass index were both inversely related to protein intake (both P&lt;0.001). Physical activity further reduced percent fat mass (Pinteraction=0.022) and lean body mass index (Pinteraction=0.011). Leucine intake was associated with lean mass, as were branched chain amino acids combined (both P&lt;0.001), but not independent of total protein. All associations were observed for normal-weight, overweight, and obese women. Protein consumption up to 2.02 g\/kg body weight daily is positively associated with lean mass in postmenopausal women.

The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantitatively investigate the association between daily intake of soy- and legume-derived isoflavones and risk of endometrial cancer. A broad search was conducted in the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and the Chinese Biomedical Database based on combinations of the key words endometrial cancer, isoflavone, soy, and legume for epidemiologic studies that focused on relationships between dietary isoflavones and endometrial cancer risk. A fixed-effect or random-effect model was used to pool study-specific risk estimates. A total of 13 epidemiologic studies were included in the present meta-analysis, consisting of three prospective cohort studies and 10 population-based case-control studies. The final results indicated that higher dietary isoflavone levels from soy products and legumes were associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.89). Low heterogeneous bias was observed (I2=11.7%; P=0.327). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on study design, source of dietary isoflavones, and study region. When restricted to study design, dietary isoflavones from soy and legumes played a role in prevention of endometrial cancer in case-control studies (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.90). However, there did not appear to be an association between dietary isoflavones and endometrial cancer in cohort studies (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.00). Significant associations were found between dietary isoflavones from soy products (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92) and legumes (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96) and endometrial cancer. Dietary isoflavones were associated with reduced incidence of endometrial cancer, both in Asian countries (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93) and non-Asian countries (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92). The findings suggest a weak inverse association between higher consumption of dietary isoflavones from soy products and legumes and endometrial cancer risk.

To assess whether vitamin-fortified snack foods affect consumers' information-seeking, purchase decisions, and product-related health perceptions. For this experimental study, participants were randomly assigned to study conditions to compare products that varied in product type, nutrition profile, and fortification and nutrient claim status. Data were collected via an online consumer panel. US adults aged 18 years and older were randomly selected from Research Now's e-panel online household panel. Data were collected during fall 2014 (N=5,076). Participants were randomly assigned to one of 24 conditions: two products (vegetable chip\/potato chip), two nutrition profiles (healthier\/less healthy), two fortification scenarios (not fortified\/fortified), and three nutrient claim conditions (two no claim\/one with claim). The design was not balanced; claims were not shown on products that were not vitamin fortified. Outcome measures were information-seeking (viewed the Nutrition Facts label), purchase decisions, perception of product healthfulness, and correct selection of product with the healthier nutrient profile. Logistic regression was used to test all models. Analyses was adjusted for general label use, consumes product, health status, age, sex, level of education, presence of children in the household, and race\/ethnicity. When the snack food carried a nutrient claim for vitamin fortification, participants were 1) less likely to look for nutrition information on the Nutrition Facts label, 2) more likely to select the product for purchase, 3) more likely to perceive the product as healthier, and 4) less likely to correctly choose the healthier product.

More than 100,000 female registered nurses in the United States, aged 24 to 44 years, were recruited in 1989 to participate in the Nurses' Health Study II. More than 90% of the original sample are currently active in the study. About 1.3% identified as lesbian or bisexual. Dietary measures were calculated from a 133-item food frequency questionnaire administered every 4 years. Measures included diet quality (Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension); calorie, fat, and fiber intake; and glycemic load and index. Multivariable adjusted repeated measures linear regression models were fit. On average, lesbian and bisexual women reported better diet quality (P&lt;0.001) and diets lower in glycemic index (P&lt;0.001) than heterosexual women. In the whole cohort, diet quality scores increased as participants aged, and were lower among women living in rural compared to urban regions. Comparisons in dietary intake across sexual orientation groups were generally similar across age and rurality status. However, differences between lesbian and heterosexual women in Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 were larger during younger compared to older ages, suggesting that diet quality estimates among sexual orientation groups converged as women aged. Lesbian and bisexual women reported higher diet quality than heterosexuals. More research examining how diet affects risk for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, among sexual minorities is needed.

This review will focus on isolated functional fibers (eg, fiber supplements) whose effects on clinical outcomes have been readily assessed in well-controlled clinical studies. This review will also focus on three health benefits (cholesterol lowering, improved glycemic control, and normalizing stool form [constipation and diarrhea]) for which reproducible evidence of clinical efficacy has been published. In the small bowel, clinically meaningful health benefits (eg, cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control) are highly correlated with the viscosity of soluble fibers: high viscosity fibers (eg, gel-forming fibers such as b-glucan, psyllium, and raw guar gum) exhibit a significant effect on cholesterol lowering and improved glycemic control, whereas nonviscous soluble fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, and wheat dextrin) and insoluble fibers (eg, wheat bran) do not provide these viscosity-dependent health benefits. In the large bowel, there are only two mechanisms that drive a laxative effect: large\/coarse insoluble fiber particles (eg, wheat bran) mechanically irritate the gut mucosa stimulating water and mucous secretion, and the high water-holding capacity of gel-forming soluble fiber (eg, psyllium) resists dehydration. Both mechanisms require that the fiber resist fermentation and remain relatively intact throughout the large bowel (ie, the fiber must be present in stool), and both mechanisms lead to increased stool water content, resulting in bulky\/soft\/easy-to-pass stools. Soluble fermentable fibers (eg, inulin, fructooligosaccharide, and wheat dextrin) do not provide a laxative effect, and some fibers can be constipating (eg, wheat dextrin and fine\/smooth insoluble wheat bran particles). When making recommendations for a fiber supplement, it is essential to recognize which fibers possess the physical characteristics required to provide a beneficial health effect, and which fiber supplements are supported by reproducible, rigorous evidence of one or more clinically meaningful health benefits.","1108":"Carotid intima media thickness (IMT) is a noninvasive marker of the extent and severity of subclinical atherosclerosis. Micronutrient intake may affect atherosclerosis and play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The primary aim of this review was to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between carotid IMT and selected micronutrients. The authors searched PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases from inception to June 2016 for selected micronutrients, CVD, carotid IMT, and antioxidants. Thirty-five original studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed following preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guidelines. Although not all studies found consistent results, the weight of the evidence suggests that high intakes and\/or circulatory levels of magnesium, as well as vitamin D and the vitamin B group, may be associated with lower carotid IMT or reduced progression of carotid IMT. The majority of studies did not find any significant association between vitamin E and C and carotid IMT. Less evidence was available for associations of retinol, zinc, and iron with carotid IMT. In general, the current evidence concerning micronutrient intake and carotid IMT is largely inconclusive. Pragmatic clinical trials are required to determine whether dietary or supplemental intake of specific micronutrients alters carotid IMT, which is a surrogate measure of cardiovascular risk.

Numerous studies have provided evidence of the economic, community, environmental, and food quality related benefits of CSAs. A substantial body of literature has also explored the CSA member experience and has found that members are generally very satisfied, but membership turnover rates are often high. Research regarding the association between dietary intake and health is more limited and mostly descriptive in nature. CSA members often report increased consumption and variety of fruits and vegetables, changes in the household food environment, and changes in meal patterns. A small number of anecdotal reports also support the association between CSA participation and improved health status. However, there is a dearth of experimental research in this area, and results of these studies are mixed. Future research opportunities include longitudinal studies to evaluate repeat CSA participation and the long-term sustainability of CSA-related dietary and health changes.

We hypothesized that children prefer less- (vs more-) healthful foods, and pay greater attention to and preferentially select products with (vs without) media characters regardless of nutritional quality. We also hypothesized that children prefer more-healthful products when characters are present over less-healthful products without characters. On a computer, participants viewed food\/beverage pairs of more-healthful and less-healthful versions of similar products.

Children's choices significantly differed based on age, sex, and the specific cartoon character displayed, with characters in this study being preferred by younger boys. Results suggest that putting licensed media characters on more-healthful food\/beverage products might not encourage all children to make healthier food choices, but could increase selection of healthy foods among some, particularly younger children, boys, and those who like the featured character(s).

Providers' perspectives showed barriers, motivators, and facilitators regarding their use of mealtime CFP. Providers reported barriers to avoiding CFP such as CFP were effective for encouraging desired behaviors, misconceptions that providers were encouraging but not controlling children's eating, and fear of parents' negative reaction if their child did not eat. Providers who did not practice CFP were motivated to avoid CFP because they were unnecessary for encouraging children to eat, and they resulted in negative child outcomes and obesity. Facilitators as an alternative to CFP included practicing healthful feeding practices such as role modeling, peer modeling, and sensory exploration of foods. Training providers about negative child outcomes associated with CFP, children's ability to self-regulate energy intake, and differentiating between controlling and healthful feeding strategies may help providers to avoid CFP.

To evaluate whether the use of cinnamon dietary supplements by adults with T2DM had clinically meaningful effects on glycemic control, as measured by changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed. Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified that met our inclusion criteria that enrolled 694 adults with T2DM receiving hypoglycemic medications or not. In 10 of the studies, participants continued to take their hypoglycemic medications during the cinnamon intervention period. Studies ranged from 4 to 16 weeks in duration; seven studies were double-blind. Cinnamon doses ranged from 120 to 6,000 mg\/day. The species of cinnamon used varied: seven used Cinnamomum cassia or Cinnamomum aromaticum, one used Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and three did not disclose the species. Because of the heterogeneity of the studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. All 11 of the studies reported some reductions in FPG during the cinnamon intervention, and of the studies measuring HbA1c very modest decreases were also apparent with cinnamon, whereas changes in the placebo groups were minimal. However, only four studies achieved the American Diabetes Association treatment goals (FPG &lt;7.2 mmol\/L [130 mg\/dL] and\/or HbAlc &lt;7.0).

Accurate diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary dietary restriction, especially in children. Because registered dietitian nutritionists often work independently, receiving referrals for dietary education and guidance for a patient who is followed by one or several other practitioners, navigating the data available and making the appropriate follow-up contact optimizes treatment.

Direct observational, cross-sectional study. Primarily low-income, minority families (n=120) video recorded 8 days of family dinners and completed a corresponding meal screener. Dietary recalls were completed on the target child (6 to 12 years old). The Healthfulness of Meal Index was used to measure meal healthfulness and included component scores for whole fruit, 100% juice, vegetables, dark green vegetables, dairy, protein, added sugars, and high-sodium foods. Child dietary intake measured by three 24-hour dietary recalls. Linear regression models estimated the association between the healthfulness of foods served at dinner meals and overall child HEI. The majority of coded meals included foods from protein and high-sodium components; more than half included foods from dairy and vegetable components. Nearly half of the meals had an added-sugar component food (eg, soda or dessert). Few meals served foods from fruit, 100% juice, or dark green vegetable components. Many components served at family dinner meals were significantly associated with child daily intake of those same foods (ie, dark green vegetable, non-dark green vegetables, dairy, and added sugars). The Healthfulness of Meal Index total score was significantly associated with child HEI score. This study represents the first report of a new methodology to collect data of foods served at family dinners.

In this cross-sectional study, anonymous meal observations were conducted after students selected their reimbursable school lunch meals in the cafeteria lunch line. The amounts of foods selected and consumed were recorded using the quarter waste method and food waste was calculated using the information recorded. During the spring of 2013, eight elementary schools (50% low income) enrolling children in kindergarten through grade 5 in one school district in the Houston, TX, area were selected by the Child Nutrition Director. The amount of calories and foods consumed and the percentage wasted were assessed. Analysis of covariance and post hoc analysis were used to examine food consumption and plate waste by grade level (kindergarten and grade 1 [K-Gr1], grades 2 and 3 [Gr2-3], and grades 4 and 5 [Gr4-5]), controlling for student sex and school-level free\/reduced priced meal eligibility. There were 568 nonrandom lunch meal observations of students included in the analyses. Approximately 48% of the observations were from boys; 50% were from low-income schools, and were evenly divided by grade. In general, students in K-Gr1 consumed fewer calories than both Gr2-3 and Gr4-5, and Gr2-3 students consumed significantly fewer calories than Gr4-5. K-Gr1 students also consumed less and wasted more total and red-orange vegetables, total\/whole\/refined grains, and total protein foods than the older students.

This study sought to develop and examine the accuracy of an individualized bite-based measure of kilocalorie intake and to compare that measure to participant estimates of kilocalorie intake. It was hypothesized that kilocalorie information would improve human estimates of kilocalorie intake over those with no information, but a bite-based estimate of kilocalorie intake would still outperform human estimates. Two-hundred eighty participants were allowed to eat ad libitum in a cafeteria setting. Their bite count and kilocalorie intake were measured. After completion of the meal, participants estimated how many kilocalories they consumed, some with the aid of a menu containing kilocalorie information and some without. Using a train and test method for predictive model development, participants were randomly divided into one of two groups: one for model development (training group) and one for model validation (test group). Multiple regression was used to determine whether height, weight, age, sex, and waist-to-hip ratio could predict an individual's mean kilocalories per bite for the training sample. The model was then validated with the test group, and the model-predicted kilocalorie intake was compared with human-estimated kilocalorie intake. Only age and sex significantly predicted mean kilocalories per bite, but all variables were retained for the test group.

However, the additional effects of parent-focused social marketing with nutrition education have received little attention. Our aim was to assess the impact of the Iowa Nutrition Network's school-based nutrition education program (Building and Strengthening Iowa Community Support for Nutrition and Physical Activity [BASICS]) and the benefits of adding a multichannel social marketing intervention (BASICS Plus) to increase parent-directed communication. A quasi-experimental design with three study conditions compared a school-based nutrition education program (BASICS) with a school-based and social marketing intervention (BASICS Plus) and a no-treatment comparison group. The study included 1,037 third-grade students attending 33 elementary schools and their parents. Measures included parents' reports of their children's in-home consumption of fruits and vegetables (F\/V) and use of low-fat\/fat-free milk. Data on F\/V were collected using a modified version of the University of California Cooperative Extension Food Behavior Checklist; and data on milk use were collected using two questions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multilevel, mixed-effect regression models that account for correlation within repeated measures and children within school were used to compare the mean change over time in the outcome variable for one study group with the mean change over time for another study group. Children in BASICS increased mean consumption of fruit by 0.16 cups (P=0.04) compared with children in the comparison group. Children in BASICS Plus increased mean consumption of fruit by 0.17 cups (P=0.03) and mean consumption of vegetables by 0.13 cups (P=0.02). Children in BASICS Plus were 1.3 times (P=0.05) more likely to use low-fat\/fat-free milk than children in either the BASICS group or the comparison group. Gaining parents' attention and engaging them in healthy eating practices for their children can be a useful way to increase the effectiveness of school-based nutrition education programs.

This was a secondary analysis of the self-efficacy enhancement arm of the Self Efficacy Lifestyle Focus (SELF) trial, an 18-month randomized clinical trial. The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh (2008-2013). Overweight or obese adults with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor were eligible. Participants in the self-efficacy enhancement arm were given a scale (Carematix, Inc) and instructed to weigh themselves at least 3 days per week or every other day. The scale date- and time-stamped each weighing episode, storing up to 100 readings. Weight was assessed every 6 months. Adherence to energy intake and EE goals was calculated on a weekly basis using paper diary data. Linear mixed modeling and mediation analyses were used.

This review discusses the burden of nausea and vomiting that patients with cancer can experience, including the effect on quality of life, nutritional status, and treatment outcomes. Implications for dietetics practice include the need to explore the nature of reported symptoms, identify predisposing risk factors, and to consider the use of a variety of interventions that are individualized to a patient's symptoms.

Due to the health implications that are associated with child and adolescent obesity, it is critical to understand systematic differences in diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors that may be contributing to this disparity in weight. However, varying definitions of rural and inconsistencies in study tools and methodologies may limit the generalizability of findings from research in this area. The objective of this narrative review was to synthesize and critically evaluate existing literature comparing diet and PA behaviors between rural and urban children and adolescents, providing recommendations for future research. Only five studies were found that reported on measures of diet in rural vs urban youth, whereas 16 were found that reported on measures of PA. Dietary assessment tools were generally standard and acceptable; however, differences existed in how dietary outcomes were defined. Few studies used assessment tools that objectively measured PA, and definitions for meeting PA recommendations varied among studies. Very few studies defined rural using the same criteria.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the impact of the revised WIC Nutrition Program's food allocation package on the availability, accessibility, and affordability of healthy foods in WIC-authorized grocery stores in Texas; and (2) how the impact of the policy change differed by store types and between rural and urban regions. WIC-approved stores (n=105) across Texas were assessed using a validated instrument (88 items). Pre- (June-September 2009) and post-new WIC package implementation (June-September 2012) audits were conducted. Paired-sample t tests were conducted to compare the differences between pre- and post-implementation audits on shelf width and number of varieties (ie, availability), visibility (ie, accessibility), and inflation-adjusted price (ie, affordability). Across the 105 stores, post-implementation audits showed increased availability in terms of shelf space for most key healthy food options, including fruit (P&lt;0.001), vegetables (P&lt;0.01), cereal (P&lt;0.001), and varieties of vegetables (P&lt;0.001).

This analysis estimated recent trends in American diet quality and compared those trends to the quality of diets that would meet the Healthy People 2020 objectives and the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans in order to measure progress toward our national nutrition goals. This analysis used 24-hour recall data from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, between the years of 1999-2000 and 2011-2012, to determine mean intakes of various dietary components for the US population over time. Mean intakes were estimated using the population ratio method, and diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010). The mean HEI-2010 total score for the US population has increased from 49 in 1999-2000 to 59 in 2011-2012; continuing on that trajectory, it would reach a score of 65 by 2019-2020.

Our aim was to evaluate the association between low energy reporting and aspects of weight perception, satisfaction, and control in a nationally representative US adult sample. This was a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed from 13,581 adults aged 20 years and older who participated in the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Data on sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics, and weight perception, satisfaction, and control were collected. The ratio of reported energy intake to estimated basal metabolic rate (EI\/BMR) was calculated and used for the assessment of low energy reporting. The relationship of low energy reporting with various aspects of weight perception, satisfaction, and control was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between the variables. Low energy reporters were significantly more likely to consider themselves overweight (perception), want to weigh less (satisfaction), and to have tried to lose weight in the past 12 months (control). Compared with having no desire for weight change, wanting to weigh less was associated with 1.28 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.53) times higher odds for low energy reporting. Trying to lose weight was also associated with low energy reporting (odds ratio=1.56; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.76). Effect modification by obesity status was observed for the weight perception, satisfaction, and control variables where the odds ratios of these factors for low energy reporting were higher among those who were not obese.

Dietary fiber is defined by the Institute of Medicine Food Nutrition Board as \"nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.\" Populations that consume more dietary fiber have less chronic disease. Higher intakes of dietary fiber reduce the risk of developing several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, and have been associated with lower body weights. The Adequate Intake for fiber is 14 g total fiber per 1,000 kcal, or 25 g for adult women and 38 g for adult men, based on research demonstrating protection against coronary heart disease. Properties of dietary fiber, such as fermentability and viscosity, are thought to be important parameters influencing the risk of disease. Plant components associated with dietary fiber may also contribute to reduced disease risk. The mean intake of dietary fiber in the United States is 17 g\/day with only 5% of the population meeting the Adequate Intake. Healthy adults and children can achieve adequate dietary fiber intakes by increasing their intake of plant foods while concurrently decreasing energy from foods high in added sugar and fat, and low in fiber.

Nationally representative sample of 22,513 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2012 waves were analyzed. The discretionary food category identifies energy-dense, nutrient-poor food products that do not necessarily provide essential nutrients that the human body needs, but can add variety.

The Food Dudes program increases in-school F\/V consumption, but the cost of prizes might be an adoption barrier. Our aim was to compare the effects of the Food Dudes program when prizes vs praise are used to reward F\/V consumption. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with three groups (ie, prize, praise, and control). Schools were randomly assigned to groups while approximately equating the percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch. F\/V consumption (lunch-tray photos) was assessed twice at pre-intervention and once after phase I, phase II, and at 6 months post-intervention, spanning approximately 11 months overall. In total, 2,292 students attending six elementary schools participated, with 882, 640, and 770 in the prize, praise, and control groups, respectively. The Food Dudes program was implemented over 4.5 months in all but the control schools. Two Food Dudes schools implemented the program with tangible prizes contingent on individual students' F\/V consumption (prize group); two schools implemented Food Dudes using teacher praise instead of prizes (praise group). Follow-up data were collected 6 months post-intervention. F\/V consumption was assessed by digital imaging of lunch trays. Linear mixed-effects modeling, including sex, grade, and baseline consumption as covariates, was performed. Students attending the Food Dudes schools consumed more F\/V than control schools after phase I, with larger differences in prize schools (92% difference) than praise schools (50% difference). After phase II, Food Dudes schools consumed 46% more F\/V than control schools, with no difference between prize and praise schools. At 6-month follow-up, only prize schools consumed more F\/V than control schools (0.12 cups more per child, 42.9% difference). Social praise proved an inadequate substitute for tangible prizes within the Food Dudes program. Program-related increases in F\/V consumption decreased after the intervention, underscoring the need to develop low-cost, long-term interventions to maintain and make habitual consumption of recommended levels of F\/V.

These changes included increases in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy to improve nutrition and health of WIC participants. Our systematic review of the literature assessed the influence that the 2009 WIC food package revisions have had on dietary intake, healthy food and beverage availability, and breastfeeding participation. The systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. Four electronic databases were searched between April 1 and 30, 2014, for peer-reviewed research. Two reviewers screened the articles, extracted the data, and established inter-rater reliability by discussing and resolving discrepancies. Twenty articles were included that met our inclusion criteria. Nine of the studies analyzed changes in dietary intake, eight examined changes in healthy food and beverage availability, and three evaluated breastfeeding participation exclusively. The review demonstrated an improved dietary intake and an increase in the availability of healthier foods and beverages in authorized WIC stores. The revised food package was also associated with improved dietary intake of WIC participants. Mixed results were demonstrated in regard to improved breastfeeding outcomes. Further research is needed to assess the influence of WIC 2009 food package revisions on breastfeeding outcomes and to make conclusions about broad nutrition-related implications.

In response to these evolving needs, the Public Health and Community Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group, with guidance from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Management Committee, has developed Standards of Practice and Standards of Professional Performance as tools for registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) currently in practice or interested in working in public health and community nutrition, to assess their current skill levels and to identify areas for professional development. The Standards of Practice address the four steps of the Nutrition Care Process for community and public health RDNs, which are assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and evaluation\/monitoring. The Standards of Professional Performance consist of the following six domains of professional performance for community and public health RDNs: Quality in Practice, Competence and Accountability, Provision of Services, Application of Research, Communication and Application of Knowledge, and Utilization and Management of Resources. Within each standard, specific indicators provide measurable action statements that illustrate the ways in which RDNs can address client and population nutrition and health. The indicators describe three skill levels (competent, proficient, and expert) for RDNs.

This study describes parents' perceptions of healthful eating for T1DM in young children and identifies factors related to parents' dietary management. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study was performed. Parents completed a questionnaire, 3-day weighed diet record, and a semi-structured interview regarding their perceptions of healthful eating for T1DM and their dietary management practices. Twenty-three families, recruited from a pediatric diabetes clinic in the midwestern United States between February 2012 and April 2013, participated. Eligible families had a child with T1DM who was 1 to 6 years old, at least 6 months from diagnosis, and was following an intensive insulin regimen. Mean scores and percentages were calculated from the diet diaries and parent questionnaires, and parents' interviews were coded to identify common themes. Results showed that while parents may believe they know what constitutes a healthful diet for T1DM, they do not always feed their child a healthful diet. Parent-identified barriers to healthful eating included limited time to prepare homemade meals, perceived higher costs of healthier foods, the influence of peers on children's food preferences, and picky eating. Parents also discussed a desire not to limit their child's diet or make their child \"feel different,\" which many parents said often led them to give into their child's requests for less healthful food options. Parents of young children with T1DM identified several barriers to healthful eating that are common for all parents, such as time constraints, expense, and child food preferences. However, unique themes emerged, including parents' desire not to limit their child's diet or make their child \"feel different.\" Nutrition components of T1DM education should include psychological and behavioral strategies to help parents manage these unique concerns.

As dementia progresses, patients require increasing amounts of care and nutrient intake usually declines. This tends to result in weight loss, malnutrition, and increased morbidity and mortality. Various interventions have been developed with the goal of improving meal intake and reducing unintentional weight loss in patients with dementia. Several studies have shown that meal intake improves with the provision of adequate assistance, either from staff members or from volunteer feeding assistants. Some studies have focused on the method of meal service and its influence on meal intake and nutrition status. Both buffet-style and family-style dining have shown promising results in terms of improving meal intake and quality of life among older adults in long-term-care settings. Other environment-related interventions include improving lighting and visual contrast, altering the dining room to more closely resemble a home-style setting, using the aroma of food to stimulate appetite, using routine seating arrangements, and using relaxing or familiar music in the dining room to provide a calmer environment.

This study reports secondary analyses of longitudinal data from mothers and children (n=340) participating in the NOURISH randomized controlled trial. Exposure was quantified as the number of food items (n=55) tried by a child from specified lists at age 14 months. At age 3.7 years, food preferences, intake patterns, and fussiness (also at age 14 months) were assessed using maternal-completed, established questionnaires. Child weight and length\/height were measured by study staff at both age points. Multivariable linear regression models were tested to predict food preferences, intake patterns, fussy eating, and body mass index z score at age 3.7 years adjusting for a range of maternal and child covariates. Having tried a greater number of vegetables, fruits, and noncore foods at age 14 months predicted corresponding preferences and higher intakes at age 3.7 years but did not predict child body mass index z score. Adjusting for fussiness at age 14 months, having tried more vegetables at age 14 months was associated with lower fussiness at age 3.7 years.

A systematic review of cohort and experimental studies published until December 2013 in peer-reviewed journals was performed on Medline, CINAHL, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies investigating the influence of SSB consumption on risk of obesity and obesity among children and adolescents were included, and methodological quality to answer this question was assessed independently by two investigators using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. Among the 32 identified studies, nine had positive quality ratings and 23 studies had at least one major methodological issue. Main methodological issues included SSB definition and inadequate measurement of exposure. Studies with positive quality ratings found an association between SSB consumption and risk of obesity or obesity (n=5) (ie, when SSB consumption increased so did obesity) or mixed results (n=4). Studies with a neutral quality rating found a positive association (n=7), mixed results (n=9), or no association (n=7).

Anthropometric assessments and surveys were completed at school by adolescents and surveys were completed at home by parents. Parental concordance on home environment factors was high for some factors (eg, 68% concordance on not pressuring adolescent to eat) and low for other factors (eg, 2% concordance on parent engaging in physically activity with child 4+ hours per week). Parental concordance on positive home environment factors (eg, frequency of family meals) was associated with more adolescent healthful eating patterns and hours of physical activity (P&lt;0.05), but not consistently. When parents were discordant, adolescents had higher consumption of fast food and more unhealthy weight control behaviors (P&lt;0.05), but not consistently.

ECE centers that require parents to send in meals and\/or snacks from home present a unique challenge for accurate nutrition estimation and data collection. We present an observational methodology for recording the contents and temperature of preschool-aged children's lunchboxes and data to support a 2-day vs a 3-day collection period. Lunchbox observers were trained in visual estimation of foods based on Child and Adult Care Food Program and MyPlate servings and household recommended measures. Trainees weighed and measured foods commonly found in preschool-aged children's lunchboxes and practiced recording accurate descriptions and food temperatures. Training included test assessments of whole-grain bread products, mixed dishes such as macaroni and cheese, and a variety of sandwich preparations. Validity of the estimation method was tested by comparing estimated to actual amounts for several distinct food types. Reliability was assessed by computing the intraclass correlation coefficient for each observer as well as an interrater reliability coefficient across observers. To compare 2- and 3-day observations, 2 of the 3 days of observations were randomly selected for each child and analyzed as a separate dataset. Linear model estimated mean and standard error of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and amounts of energy, carbohydrates, protein, total fat, saturated fat, dietary fiber, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamins A and C, calcium, iron, sodium, and dietary fiber per lunch were compared across the 2- and 3-day observation datasets. The mean estimated amounts across 11 observers were statistically indistinguishable from the measured portion size for each of the 41 test foods, implying that the visual estimation measurement method was valid: intraobserver intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.951 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97) to 1.0. Across observers, the interrater reliability correlation coefficient was estimated at 0.979 (95% CI 0.957 to 0.993). Comparison of servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains showed no significant differences for serving size or mean energy and nutrient content between 2- and 3-day lunch observations. The methodology is a valid and reliable option for use in research and practice that requires observing and assessing the contents and portion sizes of food items in preschool-aged children's lunchboxes in an ECE setting. The use of visual observation and estimation with Child and Adult Care Food Program and MyPlate serving sizes and household measures over 2 random days of data collection enables food handling to be minimized while obtaining an accurate record of the variety and quantities of foods that young children are exposed to at lunch time.

However, the effects of this dietary change on weight loss are unknown. Our aim was to evaluate associations between changes in dietary factors and child anthropometric outcomes after treatment. It is hypothesized that reduced consumption of food away from home will be associated with improved dietary intake and greater reductions in anthropometric outcomes (standardized body mass index [BMI] and percent body fat), and the relationship between food away from home and anthropometric outcomes will be mediated by improved child dietary intake. We conducted a longitudinal evaluation of associations between dietary changes and child anthropometric outcomes. Child diet (three 24-hour recalls) and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and 16 weeks. Participants were 170 overweight and obese children ages 7 to 11 years who completed a 16-week family-based behavioral weight-loss treatment as part of a larger multi-site randomized controlled trial conducted in two cohorts between 2010 and 2011 (clinical research trial). Dietary treatment targets during family-based behavioral weight-loss treatment included improving diet quality and reducing food away from home. The main outcome measures in this study were child relative weight (standardized BMI) and body composition (percent body fat). We performed t tests and bootstrapped single-mediation analyses adjusting for relevant covariates. As hypothesized, decreased food away from home was associated with improved diet quality and greater reductions in standardized BMI (P&lt;0.05) and percent body fat (P&lt;0.01). Associations between food away from home and anthropometric outcomes were mediated by changes in diet quality. Specifically, change in total energy intake and added sugars mediated the association between change in food away from home and standardized BMI, and change in overall diet quality, fiber, added sugars, and added fats mediated the association between change in food away from home and percent body fat. Including physical activity as a covariate did not significantly impact these findings. These results suggest that reducing food away from home can be an important behavioral target for affecting positive changes in both diet quality and anthropometric outcomes during treatment.

This study aimed to pilot a behavioral observation measure of tactile play in young children. The primary aim of the study was to see whether children's enjoyment of tactile play was associated with higher F\/V consumption, as well as lower food neophobia. Seventy 2- to 5-year-old children (37 males and 33 females) and their parents were recruited through children's centers in the Leicester region of the United Kingdom during July to October 2012. Children's engagement in two tactile play tasks using sticky foods (mashed potatoes and vegetarian gelatin) was observed and rated by both the researcher and parent. Parents were asked to complete a series of questionnaires measuring F\/V consumption, food neophobia, and sensory processing. It was found that lower child food neophobia was significantly related to enjoyment of tactile play, whereas child F\/V consumption was associated with parental F\/V consumption, but not enjoyment of tactile play. The findings strengthen the idea that tactile processing may be associated with the acceptance of food variety, but not the total amount of F\/V consumed.

This study examined differences in dietary practices (at or en route to and\/or from school) between students in their last years of elementary school (grades 5 to 7) and first year of secondary school (grade 8) in Vancouver, Canada, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and school-level socioeconomic status. Demographic characteristics and dietary data were collected through a cross-sectional survey (n=950 from 26 schools) and combined with school-level socioeconomic data derived from the 2006 Canadian Census. Multilevel logistic regression analyses indicated that secondary school students were significantly more likely to report daily consumption of fast foods (odds ratio=1.92; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.12) and minimally nutritious packaged snacks (eg, candy or chocolate bars) (odds ratio=1.60; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.45), and to report regular purchases from off-campus retailers (odds ratio=1.63; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.42). Gender, food insecurity, lower acculturation to Canada, and access to more weekly spending money were associated with nutritionally poor practices. Students attending schools drawing from lower-income neighborhoods were also significantly more likely to consume fast foods and packaged snacks daily. The majority of students sampled did not report consuming healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, daily at or en route to and\/or from school. Intake of fruit, vegetables, and low-fat milk did not differ significantly between elementary and secondary school students.

Adults' visual attention to Nutrition Facts labels and front-of-package nutrition labels was objectively measured via eye-tracking glasses. To examine whether there were significant differences in the percentages of participants who viewed Nutrition Facts labels vs front-of-package nutrition labels, McNemar's tests were conducted across all participants, as well as within various sociodemographic categories. To determine whether hypothesized factors, such as health literacy and education, had stronger relationships with front-of-package nutrition label vs Nutrition Facts label viewing, linear regression assessed the magnitude of relationships between theoretically and empirically derived factors and each type of label viewing. Overall, front-of-package nutrition labels were more likely to be viewed than Nutrition Facts labels; however, for all subgroups, higher rates of front-of-package nutrition label viewership occurred only when signage was present drawing attention to the presence and meaning of front-of-package nutrition labels.

Approximately 60% of participants noticed calorie menu labels, whereas only 16% reported using the information for food or beverage purchases. Higher-income individuals had twice the odds of noticing calorie labels (P=0.029) and three times the odds of using them (P=0.004). Significant positive associations were found between individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher and use of calorie menu labels (odds ratio 3.25; P=0.023). Noticing calorie menu labels was not associated with purchasing fewer calories; however, those who reported using calorie information purchased 146 fewer calories than those who did not (P=0.001). Using calorie menu labels is associated with purchasing fewer calories. However, there are significant socioeconomic disparities among customers who notice and use calorie menu labels. Targeted education campaigns are needed to improve the use of menu labeling across all sociodemographic groups.

Although heterogeneity was absent, study designs varied with regard to duration, dose, and control of energy intake. Replacement of LCTs with MCTs in the diet could potentially induce modest reductions in body weight and composition without adversely affecting lipid profiles. However, further research is required by independent research groups using large, well-designed studies to confirm the efficacy of MCT and to determine the dosage needed for the management of a healthy body weight and composition.

Although there are nutrition interventions in Hawaii and the Pacific, success is limited, in part, because of the lack of tailoring for the Pacific context. The Pacific context is inclusive of environment, political, and economic situation; historical (precontact, colonial, and post colonial) background; cultural practices; and spiritual orientation. This study used Grounded Theory and Community-Based Participatory Research processes to identify influences that hinder or facilitate adherence to nutrition recommendations. Data were gathered through key informant interviews (faith leaders and health care providers) and focus-group discussions (individual with diabetes and care takers). Results showed barriers to nutrition recommendations adherence that were similar to other minority populations in the United States, such as cost of healthy foods, taste preference, low availability of healthy food choices, lack of ideas for healthy meals\/cooking, and lack of culturally appropriate options for dietary modification. It also elucidated behaviors that influence adherence to nutrition recommendations, such as preparing and consuming meals for and with extended family and church members; patient and group motivation; and access to healthy, affordable, and palatable foods. Participants expressed the need for interventions that are tailored to the local culture and context and a holistic view of health, with a focus on motivation (spiritual and emotional support). These findings could be used to develop culturally and contextually appropriate programs. For example, adapting motivational interviewing techniques and materials by adding family members to motivational interviewing sessions vs patients only, as Pacific Islanders have a collectivistic culture and family members play an important role in adherence; conducting motivational interviewing in the community in addition to the clinical setting; utilizing church leaders as motivational interviewing counselors in addition to health care providers; and changing motivational interviewing narratives and tools (eg, a confidence scale of 1 to 10 will be unfamiliar to many Pacific Islanders); therefore, counselors need to develop another method to indicate levels of confidence, such as the color of the lagoon\/ocean that goes from turquoise (the color of shallow water) to navy blue (the color of deep water).

The International Study on Macro\/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure is a cross-sectional investigation with four 24-hour dietary recalls and BMI measurements conducted between 1996 and 1999. Consumption of solid foods was aggregated into eating occasion. Nutrient density is expressed using the Nutrient Rich Food Index 9.3. The ratio of evening\/morning energy intake was calculated; mean values of four visits were used. Characteristics across eating occasion categories are presented as adjusted mean with corresponding 95% CI. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine associations of eating occasions, ratio of evening\/morning energy intake, dietary energy density, and Nutrient Rich Food Index 9.3 with BMI. Compared to participants with fewer than four eating occasions in 24 hours, those with six or more eating occasions in 24 hours had lower mean BMI (27.3 vs 29.0), total energy intake (2,129 vs 2,472 kcal\/24 hours), dietary energy density (1.5 vs 2.1 kcal\/g), and higher Nutrient Rich Food Index 9.3 (34.3 vs 28.1). In multiple regression analyses, higher evening intake relative to morning intake was directly associated with BMI; however, this did not influence the relationship between eating frequency and BMI. Our results suggest that a larger number of small meals may be associated with improved diet quality and lower BMI.

When two or more data points are available, indicators may also include weight-gain velocity (younger than 2 years of age), weight loss (2 to 20 years of age), deceleration in weight for length\/height z score, and inadequate nutrient intake. The purpose of this consensus statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document undernutrition in the pediatric population (ages 1 month to 18 years). The indicators are intended for use in multiple settings, such as acute, ambulatory care\/outpatient, residential care, etc. Several screening tools have been developed for use in hospitalized children. However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper. Clinicians should use as many data points as available to identify and document the presence of malnutrition. The universal use of a single set of diagnostic parameters will expedite the recognition of pediatric undernutrition, lead to the development of more accurate estimates of its prevalence and incidence, direct interventions, and promote improved outcomes.

Although sandwiches are a staple of the American diet, previous examinations of their contribution to sodium intake captured only a small subset of sandwiches. One day of dietary intake data from 5,762 adults aged 20 years and older in What We Eat in America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010 was analyzed. Sandwiches were defined in a manner that more accurately reflected their frequency of consumption. Two-sided t tests were used to compare percentages of men and women reporting sandwiches; contributions of sandwiches to energy and sodium intakes (amounts in kilocalories and milligrams, respectively, and percent of daily totals) by sex; and total energy, total sodium, and sodium density (mg\/1,000 kcal) by sandwich reporting status (reporter\/nonreporter). On any given day, 49% of American adults ate sandwiches. A significantly higher percentage of men than women reported sandwiches (54% vs 44%, respectively; P&lt;0.001), and sandwiches accounted for higher percentages of men's total energy and sodium intakes. Compared with individuals who did not report a sandwich on the intake day, sandwich reporters had significantly higher energy and sodium intakes; however, sodium density of the diet did not vary by sandwich reporting status. Although much national attention is appropriately focused on reducing sodium in the food supply, consumer choices still play a vital role. Due to sandwiches' frequent consumption and considerable contributions to sodium intake, substituting lower-sodium for higher-sodium ingredients in sandwiches could significantly influence sodium intakes.

Final models were adjusted for race, smoking status, education, parity, duration of sex hormone use, whole body percent fat, childhood body mass index z score, and energy from beverages. After adjustment, each 1 kcal\/g unit increase in food-only ED was associated with a 25.9% (95% CI 6.2% to 56.8%) increase in %DBV (P=0.01). Childhood body mass index z score modified the association between food-only ED and %DBV such that a significant positive association was observed only in women who were heavier as children. Food-only ED was not associated with ADBV in all women, but a borderline significant positive association was observed in women who had higher childhood body mass index z scores. This is the first report to suggest a potential role for dietary ED in breast density; the effects of long-term exposure to high-ED diets on breast cancer risk remain unknown.

We describe and evaluate an intervention for low-income families to encourage healthy habits. The RD Parent Empowerment Program (http:\/\/www.eatright.org\/programs\/kidseatright\/activities\/content.aspx?id=6442477891) consists of four workshops centered on the 8 Habits of Healthy Children and Families (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation). Registered dietitian nutritionists conduct the workshops in school and community settings using a structured leader guide and tailor the communication and interactive activities to the audience. Participants are parents of young children. Our goals were to use a phenomenologic approach to elicit participant feedback, determine whether participants in the RD Parent Empowerment Program made healthier choices for their families after attending the workshops, and identify which elements of the program participants believed contributed most to its success. The evaluation design used a pragmatic, mixed-methods approach utilizing postintervention focus groups and pre-post intervention scores on the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity (FNPA) survey. All workshop attendees aged 18 years or older were eligible to participate in the evaluation. One hundred twenty-three parents participated in the intervention across seven sites. Focus group results were analyzed using thematic analysis methods to match themes to the main intervention goals. t Tests were used to compare pre- and postintervention FNPA scores and demographic characteristics pooled across sites. FNPA scores significantly improved from pre- to postintervention by a mean of 4.3 FNPA points (6.5%; P&lt;0.01). Focus group participants reported behavior changes as a result of the program and identified the site leaders as integral to the program's success, triangulating the results. The RD Parent Empowerment Program generates meaningful self-reported behavior change in parents. Long-term sustainability of the changes must be investigated.

Differences in food group spending by diet quality were also examined to identify potential budgetary reallocation to improve overall diet quality. Families of 252 youth with type 1 diabetes aged 8 to 18 years completed 3-day youth diet records. Cost of each food reported was calculated based on the average price obtained from two online grocery stores. Diet cost was estimated as average daily cost of foods consumed. The Healthy Eating Index 2005 (HEI2005), Nutrient Rich Foods Index version 9.3, and Whole Plant Food Density scores were evaluated. Differences in mean daily diet cost across tertiles of HEI2005, Nutrient Rich Foods Index version 9.3, and Whole Plant Food Density were modest, with none reaching statistical significance. Those in the upper tertile of HEI2005 spent more on whole fruit, whole grains, lean meat, and low-fat dairy, and less on high-fat meat and high-fat dairy compared with those in the lower tertiles. Higher-quality diets can be obtained at comparable costs to lesser-quality diets, suggesting that cost need not be an insurmountable barrier to more healthful eating. Reallocation of spending may increase overall quality without substantially increasing overall spending.

Our study explores the effect of accounting for plausibility on nutrient intake estimates in a sample of Mexican-American women in northern California in 2008. Nutrient intakes are compared with Dietary Reference Intake recommendations, and intakes of Mexican-American women in a national survey are presented as a reference. Eighty-two women provided three 24-hour recalls. Reported energy intakes were classified as biologically plausible or implausible using the reported energy intakes to total energy expenditure cutoff of &lt;0.76 or &gt;1.24, with low-active physical activity levels used to estimate total energy expenditure. Differences in the means of nutrient intakes between implausible (n=36) and plausible (n=46) reporters of energy intake were examined by bivariate linear regression. Estimated energy, protein, cholesterol, dietary fiber, and vitamin E intakes were significantly higher in plausible reporters than implausible. There was a significant difference between the proportions of plausible vs implausible reporters meeting recommendations for several nutrients, with a larger proportion of plausible reporters meeting recommendations.

However, little is known about the prevalence of these food practices in alternative schools, which are educational settings for students at risk of academic failure due to truancy, school expulsion, and behavior problems. Nationwide, more than 5,000 alternative schools enroll about one-half million students who are disproportionately minority and low-income youth. Principal survey data from a cross-sectional sample of alternative (n=104) and regular (n=339) schools collected biennially from 2002-2008 as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Minnesota School Health Profiles were used to assess and compare food practice prevalence over time. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate prevalence, adjusting for school demographics.

Rapid increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity during the 1980s and 1990s focused attention on young children's overconsumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages and lack of physical activity. While recent data suggest a stabilization of obesity rates, several public health concerns remain.

A secondary objective was to determine whether the format of the nutrition information (informative vs contextual or interpretive) influences calorie selection or consumption. Several bibliographic databases were searched for experimental or quasiexperimental studies that tested the effect of providing nutrition information in a restaurant or other foodservice setting on calories selected or consumed. Studies that recruited generally healthy, noninstitutionalized adolescents or adults were included. When two or more studies reported similar outcomes and sufficient data were available, meta-analysis was performed. Menu labeling with calories alone did not have the intended effect of decreasing calories selected or consumed (-31 kcal [P=0.35] and -13 kcal [P=0.61], respectively).

An experimental study with randomized exposures was conducted that exposed children (5 to 10 years old) to the following conditions: whole or sliced fruit; whole\/sliced fruit, sugar-sweetened snacks (eg, cookies) and flavored salty (eg, nacho cheese-flavored tortilla chips) snacks; and whole\/sliced fruit and less-processed\/unflavored grain snacks (eg, pretzels), during a 2-week period representing 18 snack occasions (morning and afternoon) during summer 2013. The percentage of children who selected snacks, snack consumption, and percent of serving wasted were calculated and analyzed using repeated-measures analyses of variance with Bonferroni adjustments. A total of 1,053 observations were made. Sliced fruit was selected more than whole fruit across all conditions. Fruit (sliced or whole) was seldom selected when served simultaneously with sugar-sweetened (6% vs 58%) and flavored salty (6% vs 38%) snacks or unflavored grain snacks (23% vs 64%). More children consumed 100% of the sugar-sweetened (89%) and flavored salty (82%) snacks compared with fruit (71%); 100% consumption was comparable between fruit (59%) and unflavored grain snacks (49%). Approximately 15% to 47% of fruit was wasted, compared with 8% to 38% of sugar-sweetened, flavored salty, and unflavored grain snacks. Snack policies that encourage out-of-school-time programs to serve fruit require clear language that limits offering less-healthful snack options simultaneously.","1644":"Although dietary counseling is generally recommended in children with food allergy (FA), its effect on the nutritional status of these patients has not yet been evaluated. Our nonrandomized multicenter prospective intervention study was undertaken to investigate the effects of dietary counseling on children with FA. Anthropometric data, dietary intakes, and laboratory biomarkers of nutritional status were evaluated in children with FA (aged 6 to 36 months) before and after dietary counseling, by multidisciplinary teams composed of pediatricians, dietitians, and nurses. Ninety-one children with FA (49 boys and 42 girls; mean age 18.9 months, 95% CI 16.5 to 21.3) were evaluated; 66 children without FA (41 boys and 25 girls; mean age 20.3 months, 95% CI 17.7 to 22.8) served as controls providing baseline values only. At enrollment, energy and protein intakes were lower in children with FA (91 kcal\/kg\/day, interquartile range [IQR]=15.1, minimum=55.2, maximum=130.6; and 2.2 g\/kg\/day, IQR=0.5, minimum=1.5, maximum=2.7, respectively) than in children without FA (96 kcal\/kg\/day, IQR=6.1, minimum=83.6, maximum=118.0; and 4.6 g\/kg\/day, IQR=1.2, minimum=2.0, maximum=6.1, respectively; P&lt;0.001). A weight to length ratio &lt;2 standard deviations was more frequent in children with FA than in children without FA (21% vs 3%; P&lt;0.001). At 6 months following dietary counseling, the total energy intake of children with FA was similar to the baseline values of control children. Dietary counseling also resulted in a significant improvement of their anthropometric and laboratory biomarkers of nutritional status.

Our study sought to determine whether parent report of food refusal based on the characteristics of food was greater in children with ASD than in typically developing children, associated with a greater percentage of foods refused of those offered, and associated with fruit and vegetable intake. A modified food frequency questionnaire was used to determine overall food refusal as well as fruit and vegetable intake. Parent-reported food refusal related to characteristics of food (eg, texture\/consistency, temperature, brand, color, shape, taste\/smell, foods mixed together, or foods touching other foods) was compared between 53 children with ASD and 58 typically developing children aged 3 to 11 years in the Children's Activity and Meal Patterns Study (2007-2008). Children with ASD were significantly more likely to refuse foods based on texture\/consistency (77.4% vs 36.2%), taste\/smell (49.1% vs 5.2%), mixtures (45.3% vs 25.9%), brand (15.1% vs 1.7%), and shape (11.3% vs 1.7%). No differences between groups were found for food refusal based on temperature, foods touching other foods, or color. Irrespective of ASD status, the percentage of foods refused of those offered was associated with parent reports of food refusal based on all characteristics examined, except temperature. Food refusal based on color was inversely associated with vegetable consumption in both groups. Routine screening for food refusal among children with ASD is warranted to prevent dietary inadequacies that may be associated with selective eating habits. Future research is needed to develop effective and practical feeding approaches for children with ASD.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 40 overweight\/obese adolescent participants (22.5% male, 77.5% female, mean age=15.43 years) and their parents (n=38) who visited a referral-only adolescent clinic for the first time from October 2009 to March 2010. Adolescents were randomly assigned by a research assistant to standard care alone or standard care plus DVD. Standard care (protocol-driven medical and nutritional assessment and counseling) was provided to all adolescents by a registered dietitian nutritionist and physician or nurse practitioner. Adolescents in the intervention group also viewed the DVD. Adolescents and parents completed assessments pre- and post-clinic visit. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to evaluate group differences, while controlling for race\/ethnicity and age. Parents who viewed the DVD experienced greater improvements in obesity-related disease knowledge than parents who did not view the DVD. Adolescents in both groups improved on measures of motivation to lose weight and dieting self-efficacy, based on pre and post-test questionnaires. A 7-minute educational and motivational DVD helped improve parent knowledge, but was not more powerful than standard care alone in changing other weight-related outcomes in this adolescent clinic. Because it led to increased parental knowledge, incorporating the DVD into clinical practice could also allow more time for health providers to focus on specific obesity-related treatment\/education.

The review was guided by theoretical consideration of the type of incentive used based on the principles of operant conditioning. There was further examination of whether studies were carried out with an institutional focus. Studies published between 2006 and 2012 were selected for review, and data were extracted regarding study population, intervention design, outcome measures, study duration and follow-up, and key findings. Twelve studies meeting selection criteria were reviewed, with 11 finding a positive association between incentives and dietary behavior change in the short term. All studies pointed to more specific information on the type, timing, and magnitude of incentives needed to motivate individuals to change behavior, the types of incentives and disincentives most likely to affect the behavior of various socioeconomic groups, and promising approaches for potential policy and practice innovations. Limitations of the studies are noted, including the lack of theoretical guidance in the selection of incentive structures and the absence of basic experimental data. Future research should consider these factors, even as policy makers and practitioners continue to experiment with this potentially useful approach to addressing obesity.","1656":null,"1657":"Little is known regarding the number of 24-hour recalls required to rank-order children and adolescents on usual intake for diet-disease studies.

Cross-sectional survey. Children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 years participating in the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Variance ratios for predefined sex, age (children age 6 to 11 years, adolescents age 12 to 17 years), and racial\/ethnic groups (Mexican American\/Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white). Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate within- and between-individual variance components for selected nutrients. The number of 24-hour recalls required to rank-order participants on usual intake (absolute values and energy-adjusted) was obtained from the nutrient variance ratios for various levels of accuracy. Variance ratios were more than 1 for all nutrients examined. High values (variance ratio &gt;3) were observed for protein, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and several micronutrients. Variance ratios for absolute nutrient intakes were similar for both sexes within age groups, but higher for children than for adolescents. A total of six to nine and three to six 24-hour recalls were typically sufficient to rank-order children and adolescents, respectively, on usual intake with an accuracy of r=0.8. Additional recalls were required to achieve the same accuracy for energy-adjusted nutrients. Variance ratios were similar for adolescents across racial\/ethnic groups, but highly variable in children. A total of six to nine 24-hour recalls may represent a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and participant burden for rank-ordering nutrient intakes in children and adolescents.

Moreover, characterizing gene-diet interactions is a research challenge to establish dietary recommendations to individuals with higher predisposition to obesity. Our objective was to analyze the association between an obesity GRS and body mass index (BMI) in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) population, focusing on gene-diet interactions with total fat and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake, and to replicate findings in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) population. Cross-sectional analyses included 783 white US participants from GOLDN and 2,035 from MESA. Dietary intakes were estimated with validated food frequency questionnaires. Height and weight were measured. A weighted GRS was calculated on the basis of 63 obesity-associated variants. Multiple linear regression models adjusted by potential confounders were used to examine gene-diet interactions between dietary intake (total fat and SFA) and the obesity GRS in determining BMI. Significant interactions were found between total fat intake and the obesity GRS using these variables as continuous for BMI (P for interaction=0.010, 0.046, and 0.002 in GOLDN, MESA, and meta-analysis, respectively). These association terms were stronger when assessing interactions between SFA intake and GRS for BMI (P for interaction=0.005, 0.018, and &lt;0.001 in GOLDN, MESA, and meta-analysis, respectively). SFA intake interacts with an obesity GRS in modulating BMI in two US populations.

Here we document vegetable output and cost savings of community gardens in the city of San Jose, CA, to better understand the capacity of community gardens to affect food affordability in an urban setting. A convenience sample of 83 community gardeners in San Jose completed a background survey during spring and summer 2012. On average, gardeners were aged 57 years and had a monthly income of $4,900; 25% had completed college. A representative subset of 10 gardeners was recruited to weigh vegetable output of their plots using portable electronic scales at three separate garden sites. Accuracy of each portable scale was verified by comparing the weight of a sample vegetable to weights obtained using a lab scale precise to 0.2 oz. Garden yields and cost savings were tabulated overall for each plot. Results indicate that community garden practices are more similar to biointensive high-production farming, producing 0.75 lb vegetables\/sq ft, rather than conventional agricultural practices, producing 0.60 lb\/sq ft. Gardens produced on average 2.55 lb\/plant and saved $435 per plot for the season. Results indicate that cost savings are greatest if vertical high value crops such as tomatoes and peppers are grown in community gardens, although yields depend on growing conditions, gardener's skill, availability of water, and other factors.

We aimed to test the reliability and validity of digital imaging (DI) and digital imaging with observation (DI+O) in assessing children's FV consumption during school lunch. FV consumption (in grams) was assessed on lunch trays from third- to fifth-grade children over eight visits (31 to 68 trays collected per visit) to compare WPW with DI and DI+O. Two elementary schools (327 and 631 students enrolled, respectively). Interobserver reliability of DI. Validity of DI and DI+O compared against WPW. Reliability was assessed by percent agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Validity was assessed by Pearson correlations, paired t tests, and Bland-Altman plots. Reliability was acceptable for DI; percent agreement was 96% and the ICC was 0.92. FV consumption assessments by DI and WPW (n=159) were highly correlated (r=0.96; P&lt;0.001). Mean FV consumption using DI (96.7 g) was within 1.0 g of WPW and not significantly different from WPW (P=0.56), and Bland-Altman limits of agreement for individual-tray FV consumption were -32.9 to 31.3 g.

Mean FV consumption using DI+O (99.3 g) was within 1.0 g of WPW and not significantly different from WPW (P=0.38), and limits of agreement for individual-tray FV consumption were -25.0 to 26.8 g. DI was reliable for assessing children's FV consumption during school lunch. DI and DI+O were valid for assessing mean consumption but less precise for estimating individual-tray consumption.

However, it is unknown whether these dimensions are compatible, and no guidance is available in the official recommendations. To identify foods with compatible sustainability dimensions. For 363 of the most commonly consumed foods in the Second French Individual and National Study on Food Consumption, environmental impact indicators (ie, greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions, acidification, and eutrophication), and prices were collected. The nutritional quality of the foods was assessed by calculating the score for the nutritional adequacy of individual foods (SAIN) to score for disqualifying nutrients (LIM) ratio. A sustainability score based on the median GHG emissions, price, and SAIN:LIM was calculated for each food; the foods with the best values for all three variables received the highest score. The environmental indicators were strongly and positively correlated. Meat, fish, and eggs and dairy products had the strongest influence on the environment; starchy foods, legumes, and fruits and vegetables had the least influence. GHG emissions were inversely correlated with SAIN:LIM (r=-0.37) and positively correlated with price per kilogram (r=0.59); the correlation with price per kilocalorie was null. This showed that foods with a heavy environmental impact tend to have lower nutritional quality and a higher price per kilogram but not a lower price per kilocalorie. Using price per kilogram, 94 foods had a maximum sustainability score, including most plant-based foods and excluding all foods with animal ingredients except milk, yogurt, and soups. Using price per kilocalorie restricted the list to 42 foods, including 52% of all starchy foods and legumes but only 11% of fruits and vegetables (mainly 100% fruit juices).

In this cross-sectional study, child-care providers (n=118) from 24 center-based programs (six Head Start [HS], 11 Child and Adult Care Food Program [CACFP] funded, and seven non-CACFP) completed self-administered surveys during 2011-2012. Multilevel multivariate linear regression models were used to predict seven feeding practices. Working in an HS center predicted teaching children about nutrition and modeling healthy eating; that may be attributed to the HS performance standards that require HS providers to practice healthful feeding. Providers who reported being concerned about children's weight, being responsible for feeding children, and had an authoritarian feeding style were more likely to pressure children to eat, restrict intake, and control food intake to decrease or maintain children's weight. Providers with nonwhite race, who were trying to lose weight, who perceived nutrition as important in their own diet, and who had a greater number of nutrition training opportunities were more likely to use restrictive feeding practices. These findings suggest that individual- and child-care-level factors, particularly provider race, education, training, feeding attitudes and styles, and the child-care context may influence providers' feeding practices with young children.

In the CT intervention, higher optimism was associated with higher AHEI at baseline and with greater change over 1 year (P=0.001). Effect modification by intervention status was observed (P=0.014), whereas control participants with highest optimism achieved threefold greater AHEI increase compared with those with the lowest optimism.

Issues of sustainability and resilience apply to all aspects of nutrition and dietetics practice, can be practiced at both the program and systems level, and are broader than any one specific practice setting or individual intervention. Given an increasing need to apply principles of sustainability and resilience to nutrition and dietetics practice, as well as growing interest among the public and by Registered Dietitian Nutritionists of health issues related to food and water systems, the Hunger and Environmental Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group, with guidance from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Management Committee, has developed the Standards of Professional Performance as a tool for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists working in sustainable, resilient, and healthy food and water systems to assess their current skill levels and to identify areas for further professional development in this emerging practice area. This Standards of Professional Performance document covers six standards of professional performance: quality in practice, competence and accountability, provision of services, application of research, communication and application of knowledge, and utilization and management of resources. Within each standard, specific indicators provide measurable action statements that illustrate how sustainable, resilient, and healthy food and water systems principles can be applied to practice. The indicators describe three skill levels (competent, proficient, and expert) for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists working in sustainable, resilient, and healthy food and water systems.

Twelve sex-specific focus groups were held in English or Spanish in 2012. Qualitative analysis informed by grounded theory examined parenting styles (ie, authoritative, authoritarian, or permissive), barriers to healthy lifestyle, and parents' stage of change about healthy lifestyles. One third of the 33 participating couples were born in Mexico. The majority of mothers and fathers described being permissive and allowing unhealthy food choices, and a minority of mothers reported more authoritarian approaches to promoting a healthier diet for their children. Mothers were more permissive than fathers about family physical activities and less engaged in these activities. Most mothers and fathers described only contemplating a healthier diet and more physical activity, while wanting their children to have a healthier lifestyle. These data suggest that clinicians need to assess and address differential parental roles when promoting a healthy lifestyle for children. Clinicians should also adopt culturally competent approaches to overcome barriers to parental engagement in diverse aspects of a healthy family lifestyle.

However, current recommendations on initial energy requirements for this population are inconsistent, with a clear lack of empirical evidence. Thus, the aim of our study was to systematically review, assess, and summarize the available evidence on the effect of differing nutrition therapies prescribed during refeeding on weight restoration in hospitalized children and adolescents (aged 19 years and younger) with diagnosed AN. Searches were conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health (CABI), PubMed, and the Cochrane database for articles published in English up to May 2012, and complemented by a search of the reference lists of key publications. Seven observational studies investigating a total of 403 inpatients satisfied the inclusion criteria. The range of prescribed energy intakes varied from 1,000 kcal to &gt;1,900 kcal\/day with a progressive increase during the course of hospitalization. It appeared that additional tube feeding increased the maximum energy intake and led to greater interim or discharge weight; however, this was also associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects. Overall, the level of available evidence was poor, and therefore consensus on the most effective and safe treatment for weight restoration in inpatient children and adolescents with AN is not currently feasible.

Formative evaluation strategies consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data helped to refine the parent feeding guide Eat Healthy, Your Children are Watching, A Parent's Guide to Raising a Healthy Eater. An interdisciplinary planning team developed a five-topic, multimedia, interactive guide addressing the strategies most associated with improved diet quality and weight status of children aged 3 to 5 years. Research staff conducted iterative phases of field testing, reformatting, in-depth interviews, and materials testing with Head Start or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education caregivers (N=38) of children aged 3 to 5 years during 2011 and 2012. Convergence of feedback from caregivers' interviews and each booklet's attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction subscale scores were used to determine and affirm areas for improvement. Lower than desired attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction scores (optimal score=5) in 2011 and too much text resulted in revisions and reformatting that improved scores from 3.8 to 4.9 in 2012. The revision of materials to reflect less text, additional white space, checklists of mealtime behaviors, and learning activities for preschool-aged children resulted in dramatically improved materials and greater acceptance by parents, as shown by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

The purpose of this study was to use the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to inform the design of a UCD application in a qualitative study that sought to determine parental views on how technology can support previously learned behaviors that require ongoing management and support beyond formal lifestyle interventions. Parents of overweight and obese adolescents (n=14) were interviewed about perceived usefulness and planned user-intent of CHT that was designed for adolescents. UTAUT provided theoretical parental constructs (intention, performance and effort expectancy, and social influence) interactions within several socio-ecological contexts, including the home food environment and restaurant dining experiences.

Participants were 40 men and 34 women, aged 18 to 69 years, living in the Columbus, OH, area. Intakes of energy, macronutrients, and 17 micronutrients\/food components were estimated from the GraFFS and the mean of all recalls. Bias (second GraFFS minus recalls) was -9%, -5%, +4%, and -4% for energy and percentages of energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively. De-attenuated, energy-adjusted correlations (intermethod reliability) between the recalls and the second GraFFS for fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol were 0.82, 0.79, 0.67, and 0.90, respectively; for micronutrients\/food components the median was 0.61 and ranged from 0.40 for zinc to 0.92 for beta carotene.

To help tailor strategies for meeting recommendations, it is important to know what foods contribute greatly to micronutrient intakes. Data are lacking on specific contributions made by added nutrients. Our aims were to examine the impact of fortification on nutrient adequacy and excess among US children and adolescents and to rank food sources of added nutrient intake and compare rankings with those based on total nutrient intake from foods. Data were from 7,250 respondents 2 to 18 years old in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. Datasets were developed that distinguished nutrient sources: intrinsic nutrients in foods; added nutrients in foods; foods (intrinsic plus added nutrients); and total diet (foods plus supplements). The National Cancer Institute method was used to determine usual intakes of micronutrients by source. The impact of fortification on the percentages of children having intakes less than the Estimated Average Requirement and more than the Upper Tolerable Intake Level was assessed by comparing intakes from intrinsic nutrients to intakes from intrinsic plus added nutrients. Specific food sources of micronutrients were determined as sample-weighted mean intakes of total and added nutrients contributed from 56 food groupings. The percentage of intake from each grouping was determined separately for total and added nutrients. Without added nutrients, a high percentage of all children\/adolescents had inadequate intakes of numerous micronutrients, with the greatest inadequacy among older girls. Fortification reduced the percentage less than the Estimated Average Requirement for many, although not all, micronutrients without resulting in excessive intakes. Data demonstrated the powerful influence of fortification on food-source rankings. Knowledge about nutrient intakes and sources can help put dietary advice into a practical context.

Registered dietitian nutritionists need basic competency in genetics as a foundation for understanding nutritional genomics; proficiency requires advanced knowledge and skills. Unlike single-gene defects in which a mutation in a single gene results in a specific disorder, most chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer are multigenetic and multifactorial and therefore genetic mutations are only partially predictive of disease risk. Family history, biochemical parameters, and the presence of risk factors in individuals are relevant tools for personalizing dietary interventions. Direct-to-consumer genetic testing is not closely regulated in the United States and may not be accompanied by access to health care practitioners. Applying nutritional genomics in clinical practice through the use of genetic testing requires that registered dietitian nutritionists understand, interpret, and communicate complex test results in which the actual risk of developing a disease may not be known.

All statistical analyses accounted for the complex sampling design effect and used appropriate sample weights. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% CIs for metabolic syndrome across quintiles of dietary carbohydrate intake. After controlling for potential confounding variables, the determinants of metabolic syndrome were the percentage of energy from carbohydrates in men and intakes of refined grains, including white rice, in women. Triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose levels were associated with the percentage of energy from carbohydrates in men and white rice intake in women. Our findings suggest that the sources and types of carbohydrates were differentially associated with metabolic syndrome according to sex in the Korean adult population. The percentage of energy from carbohydrates in men and intake of refined grains, including white rice, in women were associated with metabolic syndrome.

In the 2005-2007 Infant Feeding Practices Study II, women completed questionnaires from the last trimester of pregnancy until 12 months postpartum. Mothers indicated prenatally their family members' and health care providers' opinion on how newborns should be fed: breastfed only, formula fed only, breast and formula fed, or no opinion\/don't know. Breastfeeding initiation was determined by asking mothers around 4 weeks postpartum (n=2,041) whether they ever breastfed. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between mothers' perception of family members' and health care providers' opinion on how to feed the infant and the initiation of breastfeeding, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Nearly 14% of mothers surveyed did not initiate breastfeeding. Mothers who believed their family members or health care providers preferred breastfeeding only were least likely not to initiate breastfeeding. Never breastfeeding was significantly associated with the following perceptions: the infant's father (odds ratio [OR]=110.4; 95% CI 52.0 to 234.4) or maternal grandmother (OR=15.9; 95% CI 7.0 to 36.0) preferred only formula feeding; the infant's father (OR=3.2; 95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) or doctor (OR=2.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 6.2) preferred both breast and formula feeding; and the infant's father (OR=7.6; 95% CI 4.5 to 12.7), maternal grandmother (OR=5.4; 95% CI 2.6 to 11.0), or doctor (OR=1.9; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.7) had no opinion\/didn't know their feeding preference.

Federal food assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), are an important source of healthy food for low-income populations. In 2009, as part of a nationwide policy revision, WIC added a fruit and vegetable (F\/V) voucher to WIC food packages. This quasi-experimental study determined whether F\/V prices at stores authorized to accept WIC (ie, WIC vendors) decreased after the policy revision in seven Illinois counties. It also examined cross-sectional F\/V price variations by store type and neighborhood characteristics. Two pre-policy observations were conducted in 2008 and 2009; one post-policy observation was conducted in 2010. Small pre- to post-policy reductions in some F\/V prices were found, particularly for canned fruit and frozen vegetables at small stores. Compared with chain supermarkets, mass merchandise stores had lower prices for fresh F\/V and frozen F\/V and small stores and non-chain supermarkets had higher canned and frozen F\/V prices, but lower fresh F\/V prices. Limited price differences were found across neighborhoods, although canned vegetables were more expensive in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of either Hispanics or blacks and fresh F\/V prices were lower in neighborhoods with more Hispanics. Results suggest the WIC policy revision contributed to modest reductions in F\/V prices. WIC participants' purchasing power can differ depending on the type and neighborhood of the WIC vendor used.","1785":null,"1786":null,"1787":"High-protein (&gt;30% of energy from protein or &gt;1.2 g\/kg\/day) and moderately high-protein (22% to 29% of energy from protein or 1.0 to 1.2 g\/kg\/day) diets are popular for weight loss, but the effect of dietary protein on bone during weight loss is not well understood. Protein may help preserve bone mass during weight loss by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1, a potent bone anabolism stimulator, and increasing intestinal calcium absorption. Protein-induced acidity is considered to have minimal effect on bone resorption in adults with normal kidney function.

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2006), this study examined whether breast cancer survivors and women with no history of cancer differed in the distribution of usual intake of foods included in the dietary recommendations for preventing cancer and recurrences. Participants completed one or two 24-hour dietary recalls. The food groups included in this analysis were whole fruit; total vegetables; dark green and orange vegetables; whole grains; red meat; processed meat; alcohol; and calories from solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar. The National Cancer Institute Method was used to estimate the distribution of usual intake and to compare breast cancer survivors (n=102) to noncancer respondents (n=2,684). Using age and cancer survivor as covariates, subgroup estimates of usual intake were constructed. No significant group differences were found, except that survivors reported a greater intake of whole grains. More than 90% of both groups did not meet recommendations for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; 75.4% and 70.2%, respectively, consumed less than the red meat recommendation; and &lt;10% of either group met the recommendation for percent energy from solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar.

The main objective of our study was to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of an electronic and a manual paper-based system for capturing the Nutrition Care Process and IDNT in a single in-center hemodialysis unit. A cohort of 56 adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were followed for 12 months. During the first 6 months, patients received the usual standard care, with documentation via a manual paper-based system. During the following 6-month period (Months 7 to 12), nutrition care was documented by an electronic system. Workload efficiency, number of IDNT codes used related to nutrition-related diagnoses, interventions, monitoring and evaluation using IDNT, nutritional status using the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Tool of Quality of Life were the main outcome measures. Compared with paper-based documentation of nutrition care, our study demonstrated that an electronic system improved the efficiency of total time spent by the dietitian by 13 minutes per consultation. There were also a greater number of nutrition-related diagnoses resolved using the electronic system compared with the paper-based documentation (P&lt;0.001).

Dietary intake was recorded using 3-day dietary recall. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to compare the dietary intakes of groups (ie, parent, sex, and couple days) over time. Percentage of participants per group meeting recommended daily dietary guidelines was also analyzed, as were variables that influenced meeting overall recommended guidelines using a multivariate analysis of variance. First-time mothers had higher overall energy, fat, sugar, fruit, and milk intake compared with women without children, and longitudinally first-time mothers decreased their fruit intake. Second-time mothers had higher overall energy, fat, sugar, and fruit intake compared with nonparent women, and longitudinally second-time mothers increased their meat intake. First-time fathers had overall higher bread intake compared with second-time fathers and men without children, and first-time fathers consumed less sugar than second-time fathers. Longitudinally, first-time fathers increased their fiber intake. At any stage of data collection, from pregnancy to 12-months postpartum, only 2% to 16% of all mothers met recommended overall daily dietary guidelines.

This study examined the difference in daily sodium intake according to self-reported taste preference for miso soup as representative of homemade cooking in middle-aged urban Japanese adults. Among 896 candidates randomly selected from examinees of cancer screening provided by the National Cancer Center, Japan, 143 men and women participated in this cross-sectional study. During the period from May 2007 through April 2008, participants provided a food frequency questionnaire, which included information on taste preference and dietary behaviors, a weighed food record over 4 consecutive days, a simultaneous 24-hour urine collection, and a sample of miso soup as it is usually prepared in the home. Mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and daily sodium intake were compared according to the self-reported taste preference for miso soup. Taste preference was significantly associated with both 24-hour urinary sodium excretion (trend P&lt;0.01) and daily sodium intake (trend P=0.01), with a corresponding regression coefficient per 1 rank preference increment of 403 mg and 315 mg\/day, respectively. The observed association between preference and urinary excretion was attenuated by further adjustment for discretionary salt-related behaviors. These findings suggest that self-reported taste preference for homemade cooking is a defining feature of daily sodium intake through discretionary salt-related dietary behaviors. A reduction in daily sodium consumption per 1 rank light preference was estimated to equate to approximately 1 g salt\/day.

Children in lower-income households are at higher risk for obesity, but there is little information about their mothers' perceptions of family meals, and such information could improve nutrition counseling. To identify the perceived benefits and challenges of having family meals, four focus groups were conducted with 20 mothers of preschool-aged children living in low-income households in Philadelphia, PA. Three authors independently analyzed verbatim transcripts using an inductive method of open coding, and themes were established by consensus among all authors. Of the 20 mothers, 18 were black, 11 had education beyond high school, and 12 were living with an adult partner or husband. Mothers' strong childhood memories of mealtimes, both negative and positive, motivated them to have family meals because of the opportunities afforded by mealtimes to build strong relationships with their children. However, mothers also described needing help, especially from other household adults, in preparing meals and establishing calm and order with their children during mealtimes. To identify what motivates the mothers of low-income, preschool-aged children to have family meals, registered dietitians can benefit from asking about the mothers' own childhood experiences of family meals.

To describe sustainability of dietary changes over 9 years in the Diabetes Prevention Program and its outcomes study, the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, among participants receiving the intensive lifestyle intervention. One thousand seventy-nine participants were enrolled in the intensive lifestyle intervention arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program; 910 continued participation in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study. Fat and energy intake derived from food frequency questionnaires at baseline and post-randomization Years 1 and 9 were examined. Parsimonious models determined whether baseline characteristics and intensive lifestyle intervention session participation predicted sustainability. Self-reported energy intake was reduced from a median of 1,876 kcal\/day (interquartile range [IQR]=1,452 to 2,549 kcal\/day) at baseline to 1,520 kcal\/day (IQR=1,192 to 1,986 kcal\/day) at Year 1, and 1,560 kcal\/day (IQR=1,223 to 2,026 kcal\/day) at Year 9. Dietary fat was reduced from a median of 70.4 g (IQR=49.3 to 102.5 g) to 45 g (IQR=32.2 to 63.8 g) at Year 1 and increased to 61.0 g (IQR=44.6 to 82.7 g) at Year 9. Percent energy from fat was reduced from a median of 34.4% (IQR=29.6% to 38.5%) to 27.1% (IQR=23.1% to 31.5%) at Year 1 but increased to 35.3% (IQR=29.7% to 40.2%) at Year 9. Lower baseline energy intake and Year 1 dietary reduction predicted lower energy and fat gram intake at Year 9. Higher leisure physical activity predicted lower fat gram intake but not energy intake. Intensive lifestyle intervention can result in reductions in total energy intake for up to 9 years.

In addition, this study examined associations of family breakfast meal frequency with dietary quality and weight status. Cross-sectional data from EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) included anthropometric assessments and classroom-administered surveys completed in 2009-2010. Participants included 2,793 middle and high school students (53.2% girls, mean age=14.4 years) from Minneapolis\/St Paul, MN, public schools. Usual dietary intake was self-reported on a food frequency questionnaire. Height and weight were measured. Regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, family dinner frequency, family functioning, and family cohesion were used to examine associations of family breakfast frequency with dietary quality and weight status. On average, adolescents reported having family breakfast meals 1.5 times (standard deviation=2.1) and family dinner meals 4.1 times (standard deviation=2.6) in the past week. There were racial\/ethnic differences in family breakfast frequency, with the highest frequencies reported by adolescents of black, Hispanic, Native American, and mixed race\/ethnicity. Family breakfast frequency was also positively associated with male sex, younger age, and living in a two-parent household. Family breakfast frequency was associated with several markers of better diet quality (such as higher intake of fruit, whole grains, and fiber) and lower risk for overweight\/obesity. For example, adolescents who reported seven family breakfasts in the past week consumed an average of 0.37 additional daily fruit servings compared with adolescents who never had a family breakfast meal.

There are multiple methods used for measuring food waste, yet it is unclear which method is most appropriate in large-scale interventions with restricted resources. This study examines which of three visual tray waste measurement methods is most reliable, accurate, and cost-effective compared with the gold standard of individually weighing leftovers. School cafeteria researchers used the following three visual methods to capture tray waste in addition to actual food waste weights for 197 lunch trays: the quarter-waste method, the half-waste method, and the photograph method. Inter-rater and inter-method reliability were highest for on-site visual methods (0.90 for the quarter-waste method and 0.83 for the half-waste method) and lowest for the photograph method (0.48). This low reliability is partially due to the inability of photographs to determine whether packaged items (such as milk or yogurt) are empty or full. In sum, the quarter-waste method was the most appropriate for calculating accurate amounts of tray waste, and the photograph method might be appropriate if researchers only wish to detect significant differences in waste or consumption of selected, unpackaged food.

Participants were urban women (n=330) who qualified for a food and nutrition assistance program. Data collection occurred at sites within the community, including homeless shelters, food pantries, libraries, and community centers. The outcome of interest was BMI and the relationship to environmental, personal, and behavioral constructs, and food-related self-identity. All three SCT construct models were significant, but the personal construct regression model predicted the greatest variance in BMI among the women (31%). Decreased BMI was associated with SCT and self-identity variables indicating preventative behaviors, while increased BMI was associated with SCT and self-identity emotional eating variables. Overall results suggest that personal, behavioral, and self-identity factors can help to explain some weight variation observed among women living in similar obesogenic, low-income environments.

In 1986, 74,194 women aged 40 to 65 years in the NHS and 50,497 men aged 40 to 75 years in the HPFS were included. Use of dietary supplements including multivitamins, vitamins, and minerals was repeatedly asked every 4 years. Generalized estimating equation models were used for repeated analysis. Prevalence of use of any supplement increased among both women (71.3% to 88.3%) and men (56.4% to 80.7%) from 1986 to 2006. Notably, longitudinal increases in the prevalence of use of vitamin D (2.2% to 32.2% for women and 1.1% to 6.7% for men), folic acid (0.8% to 10.7% for women and 1.1% to 13.8% for men), and fish oil (1.6% to 18.1% for women and 3.3% to 22.2% for men) supplements were observed from 1990 to 2006. However, the use of vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E supplements peaked in 1994 or 1998, then declined steadily. A secular increase in use of multivitamins, vitamin D, folic acid, and fish oil across same age group was noted. In conclusion, the use of many types of dietary supplements has increased over time, but the use of antioxidant supplements has declined. The secular increase in the prevalence of use of supplements across the same age group suggests that aging of the population is not the primary reason for the increase. These findings in health professionals need to be replicated in the general populations.

All of them were university graduates (alumni) (59.6% women, mean age 38 years). Usual diet was assessed at baseline with a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Deaths were confirmed by review of medical records and of the National Death Index. Dietary patterns were ascertained through a factor (principal component) analysis based on 30 predefined food groups. Participants were classified according to tertiles of adherence to the three main dietary patterns identified with factor analysis. Cox regression models were fitted to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and 95% CIs for mortality. Three major dietary patterns were identified.

Our randomized controlled study aimed to test the efficacy and acceptability of mailed materials giving instructions on taste exposure as a means of increasing acceptance of vegetables in preschool-aged children. Participants were families of 3-year-old twins from the Gemini cohort who took part between March 2011 and April 2012. Families were randomized to a mailed intervention or a no treatment control condition. The intervention involved offering each child 14 daily tastes of a disliked (target) vegetable with a small reward (a sticker) if the child complied. Outcomes were the child's intake of the target vegetable (number of pieces) and parent reports of the child's liking at two baseline (T1 and T2) and one postintervention (T3) behavior assessment. Record sheets with intake and liking data from T1, T2, and T3 were returned for 472 children, of which 442 were complete (94%).

Meeting zero or one out of five of the Healthy Diet Score components was associated with increased risk of weight gain over 4 years compared with meeting at least two components (P=0.03). With the exception of dietary criteria, prevalence was high for achieving ideal levels of the remaining six cardiovascular health metrics. In conclusion, in this sample of young adults, a very low prevalence of ideal overall cardiovascular health was observed, mainly driven by poor dietary habits, and a poor Healthy Diet Score was associated with increased weight gain.

The purpose of this study was to determine which nutrition-related risk index predicts mortality better in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. This prospective, multicenter study involved noncritically ill patients who were prescribed total parenteral nutrition. Data were collected on Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Nutritional Risk Index, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index, body mass index, albumin and prealbumin, as well as in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and infectious complications. Of the 605 patients included in the study, 18.8% developed infectious complications and 9.6% died in the hospital. SGA, albumin, Nutritional Risk Index and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index were associated with longer hospital stay. Prealbumin levels were associated with infectious complications. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed (after adjustment for age, sex, C-reactive protein levels, mean blood glucose levels, use of corticoids, prior comorbidity, carbohydrates infused, diagnosis, and infectious complications) that the SGA, Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index, body mass index, albumin, and prealbumin were associated with an increased risk for in-hospital mortality. SGA was the tool that best predicted mortality and adequately discriminated the values of the other nutrition-related risk indexes studied.

This cross-sectional study used data from an online survey to identify factors related to young adults' F\/V purchasing, preparation, and consumption, and to explore between-factor relationships using mediation analysis. In 2010, 1,201 college students in Minnesota completed questionnaires assessing F\/V behaviors as well as perceptions of F\/V-related individual, social, and environmental factors. Factor analysis identified questionnaire items assessing similar constructs. Seven factors were identified (personal barriers, F\/V knowledge, family, friends, neighborhood, access barriers, and campus) and evaluated for relationships with F\/V purchasing, preparation, and consumption using linear regression. Results revealed that perceived personal barriers (eg, lacking cooking skills) were inversely related to all F\/V outcomes. Perception that family and friends eat healthfully and neighborhood access to F\/V were positively related to all outcomes. Individual-, social-, and environment-level perceptions were related to purchasing, preparation, and consumption, and the effects of these factors were similar when accounting for mediated effects. Factors at all three levels and the ways in which these various factors operate together may be important to consider in future efforts to improve F\/V behaviors among young adults.

To evaluate the influence of supplemental calcium and vitamin D on joint symptoms in the Women's Health Initiative randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. In post hoc analyses, the results of the Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trial in which 36,282 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive calcium carbonate (1,000 mg as elemental calcium) with vitamin D-3 (400 IU) daily or placebo were examined in the 6% subgroup of 1,911 participants, oversampled for minorities, who had serial joint symptom assessment. Qualitative information on joint pain and joint swelling was collected by questionnaire before entry and 2 years after randomization. Logistic regression models were used to compare the occurrence and severity of joint symptoms across randomization groups. At baseline, total calcium and vitamin D intakes from diet and supplements were similar in the two randomization groups. In addition, both joint pain (reported by 73%) and joint swelling (reported by 34%) were commonly reported and comparable in the supplement and placebo groups. Two years after randomization, no statistically significant differences between supplement and placebo groups were seen for joint pain frequency (74.6% compared with 75.1% [P=0.79] for supplement and placebo groups, respectively) or joint swelling frequency (34.6% compared with 32.4% [P=0.29], respectively) or in severity scores for either outcome. Subgroup analyses suggested study participants also using nonprotocol calcium supplements at study entry may have less joint pain with supplement group randomization (interaction P=0.02). Joint symptoms are relatively common in postmenopausal women. However, daily supplementation with 1,000 mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU vitamin D-3 in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial setting did not reduce the self-reported frequency or severity of joint symptoms.

This study examined whether attitudes toward healthy eating are independently associated with diet quality among shoppers at low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost supermarkets. Data on socioeconomic status (SES), attitudes toward healthy eating, and supermarket choice were collected using a telephone survey of a representative sample of adult residents of King County, WA. Dietary intake data were based on a food frequency questionnaire. Thirteen supermarket chains were stratified into three categories: low, medium, and high cost, based on a market basket of 100 commonly eaten foods. Diet-quality measures were energy density, mean adequacy ratio, and total servings of fruits and vegetables. The analytical sample consisted of 963 adults. Multivariable regressions with robust standard error examined relations between diet quality, supermarket type, attitudes, and SES. Shopping at higher-cost supermarkets was associated with higher-quality diets. These associations persisted after adjusting for SES, but were eliminated after taking attitudinal measures into account. Supermarket shoppers with positive attitudes toward healthy eating had equally higher-quality diets, even if they shopped at low-, medium-, or high-cost supermarkets, independent of SES and other covariates. These findings imply that shopping at low-cost supermarkets does not prevent consumers from having high-quality diets, as long as they attach importance to good nutrition. Promoting nutrition-education strategies among supermarkets, particularly those catering to low-income groups, can help to improve diet quality.","1847":null,"1848":"Despite the historical rise and recent plateau of child overweight and obesity, levels remain exceedingly high.

The objective of our analysis was to describe 21-year trends in total energy intake and the major food and beverage sources of energy among 2- to 18-year-olds in the United States. Six nationally representative surveys were examined in 2012, the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1989-1991 and 1994-1996, 1998) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010). Total energy intake among US children and adolescents rose considerably from 1989 to 2004, and subsequently declined through 2010. Seven sources were consistently major contributors across all time points: sugar-sweetened beverages, pizza, full-fat milk, grain-based desserts, breads, pasta dishes, and savory snacks. Intakes of full-fat milk, meats and processed meat products, ready-to-eat cereals, burgers, fried potatoes, fruit juice, and vegetables decreased from 1989-2010 whereas intakes of nonfat milk, poultry, sweet snacks and candies, and tortilla- and corn-based dishes increased linearly over the 21-year period. Significant nonlinear time trends were observed with recent decreases in intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages, pizza, pasta dishes, breads and rolls, and savory snacks and recent increases in intake of fruit. Energy intakes of US children began to decline in 2003-2004 and continued to decline through 2009-2010. However, among preschool children (aged 2 to 5 years) and children from low-income families, total energy intakes in 2009-2010 still remained significantly higher than in 1989-1991.

Little information exists on whether overweight children and minorities who do not meet dietary vitamin D recommendations are at risk for low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) status. Vitamin D intake from foods and dietary supplements was estimated in 3,310 children\/adolescents who were examined as part of the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Weight status was dichotomized into healthy weight or overweight\/obese. Parent-reported race\/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other. Adjusted logistic regression was used to determine whether children who did not achieve the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) were at increased risk for inadequate 25OHD. Nearly 75% of children failed to meet the EAR. Overall, not meeting the EAR was associated with inadequate 25OHD (odds ratio=2.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 4.5). However, this association differed by weight status (P=0.02) and race\/ethnicity (P=0.02). Overweight\/obese children who failed to meet the EAR were five times more likely to be at risk for inadequate 25OHD than overweight\/obese children who met it (95% CI 2.0 to 12.7; P&lt;0.001). Non-Hispanic blacks with intakes below the EAR were nearly four times more likely to be at risk for inadequate 25OHD than those who met the EAR (95% CI 1.5 to 9.7; P&lt;0.01).

The prevention and treatment of hospital malnutrition offers a tremendous opportunity to optimize the overall quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Unfortunately, malnutrition continues to go unrecognized and untreated in many hospitalized patients. This article represents a call to action from the interdisciplinary Alliance to Advance Patient Nutrition to highlight the critical role of nutrition intervention in clinical care and to suggest practical ways to promptly diagnose and treat malnourished patients and those at risk for malnutrition. We underscore the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to addressing malnutrition both in the hospital and in the acute post-hospital phase. It is well recognized that malnutrition is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although data vary across studies, available evidence shows that early nutrition intervention can reduce complication rates, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, mortality, and cost of care. The key is to systematically identify patients who are malnourished or at risk and to promptly intervene. We present a novel care model to drive improvement, emphasizing the following six principles: (1) create an institutional culture where all stakeholders value nutrition; (2) redefine clinicians' roles to include nutrition care; (3) recognize and diagnose all malnourished patients and those at risk; (4) rapidly implement comprehensive nutrition interventions and continued monitoring; (5) communicate nutrition care plans; and (6) develop a comprehensive discharge nutrition care and education plan.

The goal of our study was to understand barriers and facilitators to adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for four nutrient-rich food groups in fifth-grade children and unrelated adult caregivers across six sites in a multistate study. A total of 281 unrelated adult caregivers (32% African American, 33% European American, and 35% Hispanic American) and 321 children (33% African American, 33% European American, and 34% Hispanic American) participated in 97 Nominal Group Technique sessions. Nominal Group Technique is a qualitative method of data collection that enables a group to generate and prioritize a large number of issues within a structure that gives everyone an equal voice. The core barriers specific to unrelated adult caregivers were lack of meal preparation skills or recipes (whole grains, fruit, vegetables); difficulty in changing eating habits (whole grains, fruit, vegetables), cost (milk, whole grains, fruit, vegetables), lack of knowledge of recommendation\/portion\/health benefits (milk, vegetables), and taste (milk, whole grains, vegetables). Specific to children, the core barriers were competing foods (ie, soda, junk foods, sugary foods [whole grains, milk, fruit, vegetables]), health concerns (ie, milk allergy\/upset stomach [milk]), taste\/flavor\/smell (milk, whole grains, fruit, vegetables), forget to eat them (vegetables, fruit), and hard to consume or figure out the recommended amount (milk, fruit).

We analyzed 3-day food records of 68 Australian adults using the US-based Nutrition Data System for Research, modified to reflect food items consumed in Australia. Modification entailed identifying a substitute food whose energy and macronutrient content were within 10% of the Australian food or by adding a new food to the database. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare differences in nutrient intakes estimated by both databases, and Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients measured degree of association and agreement between intake estimates for individuals. Median intakes of energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fiber differed by &lt;5% at the group level. Larger discrepancies were seen for fat (11%; P&lt;0.0001) and most micronutrients. Despite strong correlations, nutrient intakes differed by &gt;10% for an appreciable percentage of participants (35% for energy to 69% for total fat).

For each level of matching, researchers calculated sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPVs) for the business list overall and by broad business categories: General Grocers (eg, supermarkets), Specialty Food Stores (eg, produce markets), Restaurants, and Businesses Not Primarily Selling Food (eg, newsstands). Even after cleaning the business list (eg, for cases of multiple listings at a single location), and allowing for inexactness in listed street addresses and spellings of business names, the overall performance of the business list was poor. For strict matches, the business list had an overall sensitivity of 39.3% and PPV of 45.5%. Sensitivities and PPVs by broad business categories were not meaningfully different from overall values, although sensitivity for General Grocers and PPV for Specialty Food Stores were particularly low: 26.2% and 32%, respectively. For lenient matches, sensitivities and PPVs were somewhat higher but still poor: 52.4% to 60% and 60% to 75%, respectively. The business list is inadequate to measure the actual food environment in the Bronx.

In Experiment 1, the herb-flavored dip was preferred over the plain dip (P&lt;0.01), and children were three times more likely to reject the vegetable alone, compared with eating the vegetable paired with an herb dip (P&lt;0.001). In Experiment 2, children ate significantly more of a previously rejected or disliked vegetable (celery and squash) when offered with a preferred reduced-fat herb dip than when the vegetable was served alone (P&lt;0.05). These findings suggest that offering vegetables with reduced-fat dips containing familiar herb and spice flavors can increase tasting and thereby promote liking, acceptance, and consumption of vegetables, including vegetables previously rejected or disliked.

Registered dietitians (RDs) should work collaboratively as part of the interprofessional team to make recommendations on providing, withdrawing, or withholding nutrition and hydration in individual cases and serve as active members of institutional ethics committees. RDs have an active role in determining the nutrition and hydration requirements for individuals throughout the life span. When individuals choose to forgo any type of nutrition and hydration (natural or artificial), or when individuals lack decision-making capacity and others must decide whether or not to provide artificial nutrition and hydration, RDs have a professional role in the ethical deliberation around those decisions. Across the life span, there are multiple instances when nutrition and hydration issues create ethical dilemmas. There is strong clinical, ethical, and legal support both for and against the administration of food and water when issues arise regarding what is or is not wanted by the individual and what is or is not warranted by empirical clinical evidence. When a conflict arises, the decision requires ethical deliberation. RDs' understanding of nutrition and hydration within the context of nutritional requirements and cultural, social, psychological, and spiritual needs provide an essential basis for ethical deliberation. RDs, as health care team members, have the responsibility to promote use of advanced directives. RDs promote the rights of the individual and help the health care team implement appropriate therapy.

Scientific and epidemiological data suggest a lifelong synergy between diet, nutrition, and integrity of the oral cavity in health and disease. Oral health and nutrition have a multifaceted relationship. Oral infectious diseases, as well as acute, chronic, and systemic diseases with oral manifestations, impact an individual's functional ability to eat and their nutrition status.

This article describes a data processing step that impacts sodium intake estimates, reasons for discontinuing the step, and implications of its discontinuation. This step, termed salt adjustment, was performed in US Department of Agriculture (USDA) dietary intake surveys from 1985 through 2008. In What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the salt content of specific foods was reduced on the basis of a question about household use of salt in cooking. For individuals whose households used salt in cooking occasionally or less often, some or all of the salt attributable to home preparation was removed from foods that typically have salt added during preparation and were obtained from the store. The growing availability of preprepared foods in stores challenges the validity of using store purchase as a proxy indicator of home food preparation, and increased restaurant\/fast-food consumption implies fewer reported foods are eligible for the procedure. In addition, USDA's Automated Multiple-Pass Method for the 24-hour dietary recall provides accurate sodium intake estimates without applying the salt-adjustment step. The final WWEIA, NHANES data release to contain salt-adjusted sodium data was 2007-2008. When assessing the effectiveness of sodium-reduction efforts over time, the nutrition community (eg, researchers, analysts, providers) must be aware of this change in WWEIA, NHANES beginning in 2009-2010 and account for it using appropriate baseline estimates.

However, little is known about the structural characteristics and interpersonal dynamics of family meals that might help to inform why family meals are protective for youth. The current mixed methods, cross-sectional study conducted in 2010-2011 includes adolescents and parents who participated in two linked population-based studies. Participants included 40 parents (91.5% female) and adolescents (57.5% female) from the Minneapolis\/St Paul, MN, area participating in EAT (Eating and Activity Among Teens) 2010 and F-EAT (Families and Eating and Activity Among Teens). The structural (eg, length of the meal, types of foods served) and interpersonal characteristics (eg, communication, emotion\/affect management) of family meals were described, and associations between interpersonal dynamics at family meals and adolescent body mass index and dietary intake were examined via direct observational methods. Families were videorecorded during two mealtimes in their homes. Results indicated that family meals were approximately 20 minutes in length, included multiple family members, were typically served family style (70%), and occurred in the kitchen 62% of the time and 38% of the time in another room (eg, family room, office). In addition, significant associations were found between positive interpersonal dynamics (ie, communication, affect management, interpersonal involvement, overall family functioning) at family meals and lower adolescent body mass index and higher vegetable intake. These findings add to the growing body of literature on family meals by providing a better understanding of what is happening at family meals in order to inform obesity-prevention studies and recommendations for providers working with families of youth.","1926":"Economically disadvantaged African-American adolescents have fruit and vegetable (F\/V) intakes that are less than optimal. To facilitate intervention planning to address low F\/V intake in this population, an understanding of determinants of youths' intake is needed. The influence of determinants consistently supported by evidence (ie, home F\/V availability, F\/V taste preferences, and parental modeling\/intake) and variables hypothesized to influence intake in the targeted population (ie, family support for F\/V consumption and Afrocentric values) were examined. Participants were African-American adolescents recruited in 2011 through summer camps serving low-income youths (N=93). Youths completed a cross-sectional survey. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis was used to examine whether availability directly influenced (ie, explained variations in) intake and whether it moderated (ie, affected the direction and\/or strength of) the relationships between the other hypothesized determinants and intake. The dependent variable was intake of five or more daily servings of F\/V estimated with the Block 7-item food frequency questionnaire.

A total of 1,393 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study from July 2008 to January 2010 in China. Dietary flavonoid and stilbene intakes as well as overall dietary intakes from foods and beverages were assessed with a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements and cardiovascular risk factors including serum lipids, uric acid, and carotid intima-media thickness were examined. The relationship between flavonoids and stilbene intakes and these cardiovascular risk factors was examined using either partial correlation coefficients or analysis of covariance. The richest sources of flavonoids and stilbenes were the fruit group including apple, plum, pear, and peach, followed by the vegetable group containing lotus root and taro. The daily intake of total flavonoids, anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, and stilbene were 165.6 mg\/day, 27.6 mg\/day, 123.7 mg\/day, 10.7 mg\/day, 3.7 mg\/day, and 0.3 mg\/day, respectively. Higher daily consumption of anthocyanidins was associated with elevated serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (P trend=0.001), and higher total flavonoid and flavonol intakes were associated with lower serum triglycerides (TG) concentrations (P trend=0.020 and P trend=0.035, respectively) and TG\/HDL-C ratios (P trend=0.040 and P trend=0.045, respectively) in female subjects.

Data from a school-based project (with National Institutes of Health funding) concerning dietary recall accuracy were linked with data from the state's Department of Education through the state's Office of Research and Statistics. Data were available on 1,504 fourth-grade, predominantly African-American children from 18 schools total in one district in South Carolina during the 2004-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007 school years. School staff administered standardized tests in English, math, social studies, and science. Researchers measured children's weight and height. Children were categorized as low-SES, medium-SES, or high-SES based on eligibility for free, reduced-price, or full-price school meals, respectively. Results from marginal regression analyses for each sex for the four academic subjects, separately and combined, showed that test scores were not related to body mass index percentile, but were positively related to SES (P values &lt;0.0001), and were related to race, with lower scores for African-American children than children of other races (P values &lt;0.0039). Cost-efficient opportunities exist to create longitudinal data sets to investigate relationships between academic performance and obesity across kindergarten through 12th-grade children.

Eight studies of moderate to poor quality met the inclusion criteria. Three interventions were specifically designed for young women and compared behavioral weight gain prevention interventions to control groups. Four of the five remaining studies evaluated weight gain prevention interventions, including daily weighing with feedback (n=2), a science course (n=1), and an exercise programs (n=1).

Acne has substantial effects on quality of life, making treatment essential. Medical nutrition therapy as a potential treatment for acne is not new, although the literature examining diet and acne during the past 100 years is mixed. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, diet was commonly used as an adjunct treatment for acne. During the 1960s, however, the diet-acne connection fell out of favor. In recent years, dermatologists and registered dietitians have revisited the idea and become increasingly interested in the role of medical nutrition therapy in acne treatment. This article reviews the history and existing literature examining the association between diet and acne. Although the total number of studies conducted within the past 40 years is relatively small, the growing body of epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggests a relationship between diet and acne. Compared with other dietary factors, more research examines dietary glycemic load. The evidence is more convincing for high glycemic load diets, compared with other dietary factors. To date there are no randomized controlled trials investigating the relationship between frequent dairy or milk consumption and acne. Similarly, the number of research studies examining the relationship between dietary fat and\/or n-3 fatty acids is sparse and the evidence is less robust. Taken together, several methodologic limitations need to be addressed, and additional research, preferably randomized controlled trials, is warranted before comprehensive evidence-based guidelines can be established. While dermatologists and registered dietitians continue to debate and research the potential relationship between diet and acne, the best dietary approach is to address each acne patient individually, carefully considering the possibility of dietary counseling.","1953":"Food banks are the foundation of the US emergency food system. Although their primary mission is to alleviate hunger, the rise in obesity and diet-related diseases among food-insecure individuals has led some food bank personnel to actively promote more nutritious products.

Most food bank personnel reported efforts to provide more fresh produce to their communities. Several described nutrition-profiling systems to evaluate the quality of products. Some food banks had implemented nutrition policies to cease distributing low-nutrient products, such as soda and candy; however, these policies were more controversial than other strategies. The obstacles to implementing strong nutrition policies included fear of reducing the total amount of food distributed, discomfort choosing which foods should not be permitted, and concern about jeopardizing relationships with donors and community partners. Empirical research is needed to measure how food bank nutrition policies influence relationships with food donors, the amount of food distributed, the nutritional quality of food distributed, and the contribution of food bank products to the food security and nutritional status of the communities they serve.","1954":"Data on long-term dietary changes and nutritional deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in grade 3 obese patients are scarce.

Although inadequate vitamin D status and health disparities have been associated with many of the same diseases, neither nutrition policy nor public health policy in the United States currently recognizes any role at all for vitamin D as a determinant of health disparities. This study investigated the relationship between health, skin color, and vitamin D nutriture in the US population. The design is cross-sectional, correlational, and can be generalized to the population of the United States. We used data from 12,505 (unweighted) subjects (3,402 non-Hispanic blacks, 3,143 Mexican Americans, and 5,960 non-Hispanic whites), aged 13 years or older, from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. Self-rated health, a repeatedly validated indicator of objective health status, was used as a continuous measure of health. Using software appropriate for the complex survey design of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the study consisted of six regression models, one predicting vitamin D status and five predicting self-rated health. Controlling for the covariates sex, interview language, country of birth, tobacco use, age, body mass index, and leisure exercise as well as the socioeconomic variables education and family income, remaining disparities in self-rated health are greatly reduced or eliminated by controlling for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.

Half of the teachers reported consuming french fries (52%) and soda (44%), and one fourth consumed fried meat (28%) at least once on the previous day. Only four teachers (3%) answered at least four of the five nutrition knowledge questions correctly. Half of the teachers (54%) agreed that it was hard to know which nutrition information to believe, and only 9% reported that their nutrition habits were healthy. A majority of teachers were trying to lose weight (71%) and said they would like to weigh less (81%).

The HEI-2010 captures the key recommendations of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines and, like earlier versions, will be used to assess the diet quality of the US population and subpopulations, evaluate interventions, research dietary patterns, and evaluate various aspects of the food environment.","1964":"The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) state that if alcohol is consumed, it should be consumed in moderation, which is defined as up to two drinks in a single day for men and one drink for women. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the percentages of adults who, on a given day, drank more than these limits and the percentages who drank too heavily; that is, more than four drinks for men and more than three for women. Dietary intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009-2010, were analyzed. Using a computer-assisted protocol, 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from 2,740 men and 2,941 women, age 21 years and older. Results were weighted to be nationally representative. Estimated mean daily intake was 1.2 drinks for men and 0.4 for women (1 drink=14 g of ethanol). On a given day, 36% of men and 21% of women consumed alcohol. Whereas 82% of men and 89% of women did not exceed the DGA's limits, 8% of men had more than four drinks, and 3% of women had more than three, amounts defined as heavy. The percentages who drank more than the DGA's limits varied by age group and were highest among men age 31 to 50 years and women age 51 to 70 years. Excessive drinking is an important health problem and is not limited to college-age individuals. Registered dietitians and other health professionals should be aware of excessive drinking by the adult US population.

The purpose of this study was to assess the demographic and psychosocial correlates of food label use using a comprehensive approach. A sample of 1,382 males and females (n=573 and n=809, respectively) aged 19 to 70 years was drawn from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The food label Check and Use subscales are the sums of multiple questions on frequency of checking and using each separate component on a Nutrition Facts label. Multiple linear regression was used to assess differences in predictors of Check and Use. Determinants of food label use differed by sex. Women check and use food label components more often and thoroughly than men. Older adults and adults with good diet-quality perception were significant predictors of food label use for both men and women. Race was a significant predictor for men only. Mexican-American and other Hispanic groups check (P=0.03) and use (P=0.01) the food label more frequently than non-Hispanic white men. Men who do not receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits also check (P&lt;0.01) and use (P=0.01) food labels more frequently than those who receive assistance. The findings of this study could be used to improve nutrition education efforts. It may be beneficial to target men and women separately, as food label use determinants are different.","1968":"Obesity is a prominent public health concern that disproportionally affects low-income and minority populations. Recent policies mandating the posting of calories on menus in fast-food chain restaurants have not proven to uniformly influence food choice. This qualitative research study used focus groups to study individual and environmental factors affecting the use of these menu labels among low-income minority populations. Ten focus groups targeting low-income residents (n=105) were held at various community organizations throughout New York City over a 9-month period in 2011. The focus groups were conducted in Spanish, English, or a combination of both languages. In late 2011 and early 2012, transcripts were coded through the process of thematic analysis using Atlas.ti for naturally emerging themes, influences, and determinants of food choice. Few participants used menu labels, despite awareness. The most frequently cited as barriers to menu label use included: price and time constraints, confusion and lack of understanding about caloric values, as well as the priority of preference, hunger, and habitual ordering habits. Based on the individual and external influences on food choice that often take priority over calorie consideration, a modified approach may be necessary to make menu labels more effective and user-friendly.","1969":"","1970":null,"1971":"","1972":"","1973":"","1974":"It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that the total diet or overall pattern of food eaten is the most important focus of healthy eating. All foods can fit within this pattern if consumed in moderation with appropriate portion size and combined with physical activity. The Academy strives to communicate healthy eating messages that emphasize a balance of food and beverages within energy needs, rather than any one food or meal. Public policies and dietary patterns that support the total diet approach include the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet, MyPlate, Let's Move, Nutrition Facts labels, Healthy People 2020, and the Dietary Reference Intakes. In contrast to the total diet approach, classification of specific foods as good or bad is overly simplistic and can foster unhealthy eating behaviors. Alternative approaches are necessary in some situations. Eating practices are dynamic and influenced by many factors, including taste and food preferences, weight concerns, physiology, time and convenience, environment, abundance of foods, economics, media\/marketing, perceived product safety, culture, and attitudes\/beliefs. To increase the effectiveness of nutrition education in promoting sensible food choices, skilled food and nutrition practitioners utilize appropriate behavioral theory and evidence-based strategies. Focusing on variety, moderation, and proportionality in the context of a healthy lifestyle, rather than targeting specific nutrients or foods, can help reduce consumer confusion and prevent unnecessary reliance on supplements. Proactive, empowering, and practical messages that emphasize the total diet approach promote positive lifestyle changes.","1975":null,"1976":"Adherence to a Mediterranean diet has recently been shown to protect against cognitive decline and dementia. It remains unclear, however, whether such protection extends to different ethnic groups and middle-aged individuals and how it might compare with adherence to the US Department of Agriculture's 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (measured with Healthy Eating Index 2005 [HEI 2005]). This study examined associations between diet quality, as assessed by the Mediterranean diet and HEI 2005, and cognitive performance in a sample of 1,269 Puerto Rican adults aged 45 to 75 years and living in the Greater Boston area of Massachusetts. Dietary intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire specifically designed for and validated with this population. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed with a 0- to 9-point scale, and the HEI 2005 score was calculated with a maximum score of 100. Cognitive performance was measured with a battery of seven tests and the Mini Mental State Examination was used for global cognitive function. Greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher Mini Mental State Examination score (P trend=0.012) and lower likelihood (odds ratio=0.87 for each additional point; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94; P&lt;0.001) of cognitive impairment, after adjustment for confounders. Similarly, individuals with higher HEI 2005 score had higher Mini Mental State Examination score (P trend=0.011) and lower odds of cognitive impairment (odds ratio=0.86 for each 10 points; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.033). In conclusion, high adherence to either the Mediterranean diet or the diet recommended by the US Department of Agriculture 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans can protect cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults.","1977":"Because childhood obesity is such a threat to the physical, mental, and social health of youth, there is a great need to identify effective strategies to reduce its prevalence. The objective of this study was to estimate the mean calories from added sugars that are saved by switching sugar-sweetened beverages (including soda, fruit-flavored drinks, and sport drinks) and flavored milks consumed to unflavored low-fat milk (&lt;1% fat) at meals and water between meals. Simulation analyses used 24-hour dietary recall data from the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (n=2,314), a 2005 national cross-sectional study of schools and students participating in the National School Lunch Program, to estimate changes in mean calories from added sugars both at and away from school. Overall, these changes translated to a mean of 205 calories or a 10% savings in energy intake across all students (8% among children in elementary school and 11% in middle and high schools). Eighty percent of the daily savings were attributed to beverages consumed away from school, with results consistent across school level, sex, race\/ethnicity, and weight status. Children's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages at home contributed the greatest share of empty calories from added sugars. Such findings indicate that parental education should focus on the importance of reducing or eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages served at home. This conclusion has implications for improving children's food and beverage environments for food and nutrition educators and practitioners, other health care professionals, policy makers, researchers, and parents.","1978":"The occurrence of hypoglycemia in patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) is low, yet its consequences can be detrimental. Treatment of hyperglycemia with insulin to achieve optimal blood glucose control is challenging and potentially associated with increased risk of the development of hypoglycemia. The objective of this study was to determine the association of patient characteristics on the risk of hypoglycemia among patients receiving concomitant PN and insulin therapy. This retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, and included 1,657 patients who received PN. There was a significant decrease in the occurrence of hypoglycemia observed over time: 9.1% (43 of 475) in 2008, 6.4% (30 of 468) in 2009, 5.8% (20 of 347) in 2010, and 3.5% (13 of 367) in 2011 (P=0.013). Patients in whom hypoglycemia developed had a significantly longer duration on PN (18.0 vs 8.1 days, P&lt;0.0001) as well as more days requiring insulin in the PN (16.1 vs 2.7 days, P&lt;0.0001). The strongest predictors of hypoglycemia were: receiving PN in the ICU (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.01), history of diabetes (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.51), days on PN (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.95), and an insulin drip (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.81 to 5.42). With the identification of patient factors that contribute to an increase in hypoglycemia, existing protocols can be modified to treat hyperglycemia and prevent hypoglycemia.","1979":null,"1980":null,"1981":"The Food and Drug Administration is considering changes to the Nutrition Facts label to help consumers make more healthful choices. To examine the effects of modifications to the Nutrition Facts label on foods that can be listed as having 1 or 2 servings per container, but are reasonably consumed at a single eating occasion. Participants were randomly assigned to study conditions that varied on label format, product, and nutrition profile. Data were collected via an online consumer panel. Adults aged 18 years and older were recruited from Synovate's online household panel. Data were collected during August 2011. A total of 32,897 invitations were sent for a final sample of 9,493 interviews. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 10 label formats classified into three groups: listing 2 servings per container with a single column, listing 2 servings per container with a dual column, and listing a single serving per container. Within these groups there were versions that enlarged the font size for \"calories,\" removed \"calories from fat,\" and changed the wording for serving size declaration. The single product task measured product healthfulness, the amount of calories and various nutrients per serving and per container, and label perceptions. The product comparison task measured ability to identify the healthier product and the product with fewer calories per container and per serving. Analysis of covariance models with Tukey-Kramer tests were used. Covariates included general label use, age, sex, level of education, and race\/ethnicity. Single-serving and dual-column formats performed better and scored higher on most outcome measures. For products that contain 2 servings but are customarily consumed at a single eating occasion, using a single-serving or dual-column labeling approach may help consumers make healthier food choices.

Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to determine independent associations between each outcome variable and the number of serving equivalents of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed after adjusting for age, sex, race, poverty status, physical activity, and energy intake. Increased sugar-sweetened beverage intake was independently associated with increased C-reactive protein concentrations (P=0.003), increased waist circumference (P=0.04), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (P&lt;0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated differences in the association of sugar-sweetened beverage intake with metabolic markers and anthropometric measurements among age ranges, sex, and racial\/ethnic groups.

Child obesity-related editorial content in 68 mainstream and 20 Spanish-language magazine issues published over 32 months was gathered. Magazine content was coded with a manual developed by refining themes from the sample and from an evidence-based child obesity prevention action plan. Seventy-three articles related to child obesity prevention and control were identified. Most focused on parental behavior change rather than environmental change, and only 3 in 10 articles referred to the social context in which parental behavior change takes place. Child obesity-focused articles were not given high prominence; only one in four articles in the entire sample referred to child obesity as a growing problem or epidemic. Key differences between genres reflect culturally important Latino themes, including family focus and changing health beliefs around child weight status. Given mass media's potential influence on parenting practices and public perceptions, nutrition communication professionals and registered dietitians need to work to reframe media coverage of childhood obesity as an environmental problem that requires broad-based policy solutions.

Characteristics associated with sports and energy drink intake were examined among a sample representing the civilian noninstitutionalized US adult population. The 2010 National Health Interview Survey data for 25,492 adults (18 years of age or older; 48% males) were used. Nationwide, 31.3% of adults were sports and energy drink consumers during the past 7 days, with 21.5% consuming sports and energy drinks one or more times per week and 11.5% consuming sports and energy drinks three or more times per week. Based on multivariable logistic regression, younger adults, males, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, not-married individuals, adults with higher family income, those who lived in the South or West, adults who engaged in leisure-time physical activity, current smokers, and individuals whose satisfaction with their social activities\/relationships was excellent had significantly higher odds for drinking sports and energy drinks one or more times per week. In this model, the factor most strongly associated with weekly sports and energy drink consumption was age (odds ratio [OR]=10.70 for 18- to 24-year-olds, OR=6.40 for 25- to 39-year-olds, OR=3.17 for 40- to 59-year-olds vs 60 years or older). Lower odds for consuming sports and energy drinks one or more times per week were associated with other\/multiracial (OR=0.80 vs non-Hispanic white) and obesity (OR=0.87 vs underweight\/normal weight). Separate modeling of the association between other beverage intake and sports and energy drink intake showed that higher intake of regular soda, sweetened coffee\/tea drinks, fruit drinks, milk, 100% fruit juice, and alcohol were significantly associated with greater odds for drinking sports and energy drinks one or more times per week. These findings can help medical care providers and public health officials identify adults most in need of encouragement to reduce sports and energy drink intake and increase healthier beverage intake.","1999":"Limited research shows an inconclusive association between soda intake and asthma, potentially attributable to certain preservatives in sodas. This cross-sectional study examined the association between regular (nondiet)-soda intake and current asthma among a nationally representative sample of high school students. Analysis was based on the 2009 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey and included 15,960 students (grades 9 through 12) with data for both regular-soda intake and current asthma status. The outcome measure was current asthma (ie, told by doctor\/nurse that they had asthma and still have asthma). The main exposure variable was regular-soda intake (ie, drank a can\/bottle\/glass of soda during the 7 days before the survey). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for regular-soda intake with current asthma after controlling for age, sex, race\/ethnicity, weight status, and current cigarette use. Overall, 10.8% of students had current asthma. In addition, 9.7% of students who did not drink regular soda had current asthma, and 14.7% of students who drank regular soda three or more times per day had current asthma. Compared with those who did not drink regular soda, odds of having current asthma were higher among students who drank regular soda two times per day (adjusted odds ratio=1.28; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.62) and three or more times per day (adjusted odds ratio=1.64; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.16). The association between high regular-soda intake and current asthma suggests efforts to reduce regular-soda intake among youth might have benefits beyond improving diet quality.

Overweight\/obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for developing asthma. The aim of this review is to present and evaluate recent publications that help answer the question: \"Is increased body weight (at least overweight status) related to asthma in children?\" A systematic review of epidemiologic literature was carried out using the MEDLINE database. Epidemiologic studies on young human subjects (ie, infants, children, and adolescents), published in English during the period 2006-2011 were included. A comprehensive literature search yielded 434 studies for further consideration. Forty-eight studies fulfilled the review's eligibility criteria. Two researchers applied the MOOSE Guidelines for Meta-Analysis and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies on all identified studies. Current evidence supports a weak yet significant association between high body weight and asthma. New information indicates that central obesity in children increases asthma risk. Also, the link between high body weight and asthma may be stronger in nonallergic asthma. There are mixed results about the importance of sex. Although the nature of the association between overweight\/obese status and asthma remains unclear, prospective studies point that high body weight precedes asthma symptoms. These data add weight to the importance of preventing and treating a high body weight against asthma outcomes. Available research in children has not studied adequately the influence of weight change (either gain or loss) on asthma symptoms, an area of clinical importance. Beyond energy control, the role of diet as a possible inflammatory stimulus warrants further investigation. Limited data seem to favor the promotion of breastfeeding in attenuating the overweight\/obesity-asthma relationship. Finally, future research should include weight intervention studies assessing various measures of body fat in relation to well-defined asthma outcomes.","2001":"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the largest federal food assistance program, currently serves 44.7 million Americans with a budget of $75 billion in 2011. This study engaged leading experts for in-depth, semi-structured interviews to explore their opinions concerning the existing challenges and barriers to eating nutritiously in SNAP. Experts also proposed strategies for improving nutritional status among SNAP recipients. Twenty-seven individuals were interviewed from advocacy, government, industry, and research organizations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for thematic content. The high cost of nutrient-rich foods, inadequate SNAP benefits, limited access to purchasing healthy foods, and environmental factors associated with poverty were identified as barriers that influence nutrition among low-income households in the United States. Six themes emerged among respondents from diverse sectors about how to address these challenges, including providing SNAP participants with incentives to purchase nutrient-rich food consistent with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, restricting the purchase of nutrient-poor foods and beverages with program benefits, modifying the frequency of SNAP benefit distribution, enhancing nutrition education, improving the SNAP retailer environment, and increasing state and federal level coordination and consistency of program implementation. Given the recent dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment, policymakers must address existing barriers as well as consider new strategies to improve nutrition policies in SNAP so that the program can continue to address food insecurity needs as well as provide a healthful diet for SNAP beneficiaries.","2002":"Sustainability and going green have become popular trends among foodservice organizations. Despite this interest, foodservice operations still produce large amounts of edible food waste and contribute significantly to waste management problems. The purpose of this operational study was to determine how to introduce food waste behavior change into a dining facility using a simple message-type intervention that requires little sustained administrative support and can provide optimum effect. The population for this study was 540 university students living in residence halls and participating in a meal plan. This study assessed whether simple prompt-type message interventions had an influence or if the addition of more personally relevant feedback-based data elicited greater change in student beliefs and food waste behaviors. A written questionnaire and individual student tray waste tracking were used to gather data. Simple print-format messages were evaluated, allowing the effect of an affordable message campaign to be determined. Students had a higher-than-neutral level of belief, but did not indicate a strong conviction toward environmental sustainability or food waste. The edible food items disposed of on 19,046 trays in this all-you-care-to-eat university dining operation were evaluated. On average, more than 57 g edible food was disposed of per tray, accumulating to &gt;1.5 tons of food waste during the 6-week study. The simple to-the-point prompt-type message stimulated a 15% reduction in food waste. The addition of a more personalized feedback-based message did not stimulate an additional change beyond that of the prompt message. These findings indicate that simply making university students aware of the topic of food waste may be useful in improving their behaviors and the sustainability of the foodservice facility.

These changes may alter parents' beliefs about their adolescent's weight status. This study aimed to examine the changes between early and mid-adolescence in: (a) the accuracy of maternal perception regarding her adolescent's weight status, (b) the degree of maternal concern about her adolescent's weight status, and (c) the predictors of maternal misclassification of adolescent overweight as average weight. A secondary analysis of the longitudinal Nepean Study data was conducted. Participants were Australian, free-living 13-year-olds in 2002-2003 (n=347) followed up at age 15 years (n=279) and their mothers. Participants' body mass index (BMI) status (overweight, normal, or underweight) was calculated from measured height and weight. Maternal perceptions and concerns about adolescent's weight status were determined by items adapted from the Child Feeding Questionnaire. Sex-adjusted binary logistic regression models assessed potential predictors of maternal misclassification of adolescent overweight. Data were available on 224 adolescent-mother dyads. Approximately one fourth of mothers misclassified their adolescent's weight status, but this varied across groups (age 13 years [%]; age 15 years [%], respectively) underweight (75%; 70%), overweight (54%; 59%), and normal weight (12%; 9%). The endpoint data show that between 13 and 15 years of age, maternal concern regarding their adolescent's weight decreased in all weight-status groups. Predictors of maternal misclassification of adolescent overweight were adolescent BMI z score, recent weight-management practices, weight history, sex, and maternal concern regarding her adolescent's weight.

ADP concordance correlation coefficient for fat mass was weak (0.179) when compared with D(2)O. Bland-Altman plots revealed a low accuracy and large scatter of ADP fat mass (%) results (mean=-2.5, 95% CI -20.3 to 15.4) compared with D(2)O. DXA fat mass (%) results were more consistent although DXA systematically overestimated fat mass by 4% to 5% compared with D(2)O.

The frequency with which children swallowed and enjoyed the novel fruit, and the frequency of taste exposures to the novel fruit during the meal, were positively correlated with parental use of physical prompting and rewarding\/bargaining. Earlier introduction of solids was related to higher frequency of child acceptance behaviors. The child's age at introduction of solids and the number of physical prompts displayed by parents significantly predicted the frequency of swallowing and enjoying the novel fruit. Age of introduction to solids and parental use of rewards\/bargaining significantly predicted the frequency of taste exposures. Prompting a child to eat and using rewards or bargains during a positive mealtime interaction can help to overcome barriers to novel fruit consumption. Early introduction of solids is also associated with greater willingness to consume a novel fruit.

Since then, it has become clear that a strong relationship exists between obesity and many cancers, particularly postmenopausal breast cancer. A major challenge in understanding the link between obesity and cancer risk has been elucidating the biological basis underlying the association. Although this remains unresolved, the main candidate systems linking adiposity and cancer risk are insulin and the insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, endogenous reproductive hormones, and chronic inflammation. Our purpose is to provide a mechanistic overview of the hypothesized relationship between diet, physical activity, and obesity with breast cancer risk and progression. In addition, we will provide examples of recently funded randomized clinical trials examining metabolic risk factors in relation to breast cancer risk and survival. Additional research is warranted to validate the strength and consistency of the relationships among diet, these biomarkers, and breast cancer risk. As these relationships become clearer, future studies will be needed to develop effective intervention programs to prevent breast cancer and improve cancer prognosis by promoting a healthy lifestyle.","2029":"","2030":"","2031":"","2032":"Generating valid estimates of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) has been a challenge in nutritional epidemiology. The methodologic issues may have contributed to the wide variation of GI\/GL associations with health outcomes observed in existing literature. We describe a standardized methodology for assigning GI values to items in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) nutrient database using the new International Tables to develop research-driven, systematic procedures and strategies to estimate dietary GI\/GL exposures of a nationally representative population sample. Nutrient databases for NHANES 2003-2006 contain information on 3,155 unique foods derived from the US Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference versions 18 and 20. Assignment of GI values were made to a subset of 2,078 carbohydrate-containing foods using systematic food item matching procedures applied to 2008 international GI tables and online data sources. Matching protocols indicated that 45.4% of foods had identical matches with existing data sources, 31.9% had similar matches, 2.5% derived GI values calculated with the formula for combination foods, 13.6% were assigned a default GI value based on low carbohydrate content, and 6.7% of GI values were based on data extrapolation. Most GI values were derived from international sources; 36.1% were from North American product information. To confirm data assignments, dietary GI and GL intakes of the NHANES 2003-2006 adult participants were estimated from two 24-hour recalls and compared with published studies. Among the 3,689 men and 4,112 women studied, mean dietary GI was 56.2 (men 56.9, women 55.5), mean dietary GL was 138.1 (men 162.1, women 116.4); the distribution of dietary GI was approximately normal. Estimates of population GI and GL compare favorably with other published literature. This methodology of adding GI values to an existing population nutrient database utilized systematic matching protocols and the latest comprehensive data sources on food composition. The database can be applied in clinical and survey research settings where there is interest in estimating individual and population dietary exposures and relating them to health outcomes.","2033":null,"2034":"Our understanding of the use of caloric and noncaloric sweeteners in the US food supply is limited. This study uses full ingredient list and Nutrition Facts label data from Gladson Nutrition Database and nationally representative purchases of consumer packaged foods from Nielsen Homescan in 2005 through 2009 to understand the use of caloric sweeteners (including fruit juice concentrate) and noncaloric sweeteners in consumer packaged foods. Of the 85,451 uniquely formulated foods purchased during 2005 through 2009, 75% contain sweeteners (68% with caloric sweetener only, 1% with noncaloric sweetener only, 6% with both caloric and noncaloric sweeteners).

Noncaloric sweetener are in &gt;33% of yogurts and sport\/energy drinks, 42% of waters (plain or flavored), and most dietetic sweetened beverages. Across unique products, corn syrup is the most commonly listed sweetener, followed by sorghum, cane sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and fruit juice concentrate. Also, 77% of all calories purchased in the United States in 2005-2009 contained caloric sweeteners and 3% contained noncaloric sweeteners, and 73% of the volume of foods purchased contained caloric sweetener and 15% contained noncaloric sweetener. Trends during this period suggest a shift toward the purchase of noncaloric sweetener-containing products.

However, the effect of specific nutrients on cardiometabolic risk is not well understood, especially in children. Four dietary factors known to influence cardiometabolic risk (ie, carbohydrate, saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat intake) were assessed by the Block Kids 2004 Food Frequency Questionnaire in a cross-sectional sample of racially diverse fourth- through eighth-grade students (n=148) in a Boston-area school district studied between January and April 2010. Fasting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and body mass index z scores were measured. Differences in dietary factors and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined among the following racial\/ethnic groups: white (39%), Hispanic (32%), black (8%), Asian (10%), and multiracial\/other (11%). In bivariate analyses, total, saturated, and polyunsaturated fat intakes differed by race\/ethnicity (P&lt;0.05), with white and black children reporting saturated fat intakes above the recommended level. Forty-seven percent of children had at least one suboptimal cardiometabolic risk factor. HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and IL-6 concentrations differed by race\/ethnicity (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01, and P&lt;0.01, respectively), with Hispanics having low HDL cholesterol levels and high triglyceride levels, whereas Asians had high IL-6 levels. In multivariate analyses controlling for demographic characteristics, none of the dietary factors examined explained racial\/ethnic differences in lipid profiles or inflammatory markers. Body mass index z score was associated with lower HDL cholesterol, higher triglyceride, higher CRP, and higher IL-6 levels (P&lt;0.0001). Further research is warranted to determine the influence of dietary recommendations at a young age among different racial\/ethnic groups on cardiometabolic health.","2036":"Disordered eating behaviors may pose a risk for poor long-term health outcomes in patients with type 1 diabetes. This cross-sectional study examined associations of disordered eating behaviors with diet quality, diet-related attitudes, and diabetes management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (N=151, 48% female). Participants, recruited July 2008 through February 2009, completed 3-day diet records and survey measures, including the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS) and measures of eating-related attitudes. Biomedical data were obtained from medical records. Participants scoring more than 1 standard deviation above the mean DEPS were classified as at risk for disordered eating. The Healthy Eating Index-2005 was calculated to assess diet quality. Analysis of covariance was used to test for differences between risk groups in diet quality, eating attitudes, and diabetes management, controlling for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) percentile. Youth at risk for disordered eating were more likely to be overweight\/obese than those at low risk (59.1% vs 31.8%, P=0.01). The at-risk group had poorer diet quality (P=0.003) as well as higher intake of total fat (P=0.01) and saturated fat (P=0.007) compared with the low-risk group. The at-risk group reported lower self-efficacy (P=0.005), greater barriers (P&lt;0.001), and more negative outcome expectations (P&lt;0.001) for healthful eating, as well as worse dietary satisfaction (P=0.004). The at-risk group had lower diabetes adherence (P&lt;0.01), less-frequent blood glucose monitoring (P&lt;0.002), and higher hemoglobin A1c (P&lt;0.001). The constellation of excess weight, poorer dietary intake, and poorer diabetes management associated with youth at risk for disordered eating suggests potential risk of future poor health outcomes. Attention should be given to healthful weight management, especially among overweight youth with type 1 diabetes.","2037":"In healthy normal-weight adults, cinnamon reduces blood glucose concentration and enhances insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance, resulting in increased fasting and postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels, is commonly observed in obese individuals. The objective of the study was to compare declines in postprandial glycemic response in normal-weight and obese subjects with ingestion of 6 g ground cinnamon. In a crossover study, subjects consumed 50 g available carbohydrate in instant farina cereal, served plain or with 6 g ground cinnamon. Blood glucose concentration, the main outcome measure, was assessed at minutes 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120. Repeated-measures analysis of variance evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI) group, dietary condition, and time on blood glucose. Paired t-test assessed blood glucose at individual time points and glucose area under the curve (AUC) between dietary conditions. Thirty subjects between the ages of 18 and 30 years, 15 with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9 and 15 with BMIs of 30.0 or more, completed the study. There was no significant difference in blood glucose between the two BMI groups at any time point. However, in a combined analysis of all subjects, the addition of cinnamon to the cereal significantly reduced 120-minute glucose AUC (P=0.008) and blood glucose at 15 (P=0.001), 30 (P&lt;0.001), 45 (P&lt;0.001), and 60 (P=0.001) minutes. At 120 minutes, blood glucose was significantly higher with cinnamon consumption (P&lt;0.001).

Evidence linking partial sleep deprivation, defined as sleeping &lt;6 hours per night, to energy imbalance is relevant to weight gain prevention and weight loss promotion. With a majority of Americans overweight or obese, weight loss is a recommended strategy for reducing comorbid conditions. Our purpose was to review the literature regarding the role of partial sleep deprivation on energy balance and weight regulation. An inverse relationship between obesity and sleep duration has been demonstrated in cross-sectional and prospective studies. Several intervention studies have tested mechanisms by which partial sleep deprivation affects energy balance. Reduced sleep may disrupt appetitive hormone regulation, specifically increasing ghrelin and decreasing leptin and, thereby, influence energy intake. Increased wakefulness also may promote food intake episodes and energy imbalance. Energy expenditure may not be greatly affected by partial sleep deprivation, although additional and more accurate methods of measurements may be necessary to detect subtle changes in energy expenditure. Body weight loss achieved by reduced energy intake and\/or increased energy expenditure combined with partial sleep deprivation may contribute to undesirable body composition change with proportionately more fat-free soft tissue mass lost compared with fat mass. Evaluating sleep patterns and recommending regular, sufficient sleep for individuals striving to manage weight may be prudent.","2040":"Despite strong scientific data indicating associations among sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and numerous adverse health outcomes, little is known about culturally specific beliefs and potential individual-level behavioral strategies to reduce SSB intake. The primary objective of this formative study targeting adults residing in rural southwest Virginia was to apply the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate culturally specific attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control constructs related to the consumption of SSB, water, and artificially sweetened beverages. Using a homogenous sampling strategy, eight focus groups were conducted with 54 adult participants who exceeded recommendations of &lt;1 cup of SSB\/day. An experienced moderator and co-moderator utilized a semi-structured script, grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior, to execute the focus group. All focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Three researchers independently coded meaning units to the major themes and subsequently met to gain consensus in coding. Important beverage-specific themes emerged for attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. Across all beverages, the most notable themes included taste (n=161 meaning units), availability\/convenience (n=95 meaning units), habit\/addiction (n=57 meaning units), and cost (n=28 meaning units). Health consequences associated with beverages and water-quality issues also surfaced, as well as normative beliefs, including the influence of doctors and peers. The identified themes and subthemes provide critical insight into understanding culturally relevant context and beliefs associated with beverage consumption behaviors and helps inform the development and evaluation of future intervention efforts targeting SSB consumption in the health disparate region of southwest Virginia.","2041":"It is unclear whether participation in home-delivered meal programs similar to the Older Americans Act home-delivered meals program influence weight status among older adults with hypertension and\/or hyperlipidemia. To examine the influence of a home-delivered Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) meal intervention on body mass index (BMI), energy consumed, and percent of energy needs consumed. A 1-year randomized control trial of home-delivered DASH meals and medical nutrition therapy conducted from 2003 through 2005. Participants who received DASH meals were compared with those who did not receive meals. Data were collected in participants' homes at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The study sample was composed of 298 adults aged &gt;60 years with hypertension and\/or hyperlipidemia residing in a county in the southeastern part of North Carolina.

Difference-in-differences models were used to estimate the effects of the meal intervention on BMI, energy consumed, and percent of daily energy needs consumed. Analyses were conducted among the full sample and by subgroup (ie, race, income, and baseline obesity status). In the full sample, receipt of meals did not have a significant effect on BMI, energy consumed, or percent of daily energy needs consumed. Among those living at or above the 165% poverty threshold, receipt of home-delivered meals was significantly associated with a decrease in energy consumed and, therefore, percent of daily energy needs consumed. Participation in a home-delivered DASH meal program did not lead to weight gain or weight loss in a group of mostly overweight or obese older adults with hypertension and\/or hyperlidemia. ","2042":"More than 75% of people older than 65 years of age in the United States have prediabetes or diabetes. Diabetes is a burden on Medicare, the US health care payer. Intensive lifestyle interventions have successfully prevented diabetes cases, and medical nutrition therapy has also significantly reduced diabetes risk factors. Including medical nutrition therapy coverage for prediabetes is a policy decision to be made by Medicare, and cost-effectiveness data must support that decision. The aims of this study were to determine the thresholds of diabetes cases that need to be averted by prediabetes lifestyle interventions in order to be cost saving and\/or cost-effective to a single health care insurance payer, such as Medicare; and to compare those thresholds with published intervention data to determine the feasibility of cost savings and\/or cost-effectiveness. This analysis used standard methods of cost-effectiveness and cost saving analysis. A health system perspective was used. Cost estimates for diabetes treatment and lifestyle interventions were based on published data. Costs for 3-, 6-, and 10-year lifestyle interventions were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed using least and most-conservative published data for health care and intervention costs. The number of cases averted needed for base-case cost savings ranged from 882,883 to 2,443,686, and in sensitivity analysis from 394,148 to 6,738,678. Cost savings are likely in the base and least-conservative scenarios. The number of cases averted needed for base-case cost-effectiveness ranged from 454,755 to 1,258,692, and in sensitivity analysis from 212,225 to 4,843,262. Cost-effectiveness is likely in all interventions, except the 10-year interventions in the most-conservative scenario. Prediabetes lifestyle interventions for people aged 65 years or older are highly cost-effective and possibly cost saving to a health care insurance payer such as Medicare. It is likely that medical nutrition therapy could be even more cost saving and\/or cost-effective than intensive lifestyle interventions. These results suggest that Medicare would receive financial benefit from providing coverage for these services.

A convenience sample of low-income adults (n=123) was randomized to receive in-person education (n=66) or web-based education (n=57) in a community setting within 14 counties of Indiana from April through December 2010. The web-based group received three nutrition education lessons (eg, fruits and vegetables, Nutrition Facts label reading, and whole grains) designed to replicate lessons received by the in-person group. Lessons were developed using Kolb's Learning Styles and Experiential Learning Model. Self-reported nutrition-related behaviors were assessed using a previously validated survey for low-income adults. Most nutrition-related behavior outcomes (eg, fruit, vegetable, whole-grain intake, Nutrition Facts label use, breakfast, and meal-planning frequency) improved significantly (P&lt;0.05) from pre to post within both groups, meaning that each intervention was effective. When these nutrition-related behavior improvements were compared between groups, the changes were statistically equivalent (P&gt;0.05), except for one question about use of the Nutrition Facts label. Therefore, web-based nutrition education can lead to favorable and equivalent nutrition-related changes when compared with in-person delivery.

Food waste was estimated for participants on regular (n=36) and modified-texture (n=42) diets. A tracking system to ensure collection and digital imaging of all main meal plates was developed. Four observers used a modified Comstock method to assess food waste for vegetables, starches, and main courses on 551 main meal plates. Intermodal, inter-rater, and intra-rater reliability were calculated using intraclass correlation for absolute agreement. Intermodal reliability was based on one rater's assessments. The digital imaging method results were in high agreement with the real-time visual method for both regular and modified-texture food (intraclass correlation=0.90 and 0.88, respectively). Agreements between observers for regular diets were higher than those for modified-texture food (range=0.91 to 0.94; 0.82 to 0.91, respectively). Intra-rater agreements were very high for both regular and modified-texture food (range=0.93 to 0.99; 0.91 to 0.98). The digital imaging method is a reliable alternative to estimating regular and modified-texture food waste for main meal plates when compared with real-time visual estimation.

Focusing on healthy eating behaviors rather than energy intake may be an alternative strategy. In addition, important behaviors might differ for short- vs long-term weight control. Our aim was to describe and compare associations between changes in eating behaviors and weight after 6 and 48 months. We performed secondary analysis of data collected during a randomized weight-loss intervention trial with 48-month follow-up. We studied 481 overweight and obese postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women on the Move through Activity and Nutrition (WOMAN) Study. We measured changes in weight from baseline to 6 and 48 months. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations between 6- and 48-month changes in eating habits assessed by the Conner Diet Habit Survey and changes in weight. Analyses were conducted in the combined study population and stratified by randomization group. At 6 months in the combined population, weight loss was independently associated with decreased desserts (P&lt;0.001), restaurant eating (P=0.042), sugar-sweetened beverages (P=0.009), and fried foods (P&lt;0.001), and increased fish consumption (P=0.003). Results were similar in intervention participants; only reduced desserts and fried foods associated with weight loss in controls. At 48 months in the combined population, weight loss was again associated with decreased desserts (P=0.003) and sugar-sweetened beverages (P=0.011), but also decreased meats\/cheeses (P=0.024) and increased fruits\/vegetables (P&lt;0.001). Decreased meats\/cheeses predicted weight loss in intervention participants; desserts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and fruits\/vegetables were independently associated in controls. Changes in eating behaviors were associated with weight change, although important behaviors differed for short- and long-term weight change and by randomization group. Future studies should determine whether interventions targeting these behaviors could improve long-term obesity treatment outcomes.

Our objectives were to cross-sectionally examine, in a nationally representative sample of adult New Zealand women, the associations between different styles of eating behavior regulation and body mass index (BMI), with specific food and eating habits as hypothesized mediators. During May 2009, a sample of 2,500 New Zealand women aged 40 to 50 years was randomly selected from the nationwide electoral rolls. A 66% (n=1,601) participation rate was achieved. Potential participants were mailed a self-administered questionnaire containing the Regulation of Eating Behavior scale, questions on specific food and eating habits (frequency of binge eating, speed of eating, usual daily servings of fruits and vegetables, usual frequency of intake of several high-fat and\/or high-sugar foods), and height and weight. Univariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations among demographic, health and behavioral variables, and BMI. Multivariate linear regression models were developed to investigate the relationships between autonomous and controlled forms of eating behavior regulation and BMI, with specific food and eating habits as mediators. After adjusting for potential confounders as well as specific food and eating habits that were potential mediators, BMI was statistically significantly lower by 2% (95% CI -2.7% to -1.4%; P&lt;0.001) for every 10-unit increase in autonomous regulation, and statistically significantly higher by 1.4% (95% CI 0.4% to 2.3%; P=0.005) for every 10-unit increase in controlled regulation. The relationships between autonomous regulation and BMI as well as controlled regulation and BMI were only partially mediated by the specific food and eating habits measured. Although the direction of causality requires confirmation, the results provide support for the applicability of Self-Determination Theory, and suggest that developing more autonomous motivation for eating behavior is likely to facilitate healthier food habits and lower BMI in middle-aged women.

Americans fall short of most food group intake targets and do not consume foods in nutrient-dense forms. Intake of calories from solid fats and added sugars exceed maximum limits by large margins. Our aim was to determine the potential effect on meeting USDA Food Pattern nutrient adequacy and moderation goals if Americans consumed the recommended quantities from each food group, but did not implement the advice to select nutrient-dense forms of food and instead made more typical food choices. Food-pattern modeling analysis using the USDA Food Patterns, which are structured to allow modifications in one or more aspects of the patterns, was used. Nutrient profiles for each food group were modified by replacing each nutrient-dense representative food with a similar but typical choice. Typical nutrient profiles were used to determine the energy and nutrient content of the food patterns. Moderation goals are not met when amounts of food in the USDA Food Patterns are followed and typical rather than nutrient-dense food choices are made. Energy, total fat, saturated fat, and sodium exceed limits in all patterns, often by substantial margins. With typical choices, calories were 15% to 30% (ie, 350 to 450 kcal) above the target calorie level for each pattern. Adequacy goals were not substantially affected by the use of typical food choices.

However, the relationship between label use, attitude toward healthy eating, and dietary quality remains unclear, particularly among young adults, about whom little is known with regard to nutrition label use. Our study investigated whether nutrition label use mediates the relationship between eating-related attitudes and dietary behaviors among young adult college students. Using cross-sectional online survey data collected in 2010 from a convenience sample in Minneapolis\/St Paul, MN (598 attending a 2-year community college; 603 attending a public 4-year university; mean age 21.5 years; 53.4% nonwhite; 52.5% women), study findings indicate that students who reported frequently reading nutrition labels were more likely to have healthier dietary intakes (eg, less fast food and added sugar; more fiber, fruits, and vegetables) compared to those who read labels sometimes or rarely (P&lt;0.001). Further, frequent nutrition label use was a significant partial mediator of the relationship between eating-related attitude (ie, feeling that it is important to prepare healthy meals) and dietary quality, indicating that label use may be one means by which individuals who value healthy eating translate their attitude into healthy eating behaviors. Even among those who did not believe it was important to prepare healthy meals, frequent nutrition label use was significantly associated with healthier dietary intake, suggesting that label use may operate independently of nutrition-related attitude in contributing to healthful diet.","2092":"","2093":"Esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction results in a variety of postoperative nutrition-related complaints that can impair nutritional intake and nutritional status. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent patients reached the recommended intake of various nutrients at 6 and 12 months after esophagectomy. It was also analyzed whether a suboptimal intake could be explained by the most clinically significant nutrition-related complaints after esophagectomy. In a prospective cohort study (2002 to 2006), the nutrient intake of 96 patients, recorded in preprinted nutritional diaries, was compared with the recommended energy intake in The Netherlands and Recommended Dietary Allowance of protein and micronutrients. Energy and protein intake remained below recommendations in 24% and 7% of the patients, respectively. Less than 10% of the patients had a sufficient intake of all micronutrients. Folic acid, vitamin D, copper, calcium, and vitamin B-1 were the micronutrients most often reported to have a suboptimal intake. Multivariate logistic regression, corrected for preoperative epigastric pain and energy intake, showed that the number of nutrition-related complaints was not an independent risk factor for the presence of a suboptimal intake of nutrients (adjusted odds ratio=1.11; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.31; P = 0.22). This study shows that the intake of micronutrients remains below recommendations in the majority of patients 12 months after esophagectomy.

However, it is unknown whether these genetic risk factors affect relative body fat distribution in the abdominal visceral and subcutaneous compartments. The association between imaging-based abdominal fat mass and waist-size risk variants in the FTO, LEPR, LYPLAL1, MSRA, NRXN3, and TFAP2B genes was investigated. A cross-sectional sample of 60 women was selected among study participants of The Multiethnic Cohort, who were aged 60 to 65 years, of European or Japanese descent, and with a body mass index (calculated as kg\/m(2)) between 18.5 and 40. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging scans were used to measure adiposity. After adjustments for age, ethnicity, and total fat mass, the FTO variants showed an association with less abdominal subcutaneous fat and a higher visceral-to-subcutaneous abdominal fat ratio, with the variant rs9941349 showing significant associations most consistently (P=0.003 and 0.03, respectively). Similarly, the LEPR rs1137101 variant was associated with less subcutaneous fat (P=0.01) and a greater visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (P=0.03) and percent liver fat (P=0.007).

Family flexibility about food choices was assessed using roles, rules, and power concepts from Family Systems Theory. Interviews at baseline revealed dinner vegetable variety was very limited because food preparers served only what everyone liked (a role expectation) and deferred to male partner and children's narrow vegetable preferences (power). Control couples reported no change in vegetable dinner variety post-intervention. Most experimental couples reported in-home tasting and evaluation was worthwhile and somewhat broadened vegetables served at dinners.

Hence, we conducted a 1-year clinical trial to evaluate the effect of dried apple vs dried plum consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women. One-hundred sixty qualified postmenopausal women were recruited from the greater Tallahassee, FL, area during 2007-2009 and were randomly assigned to one of two groups: dried apple (75 g\/day) or dried plum (comparative control). Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months to measure various parameters. Physical activity recall and 7-day dietary recall were also obtained. Neither of the dried fruit regimens significantly affected the participants' reported total energy intake throughout the study period. On the contrary, women who consumed dried apple lost 1.5 kg body weight by the end of the study, albeit not significantly different from the dried plum group. In terms of cholesterol, serum total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the dried apple group compared with the dried plum group only at 6 months. Although dried plum consumption did not significantly reduce serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, it lowered their levels numerically by 3.5% and 8%, respectively, at 12 months compared with baseline. This may explain the lack of significance observed between the groups. However, within the group, women who consumed dried apple had significantly lower serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 9% and 16%, respectively, at 3 months compared with baseline. These serum values were further decreased to 13% and 24%, respectively, after 6 months but stayed constant thereafter. The within-group analysis also reported that daily apple consumption profoundly improved atherogenic risk ratios, whereas there were no significant changes in lipid profile or atherogenic risk ratios as a result of dried plum consumption.

Program delivery costs, weight loss, and self-reported health status were directly assessed through questionnaires and program activity logs. Costs were estimated across a range of enrollment sizes to allow inferences beyond the study sample. Nonparametric and parametric tests of differences across groups for program outcomes were combined with direct program cost estimates and expected value calculations to determine which scales of operation favored alternative formats for lifestyle maintenance. Median weight regain during the intervention year was 1.7 kg for participants in the face-to-face format, 2.1 kg for the telephone format, and 3.1 kg for the mail\/control format. For a typical group size of 13 participants, the face-to-face format had higher fixed costs, which translated into higher overall program costs ($420 per participant) when compared with individual telephone counseling ($268 per participant) and control ($226 per participant) programs. Although the net weight lost after the 12-month maintenance program was higher for the face-to-face and telephone programs compared with the control group, the average cost per expected kilogram of weight lost was higher for the face-to-face program ($47\/kg) compared with the other two programs (approximately $33\/kg for telephone and control).

A retrospective chart audit was conducted to document the error rate in 672 nutrition-related orders placed before, and in 633 orders placed after, implementation of RD diet order entry on high-risk inpatient units. Error rates for all nutrition-related orders decreased by 15% after RD order entry access (P&lt;0.01).

Effectiveness of repeated exposure to vegetables has not been tested in a community-based preschool setting. This randomized controlled trial tested the hypotheses that children who are served unfamiliar vegetables repeatedly in the preschool lunch setting will increase consumption of them, and that consumption will be influenced by peer eating behaviors and parental feeding behaviors. Data were collected in two private preschools in a small northeastern city in 2007. Ninety-six children (aged 3 to 6 years) participated. Schools were randomly assigned to condition. During the first 6 weeks, Preschool A served three vegetables at lunch on 10 separate occasions (ie, 30 days of exposure), while Preschool B continued routine practice. In the 7th week, schools reversed conditions and Preschool B served the vegetables for the next 6 weeks. Consumption data were collected daily in the intervention school and at baseline and post-intervention meals in the control school. PRIMARY OUTCOMES\/STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Analysis of variance was used to examine the effect of vegetable exposure on vegetable intake; multilevel models were used to examine the effect of peer eating behaviors and parental feeding practices on vegetable intake. Repeated exposure did not increase vegetable consumption. Greater consumption by tablemates was a significant predictor of greater vegetable consumption; across the three vegetables, 1 g of peer intake was associated with roughly a 1\/5-g intake increase among the subjects. Overall, children demonstrated wide fluctuation in vegetable consumption from day to day, creating as much variability within subjects as between them.

Creating opportunities for young children to serve as peer models has promise as a strategy to promote vegetable consumption.

This study tested whether 8- to 13-year-old children could complete an early version of the Automated Self Administered 24-hour diet recall (ASA24) and how this compared to an interviewer-administered 24-hour diet recall. One-hundred twenty 8- to 13-year-old children were recruited in Houston from June through August 2009 and randomly assigned to complete either the ASA24 or an interviewer-administered 24-hour diet recall, followed by the other recall mode covering the same time interval. Multivariate analysis of variance, testing for differences by age, sex, and ethnic\/racial group, were applied to percentages of food matches, intrusions, and omissions between reports on the ASA24 and the interviewer-administered 24-hour diet recall. For the ASA24, qualitative findings were reported regarding ease of use. Overall matches between interviewer-administered and ASA24 self-administered 24-hour diet recall was 47.8%. Matches were significantly lower among younger (8- to 9-year-old) compared with older (10- to 13-year-old) children. Omissions on ASA24 (18.9% overall) were most common among 8-year-olds and intermediate among 9-year-olds. Eight- and 9-year-olds had substantial difficulties and often required aid in completing ASA24. Findings from this study suggest that a simpler version of an Internet-based diet recall program would be easier for children to use.","2142":"The relevance of drug?nutrient interactions in daily practice continues to grow with the widespread use of medication. Interactions can involve a single nutrient, multiple nutrients, food in general, or nutrition status. Mechanistically, drug?nutrient interactions occur because of altered intestinal transport and metabolism, or systemic distribution, metabolism and excretion, as well as additive or antagonistic effects. Optimal patient care includes identifying, evaluating, and managing these interactions. This task can be supported by a systematic approach for categorizing interactions and rating their clinical significance. This review provides such a broad framework using recent examples, as well as some classic drug?nutrient interactions. Pertinent definitions are presented, as is a suggested approach for clinicians. This important and expanding subject will benefit tremendously from further clinician involvement.","2143":"Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) is a method for evaluating nutritional status based on a practitioner's clinical judgment rather than objective, quantitative measurements. Encompassing historical, symptomatic, and physical parameters, SGA aims to identify an individual's initial nutrition state and consider the interplay of factors influencing the progression or regression of nutrition abnormalities. SGA has been widely used for more than 25 years to assess the nutritional status of adults in both clinical and research settings. Perceiving multiple benefits of its use in children, we recently adapted and validated the SGA tool for use in a pediatric population, demonstrating its ability to identify the nutritional status of children undergoing surgery and their risk of developing nutrition-associated complications postoperatively. Objective measures of nutritional status, on the other hand, showed no association with outcomes. The purpose of this article is to describe in detail the methods used in conducting nutrition-focused physical examinations and the medical history components of a pediatric Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment tool. Guidelines are given for performing and interpreting physical examinations that look for evidence of loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, and\/or edema in children of different ages. Age-related questionnaires are offered to guide history taking and the rating of growth, weight changes, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity, and any metabolic stress. Finally, the associated rating form is provided, along with direction for how to consider all components of a physical exam and history in the context of each other, to assign an overall rating of normal\/well nourished, moderate malnutrition, or severe malnutrition. With this information, interested health professionals will be able to perform Subjective Global Nutritional Assessment to determine a global rating of nutritional status for infants, children, and adolescents, and use this rating to guide decision making about what nutrition-related attention is necessary. Dietetics practitioners and other clinicians are encouraged to incorporate physical examination for signs of protein-energy depletion when assessing the nutritional status of children.","2144":"Few if any studies have examined weight loss among term newborns by weighing infants daily for the first week of life. Perhaps because so few data exist, there is no standard in the United States for normal newborn weight loss. Our objective was to investigate normal newborn weight loss among infants born in a US Baby-Friendly hospital, by weighing infants daily for the first week of life. Using a prospective cohort design, infants born at an urban Boston, MA, hospital were enrolled within 72 hours of delivery and weighed daily for the first week of life. In hospital, infant weight was obtained from the medical record; post discharge, a research assistant visited the home daily and weighed the baby. All feeds in week 1 of life were recorded. Birth-related factors potentially affecting weight loss were abstracted from the medical record. Complete data were collected on 121 infants. Mean weight loss was 4.9% (range=0.0% to 9.9%); 19.8% (24 of 121) of infants lost &gt;7% of their birth weight; no infant lost &gt;10%. Maximum percent weight loss was significantly associated with feeding type: exclusively and mainly breastfed infants lost 5.5%, mainly formula-fed infants lost 2.7% and exclusively formula-fed infants lost 1.2% (P&lt;0.001). Type of delivery and fluids received during labor were not associated with weight loss. Clinical practices at a Baby-Friendly hospital, which support and optimize breastfeeding, appear to be associated with only moderate weight loss in exclusively and mainly breastfed infants.","2145":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world. NAFLD is tightly linked to insulin resistance and considered to be the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. The cornerstone of any treatment regimen for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle modification focused on weight loss, exercise, and improving insulin sensitivity. Here we review the literature and discuss the role of diet and nutrient composition in the management of NAFLD. Because there are currently no specific dietary guidelines for NAFLD, this review proposes a dietary framework for patients with NAFLD based on the available evidence and extrapolates from dietary guidelines aimed at reducing insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk.","2146":"Adequate iron availability is essential to human development and overall health. Iron is a key component of oxygen-carrying proteins, has a pivotal role in cellular metabolism, and is essential to cell growth and differentiation. Inadequate dietary iron intake, chronic and acute inflammatory conditions, and obesity are each associated with alterations in iron homeostasis. Tight regulation of iron is necessary because iron is highly toxic and human beings can only excrete small amounts through sweat, skin and enterocyte sloughing, and fecal and menstrual blood loss. Hepcidin, a small peptide hormone produced mainly by the liver, acts as the key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin controls movement of iron into plasma by regulating the activity of the sole known iron exporter ferroportin-1. Downregulation of the ferroportin-1 exporter results in sequestration of iron within intestinal enterocytes, hepatocytes, and iron-storing macrophages reducing iron bioavailability. Hepcidin expression is increased by higher body iron levels and inflammation and decreased by anemia and hypoxia. Importantly, existing data illustrate that hepcidin may play a significant role in the development of several iron-related disorders, including the anemia of chronic disease and the iron dysregulation observed in obesity. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to discuss iron regulation, with specific emphasis on systemic regulation by hepcidin, and examine the role of hepcidin within several disease states, including iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, and obesity. The relationship between obesity and iron depletion and the clinical assessment of iron status will also be reviewed.","2147":null,"2148":null,"2149":"Among adolescent girls, the health effects of frequent self-weighing are unclear. This study examines cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between frequency of self-weighing and body mass index (BMI), body satisfaction, weight control behaviors, and binge eating among a diverse population of adolescent girls. The study was conducted in the Minneapolis\/St Paul, MN, metropolitan area between 2007 and 2009. The study population included 356 adolescent girls (mean age 15.7 years); 46.2% of the girls were overweight or obese and &gt;75% were from a racial\/ethnic minority group. Anthropometric and survey data were collected at baseline and at follow-up 9 months later. Hierarchical linear regression models were developed to test associations. Cross-sectionally, frequent self-weighing was associated with lower body satisfaction (P=0.034) and higher rates of healthy (P=0.002), unhealthy (P=0.016), and extreme (P=0.038) weight control behaviors. A quadratic association was found between frequency of self-weighing and binge eating, with girls who weighed themselves least and most frequently reporting the highest prevalences of binge eating (P=0.014). No association was observed between frequency of self-weighing and girls' BMI (P=0.111). Short-term longitudinal associations between baseline frequency of self-weighing and changes in body satisfaction, weight control behaviors, binge eating, or BMI were not observed. Findings suggest that among adolescent girls, frequent self-weighing is cross-sectionally associated with both healthy and potentially harmful unhealthy weight control behaviors, and does not contribute to weight loss over time. Adolescents should not be encouraged to engage in frequent self-weighing.","2150":"Latinos are among the most overweight racial\/ethnic groups of US children. The study aim was to identify parents' perspectives on healthy eating, physical activity, and weight-management strategies for overweight Latino children. Four focus groups were conducted of Mexican immigrant, Mexican-American, Puerto Rican, and other Latino families with overweight children. Parents were asked 33 questions and sampled four healthy substitutes for traditional Latino foods, including multigrain enchiladas and brown rice. Nineteen parents were interviewed in the focus groups. The children?s median body mass index was 23; 60% had a body mass index ?95th percentile. Parents identified 22 themes regarding the most important things parents can do to help overweight children lose weight, including encouragement, not making the child feel left out, the whole family eating healthy, and the parent setting a good example. Parents identified 17 themes regarding the most important things overweight children can do to help themselves lose weight, including eating healthier, limiting portion size and second helpings, drinking more water, increased physical activity, decreased screen time, children educating themselves at school, asking parents for help, and participating in interventions that include the whole family. Challenges to getting kids to exercise included expense, time constraints, and neighborhood safety. Parents were open to integrating healthy substitutes into traditional Latino meals\/snacks, and found them palatable. One mother stated, \"We have to keep our traditional foods, but realize that we can make them more nutritious.\" Parents reported their children would accept high-fiber foods and low-fat dairy. In designing effective weight-management interventions for overweight Latino children, the study findings may prove useful in identifying healthy, well-accepted foods and beverages; agreeable physical activities; suitable targets for reducing inactivity; and efficacious strategies for enhancing traditional foods and meals so that there is an increased likelihood of healthy diet and weight loss. Parental input on the most important things that children and parents can do to help children lose weight and on challenges faced in trying to get children to exercise might provide valuable guidance in devising effective, evidence-based interventions that are likely to be adhered to.","2151":"Although dietary weight-loss counseling usually employs a 500 to 1,000 kcal\/day energy deficit to induce weight loss of 0.5 to 1 kg\/week, this rate of weight loss is rarely achieved in research settings. Biological factors, such as changes in metabolic rate, are partly responsible, but would only account for a small deviation from expected weight loss. There must be other factors, behavioral or related to study design and implementation, that affect the rate of weight loss observed. To examine factors that influence the rate of weight loss obtained in clinical studies. Thirty-five weight-loss studies published between 1995 and 2009 were identified that used dietary counseling to induce weight loss in healthy subjects. Studies were included if they had a duration of at least 6 weeks, used a strategy to counsel subjects to reduce free-living energy intakes, and reported weight-loss data based on a completers analysis. Variables that were associated with the rate of weight loss among age, sex (percent female subjects), initial body weight, frequency of dietary counseling, placebo use, exercise level, study length, and prescribed energy deficit were examined using linear regression analysis. Study length was negatively related to the rate of weight loss (P&lt;0.0001), whereas subject age (P&lt;0.002), subject age squared (P=0.0073), initial body weight (P=0.0003), frequency of dietary counseling (P=0.0197), and prescribed energy deficit (P&lt;0.0001) were positively related to the rate of weight loss observed in clinical studies. These findings provide a tool for investigators and clinical dietitians to predict the rate of weight loss that can be expected within a population given the age, initial body weight, frequency of dietary counseling, and energy deficit prescription. These data from clinical studies suggest that the rate of weight loss is greater in older and heavier subjects and with higher contact frequency and caloric restriction. ","2152":"The Nutrient Rich Foods (NRF) approach to eating uses the NRF Index, a nutrient profiling metric to help consumers choose foods that contain more vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients per kilocalorie. Research is needed to test the efficacy of dietary guidance using nutrient profiling systems to rank foods. To examine whether nutrition education and supporting materials would increase understanding of the NRF approach and improve food shopping, meal planning, consumption of nutrient-rich foods, and diet quality. Unbalanced randomized controlled trial conducted in February to May 2009 with participants assigned to NRF education group (n=128) or control group receiving standard nutrition education (n=61). Adult primary food shoppers and preparers with at least one child in the household aged 3 to 17 years. Group education session and support tools (pocket guide, shopping list, refrigerator magnet, weekly e-mail messages, and biweekly mailings). Surveys of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and two 24-hour telephone dietary recalls at baseline and after an 8-week intervention period. Examined time-by-treatment interactions in outcome measures. Compared to controls, NRF participants increased meal planning (+24.2% vs ?4.9%; P&lt;0.01), ability to identify nutrient-rich foods (+60.2% vs +24.6%; P&lt;0.001), and use of shopping lists (+14.1% vs +3.3%; nonsignificant trend), and consumed more vegetables and fruits (P&lt;0.05). NRF participants improved overall diet quality as shown by their scores on the Healthy Eating Index (P=0.04) and NRF scale scores (nonsignificant trend). Significant improvements were observed in Healthy Eating Index component scores for total fruit; whole fruit; whole grains; saturated fat; and energy from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars. Findings of this study showed that a consumer education program increased participants' use of the NRF approach and improved diet quality.

Because higher salaries are tied to increasing levels of authority and responsibility, RDs must seek management and leadership roles to enjoy the increased remuneration tied to such positions. Advanced-level practice in any area of dietetics demands powerful communication abilities, proficiency in budgeting and finance, comfort with technology, higher-order decision-making\/problem-solving skills, and well-honed human resource management capabilities, all foundational to competent management practice. As RDs envision the future of the dietetics profession, practitioners must evaluate management competence in both hard and soft skills. Just as research is needed to support evidenced-based clinical practice, the same is needed to support management practice across the profession. Dietetics educators and preceptors should be as enthusiastic about management practice as they are clinical practice when educating and mentoring future professionals. Such encouragement and support can mean that new RDs and dietetic technicians, registered, will understand what it takes to advance to higher levels of responsibility, authority, and subsequent enhanced remuneration. In the ever-changing social, legal, ethical, political, economic, technological, and ecological environments of work, food and nutrition professionals who are willing to step forward and assume the risks and responsibilities of management also will share in the rewards, and propel the profession to new heights of recognition and respect.","2159":"","2160":"","2161":"","2162":"","2163":"","2164":"","2165":"","2166":null,"2167":"","2168":"At the behest of the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) Workforce Demand Task Force, a retrospective examination and reanalysis of 12 primary research projects (sponsored by CDR and\/or the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics between 1995 and 2011) was undertaken to identify trends in supply of and demand for registered dietitians (RDs) and dietetic technicians, registered (DTRs). The analysis suggests that supply of RDs (and possibly DTRs) lags slightly behind demand-although, in the case of DTRs, that does not necessarily imply that demand is growing (supply was shrinking throughout most of the study period). The population of both groups is aging, and the number of RDs and DTRs reporting expected retirement in the near future is sure to affect supply\/demand relationships. Neither group reflects the US population as a whole in terms of either sex or racial\/ethnic diversity, and the trend lines in these areas are essentially flat. RD practice is seen to be moving incrementally toward the clinical arena, in inpatient and (increasingly) outpatient settings. The proportion of RDs in clinical long-term-care, as well as in food\/nutrition management and consultation\/business practice, is decreasing; a longer-term trend away from foodservice is noted. There is small growth in both the prevalence and the compensation of clinical specialists in areas like renal, pediatrics, and weight management at the expense of more general clinical practitioners. In a trend likely related to the increase in clinical practice, RD positions are gradually losing managerial responsibility. DTRs have experienced a similar phenomenon. For almost all RD positions in the clinical arena, registration as an RD is a requirement for employment, suggesting that clinical employment should continue to grow along with the increasing health care demand from an aging population. The DTR credential is not required at similarly high rates. A major supply issue is the relative shortage of DTRs in certain parts of the country, particularly the South. Major effects from the June 2009 inauguration of the Pathway III route to registration as a DTR have been noted.","2169":"If upheld as constitutional, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that passed in 2010 promises to change health care delivery systems in the United States, partly by shifting focus from disease treatment to disease prevention. Registered dietitians (RDs) have already taken an active role in health care areas that stand to be directly affected by provisions in the health care reform bill. However, nutrition's vital role in preventing diseases and conditions potentially could translate to additional opportunities for RDs as a result of this reform. Specific dietetics-related areas targeted by health care reform include medical nutrition therapy for chronic conditions and employee wellness incentive programs. However, dietetics practitioners are not necessarily established in the language of the bill as the essential providers of specific services or as reimbursable practitioners. Thus, although it is possible health care reform could affect demand-and, in turn, supply-of RDs, the actual effect of this legislation is difficult to predict.","2170":"The number of credentialed dietetics specialists--approximately 15% of the profession--is proportionately higher than those in other allied health and nursing professions. Credentialed specialists seem to receive greater compensation earlier in their career, but this advantage neutralizes as length of time in the profession increases. A larger proportion of younger registered dietitians (RDs) are specialists, which may mean an increase in supply of specialists in the future. There is considerable interest in creation of health promotion and foodservice management credentials. Consideration should be given to collaborating with other organizations to explore new models of recognition or credentialing for narrow areas of focus. Creating a methodology that can differentiate the tasks and approaches to practice that are unique to advanced practitioners compared with specialists has been a challenge. Prior research has not succeeded in identifying the differences in what advanced practitioners do. Future research to isolate advanced practice must take practice approach into account. A new, research-based, credential for advanced practitioners is possible, or a recognition program for advanced practice RDs could be considered. Precise supply and demand for specialty and advanced practice RDs cannot be measured. Thus, in this technical article, the authors share the available information regarding supply and demand with regard to dietetics specialists and advanced practitioners. It seems there are distinctions among the various levels of practice and recognition of their value to the profession and to the health of the public.","2171":"Many factors affect the current and future practice of dietetics in the United States. This article provides an overview of the most important population risk factors and trends in health care and public policy that are anticipated to affect the current dietetics workforce and future of dietetics training and practice. It concludes with an overview of the state of the current workforce, highlighting the opportunities and challenges it will face in the future. Demographic shifts in the age and racial\/ethnic composition of the US population will be a major determinant of future the dietetics profession because a growing population of older adults with chronic health conditions will require additional medical nutrition therapy services. Dietetics practitioners will work with an increasingly diverse population, which will require the ability to adapt existing programs and services to culturally diverse individuals and communities. Economic factors will affect not only the type, quantity, and quality of food available in homes, but also how health care is delivered, influencing future roles of registered dietitians (RDs) and dietetic technicians, registered (DTRs). As health care services consume a larger percentage of federal and corporate expenditures, health care agencies will continue to look for ways to reduce costs. Health promotion and disease prevention efforts will likely play a larger role in health care services, thus creating many opportunities for RDs and DTRs in preventive care and wellness. Increasingly, dietetics services will be provided in more diverse settings, such as worksites, community health centers, and home-care agencies. To address population-based health care and nutrition priorities effectively, dietetics practice will need to focus on appropriate evidence-based intervention approaches and targets. The workforce needs to be skilled in the delivery of culturally competent interventions across the lifespan, for all population groups, and across all levels of the social-ecological model for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Because there is an assumption that the dietetics profession will experience rates of attrition of 2% to 5% based on historical workforce data, an important consideration is that the current dietetics workforce is limited in terms of diversity. An increasingly diverse population will demand a more diverse dietetic workforce, which will only be achieved through a more focused effort to recruit, train, and retain practitioners from a variety of racial, ethnic, social, and cultural backgrounds. In addition, the geographic distribution of RDs and DTRs must be addressed through strategic planning efforts related to dietetics training to provide access to and delivery of services to meet population needs. Furthermore, the health care workforce is projected to bifurcate as a result of growth in demand for the \"frontline workforce\" that works in direct patient contact. This bifurcation will require the dietetics profession to consider new practice roles and the level of education and training required for these roles in relation to how much the health care delivery system is willing and able to pay for services. There are many challenges and opportunities for the dietetics workforce to address the changing population risk factors and trends in health care and public policy by working toward intervention targets across the social-ecological model to promote health, prevent disease, and eliminate health disparities. Addressing nutrition-related health needs, including controlling costs and improving health outcomes, and the demands of a changing population will require careful research and deliberation about new practice roles, integration in health care teams, workforce supply and demand, and best practices to recruit and retain a diverse workforce.","2172":"The four future views of dietetics workforce supply and demand that will be discussed in this paper illustrate the critical changes and choices ahead for the profession if registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered want vital roles in nutrition, food, and health. These scenarios were built using a four-quadrant approach based on workforce supply and demand. This yielded four views: a preferred future of high supply, high demand; an underprepared future of low supply, high demand; an overproduced future of high supply, low demand, and a feared future of low supply, low demand. These scenarios are not projections about the future; rather, they are designed to help the profession prepare for the future. Registered dietitian leaders participating in a scenario workshop judged either the overproduced or underprepared scenarios to be the most likely future and the preferred future to be the most challenging for the profession.","2173":"The dietetics profession faces many workforce challenges and opportunities to ensure that registered dietitians (RDs) and dietetic technicians, registered (DTRs) are at the forefront of health and nutrition. The profession must prepare for new public priorities, changes in population, and the restructuring of how people learn and work, as well as new advances in science and technology. In September 2010, the Dietetics Workforce Demand Task Force, in consultation with a panel of thought leaders, identified 10 change drivers that affect dietetics workforce supply and demand. This future scan report provides an overview of eight of these drivers. Two change drivers-health care reform and population risk factors\/nutrition initiatives-are addressed in separate technical articles. A change matrix has been included at the end of this executive summary. The matrix contains a summary of each change driver and its expected impact and is designed to present the drivers in the context of a larger, dynamic system of change in the dietetics profession. The impact of any of these change drivers individually and collectively in a dynamic system is uncertain. The outcome of any change driver is also uncertain.

Schools can play an important role in improving children's preferences and food consumption patterns. The US Department of Agriculture's Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) aims to improve children's nutrient intake patterns by offering fresh fruits and vegetables as snacks outside the reimbursable meals programs in elementary schools that serve large numbers of low-income children. Using a nationally representative sample of public elementary schools, this cross-sectional study investigated FFVP participation patterns among schools by demographic and school characteristics. Further, the study investigated the association between FFVP participation and availability of fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables at lunch as reported by school administrators and foodservice staff. Data collected via a mail-back survey from 620 public elementary schools participating in the National School Lunch Program during 2009-2010 were analyzed. Almost 70% of the FFVP-participating schools had a majority of students (&gt;50%) eligible for free and reduced-cost meals. Participating in US Department of Agriculture Team Nutrition Program and having a registered dietitian or a nutritionist on staff were significantly associated with FFVP participation. Based on the results from logistic regression analyses schools participating in the FFVP were significantly more likely (odds ratio 2.07; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.53) to serve fresh fruit during lunch meals. Slightly &gt;25% of public elementary schools across the United States participated in the FFVP, and participation was associated with healthier food availability in school lunches.","2177":"Eighty-percent of the US adult population regularly consumes caffeine, but limited information is available on the extent and patterns of use. Caffeine use is a public health issue and its risks and benefits are regularly considered in scientific literature and the lay media. Recently, new caffeine-containing products have been introduced and are widely available on Army bases and are added to rations to maintain cognitive performance. This study surveyed caffeine consumption and demographic characteristics in 990 US Army soldiers. Data were weighted by age, sex, rank, and Special Forces status. Total caffeine intake and intake from specific products were estimated. Logistic regression was used to examine relationships between caffeine use and soldier demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Eighty-two percent of soldiers consumed caffeine at least once a week. Mean daily caffeine consumption was 285 mg\/day (347 mg\/day among regular caffeine consumers). Male soldiers consumed, on average, 303 mg\/day and females 163 mg\/day (regular consumers: 365 mg\/day for male soldiers, 216 mg\/day for female soldiers). Coffee was the main source of caffeine intake. Among young males, energy drinks were the largest source of caffeine intake, but their intake was not greater than older males. Regression analysis indicated an association of higher caffeine intake with male sex, white race, and tobacco use (P&lt;0.01). Most soldiers consume caffeine in levels accepted as safe, but some consume greater quantities than recommended, although definitive information on safe upper limits of caffeine intake is not available. Labels of caffeine-containing products should provide caffeine content so individuals can make informed decisions.","2178":"Personality influences lifestyle behaviors, and particularly dietary behavior. The possible association of personality with adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) has not been reported. The objective of this study was to analyze the possible association of personality traits with adherence to the MDP, controlling for sociodemographic variables, presence of chronic illnesses, minor psychiatric morbidity, body mass index (BMI), daily smoking, and physical activity. This cross-sectional study included 206 patients, age 18 to 65 years, recruited at a primary health service in Granada, Spain, during 2007 to 2008. The participants answered a questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics, data on personality, and MDP. Personality was measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125). Adherence to MDP was measured using the validated 14-point Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). MEDAS score was directly associated with the character dimension of self-directedness, age, and minor psychiatric morbidity score; and inversely with marital status (widowed, separated, or divorced) and BMI. Because highly self-directed individuals may respond better to diet advice, consideration of personality may prove helpful in the design of interventions to enhance the adherence to MDP. To improve the adherence to MDP in interventions with patients with low self-directedness, more intensive professional support and counseling with tailored messages about the health benefits of MDP may be indicated.","2179":"Heart failure is a common condition in the Western world, particularly among elderly persons and with an ever-aging population, the incidence is expected to increase. Diet in the setting of heart failure is important--patients with this condition are advised to consume a low-salt diet and monitor their weight closely. Nutritional status of patients with heart failure also is important--those with poor nutritional status tend to have a poor long-term prognosis. A growing body of evidence suggests an association between heart failure and micronutrient status. Reversible heart failure has been described as a consequence of severe thiamine and selenium deficiency. However, contemporary studies suggest that a more subtle relationship may exist between micronutrients and heart failure. This article reviews the existing literature linking heart failure and micronutrients, examining studies that investigated micronutrient intake, micronutrient status, and the effect of micronutrient supplementation in patients with heart failure, and focusing particularly on vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, thiamine, other B vitamins, vitamin D, selenium, zinc, and copper.","2180":null,"2181":"The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has important potential for preventing diet-related disease in low-income children. WIC food packages were recently revised to offer foods that better reflect dietary recommendations for Americans. This article reports on how implementation of the new healthier WIC food packages affected access of low-income populations to healthy foods (eg, whole grains, fruit and vegetables, and lower-fat milk). A pre-post store inventory was completed using a standardized instrument to assess availability, variety, quality and prices of WIC-approved foods (65 food items). Stores were assessed before (spring 2009) and shortly after the new WIC package implementation (spring 2010). All convenience stores and nonchain grocery stores located in five towns of Connecticut (N=252), including 33 WIC-authorized stores and 219 non-WIC stores. The healthy food supply score was constructed to summarize postrevision changes in availability, variety, prices of healthy foods, and produce quality. The effect of the WIC food package revisions was measured by differential changes in the scores for stores authorized to accept WIC benefits and stores not participating in WIC, including differences by neighborhood income. Multivariate multilevel regression models were estimated. The 2009 introduction of the revised WIC food packages has significantly improved availability and variety of healthy foods in WIC-authorized and (to a smaller degree) non-WIC convenience and grocery stores. The increase in the composite score of healthy food supply varied from 16% in WIC convenience and grocery stores in higher-income neighborhoods to 39% in lower-income areas. Improved availability and variety of whole-grain products were responsible for most of the increase in the composite score of healthy food supply.

A preference for sweet taste is innate and sweeteners can increase the pleasure of eating. Nutritive sweeteners contain carbohydrate and provide energy. They occur naturally in foods or may be added in food processing or by consumers before consumption. Higher intake of added sugars is associated with higher energy intake and lower diet quality, which can increase the risk for obesity, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. On average, adults in the United States consume 14.6% of energy from added sugars. Polyols (also referred to as sugar alcohols) add sweetness with less energy and may reduce risk for dental caries. Foods containing polyols and\/or no added sugars can, within food labeling guidelines, be labeled as sugar-free. NNS are those that sweeten with minimal or no carbohydrate or energy. They are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as food additives or generally recognized as safe. The Food and Drug Administration approval process includes determination of probable intake, cumulative effect from all uses, and toxicology studies in animals. Seven NNS are approved for use in the United States: acesulfame K, aspartame, luo han guo fruit extract, neotame, saccharin, stevia, and sucralose. They have different functional properties that may affect perceived taste or use in different food applications. All NNS approved for use in the United States are determined to be safe.","2192":"The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) recommend that a standardized set of diagnostic characteristics be used to identify and document adult malnutrition in routine clinical practice. An etiologically based diagnostic nomenclature that incorporates a current understanding of the role of the inflammatory response on malnutrition's incidence, progression, and resolution is proposed. Universal use of a single set of diagnostic characteristics will facilitate malnutrition's recognition, contribute to more valid estimates of its prevalence and incidence, guide interventions, and influence expected outcomes. This standardized approach will also help to more accurately predict the human and financial burdens and costs associated with malnutrition's prevention and treatment, and further ensure the provision of high quality, cost effective nutritional care.","2193":"Diet modification to increase water and fiber consumption is considered an important component in the management of constipation. This prospective randomized study aimed to evaluate the compliance of 86 children with refractory functional constipation (mean age 4.4 years, range 1 to 11 years)-to a high-fiber, high-water diet following either physician's dietary advice (PI group) (n=42) or physician's dietary advice plus personalized diet management by a registered dietitian (DM group) (n=44). Dietary intake was assessed by a 24-hour dietary recall at baseline and 1 month later. The changes in water and fiber consumption were used as compliance criteria. DM group had comparable anthropometric measurements; sex distribution; and baseline intakes of energy, macronutrient, water, and dietary fiber compared with the PI group. Comparison of nutrient intakes between the two visits within each group showed a significant increase in fiber consumption in both groups that was more pronounced in the DM group. Water, energy, and carbohydrate consumption increased significantly only in the DM group. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the intervention group was the only significant independent predictor for the change in fiber and water consumption after controlling for age, sex, and weight-for-age z score. Children receiving personalized diet management for refractory functional constipation achieved better compliance in increasing fiber and water consumption.","2194":"This study used a descriptive, cross-sectional analysis to examine a social ecological model of obesity among African-American female adolescents residing in obesogenic environments. The goal was to identify factors that promote weight resilience, defined as maintaining a healthy body weight despite living in an environment that encourages inactivity and undermines healthy weight behaviors. During 2005 to 2008, weight-resilient (n=32) and obese (n=35) African-American female adolescents (12 to 17 years) living in Detroit, MI, and their caregivers completed measures of individual, family, and extrafamilial weight-resilience factors. Variables related to weight resilience in bivariate analyses were subjected to multivariate analysis using logistic regression to test the hypothesis that these factors independently predicted adolescent membership into the weight-resilient or obese group. As hypothesized, the odds of an adolescent being weight resilient were predicted by lower caregiver body mass index (calculated as kg\/m(2)) (odds ratio [OR]=0.790; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.642 to 0.973), lower caregiver distress (OR=0.796; 95% CI: 0.635 to 0.998), higher caregiver monitoring and supervision of exercise (OR=5.746; 95% CI: 1.435 to 23.004), more frequent full-service grocery store shopping (OR=5.147; 95% CI: 1.137 to 23.298), and more peer support for eating (OR=0.656; 95% CI: 0.445 to 0.969). Contrary to prediction, lower eating self-efficacy (OR=0.597; 95% CI: 0.369 to 0.965) also predicted weight resilience. The model correctly classified 92.5% of all cases. Findings suggest that increasing psychosocial weight-resilience factors across multiple systems might be an important intervention strategy for obese African-American female adolescents residing in obesogenic environments.","2195":"Paradoxically, individuals with food insecurity have been observed to have higher rates of obesity compared with their counterparts with food security. The factors influencing food purchasing behaviors in households with food security vs food insecurity are poorly understood. Using the mixed methods approach of concept mapping, we examined the perceptions and preferences driving the food purchasing behaviors of households with food security vs food insecurity. Twenty-six men and women with food security and 41 men and women with food insecurity from four neighborhoods in Boston, MA, completed the concept mapping process during 2010. Prevalence of overweight and obesity was greater among participants with food insecurity (80.5%) compared with those with food security (61.5%). Participants identified 163 unique factors that influenced their food purchasing behavior. Using multivariate analyses, these factors were grouped into eight unique concepts or clusters that reflected their perceptions of factors hindering healthy eating. Average cluster ratings were similar between participants with food security and food insecurity, suggesting that similar food purchasing behaviors are employed and are perceived similarly in how they hinder or promote healthy eating. The use of emergency food assistance programs may play a role in minimizing the burden of food insecurity while providing access to foods with varying degrees of nutritional quality that may be associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity observed in individuals and households with food insecurity.","2196":"There is a paucity of studies acknowledging the existence of alternative food sources, and factors associated with food purchasing from three common alternative sources: vendedores (mobile food vendors), pulgas (flea markets), and vecinos\/amigos (neighbors\/friends). This analysis aims to examine the use of alternative food sources by Mexican-origin women from Texas-border colonias and determine factors associated with their use. The design was cross-sectional. Promotora-researchers (promotoras de salud trained in research methods) recruited 610 Mexican-origin women from 44 colonias and conducted in-person surveys. Surveys included participant characteristics and measures of food environment use and household food security. Statistical analyses included separate logistic regressions, modeled for food purchase from mobile food vendors, pulgas, or neighbors\/friends. Child food insecurity was associated with purchasing food from mobile food vendors, while household food security was associated with using pulgas or neighbors\/friends. School nutrition program participants were more likely to live in households that depend on alternative food sources. Efforts to increase healthful food consumption such as fruits and vegetables should acknowledge all potential food sources (traditional, convenience, nontraditional, and alternative), especially those preferred by colonia residents. Current findings support the conceptual broadening of the retail food environment, and the importance of linking use with spatial access (proximity) to more accurately depict access to food sources.","2197":null,"2198":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent in clinical weight-loss settings and predicts poor weight-loss outcomes. It is unknown whether the severity of depressive symptoms among those with MDD is associated with diet quality or physical activity levels. This knowledge is important for improving weight-loss treatment for these patients. It was hypothesized that more severe depression is associated with poorer diet quality and lower physical activity levels among individuals with obesity and MDD. Participants were 161 women with current MDD and obesity enrolled in the baseline phase of a weight-loss trial between 2007 and 2010. Depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory II. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index was applied to data from three 24-hour diet recalls to capture overall diet quality. Daily metabolic equivalents expended per day were calculated from three 24-hour physical activity recalls. Greater depression severity was associated with poorer overall diet quality (estimate=-0.26, standard error 0.11; P=0.02), but not with physical activity (estimate=0.07, standard error 0.05; P=0.18), in linear regression models controlling for income, education, depression-related appetite change, binge eating disorder, and other potential confounds. Associations with diet quality were primarily driven by greater intake of sugar (r=0.20; P&lt;0.01), saturated fat (r=0.21; P&lt;0.01), and sodium (r=0.22; P&lt;0.01). More severe depression was associated with poorer overall diet quality, but not physical activity, among treatment-seeking women with MDD and obesity. Future studies should identify mechanisms linking depression to diet quality and determine whether diet quality improves with depression treatment.","2199":null,"2200":"African-American women have the highest prevalence of adult obesity in the United States. They are less likely to participate in weight-loss programs and tend to have a low success rate when they do so. The goal of this project was to explore the use of the Health Belief Model in developing culturally appropriate weight-management programs for African-American women. Seven focus groups were conducted with 50 African-American women. The Health Belief Model was used as the study's theoretical framework. Participants made a clear delineation between the terms healthy weight, overweight, and obese. Sexy, flirtatious words, such as thick, stacked, and curvy were often used to describe their extra weight. Participants accurately described the health risks of obesity. Most believed that culture and genetics made them more susceptible to obesity. The perceived benefits of losing weight included reduced risk for health problems, improved physical appearance, and living life to the fullest. Perceived barriers included a lack of motivation, reliable dieting information, and social support. Motivators to lose weight included being diagnosed with a health problem, physical appearance, and saving money on clothes. Self-efficacy was primarily affected by a frustrated history of dieting. The data themes suggest areas that should be addressed when developing culturally appropriate weight-loss messages, programs, and materials for African-American women.","2201":null,"2202":"Immigration to the United States has been associated with obesity, yet the relationship of acculturation to obesity and energy balance (ie, physical activity\/dietary intake) in adults is a complex issue. Limited longitudinal data are available on immigrant Asians and Pacific Islanders. Analyses were conducted on baseline data and change data from baseline to 24 months in the hotel-based cluster-randomized Work, Weight and Wellness trial involving 15 control and 15 intervention hotels on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Participants were adult employees of predominantly Asian and Pacific Islander ancestry who were assessed one or more times over the course of 24 months. The full sample consisted of 4,236 hotel workers (about 40% of hotel workforce) at baseline, 3,502 hotel workers at Year 1 and 2,963 hotel workers at the 24-month follow up. One thousand one hundred fifteen hotel workers had at least two measurements, and were included in the analysis. The Work, Weight, and Wellness trial was designed to promote weight loss via motivation and support for increases in physical activity and increased access to and consumption of healthy low-fat\/low-energy foods. The measure of acculturation consisted of a score that was a compilation of a participant's age when he or she immigrated to the United States, country of birth, language spoken at home, and years of education. We used mixed effect regression models for cross-sectional baseline models and longitudinal multilevel regression analysis of change in diet and physical activity behaviors and obesity over time using a random intercept. Estimates of the intervention effect are expressed as an annual rate of change for all study outcomes. At baseline acculturation was positively associated with body mass index; physical activity level; and fruit, meat, and sweetened drink intake level. In analyses of change across 24 months, acculturation did not significantly influence change in dietary intake or indexes of obesity (ie, body mass index or waist-to-height ratio). However physical activity increased significantly more in the intervention group during the course of the intervention compared with the control group, which decreased activity, when sociodemographic factors (including acculturation) and food intake behavior were controlled for.

Random assignment occurred at 4 weeks postpartum to either an Intervention group (n=14) or Minimal Care group (n=13) from 2008 through 2010. Three 24-hour dietary recalls were obtained using the Nutrition Data System at 4 and 20 weeks postpartum. Individual MyPyramid Menu Planner accounts were created for the Intervention group and used in face-to-face dietary counseling. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for differences between groups for change in dietary intake and weight. Changes in energy, saturated fat, and percent of energy from added sugars were significantly different between Intervention group and Minimal Care group (-613 [521] kcal vs -171 [435] kcal; P=0.03; -14.9 [14.0] g vs +0.9 [13.4] g; P&lt;0.01; and -3.5% [5.3%] vs +2.2% [4.8%]; P&lt;0.01, respectively).

Studies have established the importance of specific parenting practices to children's beverage consumption; however, no study has examined multiple operationalizations of parenting to better understand where to focus future interventions. The present study examined the relationship between children's sugary beverage consumption and a parenting model that included household food rules, parent modeling of food rules, parent-mediated behaviors, and parent support. Baseline data from Project MOVE\/me Muevo were used. Participants included 541 children, aged 5 to 8 years old, and their parents. Parents completed a 45-minute self-administered survey in Spanish or English, providing information about their child's dietary intake, as well as their parenting practices. Children's sugary beverage consumption included nondiet soda, noncarbonated sugary drinks, and sport drinks. Household food rules and parent modeling of food rules were assessed with seven items each. Parent-mediated behaviors consisted of four behaviors. Parent support was assessed with five items. Parent support and parent-mediated behaviors, including total screen time and eating at fast-food restaurants at least weekly, were associated with greater consumption of sugary beverages in children. No other parenting variables were significant. Encouraging caregivers to promote healthy dietary behaviors and provide healthy choices, limiting children's television and computer use, and reducing fast-food consumption can contribute to reductions in sugary beverage consumption among children.","2217":"This review presents a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between social position and obesity, focusing on stress as a contributing factor. Through a systematic review of the literature, the studies that assess associations between social position, stress levels, dietary behaviors, and obesity risk in human beings were identified. Fourteen studies were retained based upon a priori inclusion\/exclusion criteria. Across studies, individuals in higher status positions tended to have lower stress levels, healthier eating patterns, and lower body weight. Higher stress was associated with less healthy dietary behaviors and with higher body weight. These patterns were more pronounced in women than in men. The nature of the stress-eating-obesity relationship is complicated, and this literature must be developed further, because its advancement may be instrumental in identifying successful stress management techniques that can be used by food and nutrition practitioners to improve nutrition-related outcomes.","2218":null,"2219":"Large disparities exist across ethnic and socioeconomic status groups regarding obesity and other chronic diseases. Eliminating health disparities is a national priority in the United States.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS\/SETTING: Nationally representative data from the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and the Diet and Health Knowledge Survey 1994-96 from 4,356 US adults aged 20 to 65 years were used. Diet was assessed using 24-hour recalls, NHRPF was assessed by 25 questions, and weight status was determined by self-reported weight and height. Index scores were created to measure NHRPF. Diet quality was assessed using the US Department of Agriculture 2005 Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were conducted to examine the associations. Some ethnic differences in NHRPF existed but were small. There were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) and large ethnic differences in diet (blacks had the worst average HEI and whites the best at 47.6 vs 52.3, respectively).

This cross-sectional study examined the association of demographic characteristics, weight status, self-reported academic grades, and behavioral factors with sugar-sweetened soda intake among a nationally representative sample of US high school students. Analysis was based on the 2009 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey and included 16,188 students in grades 9 through 12. The main outcome measure was daily sugar-sweetened soda intake (eg, drank a can, bottle, or glass of soda [excluding diet soda] at least one time per day during the 7 days before the survey). Nationally, 29.2% of students reported drinking sugar-sweetened soda at least one time per day. Logistic regression analyses showed factors significantly associated with sugar-sweetened soda intake at least one time per day included male sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.47), Hispanic ethnicity (vs whites; OR=0.81), earning mostly B, C, and D\/F grades (vs mostly As; OR=1.26, 1.66, and 2.19, respectively), eating vegetables fewer than three times per day (OR=0.72), trying to lose weight (OR=0.72), sleeping &lt;8 hours (OR=1.18), watching television &gt;2 hours\/day (OR=1.71), playing video or computer games or using a computer for other than school work &gt;2 hours\/day (OR=1.53), being physically active at least 60 minutes\/day on &lt;5 days during the 7 days before the survey (OR=1.19), and current cigarette use (OR=2.01).

However, few studies have examined role modeling by caregivers and child-care center policies. This cross-sectional study evaluated the associations between child-care center policies about staff eating practices and caregivers' eating behaviors during mealtime interactions with children. Data were collected in 2008-2009 at 50 North Carolina child-care centers. Caregivers (n=124) reported about modeling healthy eating behaviors to children, trained research staff observed caregivers' (n=112) eating behaviors in classrooms, and directors reported about the presence\/absence of center policies on staff eating practices. About 90% of caregivers reported modeling healthy eating behaviors to children. At 80% of centers, caregivers were observed modeling healthy dietary behaviors (eg, sitting with or eating same foods as children), but at fewer centers they were observed consuming unhealthy foods (eg, fast foods, salty snacks: 25%; and sugar-sweetened beverages: 50%). Although no substantial associations were observed between caregiver behaviors and center policies, effect size estimates suggest differences that may be of clinical significance. For example, caregivers were observed modeling healthy dietary behaviors more frequently at centers that had written policies about staff discouraging unhealthy foods for meals\/snacks and having informal nutrition talks with children at meals. However, caregivers were observed consuming unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages more often at centers with policies that promoted healthier foods for meals\/snacks. Future research should build on this study by using larger samples to understand why healthy food policies in child-care centers may not translate to eating practices among caregivers.","2238":"Data from four cross-sectional studies involving fourth-grade children were analyzed to investigate the relationship between participation in school-provided meals and body mass index (BMI), and the effect observed energy intake has on that relationship.

Direct meal observations were available for a subset of 342 children (54% black; 50% girls) for one to three breakfasts and one to three lunches per child for a total of 1,264 school meals (50% breakfast). Participation in breakfast, lunch, and combined (both meals on the same day) was determined from nametag records compiled for meal observations for each study. Weight and height were measured. A marginal regression model was fit with BMI as the dependent variable; independent variables were breakfast participation, lunch participation, combined participation, sex, age, race, and study. For the subset of children, observed energy intake at breakfast, lunch, and combined was included in additional analyses. Participation in breakfast, lunch, and combined was not significantly associated with BMI regardless of whether analyses included observed energy intake (P values &gt;0.181). The relationship between observed energy intake at breakfast and lunch, separately and combined, with BMI was positive (P values &lt;0.01). In conclusion, these results do not support a relationship between school-meal participation and BMI but do support a relationship between observed energy intake at school meals and BMI during fourth grade.","2239":"This article is the eighth in a series exploring the importance of research design, statistical analysis, and epidemiology in nutrition and dietetics research, and the second in a series focused on multivariate statistical analytical techniques.

This study was conducted to identify 5-year and 10-year longitudinal predictors of F\/V intake in young adulthood. The sample included 476 male and 654 female participants enrolled in a population-based cohort study (Projects EAT-I, II, and III [Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults]). Participants completed surveys and food frequency questionnaires in Minneapolis\/St Paul, MN, high school classrooms in 1998-1999 (mean age=15.8 years, adolescence) and follow-up measures in 2003-2004 (mean age=20.4 years, emerging adulthood) and 2008-2009 (mean age=26.2 years, young adulthood). In young adulthood, average daily intake was 0.9 servings of fruit (excluding juice) and 1.8 servings of vegetables (excluding potatoes). Factors examined in adolescence and in emerging adulthood that were predictive of F\/V intake in young adulthood included favorable taste preferences, fewer perceived time barriers to healthy eating, higher home availability of F\/V, and limited home availability of unhealthy foods. Analyses also identified additional factors that were specifically relevant to fruit (eg, breakfast patterns) or vegetable intake (eg, home food preparation) and of particular relevance during emerging adulthood (eg, significant other's healthy eating attitudes).

Whether gastric or postpyloric feeding route is more beneficial to patients receiving enteral nutrition remains controversial. To test whether illness severity influences the efficacy of enteral feeding route on clinical outcomes in patients with critical illness. A 2-year prospective, randomized, clinical study was conducted to assess the differences between the nasogastric (NG) and nasoduodenal (ND) tube feedings on clinical outcomes. One hundred one medical adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring enteral nutrition were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to the NG (n=51) or ND (n=50) feeding route during a 21-day study period. Illness severity was dichotomized as \"less severe\" and \"more severe,\" with the cutoff set at Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 20. Daily energy and protein intake, feeding complications (eg, gastric retention\/vomiting\/diarrhea\/gastrointestinal bleeding), length of ICU stay, hospital mortality, nitrogen balance, albumin, and prealbumin. Two-tailed Student t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze significant differences between variables in the study groups. Multiple regression was used to assess the effects of illness severity and enteral feeding routes on clinical outcomes. Among less severely ill patients, no differences existed between the NG and ND groups in daily energy and protein intake, feeding complications, length of ICU stay, and nitrogen balance. Among more severely ill patients, the NG group experienced lower energy and protein intake, more tube feeding complications, longer ICU stay, and poorer nitrogen balance than the ND group. To optimize nutritional support and taking medical resources into account, the gastric feeding route is recommended for less severely ill patients and the postpyloric feeding route for more severely ill patients.

A cohort of 3,126 youth from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey who were surveyed in 2004 (5th grade) and 2007 (8th grade) were used for the analysis. Multivariate linear regression with individual fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect of SNAP participation on the frequency of consumption of each beverage type in the preceding week. The fixed effects controlled for factors specific to the youth, such as sex, race\/ethnicity, and time-invariant bias in reporting SNAP participation or beverage consumption. Overall participation in SNAP increased from 19.5% to 20.3% between 2004 and 2007, with 14.4% reporting a different participation status in 2007 as compared with 2004. SNAP participation was not found to be predictive of the frequency of soft drink, 100% fruit juice, or milk consumption among youth. In its current state, SNAP may serve to replace lost income for qualifying households, but not alter their food and beverage choices. Interventions that support access to and incentivize the consumption of more healthful foods and beverages may be successful in improving the nutritional quality of intake.","2250":"Children spend much of their day in school, and authorities have called for improvements in the school food environment. However, it is not known whether changes have occurred since the federal wellness policy mandate took effect in 2006-2007. We examined whether the school food environment in public and private elementary schools changed over time and examined variations by school type and geographic division. Survey data were gathered from respondents at nationally representative samples of elementary schools during the 2006-2007 and 2009-2010 school years (respectively, 578 and 680 public schools, and 259 and 313 private schools). Topics assessed included competitive foods, school meals, and other food-related practices (eg, school gardens and nutrition education). A 16-item food environment summary score was computed, with possible scores ranging from 0 (least healthy) to 100 (healthiest). Multivariate regression models were used to examine changes over time in the total school food environment score and component items, and variations by US census division. Many practices improved, such as participation in school gardens or farm-to-school programs, and availability of whole grains and only lower-fat milks in lunches. Although the school food environment score increased significantly, the magnitude of change was small; as of 2009-2010 the average score was 53.5 for public schools (vs 50.1 in 2006-2007) and 42.2 for private schools (vs 37.2 in 2006-2007). Scores were higher in public schools than in private schools (P&lt;0.001), but did not differ by race\/ethnicity or school size. For public schools, scores were higher in the Pacific and West South Central divisions compared with the national average.

During every year, the corresponding district policy for each school was gathered and coded for provisions pertaining to the use of food as a reward. School practices did not change over time and as of the 2009-2010 school year, respondents in 42.1% and 40.7% of schools, respectively, indicated that food was not used as a reward for academic performance or for good student behavior. In multivariate logistic regression analyses controlling for school characteristics and year, having a district policy that prohibited the use of food as a reward was significantly associated with school respondents reporting that food was not used as a reward for academic performance (P&lt;0.05) or for good student behavior (P&lt;0.05). School-level respondents in the West and the Midwest were less likely to report that food was not used as a reward than were respondents in the South and Northeast. As of 2009-2010, only 11.9% of the districts in our study prohibited the use of food as a reward.

There was complex interaction between each of the eight themes. Many of the themes were very specific to the dietetics context, including being a small discipline, being in newer universities without established research portfolios, having greater teaching responsibilities, and the availability of grants in areas related to nutrition. The factors influencing research involvement among dietetics faculty members are complex and interact; therefore, solutions to overcome these barriers will need to account for this. These findings provide understanding that can contribute to this endeavor.","2257":null,"2258":"Cross-sectional studies suggest that parents eat more saturated fat than nonparents. Few studies exist on other dietary factors or using longitudinal data. To compare change in daily dietary intake of selected foods and nutrients across 7 years between adults who have children enter the home and those who do not. Analysis of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study. Dietary intake was assessed by the diet history questionnaire used in that study. The main dependent variables were change from baseline (1985-1986) to Year 7 (1992-1993) for intake of percent saturated fat, energy, daily servings of fruits and vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages, and frequency of fast-food intake. The primary independent variable was whether or not participants had children in their home by Year 7. Two thousand five hundred sixty-three black and white adults who did not have children at baseline from four urban centers. Linear regression adjusting for baseline demographics, energy intake, physical activity, and smoking status. Parents were more likely to be women, full-time workers, married, and older. Diet did not differ at baseline. Seven-year change in diet for parents and nonparents did not differ for fruit and vegetable, sugar-sweetened beverages, or fast food. Percent saturated fat decreased among both groups but parents showed a smaller decrease in percent saturated fat (1.59 vs 2.10; P&lt;0.001). Compared with nonparents, parents increased energy intake by 79 kcal\/day (P=0.058), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Parenthood does not have unfavorable effects on parents' diets, but neither does it lead to significant improvements. In fact, parents lag behind their childless counterparts in decreasing intake of saturated fat and overall diets remain poor. Nutrition education programs and food and nutrition practitioners should develop strategies to support and motivate healthy eating habits in parents. ","2259":null,"2260":"Manager attitude is influential in female employees' perceptions of workplace breastfeeding support. Currently, no instrument is available to assess manager attitude toward supporting women who wish to combine breastfeeding with work. We developed and piloted an instrument to measure manager attitudes toward workplace breastfeeding support entitled the \"Managers' Attitude Toward Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire,\" an instrument that measures four constructs using 60 items that are rated agree\/disagree on a 4-point Likert rating scale. We established the content validity of the Managers' Attitude Toward Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire measures through expert content review (n=22), expert assessment of item fit (n=11), and cognitive interviews (n=8). Data were collected from a purposive sample of 185 front-line managers who had experience supervising female employees, and responses were scaled using the Multidimensional Random Coefficients Multinomial Logit Model. Dimensionality analyses supported the proposed four-construct model. Reliability ranged from 0.75 to 0.86, and correlations between the constructs were moderately strong (0.47 to 0.71). Four items in two constructs exhibited model-to-data misfit and\/or a low score-measure correlation. One item was revised and the other three items were retained in the Managers' Attitude Toward Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire. Findings of this study suggest that the Managers' Attitude Toward Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire measures are reliable and valid indicators of manager attitude toward workplace breastfeeding support, and future research should be conducted to establish external validity. The Managers' Attitude Toward Breastfeeding Support Questionnaire could be used to collect data in a standardized manner within and across companies to measure and compare manager attitudes toward supporting breastfeeding. Organizations can subsequently develop targeted strategies to improve support for breastfeeding employees through efforts influencing managerial attitude.","2261":null,"2262":"Grocery stores represent a unique opportunity to initiate nutrition interventions. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a 12-week, child-focused intervention at one grocery store. An observational uninterrupted time-series design was implemented from May to September 2009. The Healthy Kids campaign consisted of a point-of-purchase kiosk featuring fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks as well as a sampling pod comprised of food items from the kiosk. Data collection included changes in sales for featured products; observations of customers at the kiosk\/intervention; and brief questionnaires for customers who engaged with the kiosk. Descriptive statistics were computed for questionnaire responses and observational data. Correlational analyses were conducted to identify potential predictors of engagement. Sales data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Results showed an overall increase in the proportion of sales of the featured items to total store sales during the intervention period (P&lt;0.05). Individual items that increased sales during the intervention period included whole-wheat bagels, bananas, radishes, honey, sunflower seeds, baked tortilla chips, and almond butter (P&lt;0.05). Almost two thirds (61.7%) of the patrons interviewed noticed the Healthy Kids kiosk, with about one quarter (28.7%) indicating that they purchased at least one item. Fifty-eight percent reported that the kiosk encouraged them to buy healthier foods.","2263":"The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 authorized the Secretary of the US Department of Agriculture to establish science-based nutrition standards for competitive foods and beverages sold in school that are, at a minimum, aligned with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), while still providing districts with discretion in regulating the competitive food and beverage environment. The objective of this study was to examine the extent to which district competitive food and beverage policies had specific and required limits aligned with 2010 DGA recommendations, and to inform US Department of Agriculture efforts as they develop competitive food and beverage standards. Competitive food and beverage policies were compiled for the 2009-2010 school year from a nationally representative sample of 622 districts. Each policy was double-coded for compliance with selected 2010 DGA recommendations (ie, restrictions on sugars, fats, trans fats, and sodium in foods and restrictions on regular soda, other sugar-sweetened beverages, and fat content of milk). Descriptive statistics were computed, clustered to account for the sample design, and weighted to account for districts nationwide. District nutrition policies were strongest for elementary schools. Nationwide, &lt;5% of districts met or exceeded all of the previously mentioned nutrient requirements examined. Fat and sugar content of foods and soda availability were more commonly addressed. Areas that require attention include stronger nutrition standards at the secondary level, limits on trans fats, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages other than soda, and fat content of milk, and greater availability of produce and whole grains at all sale locations.","2264":"School cafeterias can play an important role in providing healthy meals. Although schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are required to meet minimum program standards, advocates recommend that innovations be sought to enhance menu dietary quality. This study evaluated the Chef Initiative, a 2-year pilot study in two Boston middle schools, designed to increase the availability and consumption of healthier school foods. Between 2007 and 2009, a professional chef trained cafeteria staff to prepare healthier school lunches (ie, more whole grains, fresh\/frozen fruits and vegetables, and less sugar, salt, saturated fats, and trans fats). Meal nutrient compositions were monitored from 2007 to 2009, and a plate waste study conducted in the spring of 2009 compared food selection and consumption patterns among students at Chef Initiative schools, with students receiving standard school lunches at two matched control schools. Paired t tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine differences in menus and mixed-model analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in students' food selection and consumption between Chef Initiative and control schools. Overall, the Chef Initiative schools provided healthier lunches and the percent of foods consumed at Chef Initiative and control schools were similar (61.6% vs 57.3%; P=0.63). Of the areas targeted, there was greater whole-grain selection and vegetable consumption; 51% more students selected whole grains (P=0.02) and students consumed 0.36 more vegetable servings\/day (P=0.01) at Chef Initiative schools. The potential of chefs collaborating with cafeteria staff to improve the availability, selection, and consumption of healthier meals is promising.","2265":"Energy density is a relatively new concept that has been identified as an important factor in body weight control in adults and in children and adolescents. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 encourages consumption of an eating pattern low in energy density to manage body weight. This article describes the systematic evidence-based review conducted by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), with support from the US Department of Agriculture's Nutrition Evidence Library, which resulted in this recommendation. An update to the committee's review was prepared for this article. PubMed was searched for English-language publications from January 1980 to May 2011. The literature review included 17 studies (seven randomized controlled trials, one nonrandomized controlled trial, and nine cohort studies) in adults and six cohort studies in children and adolescents. Based on this evidence, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded that strong and consistent evidence in adults indicates that dietary patterns relatively low in energy density improve weight loss and weight maintenance. In addition, the committee concluded that there was moderately strong evidence from methodologically rigorous longitudinal cohort studies in children and adolescents to suggest that there is a positive association between dietary energy density and increased adiposity. This review supports a relationship between energy density and body weight in adults and in children and adolescents such that consuming diets lower in energy density may be an effective strategy for managing body weight.","2266":"","2267":"","2268":"","2269":"","2270":"","2271":"","2272":"Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly Food Stamp Program) participants can use their benefits at many farmers' markets. However, most markets have only one market-operated wireless point-of-sale (POS) card swipe terminal for electronic benefits transfer (EBT) transactions. It is not known whether providing each farmer\/vendor with individual wireless POS terminals and subsidizing EBT fees will increase SNAP\/EBT purchases at farmers' markets. To evaluate the effects of multiple vendor-operated wireless POS terminals (vs a single market-operated terminal) on use of SNAP benefits at an urban farmers' market. Time-series analyses of SNAP\/EBT sales. The Clark Park farmers' market in West Philadelphia, PA, which accounts for one quarter of all SNAP\/EBT sales at farmers' markets in Pennsylvania. Vendors were provided with individual wireless POS terminals for 9 months (June 2008-February 2009.) The pilot program covered all equipment and wireless service costs and transaction fees associated with SNAP\/EBT, credit, and debit sales. Monthly SNAP\/EBT sales at the Clark Park farmers' market. SNAP\/EBT sales data were collected for 48 months (January 2007-December 2010). Time-series regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the intervention period (June 2008-February 2009) on SNAP\/EBT sales, controlling for seasonal effects and total SNAP benefits issued in Philadelphia. The intervention was associated with a 38% increase in monthly SNAP\/EBT sales. Effects were greatest during the busy fall market seasons. SNAP\/EBT sales did not remain significantly higher after the intervention period. Providing individual wireless POS terminals to farmers' market vendors leads to increased sales. However, market vendors indicated that subsidies for equipment costs and fees would be needed to break even. Currently, SNAP provides some support for these services for supermarket and other SNAP retailers with landline access, but not for farmers' markets. ","2273":null,"2274":"","2275":"Characterizing relationships between diet, body weight, and health is complicated by reporting errors in dietary intake data that are associated with body weight. The objectives of this study were to assess changes in reporting across days (reactivity) on food checklists and associations between reactivity and body mass index (BMI) using data from two cross-sectional studies: 1) the Recontacting Participants in the Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition study (n = 297), which was conducted in 2003-2004 and included a 7-day checklist and a 4-day food record (FR), and 2) the America's Menu Daily Food Report Study (n=530), which was conducted in 1996 and included a 30-day checklist. Zero-inflated Poisson regression was used to assess effects of reporting day on frequency of consumption for the checklists and number of items reported for the FR. Interactions between day and BMI were tested using contrast statements. Frequency of reported consumption declined across days among males and females for total items and many of the eight food groups on the 7-day checklist; among females, the effect of reporting day differed by BMI category for the meat, fish, and poultry group. Smaller declines across days were observed for some of the 22 food groups on the 30-day checklist; no interactions with BMI were apparent. No reporting day effects were observed in the FR data. The results suggest inconsistent reactivity across days, possibly reflecting changes in reporting or consumption behavior. However, the effects are generally small and independent of body weight, suggesting that checklists are potentially useful for the study of body weight and diet."},"articletitle":{"0":"For 25 years
