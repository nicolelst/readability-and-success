CNTYMEs improve selectivity among cationic catecholamines because secondary reactions are enhanced, but no anions have been studied. Here, we compared fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) of dopamine and anionic interferents 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and L-ascorbic acid (AA) at CNTYMEs and carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs). At CFMEs, dopamine current decreases with increasing FSCV repetition frequency at pH 7.4, whereas DOPAC and AA have increasing currents with increasing frequency, because of less repulsion at the negative holding potential. Both DOPAC and AA have side reactions after being oxidized, which are enhanced by trapping. At pH 4, the current increases for DOPAC and AA because they are not repelled. In addition, AA has a different oxidation pathway at pH 4, and an extra peak in the CV is enhanced by trapping effects at CNTYMEs. At pH 8.5, co-detection of dopamine in the presence of DOPAC and AA is enhanced at 100 Hz frequency because of differences in secondary peaks. Thus, the trapping effects at CNTYMEs affects anions differently than cations and secondary peaks can be used to identify dopamine in mixture of AA and DOPAC with FSCV.","2":null,"3":"In efforts to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, researchers have attempted to both increase the thickness of battery electrodes and increase the relative fractions of active material. One system that has both of these attributes are sintered thick electrodes comprised of only active material. Such electrodes have high areal capacities, however, detailed understanding is needed of their transport properties, both electronic and ionic, to better quantify their limitations to cycling at higher current densities. In this report, efforts to improve models of the electrochemical cycling of sintered electrodes are described, in particular incorporation of matrix electronic conductivity which is dependent on the extent of lithiation of the active material and accounting for initial gradients in lithiation of active material in the electrode that develop as a consequence of transport limitations during charging cycles. Adding in these additional considerations to a model of sintered electrode discharge resulted in improved matching of experimental cell measurements.","4":"Fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is an analytical technique that was first developed over 30 years ago. Since then, it has been extensively used to detect dopamine using carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMEs). More recently, electrode modifications and waveform refinement have enabled the detection of a wider variety of neurochemicals including nucleosides such as adenosine and guanosine, neurotransmitter metabolites of dopamine, and neuropeptides such as enkephalin. These alterations have facilitated the selectivity of certain biomolecules over others to enhance the measurement of the analyte of interest while excluding interferants. In this review, we detail these modifications and how specializing CFME sensors allows neuro-analytical researchers to develop tools to understand the neurochemistry of the brain in disease states and provide groundwork for translational work in clinical settings.","5":"Carbon fiber-microelectrodes (CFMEs) are considered to be one of the standard electrodes for neurotransmitter detection such as dopamine (DA). DA is physiologically important for many pharmacological and behavioral states, but is readily metabolized on a fast, subsecond timescale. Recently, DA metabolites such as 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) were found to be involved in physiological functions, such as movement control and progressive neuro degeneration. However, there is no current assay to detect and differentiate them from DA. In this study, we demonstrate the co-detection of similarly structured neurochemicals such as DA, 3-MT, and DOPAL. We accomplished this through electrodepositing CFMEs with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) polymers. This endowed the bare unmodified CFMEs with surface charge, physical, and chemical differences, which resulted in the improved sensitivity and selectivity of neurotransmitter detection. The differentiation and detection of 3-MT, DOPAL, and DA will potentially help further understand the important physiological roles that these dopaminergic metabolites play in vivo.","6":null,"7":null,"8":"Fundamental research and practical assembly of rechargeable calcium (Ca) batteries will benefit from an ability to use Ca foil anodes. Given that Ca electrochemistry is considered a surface-film-controlled process, understanding the interface's role is paramount. This study examines electrochemical signatures of several Ca interfaces in a benchmark electrolyte, Ca(BH4)2\/tetrahydrofuran (THF). Preparation methodologies of Ca foils are presented, along with Ca plating\/stripping through either pre-existing, native calcium hydride (CaH2), or pre-formed calcium fluoride (CaF2) interfaces. In contrast to earlier work examining Ca foil in other electrolytes, Ca foils are accessible for reversible electrochemistry in Ca(BH4)2\/THF. However, the first cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycle reflects persistent, history-dependent behavior from prior handling, which manifests as characteristic interface-derived features. This behavior diminishes as Ca is cycled, though formation of a native interface can return the CV to interface-dominated behavior. CaF2 modification enhances such interface-dominance; however, continued cycling suppresses such features, collectively indicating the dynamic nature of certain Ca interfaces. Cell configuration is also found to significantly influence electrochemistry. With appropriate preparation of Ca foils, the signature of interface-dominated behavior is still present during the first cycle in coin cells, but higher current density compared to three-electrode cells along with moderate cycle life are readily achievable.","9":"Infectious diseases commonly occur in contaminated water, food, and bodily fluids and spread rapidly, resulting in death of humans and animals worldwide. Among infectious agents, viruses pose a serious threat to public health and global economy because they are often difficult to detect and their infections are hard to treat. Since it is crucial to develop rapid, accurate, cost-effective, and in-situ methods for early detection viruses, a variety of sensors have been reported so far. This review provides an overview of the recent developments in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for detecting viruses and use of these sensors on environmental, clinical and food monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors for determining viruses are divided into four main groups including nucleic acid-based, antibody-based, aptamer-based and antigen-based electrochemical biosensors. Finally, the drawbacks and advantages of each type of sensors are identified and discussed.","10":"This mini review investigates the relationship and interactions of polymers under an applied electric field (AEF) for sensor applications. Understanding how and why polymers are reoriented and manipulated by under an AEF is essential for future growth in polymer-based electrochemical sensors. Examples of polymers that can be manipulated in an AEF for sensor applications are provided. Current methods of monitoring polymer reorientation will be described, but new techniques are needed characterize polymer response to various AEF stimuli. The unique and reproducible stimuli response of polymers elicited by an AEF has significant potential for growth in the sensing community.","11":null,"12":"Nanosensors built with pre-pulled glass nanopipettes, including bare or chemically modified nanopipettes and fully or partially filled solid nanoelectrodes, have found applications in chemical and biological sensing via resistive-pulse, current rectification, and electrochemical sensing. These nanosensors are easily fabricated and provide advantages through their needle-like geometry with nanometer-sized tips, making them highly sensitive and suitable for local measurements in extremely small samples. The variety in the geometry and layout have extended sensing capabilities. In this review, we will outline the fundamentals in fabrication, modification, and characterization of those pre-pulled glass nanopipette based nanosensors and highlight the most recent progress in their development and applications in real-time monitoring of biological processes, chemical ion sensing, and single entity analysis.","13":null,"14":null,"15":null,"16":null,"17":"Superconformal Au deposition is demonstrated in a Na3Au(SO3)2 + Na2SO3 electrolyte using Bi species to catalyze the reduction of Au(SO3)2 3-. Micromolar additions of Bi3+ to the sulfite-based electrolyte accelerate the reduction of Au(SO3)2 3- as shown by hysteretic voltammetry and rising chronoamperometric transients. Superconformal feature filling is observed over a defined range of Bi3+ concentration, potential and hydrodynamics. Over a more limited parameter range, approximately -0.9 V to -0.95 V, void-free, bottom-up filling of Damascene trenches is achieved. Furthermore, in the presence of significant convection the bottom-up filling is accompanied by passivation of the free surface. Bottom-up feature filling is characterized by a counterintuitive dependence of the free surface reactivity on the available flux of the Bi3+ accelerator species suggestive of an unusual coupling between hydrodynamic transport, shear and interfacial chemistry.","18":null,"19":"Electrochemically gas-evolving systems are utilized in alkaline water electrolysis, hydrogen production, and many other applications. To design and optimize these systems, high-fidelity models must account for electron-transfer, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, electrode porosity, and hydrodynamics as well as the interconnectedness of these phenomena. Further complicating these models is the production and presence of bubbles. Bubble nucleation naturally occurs due to the chemical reactions and impacts the reaction rate. Modeling bubble growth requires an accurate accounting of interfacial mass transfer. When the bubble becomes large, detachment occurs and the system is modeled as a two-phase flow where the bubbles can then impact material transport in the bulk. In this paper, we review the governing mathematical models of the physicochemical life cycle of a bubble in an electrolytic medium from a multiscale, multiphysics viewpoint. For each phase of the bubble life cycle, the prevailing mathematical formulations are reviewed and compared with particular attention paid to physicochemical processes and the impact the bubble. Through the review of a broad range of models, we provide a compilation of the current state of bubble modeling in electrochemically gas-evolving systems.","20":"Carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn and fiber-microelectrodes were developed for neurotransmitter detection using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Fibers were made by suspending CNTs in acid\/surfactant and extruding into acetone\/polyethyleneimine (PEI) and compared to a CNT yarn. They were FSCV frequency independent for dopamine up to 100 Hz. With faster frequencies, up to 500 Hz, high currents are maintained, which allows a 2 ms sampling rate for FSCV, compared to 100 ms. CNT fibers have rough surfaces which trap dopamine and dopamine-o-quinone (DOQ), creating more reversible CVs. CNT yarns and fibers are beneficial for high sensitivity, rapid measurements of neurotransmitters.","21":null,"22":null,"23":"This work examines the filling of Through Silicon Vias (TSV) by Ni deposition from a NiSO4 + NiCl2 + H3BO3 electrolyte containing a branched polyethyleneimine suppressor. Feature filling occurs due to the interaction of transport limited suppressor adsorption and its consumption by potential dependent metal deposition. The interaction between surface topography and suppressor transport yields a sharp transition from passive to active deposition within the TSV. The transition is associated with significant incorporation of the suppressor, or its components, within the Ni deposit that results in grain refinement evident by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Potential waveforms that progressively shift the location of the passive-active transition upward to optimize feature filling were examined. The evolution of feature filling and deposit microstructure are compared to predictions of a three-dimensional model that reflect critical behavior associated with suppressor-derived, S-shaped negative differential resistance (S-NDR). The model uses adsorption and consumption kinetics obtained from voltammetric measurements of the critical potential associated with suppression breakdown. Good agreement between experiment and simulation is demonstrated.","24":"High temporal resolution of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is widely appreciated in fundamental and applied electrochemistry to quantitatively investigate rapid dynamics of electron transfer and neurotransmission using ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs). Faster potential scan, however, linearly increases the background current, which must be subtracted for quantitative FSCV. Herein, we numerically simulate fast-scan nanogap voltammetry (FSNV) for quantitative detection of diffusing redox species under quasi-steady states without the need of background subtraction while maintaining high temporal resolution of transient FSCV. These advantages of FSNV originate from the use of a parallel pair of cylindrical UMEs with nanometer-wide separation in contrast to FSCV with single UMEs. In FSNV, diffusional redox cycling across the nanogap is driven voltammetrically at the generator electrode and monitored amperometrically at the collector electrode without the transient background. We reveal that the cylindrical collector electrode can reach quasi-steady states ~104 times faster than the generator electrode with identical sizes to allow for fast scan. Double-microcylinder and nanocylinder UMEs enable quasi-steady-state FSNV at hundreds volts per second as practiced for in-vivo FSCV and megavolts per second as achieved for ultra-FSCV, respectively. Rational design and simple fabrication of double-cylinder UMEs are proposed to broaden the application of nanogap voltammetry.","25":"Organic additives are typically used in the pulse electrodeposition of copper (Cu) to prevent void formation during the filling of high aspect ratio features. In this work, the role of bath chemistry as modified by organic additives was investigated for its effects on Cu trench microstructure. Polyethylene glycol (PEG), bis(3-sulfopropyl) disulfide (SPS), and Janus green b (JGB) concentrations were varied in the Cu electrodeposition bath. Results indicated a correlation between the JGB\/SPS ratio and the surface roughness and residual stresses in the Cu. Electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) and transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) were used to study the cross-sectional microstructure in the trenches. Finer grain morphologies appeared in trenches filled with organic additives as compared to additive-free structures. Cu trench (111) texture also decreased with increasing organic additive concentrations due to more pronounced influence of sidewall seed layers on trench features. Twin density in the microstructure closely tracked calculated stresses in the Cu trenches. A comprehensive microstructural analysis was conducted in this study, on an area of focus that has garnered little attention from the literature, yet can have a major impact on microelectronic reliability.","26":"Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) offers a powerful method to isolate affinity oligonucleotides known as aptamers, which can then be used in a wide range of applications from drug delivery to biosensing. However, conventional SELEX methods rely on labor intensive and time consuming benchtop operations. A simplified microfluidic approach is presented which allows integration of the affinity selection and amplification stages of SELEX for the isolation of target-binding oligonucleotides by combining bead-based biochemical reactions with free solution electrokinetic oligonucleotide transfer. Free solution electrokinetics allows coupling of affinity selection and amplification for closed loop oligonucleotide enrichment without the need for offline processes, flow handling components or gel components, while bead based selection and amplification allow efficient manipulation of reagents and reaction products thereby realizing on-chip loop closure and integration of the entire SELEX process. Thus the approach is capable of multi-round enrichment of oligonucleotides using simple transfer processes while maintaining a high level of device integration, as demonstrated by the isolation of an aptamer pool against a protein target (IgA) with significantly higher binding affinity than the starting library in approximately 4 hours of processing time.","27":null,"28":"This work presents superconformal, bottom-up Au filling of high aspect ratio through silicon vias (TSVs) along with a predictive framework based on the coupling of suppression breakdown and surface topography. The work extends a previous study of superconformal Au deposition in lower aspect ratio TSVs. Deposition was performed in a Na3AuSO3 electrolyte containing a branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) deposition-rate suppressing additive. Voltammetric measurements using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) were used to assess the impact of the PEI suppressor concentration and transport on the rate of metal deposition, enabling the interplay between metal deposition and suppressor adsorption to be quantified. The positive feedback associated with suppression breakdown gives rise to an S-shaped negative differential resistance (S-NDR). The derived kinetics for suppressor adsorption and consumption were used in a mass conservation model to account for bottom-up filling of patterned features. Predictions, including the impact of deposition potential and additive concentration on feature filling, are shown to match experimental results for filling of TSVs. This further generalizes the utility of the additive derived S-NDR model as a predictive formalism for identifying additives capable of generating localized, void-free filling of TSVs by electrodeposition.","29":null,"30":"Electrochemical systems suffer from poor management of evolving gas bubbles. Improved understanding of bubbles behavior helps to reduce overpotential, save energy and enhance the mass transfer during chemical reactions. This work investigates and reviews the gas bubbles hydrodynamics, behavior, and management in electrochemical cells. Although the rate of bubble growth over the electrode surface is well understood, there is no reliable prediction of bubbles break-off diameter from the electrode surface because of the complexity of bubbles motion near the electrode surface. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) are the most common experimental techniques to measure bubble dynamics. Although the PIV is faster than LDA, both techniques are considered expensive and time-consuming. This encourages adapting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods as an alternative to study bubbles behavior. However, further development of CFD methods is required to include coalescence and break-up of bubbles for better understanding and accuracy. The disadvantages of CFD methods can be overcome by using hybrid methods. The behavior of bubbles in electrochemical systems is still a complex challenging topic which requires a better understanding of the gas bubbles hydrodynamics and their interactions with the electrode surface and bulk liquid, as well as between the bubbles itself.","31":null,"32":"It has previously demonstrated that cholesterol efflux from the cell plasma membrane is increased in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to a wild-type control. A noninvasive means of characterizing plasma membrane cholesterol efflux at the surface of airway tissue of CF patients is needed to extend the trends found in animal models of CF to the human disease state. Microelectrode-induced cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane of cells at the surface of tissue is proposed as a strategy to demonstrate increased cholesterol efflux for CF in human subjects. Data demonstrating detection of cholesterol efflux from the human buccal mucosa is reported as proof-of-concept for an in vivo diagnostic assay.","33":"The anodic dissolution of aluminum metal was investigated in the Lewis acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquid, aluminum chloride-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. The investigation was conducted on aluminum rotating disk electrodes as a function of potential, ionic liquid composition, and temperature. Two different dissolution mechanisms were realized. At modest overpotentials, dissolution takes place under mixed kinetic-mass transport control. However, as the overpotential is increased to induce higher dissolution rates and\/or the ionic liquid is made more acidic, the dissolution reaction transitions to a potential-independent passivation-like process ascribed to the formation of a porous solid layer of AlCl3(s). At a fixed temperature and composition, the limiting passivation current density displays Levich behavior and also scales linearly with the concentration of AlCl4 - in the ionic liquid. The heterogeneous kinetics of the Al dissolution reaction were measured in the active dissolution potential regime. The exchange current densities were independent of the composition of the ionic liquid, and the anodic transfer coefficients were close to zero and seemed to be independent of the Al grain size.","34":null,"35":null,"36":null,"37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":"We present experimentally observed molecular adsorbate coverages (e.g., O(H), OOH and HOOH) on real operating dealloyed bimetallic PtMx (M = Ni or Co) catalysts under oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) conditions obtained using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). The results reveal a complex Sabatier catalysis behavior and indicate the active ORR mechanism changes with Pt-O bond weakening from the O2 dissociative mechanism, to the peroxyl mechanism, and finally to the hydrogen peroxide mechanism. An important rearrangement of the OOH binding site, an intermediate in the ORR, enables facile H addition to OOH and faster O-O bond breaking on 111 faces at optimal Pt-O bonding strength, such as that occurring in dealloyed PtM core-shell nanoparticles. This rearrangement is identified by previous DFT calculations and confirmed from in situ measured OOH adsorption coverages during the ORR. The importance of surface structural effects and 111 ordered faces is confirmed by the higher specific ORR rates on solid core vs porous multi-core nanoparticles.","41":"The corrosion of carbon in the cathodes of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells leads to electrode collapse, reduced active catalyst area, and increased surface hydrophilicity. While these effects have been linked to performance degradation over cell lifetime, the role of corrosion in the evolving water balance has not been clear. In this study, neutron imaging was used to evaluate the through-plane water distribution within several cells over the course of accelerated stress testing using potential holds and square-wave cycling. A dramatic decrease in water retention was observed in each cell after the cathode was severely corroded. The increasing hydrophilic effect of carbon surface oxidation (quantified by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was overwhelmed by the drying effect of increased internal heat generation. To evaluate this mechanism, the various observed electrode changes are included in a multiphase, non-isothermal one-dimensional cell model, and the simulated alterations to cell performance and water content are compared with those observed experimentally. Simulation results are consistent with the idea that collapse and compaction of the catalyst layer is the dominant limitation to cell performance and not the lower amounts of active Pt surface area, and that higher temperature gradients result in drying out of the cell.","42":null,"43":"Three types of fluorinated carbon, all in their original form and upon sequential chemical lithiations via n-butyllithium, were investigated by (13)C and (19)F solid-state NMR methods. The three starting CF(x) materials [where x = 1 (nominally)] were fiber based, graphite based, and petroleum coke based. The aim of the current study was to identify, at the atomic\/molecular structural level, factors that might account for differences in electrochemical performance among the different kinds of CF(x). Differences were noted in the covalent F character among the starting compounds and in the details of LiF production among the lithiated samples.","44":"This work concerns the design, the synthesis, and the characterization of the N-butyl-N-ethylpiperidinium N,N-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (PP(24)TFSI) ionic liquid (IL). To impart Li-ion transport, a suitable amount of lithium N,N-bis-(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is added to the IL. The Li-IL mixture displays ionic conductivity values on the order of 10(-4) S cm(-1) and an electrochemical stability window in the range of 1.8-4.5 V vs Li(+)\/Li. The voltammetric analysis demonstrates that the cathodic decomposition gives rise to a passivating layer on the surface of the working electrode, which kinetically extends the stability of the Li\/IL interface as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The LiTFSI-PP(24)TFSI mixture is incorporated in a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) matrix to form various electrolyte membranes with different LiTFSI-PP(24)TFSI contents. The ionic conductivity of all the membranes resembles that of the LiTFSI-IL mixture, suggesting an ionic transport mechanism similar to that of the liquid component. NMR measurements demonstrate a reduction in the mobility of all ions following the addition of LiTFSI to the PP(24)TFSI IL and when incorporating the mixture into the membrane. Finally, an unexpected but potentially significant enhancement in Li transference number is observed in passing from the liquid to the membrane electrolyte system.","45":null,"46":"Carbon-based electrode materials have been widely used for many years for electrochemical charge storage, energy generation, and catalysis. We have developed an electrode material with high specific capacitance by entrapping graphite nanoparticles into a sol-gel network. Films from the resulting colloidal suspensions were highly porous due to the removal of the entrapped organic solvents from sol-gel matrix giving rise to high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas (654 m(2)\/g) and a high capacitance density ( approximately 37 F\/g). An exponential increase of capacitance was observed with decreasing scan rates in cyclic voltammetry studies on these films suggesting the presence of pores ranging from micro (&lt; 2 nm) to mesopores. BET surface analysis and scanning electron microscope images of these films also confirmed the presence of the micropores as well as mesopores. A steep drop in the double layer capacitance with polar electrolytes was observed when the films were rendered hydrophilic upon exposure to a mild oxygen plasma. We propose a model whereby the microporous hydrophobic sol-gel matrix perturbs the hydration of ions which moves ions closer to the graphite nanoparticles and consequently increase the capacitance of the film.","47":"Ionic liquids thermodynamically compatible with Li metal are very promising for applications to rechargeable lithium batteries. 1-methyl-3-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (P(13)TFSI) is screened out as a particularly promising ionic liquid in this study. Dimensionally stable, elastic, flexible, nonvolatile polymer gel electrolytes (PGEs) with high electrochemical stabilities, high ionic conductivities and other desirable properties have been synthesized by dissolving Li imide salt (LiTFSI) in P(13)TFSI ionic liquid and then mixing the electrolyte solution with poly(vinylidene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) copolymer. Adding small amounts of ethylene carbonate to the polymer gel electrolytes dramatically improves the ionic conductivity, net Li ion transport concentration, and Li ion transport kinetics of these electrolytes. They are thus favorable and offer good prospects in the application to rechargeable Li batteries including open systems like Li\/air batteries, as well as more \"conventional\" rechargeable lithium and lithium ion batteries."},"articletitle":{"0":"Platinum Nanoparticle Size and Density Impacts Purine Electrochemistry with Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry.","1":"Different Electrochemical Behavior of
