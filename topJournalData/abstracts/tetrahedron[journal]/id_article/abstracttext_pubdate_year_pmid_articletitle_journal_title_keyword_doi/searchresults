of 2,1-benzothiazines are useful synthetic intermediates for a variety of applications. We became interested in developing a one-pot procedure to S-2-halophenyl-2,1-benzothiazines as potential precursors to P,N type ligands for metals. Accordingly, we reacted S-2-halophenyl-S-methylsulfoximines with 2-bromobenzaldehydes using the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction under conditions previously developed in our laboratory. We found that 2-halophenylmethyl sulfoximines show lower reactivity in process than methylphenyl sulfoximine. Among the 2-(S)-2-halophenyl-(S)-methylsulfoximines tested, S-2-fluorophenyl-S-methyl sulfoximine was found to afford higher yields of benzothiazines than the bromine- or chlorine-substituted congeners. In the coupling of S-2-halophenyl-S-methylsulfoximines to 2-bromobenzaldehyde, using Ruphos as a ligand gave the best yields.","1":"The scientific community has found deep interest in anthraquinone-based compounds due to their therapeutic properties and challenging structural elements. Various architecturally beautiful natural products have been successfully synthesized in recent decades utilizing two main strategies: either an early-stage synthesis of the anthraquinone and further elongation of the system, or a late-stage introduction of the anthraquinone ring moiety. Select syntheses of complex anthraquinone monomers and dimers within the past 20 years are described with an emphasis on the retrosynthetic disconnections that shape the anthraquinone-installation strategy.","2":"A chemoenzymatic convergent synthesis of 10-benzyloxy narciclasine from bromobenzene was accomplished in 16 steps. The key transformations included toluene dioxygenase-mediated hydroxylation, nitroso Diels-Alder reaction and intramolecular Heck cyclization. The unnatural derivative of narciclasine was subjected to biological evaluation and its activity was compared to other C-10 and C-7 compounds prepared previously.","3":"We report synthetic efforts toward the regiocontrolled installation of the prenyl moiety in debromoflustramine A by the regiospecific photodecarbonylation of a prenyl-substituted ketone. Synthetic approaches to access the plausible photodecarbonylation substrates beginning from tryptamine were evaluated. Initial attempts to synthesize a suitable substrate for photodecarbonylation were hampered by a lack of substrate crystallinity (a prerequisite for solid-state photochemistry). Ultimately, a crystalline substrate could be accessed to attempt the key step by judicious selection of N-substituents. Although the photodecarbonylation did not result in the desired reverse prenylation, this study highlights the troubleshooting and optimization required for crystal phase photochemistry and underscores methods that can be used to control substrate crystallinity.","4":null,"5":"Classic acetyl thioester protection\/deprotection methodologies are widely used in organic synthesis, but deprotection step usually requires harsh conditions not suitable for labile substrates. In this work, a new method for thioester deprotection using a thiotransesterification approach is described. Firstly, thioglycolic acid (TGA) was identified as a good deprotecting reagent in solution. In order to develop a thiol polymer-supported reagent, TGA was anchored to a PEG-based resin through an amide bond (TG-NCO-SH). Both homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches were conveniently carried out at room temperature, in aqueous buffer at pH 8. The mild conditions were suitable for alkyl and phenyl thioesters. Moreover labile thioesters containing thiazolidine and oxazolidine scaffolds, bearing amine, ester and acetal functionalities were also deprotected. The polymer-supported TGA gave better deprotection yields compared to TGA in solution, yields ranging from 61 to 90%. The feasibility of the recovery and reuse of TG-NCO-SH reagent was explored, showing it can be reused at least five times without lossing the activity.","6":"In this full article, a detailed study of a distal alkenyl C-H arylation and alkylation through the palladium\/norbornene (NBE) cooperative catalysis is described. Both aminopyridine- and oxime ether-type directing groups have been found effective for this transformation, allowing functionalization of diverse allyl amines and homoallyl alcohols. In addition, the C5,C6-substititued NBEs show optimal reactivity and selectivity. Various cis-olefins can be transformed to the corresponding arylated or alkylated trisubstituted alkenes with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity. Preliminary mechanistic studies support the Catellani pathway instead of the Heck pathway.","7":"A short and flexible synthesis of substituted indoles employing two palladium-catalyzed reactions, a Barluenga cross-coupling of p-tosylhydrazones with 2-nitroarylhalides followed by a palladium-catalyzed, carbon monoxide-mediated reductive cyclization has been developed. A one-pot, two-step methodology was further developed, eliminating isolation and purification of the cross-coupling product. This was accomplished by utilizing the initially added 0.025 equivalents of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride, thus serving a dual role in the cross-coupling and the reductive cyclization. It was found that addition of 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane and carbon monoxide after completion of the Barluenga reaction afforded, in most cases, significantly better overall yields.","8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":"We present a case study to demonstrate how complex molecule synthesis can benefit from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. Theory is applied in two contexts: testing the chemical intuition used in retrosynthetic planning, along with expediting the resolution of unexpected challenges encountered during the course of the synthesis. From a computational lens, we examine retrospectively the strategies employed and the decisions made during our synthetic efforts toward the diterpenoid natural product ineleganolide. Seemingly logical and robust hypotheses are found to be ill-fated after theoretical investigation. Prior knowledge of these issues may have potentially saved valuable time and resources during our synthetic efforts. This cautionary tale suggests that synthetic campaigns can benefit from computational evaluation of synthetic plans.","13":"We have experimentally and computationally explored the sluggish Diels-Alder reactivities of the geminally substituted 5,5-dimethylcyclopentadiene and 5,5-dimethyl-2,3-diazacyclopentadiene (4,4-dimethyl-4H-pyrazole) scaffolds. We found that geminal dimethylation of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclopentadiene to 1,2,3,4,5,5-hexamethylcyclopentadiene decreases the Diels-Alder reactivity towards maleimide by 954-fold. Quantum mechanical calculations revealed that the decreased Diels-Alder reactivities of gem-dimethyl substituted cyclopentadienes and 2,3-diazacyclopentadienes are not a consequence of unfavorable steric interactions between the diene and dienophile as reported previously, but a consequence of the increased repulsion within the gem-dimethyl group in the transition state. The findings have implications for the use of cyclopentadienes in \"click\" chemistry.","14":"Despite recent advancements in the selective generation and coupling of organic radical species, the alkoxycarbonyl radical remains underexplored relative to other carbon-containing radical species. Drawing inspiration from new strategies for generating acyl radical equivalents utilizing dual N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis and photocatalysis, we have prepared dimethylimidazolium esters that can function as an alkoxycarbonyl radical surrogate under photocatalytic conditions. We demonstrate the synthetic utility of these azolium-based partners through the preparation of esters arising from the coupling of this radical surrogate with an oxidatively generated alkyl radical.","15":"A concise total synthesis of (-)-4-desacetoxy-1-oxovindoline is disclosed, bearing a single heteroatom exchange in the core structure of the natural product 4-desacetoxyvindoline. Central to the synthesis is powerful oxadiazole intramolecular [4+2]\/[3+2] cycloaddition cascade that formed four C-C bonds, created three new rings, and established five contiguous stereocenters about the new formed central 6-membered ring.","16":"The hydroperoxidation of alkyl enol ethers using N-hydroxyphthalimide and molecular oxygen occurred in the absence of catalyst, initiator, or light. The reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism that is initiated by N-hydroxyphthalimide-promoted autoxidation of the enol ether substrate. The resulting dioxetane products decompose in a chemiluminescent reaction that allows for photochemical activation of N-hydroxyphthalimide in the absence of other light sources.","17":"This review article highlights selected advances in triphosgene-enabled organic synthetic reactions that were reported in the decade of 2010-2019. Triphosgene is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. It serves as a convenient substitute for the toxic phosgene gas. Despite its first known preparation in the late 19th interestingly began only three decades ago. Despite the relatively short history, triphosgene has been proven to be very useful in facilitating the preparation of a vast scope of value-added compounds, such as organohalides, acid chlorides, isocyanates, carbonyl addition adducts, heterocycles, among others. Furthermore, applications of triphosgene in complex molecules synthesis, polymer synthesis, and other techniques, such as flow chemistry and solid phase synthesis, have also emerged in the literature.","18":"Analogs of nucleosides and nucleotides represent a promising pool of potential therapeutics. This work describes a new synthetic route leading to 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorotetradialdose D-nucleoside phosphonates. Moreover, a new universal synthetic route leading to tetradialdose d-nucleosides bearing purine nucleobases is also described. All new compounds were tested as triphosphate analogs for inhibitory potency against a variety of viral polymerases. The fluorinated nucleosides were transformed to phosphoramidate prodrugs and evaluated in cell cultures against various viruses including influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","19":"Incorporation of the epigenetic modifier suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) into a potato dextrose broth culture of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. AST0006 affected its polyketide biosynthetic pathway providing two new 3-(4-oxopyrano)-chromen-2-ones, aspyranochromenones A (1) and B (2), and the isocoumarin, (-)-6,7-dihydroxymellein (3). Eight additional metabolites (4-11) and two biotransformation products of SAHA (12-13) were also encountered. The planar structures and relative configurations of the new metabolites 1-2 were elucidated with the help of high-resolution mass, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic data and the absolute configurations of 1-3 were determined by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD data. Possible biosynthetic pathways to 1 and 2 are presented.","20":null,"21":"Originated in China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)- the highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 29 million people worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.15% (according to World Health Organization's (WHO's) report, September 2020) and the number is exponentially increasing with no remedy whatsoever discovered till date. But it is not the first time this infectious viral disease has appeared, in 2002 SARS-CoV infected more than 8000 individuals of which 9.6% patients died and in 2012 approximately 35% of MERS-CoV infected patients have died. Literature reports indicate that a chymotripsin-like cystein protease (3CLpro) is responsible for the replication of the virus inside the host cell. Therefore, design and synthesis of 3CLpro inhibitor molecules play a great impact in drug development against this COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we are discussing the anti-SARS effect of some small molecule 3CLpro inhibitors with their various binding modes of interactions to the target protein.","22":"Efficient approaches that enable the synthesis of analogs of natural product antibiotics are needed to keep up with the emergence of multiply-resistant strains of pathogenic organisms. One promising candidate in this area is fidaxomicin, which boasts impressive in vitro anti-tubercular activity but has poor systemic bioavailability. We designed a flexible synthetic route to this target to enable the exploration of new chemical space and the future development of analogs with superior pharmacokinetics. We developed a robust approach to each of the key macrocyclic and sugar fragments, their union via stereoselective glycosylation, and a convergent late-stage macrolide formation with fully glycosylated fragments. Although we were able to demonstrate that the final Suzuki cross-coupling and ring-closing metathesis steps enabled macrocycle formation in the presence of the northern resorcylic rhamnoside and southern novioside sugars, these final steps were hampered by poor yields and the formation of the unwanted Z-macrocycle as the major stereoisomer.","23":"Dilemmaones A-C are naturally occurring tricyclic indole alkaloids possessing a unique hydroxymethylene or methoxymethylene substituent at the C2 position of the indole core and a C6-C7 fused cyclopentanone. Dilemmaone B has been prepared in 5 steps from 5-methylindan-1-one, and dilemmaone A has been prepared in 3 steps from a common precursor, 6-bromo-5-methyl-7-nitroindan-1-one. In both syntheses, key steps include a Kosugi-Migita-Stille cross coupling and a reductive cyclization using hydrogen gas and a transition metal catalyst.","24":"Influenza is a serious respiratory disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality due to both annual epidemics and pandemics; its treatment involves the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. (-)-Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu) approved in 1999, is one of the most potent oral anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitors. Consequently, more than 70 Tamiflu synthetic procedures have been developed to date. Herein, we highlight the evolution of Tamiflu synthesis since its discovery over 20 years ago in the quest for a truly efficient, safe, cost-effective and environmentally benign synthetic procedure. We have selected a few representative routes to give a clear account of the past, present and the future with the advent of enabling technologies.","25":null,"26":"The Michael addition step and the following C5 isomerization in Hayashi's synthesis of Oseltamivir was studied by means of a DFT mechanistic study. These steps are crucial for the viability of the process where the formation of a single stereoisomer is required. The results indicate that the addition reaction is under thermodynamic and not kinetic control and that the key factor determining the reaction stereoselectivity are the stereochemical constraints imposed by all substituents in the cyclohexane ring. The DFT results indicate that cyclohexylthiol should behave similarly to p-toluylthiol, the one actually employed, and tert-butylthiol should increase the ratio between isomers favoring the desired S configuration of the C5 atom.

Cobalt-catalyzed peroxidation of these cyclic lactones afforded silyl peroxides in diastereomeric ratios ranging from 91:9 to 97:3.","29":"Recently [11C]mG4P012 (previously [11C]KALB012 and presently named as [11C]PXT012253 by Prexton Therapeutics) had been used as a biomarker during the preclinical development of a potential therapeutic drug, PXT0002331 (an mGluR4 PAM), for PD and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. [11C]mG4P012 was shown to be a promising PET radioligand for mGluR4 in the monkey brain and for further development in human subjects. However, the previously reported multi-step synthesis of the thiophenol precursor suffered from low yields and difficult workup procedures. To support the translational research of [11C]mG4P012 and the other potential applications, we have developed a new route for synthesis of the thiophenol precursor and optimized the reaction conditions. The synthesis of N-(4-chloro-3-mercaptophenyl)picolinamide from 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene has been greatly improved from 8% to 52% total yield with easy handling and in gram scales.","30":null,"31":null,"32":"","33":"Reductive late-stage functionalization of gibberellic acid is reported using three fluoroarylborane Lewis acids; (B(C6F5)3, B(3,5-C6H3(CF3)2), and B(2,4,6-C6H2F3)3) in combination with a tertiary silane and a borane (HBCat) reductant.

Herein we report an enantioselective synthesis of an advanced intermediate corresponding to the tricyclic core common to the guanacastepenes and heptemerones. Highlights of this work include sequential Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative allylic alkylation reactions to generate the two all carbon quaternary stereocenters, the use of ring-closing metathesis to close the A ring in the presence of a distal allyl sidechain, and a region and diastereoselective oxidation of an trienol ether to introduce oxygenation on the A ring.","39":"Over the past three decades, Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become a mainstay of organic synthesis. In particular, catalysts derived from biaryl monophosphines have shown wide utility in forming C-N bonds under mild reaction conditions.

The structure of a proposed biosynthetic monomer, lindenatriene, was recently called into question. Its attempted synthesis produced a compound whose 1H NMR spectrum differed significantly from the spectrum of a monomer produced by oligomer pyrolysis. Here we propose that the original structural assignment after pyrolysis was correct and instead the spectra of synthetic materials were misinterpreted. Reanalysis of 2D NMR data suggest that lindenatriene isomerizes (formal [1,7]-hydrogen shift) upon treatment with base.","41":"Pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids represent a structurally intriguing class of natural products that display an array of useful biological properties. Here, we present a versatile and scalable platform for the synthesis of this diverse family - and in particular the antitumor discorhabdins - built upon sequential selective C-H functionalization of tryptamine. The utility of this strategy is showcased through short formal syntheses of damirones A-C, makaluvamines D and I, and discorhadbin E. Additionally, we describe efforts to develop the first catalytic asymmetric entry to the discorhabdin subclass.","42":"Conjugated dienes and polyenes are central structural motifs of natural products, and key synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis and materials science. We describe herein a palladium-catalyzed dienylation of aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl triflates, nonaflates and iodides that were previously identified as recalcitrant substrates for the sulfolene-mediated catalytic dienylation. The method has now been successfully expanded to C-O and C-I dienylation, demonstrating broad scope with respect to sulfonates, iodides and sulfolenes.

The substrates for these reactions are generated in 3-5 steps from commercially available materials, and products are obtained in good yield with up to &gt;20:1 diastereoselectivity. The stereochemical outcome of the sulfamide alkene addition is consistent with a mechanism involving anti-aminopalladation of the alkene, whereas the stereochemical outcome of the urea alkene addition is consistent with a syn-aminopalladation mechanism.","45":"The enantioselective dichlorination of alkenes is a continuing challenge in organic synthesis owing to the limitations of selective and independent antarafacial delivery of both electrophilic chlorenium and nucleophilic chloride to an olefin. Development of a general method for the enantioselective dichlorination of isolated alkenes would allow access to a wide variety of polyhalogenated natural products. Accordingly, the enantioselective suprafacial dichlorination of alkenes catalyzed by electrophilic organoselenium reagents has been developed to address these limitations. The evaluation of twenty-three diselenides as precatalysts for enantioselective dichlorination is described, with a maximum e.r. of 76:24 Additionally, mechanistic studies suggest an unexpected Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process may be operative.","46":"This manuscript describes a modular method for preparing N-alkyl phosphinic amides from primary or secondary alcohols and primary phosphinic amide (R1R2P=ONH2) nucleophiles via transfer hydrogenation.

Our group has developed a series of silylations of primary C-H bonds that occur with site selectivity and diastereoselectivity resulting from an approach to run the reactions as intramolecular processes. These reactions have become practical by using an alcohol or amine as a docking site for a hydrosilyl group, thereby leading to intramolecular silylations of C-H bonds at positions dictated by the presence common functional groups in the reactants.

Further, 2-D-L-Tryptophan is stable in many buffers used for biological studies.","65":"The oxidative addition of phenolic electrophiles at Ni(0) in the presence of monodentate phosphine ligands was studied with both dispersion-free and dispersion-containing DFT methods. With the popular bulky ligand PCy3, consideration of dispersion has a striking effect on the predicted ligation state of nickel during oxidative addition of aryl sulfamates. Dispersioncontaining methods such as M06L indicate a clear preference for a bis-phosphine ligated transition state (TS), while dispersion free methods like B3LYP strongly favor a monophosphine ligated TS. This discrepancy in predicted ligation state is also found with small phosphines (PMe3) in combination with some aryl electrophiles (carbamates, acetates, pivalates, chlorides), but a bis-PMe3-ligated TS is predicted regardless of dispersion for other electrophiles (sulfamates, mesylates, tosylates). DFT calculations that include dispersion also offer a possible explanation for the observed poor efficacy of P t Bu3 as a ligand in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.","66":null,"67":"The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is of interest to the chemical industry, as many synthetic materials can be derived from CO2. To help determine the reagents needed for the functionalization of carbon dioxide this experimental and computational study describes the reduction of CO2 to formate and CO with hydride, electron, and proton sources in the presence of sterically bulky Lewis acids and bases. The insertion of carbon dioxide into a main group hydride, generating a main group formate, was computed to be more thermodynamically favorable for more hydridic (reducing) main group hydrides. A ten kcal\/mol increase in hydricity (more reducing) of a main group hydride resulted in a 35% increase in the main group hydride's ability to insert CO2 into the main group hydride bond. The resulting main group formate exhibited a hydricity (reducing ability) about 10% less than the respective main group hydride prior to CO2 insertion. Coordination of a second identical Lewis acid to a main group formate complex further reduced the hydricity by about another 20%. The addition of electrons to the CO adduct of t Bu3P and B(C6F5)3 resulted in converting the sequestered CO2 molecule to CO. Reduction of the CO2 adduct of t Bu3P and B(C6F5)3 with both electrons and protons resulted in only proton reduction.","68":"A highly stereoselective method for achieving the anti-Mannich reaction of aldehydes and ketones with ethyl (4-methoxyphenylimino)acetate was realized using the modularly designed organocatalysts (MDOs) self-assembled from cinchona alkaloid derivatives and (A)-pyrrolidien-3-carboxylic acid in the reaction media.

The proposed method is facile, uses ethanol as a green solvent, and results in uniquely substituted benzo[b]thiophene structures with isolated yields up to 96%. The most useful component of this methodology is the selective introduction of bromine atoms at every available position (2-7) around the benzo[b]thiophene ring, while keeping position 3 occupied by a specific halogen atom such as Cl, Br or I. Aromatic halogens are useful reactive handles; therefore, the selective introduction of halogens at specific positions would be valuable in the targeted synthesis of bioactive molecules and complex organic materials via metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.

The latter provided the final fragment with excellent stereochemical control.","78":"A panel of three lipid-modified, functionalized biphenyl cross-linkers (fBph) were synthesized and subsequently employed in the preparation of the stapled oxyntomodulin (OXM) analogs. In a luciferase-based reporter assay, these stapled OXM analogs showed varying degree of potency in activating GLP-1R and GCGR, presumably due to the disparate effect of the lipid chains on the local environment close to the ligand-receptor binding interface. In particular, the fBph-1 cross-linked peptide with the lipid chain attached to position-3 of the biphenyl cross-linker exhibited the highest dual agonist activity.","79":null,"80":null,"81":"Heteroaryl thioethers, comprised of pyridines and diazines, are an important class of compounds with relevance to medicinal chemistry.

The first one proceeds in six steps and 34% overall yield and the second one in five steps and an overall yield of 69% starting from commercially available starting material 5,6-dimethoxybenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (6). The enantiomers of ORG9935 were separated by chiral column chromatography and the absolute stereochemistry of the (+)-enantiomer, ORG20865 was determined by X-ray crystallography to possess the (S)-configuration. The (-)-enantiomer, ORG20864, was therefore assigned the (R)-stereochemistry. The biologically less active (+)-isomer ORG20865 was converted to racemic ORG9935 under basic conditions, which then can be separated again into the enantiomers. The crystal structure of ORG20865 is notable for having the highest Z' for any known pharmaceutical substance.","85":"The biosynthesis of glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) has been an active area of research for decades. Nonetheless, insights into the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes required for installing the aromatic crosslinks, which form their cup-shaped topologies and render GPAs bioactive, have only recently emerged. Presently, little is known about the substrate scope and promiscuity of the P450 enzymes. Herein, we report that OxyBvan, the P450 enzyme that installs the first crosslink in vancomycin biosynthesis, is capable of catalyzing the formation of its conventional C-O-D bis-aryl ether bond in non-natural substrates and, furthermore, the formation of a second, novel linkage when D-Trp is incorporated at position 6. HR-MS\/MS and isotope labeling studies indicate the second crosslink is formed between rings A and B, resulting in a novel GPA-type scaffold. OxyB is also capable of installing two crosslinks in kistamicin- and complestatin-like substrate peptides. These findings highlight the utility of OxyBvan in creating crosslinked GPA derivatives and provide clues regarding the unusual biosynthesis of kistamicin.","86":"Carbon-carbon bonds are integral for pharmaceutical discovery and development. Frequently, C-C bond reactions utilize expensive catalyst\/ligand combinations and\/or are low yielding, which can increase time and expenditures in pharmaceutical development. To enhance C-C bond formation protocols, we developed a highly efficient, selective, and combinatorially applicable Friedel-Crafts acylation to acetylate the C-3 position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines. The reaction, catalyzed by aluminum chloride, is both cost effective and more combinatorial friendly compared to acetylation reactions requiring multiple, stoichiometric equivalents of AlCl3. The protocol has broad application in the construction of acetylated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines with an extensive substrate scope. All starting materials are common and the reaction requires inexpensive, conventional heating methods for adaptation in any laboratory.

In general, highly selective carbon-bromine bond cross couplings were observed using for example bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride (2 mol-%) in 1,4-dioxane at reflux. In contrast, reactions using the same pre-catalyst but in the presence of a three-fold excess of lithium chloride in N,N-dimethylformamide at ambient temperature were in most cases selective for coupling at the carbon-triflate bond. Overall, isolated yields and the selectivity for carbon-bromine bond coupling were significantly higher compared to carbon-triflate bond coupling.","89":"A full account of our previously disclosed synthesis of the monoterpene dimer cardamom peroxide is reported.

Isocyanate 6 can be coupled to amines at room temperature or to alcohols in refluxing dichloroethane to obtain the corresponding urea or carbamate linked ligand systems. The coupling of isocyanate 6 with TREN followed by deprotection gave the tris-HOPO 10, an interesting target as it has both cationic and anionic binding sites. The HOPO hydroxylamine linker 11 was shown to be especially valuable as its coupling with carboxylic acids proceeds with the concomitant generation of an additional hydroxamate ligand moiety in the framework.

The benzannulation reaction is employed to install the aromatic C-ring via the reaction of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbene complex in which the carbene complex is attached to a seven-membered ring that is to become the B-ring of the allocolchicinoids. Two different regioisomeric series can be accessed depending on which position the carbene complex is on the seven membered ring. A key issue that is addressed is the stereochemistry of the newly formed axis of chirality that results from a stereo-relay from an existing chiral center on the seven membered ring at the position destined to be C(7) in the allocolchicinoids. The level of stereochemistry is dependent on the position of the carbene complex on the seven membered ring. A mechanism is proposed to account for this stereochemical dependence and to account for the observed effects of temperature and solvent on the stereoselectivity. Finally, the benzannulation reactions of optically pure complexes are examined and quite surprisingly one, but not both, of the diastereomeric products is racemized. The racemization can be prevented with the proper choice of solvent and temperature. A mechanism is proposed to account for the racemization of only one of the diastereomers of the product that involves the intermediacy of an ortho-quinone methide chromium tricarbonyl complex.","506":"[3 + 3] Annulations of exo-cyclic vinylogous amides and urethanes with vinyl iminium salts are described here.

A significant strength of these base analogs is their similarity in molecular constitution and chemical properties to natural bases. While chemical synthesis has afforded the ability to generate oligonucleotides in good yield with sequence-specific incorporation of fluorescent base analogs, this method is limited in practice to the synthesis of relatively small RNAs of less than ~ 80 nucleotides. Since most RNAs of biological interest are greater than 80 nucleotides in length, methods for synthesizing these larger RNAs in good yield, while maintaining the ability to site-specifically incorporate base analogs that allow for fluorescence measurements, could be of broad interest.

Two extreme labeling protocols are examined, where either all native uridine residues are replaced with the corresponding modified fluorescent analogue, or only key residues are site-specifically modified. For the HIV-1 Tat-TAR system, labeling all native uridine residues resulted in relatively small changes in emission upon increasing concentrations of the Tat peptide. In contrast, when the two bulge U residues were site-specifically labeled, a reasonable fluorescence response was observed upon Tat titration.

The furan moiety was then attached to the 5 position of 2'-deoxycytidine as well as the 8 position of adenosine and guanosine. Photophysical evaluation of these four furan containing nucleoside analogues reveal distinct differences in the absorption, emission and quantum efficiency depending upon the class of nucleoside (pyrimidine or purine).

One such target was carbocyclic 4'-epiformycin (4). This compound is reported via a procedure based on an asymmetric aldol\/ring closure methathesis strategy. To provide a preliminary glimpse into the biological characterization of 4 an antiviral assay was conducted. Target 4 was found to be inactive and to lack cytotoxicity to the host cells.","569":null,"570":"Porphyrins that bear one-carbon oxygenic substituents (hydroxymethyl, formyl, ester) directly attached to the macrocycle afford a compact architecture that is attractive for diverse applications. Routes to 9 porphyrins bearing such groups in distinct architectures (A(4)-, trans-A(2)-, trans-A(2)B(2)-, trans-AB- and trans-AB(2)C-porphyrins) have been explored (A = hydroxymethyl), including porphyrins bearing two one-carbon units in different oxidation states (hydroxymethyl\/ester, formyl\/ester). The hydroxymethyl group was introduced via TBDMS-protected dipyrromethane precursors.","571":"An unusual peroxide base promoted isomerization was uncovered. Saturated endoperoxides derived from fulvenes give rise to 2-vinyl-2-cyclopentenones upon treatment with DBU in CH(2)Cl(2) in a one-pot reaction. This methodology was applied to a convenient synthesis of dihydrojasmone. Moreover, functional groups placed on the side chain at C-6 participate in the base catalyzed isomerizations via conjugate attack at the enone moiety to give 2-cyclopentenones carrying oxygen heterocycles at C2.","572":"Calix[4]arenes constrained to 1,3-alternate conformation and functionalized at the upper rim with four and two nitronyl nitroxides have been synthesized, and characterized by X-ray crystallography, magnetic resonance (EPR and (1)H NMR) spectroscopy, and magnetic studies. Such calix[4]arene tetraradicals and diradicals provide scaffolds for through-bond and through-space intramolecular exchange couplings.","573":"The RecA protein of Escherichia coli plays a crucial roles in DNA recombination and repair, as well as various aspects of bacterial pathogenicity. The formation of a RecA-ATP-ssDNA complex initiates all RecA activities and yet a complete structural and mechanistic description of this filament has remained elusive. An analysis of RecA-DNA interactions was performed using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. A direct comparison was made between fluorescein and several fluorescent nucleosides. The fluorescent guanine analog 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6MI) demonstrated significant advantages over the other fluorophores and represents an important new tool for characterizing RecA-DNA interactions.","574":"Sequential transformations enable the facile synthesis of complex target molecules from simple building blocks in a single preparative step. Their value is amplified if they also create multiple stereogenic centers. In the ongoing search for new domino processes, emphasis is usually placed on sequential reactions which occur cleanly and without forming by-products. As a prerequisite for an ideally proceeding one-pot sequential transformation, the reactivity pattern of all participating components has to be such that each building block gets involved in a reaction only when it is supposed to do so. The development of sequences that combine transformations of fundamentally different mechanisms broadens the scope of such procedures in synthetic chemistry. This mini review contains a representative sampling from the last 15 years on the kinds of reactions that have been sequenced into cascades to produce heterocyclic molecules.","575":"First and second generation total syntheses of mycolactones A and B are reported. The first generation total synthesis unambiguously confirmed our earlier assignment of the relative and absolute stereochemistry of mycolactones A and B. Knowledge of the chemical properties of the mycolactones accumulated through the first generation total synthesis allowed us to implement several major improvements to the original synthesis, including: (1) optimizing the choice of protecting groups, (2) eliminating the unnecessary adjustment of protecting groups, and (3) improving the overall stereoselectivity and synthetic efficiency. The second generation total synthesis consists of 21 longest linear steps, with 8.8% overall yield.","576":"We describe the properties of a series of oligomeric polyfluorophores assembled on the DNA backbone. The eleven oligomers (oligodeoxyfluorosides, ODFs), 4 to 7 monomers in length, were composed of only two fluorescent monomers and a spacer in va ried sequences, and were designed to test how fluorescent nucleobases can interact electronically to yield complexity in fluorescence emission. The monomer fluorophores were deoxyribosides of pyrene and perylene, which emit light in violet and blue wavele ngths respectively. The experiments show that simple variation of sequence and spacing can dramatically change fluorescence, yielding emission maxima ranging from 380 to 557 nm and visible colors from violet to orange-red. Fluorescence lifetimes data, excitation spectra, and absorption data point to a number of multi-fluorophore electronic interactions, including pyrene-pyrene and perylene-perylene excimers, pyrene-perylene exciplexes, as well as monomer dye emissions, contributing to the final spectral outcomes. Thus, two simple fluorophores can be readily combined to give emissions over much of the visible spectrum, all requiring only a single excitation. The results demonstrate that fluorescent nucleobases in oligomeric form can act cooperatively as electronic units, and that fluorophore sequence in such oligomers is as important as fluorophore composition in determining fluorescence properties.","577":"Miscibility tests between sixty pairs of fluorous and organic solvents have been performed, and a number of biphasic systems based on hydrofluoroether solvents have been identified. Mutual solubilities of a series of fluorous and organic solvents have been measured to ascertain the compositions of the biphasic systems. A qualitative solvent tuning strategy based on solvent polarity and fluorophilicity\/phobicity is introduced. Solvent tuning is then used to modulate the partition coefficients (P) of triarylphosphines with 0-3 fluorous tags. The results lay a foundation for future applications of these and related biphasic systems in catalysis and extraction.","578":null,"579":null,"580":"Using a metal-catalyzed domino reaction as the key step, the heterocyclic skeleton of the kopsifoline alkaloid family was constructed by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a carbonyl ylide dipole derived from a Rh(II)-catalyzed reaction of a diazo ketoester across the indole pi-bond. Ring opening of the resulting 1,3-dipolar cycloadduct followed by a reductive dehydroxylation step resulted in the formation of a critical silyl enol ether necessary for the final F-ring closure of the kopsifoline skeleton.","581":null,"582":"The total and semi syntheses of (2R, 3R)-epigallocatechin-3-O-(4-hydroxybenzoate), a novel catechin from Cistus salvifolius, was accomplished.

Upon irradiation with UV light, the thiophosphate group, representing a hydrolysis resistant phosphate analog, is revealed.","587":"The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of potassium (4-methoxyphenyl)dimethylsilanolate (K(+)1(-)) with aryl bromides has been demonstrated using triphenylphosphine oxide as a stabilizing ligand. Unsymmetrical biaryls can be prepared from a variety of aryl bromides in good yield with short reaction times. Qualitative kinetics studies compared effects of different phosphine oxides on the rate of cross-coupling and established the beneficial effect of these ligands in the reaction of electron-rich arylsilanolates. The improved yield and reproducibility of the cross-coupling of several bromides was demonstrated by direct comparison of reactions performed with and without triphenylphosphine oxide under non-rigorous exclusion of oxygen.","588":null,"589":"The chemistry of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,5-naphthyridines and 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[3,2-b]azepines has been explored with the goal of discovering reactions at N1 suitable for library development. Epoxide openings, palladium-catalyzed N-arylations, DEPBT-promoted acylations, and urea formation through the reaction with isocyanates were all successful. The epoxide opening chemistry using homochiral epichlorohydrin, with epoxide reclosure and a second nucleophilic opening led to the preparation of a small 24-membered library.","590":"Kinetic isotope effects provide a powerful method to investigate the mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, but often other slow steps in the reaction such as substrate binding or product release suppress the isotopically sensitive step. For reactions at methyl groups, this limitation may be overcome by measuring the isotope effect by an intra-molecular competition experiment. This requires the synthesis of substrates containing regio-specifically mono- or dideuterated methyl groups. To facilitate mechanistic investigations of the adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme, glutamate mutase we have developed a synthesis of mono- and di-deuterated (2S, 3S)-3-methylaspartic acids. Key intermediates are the correspondingly labeled mesaconic acids and their dimethyl esters that potentially provide starting materials for a variety of isotopically labeled molecules.","591":"","592":"The BINOL ligand (R)-2 that contains bulky 3,3'-tertiaryalkyl groups shows improved catalytic properties than the previously reported 3,3'-substituted BINOL ligands in the asymmetric alkyne addition to aromatic aldehydes. It can catalyze the phenylacetylene addition to aromatic aldehydes with high enantioselectivity (86 - 94% ee) and good yields without using Ti(O(i)Pr)(4) and a Lewis base additive. The catalytic properties of several analogs of (R)-2 in the asymmetric alkyne addition to aldehydes have also been studied. .","593":"Stable chlorins bearing few or no substituents have been subjected to a variety of reactions including demetalation, magnesium insertion, oxochlorin formation, and bromination followed by Suzuki coupling. The kinetics of deuteration also have been determined for two oxochlorins and a series of chlorins bearing 0, 1, 2, or 3 meso-aryl substituents.","594":"The availability of stable chlorins bearing few or no substituents has enabled a variety of fundamental studies. The studies described herein report absorption spectra of diverse chlorins, comparative NMR features of chlorins bearing 0-3 meso-aryl substituents, and X-ray structures of the fully unsubstituted chlorin and the oxochlorin.","595":"Five routes to stable chlorins bearing 0 or 1 meso substituents have been investigated, among which reaction of a 9-bromo-1-formyldipyrromethane and 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,3,3-trimethyldipyrrin proved most effective. Application of this route afforded metallochlorins [Cu(II), Zn(II), Pd(II)] including the chlorin lacking any beta-pyrrole and meso substituents.","596":"A collection of 33 hydrodipyrrins (9 targets, 21 intermediates, and 3 byproducts) has been prepared. The hydrodipyrrins (dihydrodipyrrins, tetrahydrodipyrrins, and hexahydrodipyrrins) contain a pyrrole ring and a geminal-dimethyl substituted 1-pyrroline (or pyrrolidine) ring. The alpha-substituents on the pyrrole ring (H, Br, CHO) and pyrroline ring (H, CH(3), CH(OR)(2), OMe, SMe) provide different reactivity combinations (Nu(-), E(+)) and 0, 1, or 2 carbon atoms (which can give rise to the bridging meso-carbons in hydroporphyrins). Straightforward access to various hydrodipyrrins should facilitate development of syntheses of diverse hydroporphyrins.","597":"We report the design, synthesis and characterization of binary oligonucleotide probes for mRNA detection. The probes were designed to avoid common problems found in standard binary probes such as direct excitation of the acceptor fluorophore and overlap between the donor and acceptor emission spectra. Two different probes were constructed that contained an array of either two or three dyes and that were characterized using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence depolarization measurements. The three-dye binary probe (BP-3d) consists of a Fam fluorophore which acts as a donor, collecting light and transferring it as energy to Tamra, which subsequently transfers energy to Cy5 when the two probes are hybridized to mRNA. This design allows the use of 488 nm excitation, which avoids the direct excitation of Cy5 and at the same time provides a good fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. The two-dye binary probe system (BP-2d) was constructed of Alexa488 and Cy5 fluorophores. Although the overlap between the fluorescence of Alexa488 and the absorption of Cy5 is relatively low, FRET still occurs due to their close physical proximity when the probes are hybridized to mRNA. This framework also decreases the direct excitation of Cy5 and reduces the fluorescence overlap between the donor and the acceptor. Picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy showed a reduction in the fluorescence lifetime of donor fluorophores after the formation of the hybrid between the probes and target mRNA. Interestingly, BP-2d in the presence of mRNA shows a slow rise in the fluorescence decay of Cy5 due to a relatively low FRET rate, which together with the reduction in the Alexa488 lifetime provides a way to improve the signal to background ratio using time-resolved fluorescence spectra (TRES). In addition, fluorescence depolarization measurements showed complete depolarization of the acceptor dyes (Cy5) for both BP-3d (due to sequential FRET steps) and BP-2d (due to the relatively low FRET rate) in the presence of the mRNA target.","598":"","599":"A highly enantio- and diastereoselective pentenylation of aldehydes is described.

Treatment of 7 with phenylselenenyl bromide afforded the desired ethyl (E)-2-bromomethyl-1-fluoro-2-phenylselenenylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate 11 in 85% yield. DIBALH reduction of 11 gave 13, which after acetylation to 14 was reacted with 2-amino-6-chloropurine to give the 9-alkylated product 15 in 87% yield. Se-oxydation of 15 with hydrogen peroxide afforded 16, which underwent smooth elimination in a mixture of THF-DMF at 60 degrees C giving rise to a Z,E mixture of protected nucleosides 17. Deacetylation gave Z-1a and E-1a which were separated on a silica gel column. Both Z-1a and E-1a were converted into the respective guanine analogues Z-1b and E-1b.","603":"Synthesis of methylenecyclopropane analogues of nucleoside phosphonates 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b is described. Cyclopropyl phosphonate 8 was transformed in four steps to methylenecyclopropane phosphonate 16.

Selenoxide eliminations (15 --&gt; 16 and 22 --&gt; 23 + 24) were instrumental in the synthesis. The Z- and E-isomers 23 and 24 were transformed to bromides 25a and 25b which were used for alkylation of adenine and 2-amino-6-chloropurine to give intermediates 26a, 26b, 26c and 26d. Acid hydrolysis provided the adenine and guanine analogues 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b. Phosphonates 6b and 7b are potent inhibitors of replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).","604":"The acid promoted diastereoselective dimerization of myrmicarin 215B is described. The reactivity of these sensitive alkaloids, structural assignment, and a possible mechanism for the observed dimerization are discussed.

The scope of the [2+2] cycloaddition with regard to both the ketene and ynamide component is described.","607":"Two enantiomerically pure B-ring modified analogues of (-)-epicatechin gallate were synthesised and their modulation of beta-lactam resistance using three strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BB 568, EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16) evaluated. Sub-inhibitory concentrations (12.5 and 25 mg\/L) of the two analogues fully sensitised each of the three MRSA strains to oxacillin, reducing the MIC to less than 0.5 mg\/L, identical to levels achieved with ECg. Lower concentrations demonstrated that the position and degree of hydroxylation of the B-ring is important for activity.","608":"Hydrolytic yields as high as 80% were obtained by using penicillin G amidase (PGA) on substrates anchored on optimized positively charged PEGA polymers. By increasing the amount of permanent charges inside the polymer, electrostatic interactions between the positively charged PEGA(+) and the negatively charged PGA (pI = 5.2-5.4) were strengthened, thus favouring the accessibility of the bulky enzyme (MW = 88 kDa) inside the pores. The effect of different amounts of charges on polymer swelling and protein retention inside the polymer was investigated and correlated to the enzyme efficiency demonstrating that electrostatic interactions predominate over swelling properties in determining enzyme accessibility.","609":null,"610":"Stereoselective [2,3]-Wittig rearrangement of E- and Z-allylic stannyl ethers derived from an isopropylidene L-threitol derivative has been investigated.

The second route involves the synthesis of a new compound, 6-nitrovanillic acid, a key A-ring component of many naturally occurring PBDs. These routes have provided a sufficient quantity of DC-81 to allow complete characterization and evaluation in DNA-binding and in vitro cytotoxicity studies.","613":"Development of an alternative strategy for securing substantial quantities of singly 5'-32P-end-labeled double-stranded DNA suitable for binding studies is described based on M13 cloning techniques and offers advantages of production of replenishable quantities of singly 5'-32P-end-labeled double-stranded DNA of homogenous length without need for DNA isolation (restriction fragment), dephosphorylation, and lengthy preparative gel electrophoresis procedures. The 32P label is introduced onto the free 5'-hydroxyl group of a chemically synthesized universal primer [5'-32P-d(GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT)-3'] which is used to initiate DNA synthesis on M13-derived single-stranded DNA templates. Following DNA synthesis, a restriction enzyme cleavage reaction produces a uniform length duplex suitable for agent binding studies. The strategy further permits the use of the Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing technique for direct and unambiguous identification of cleavage sites introduced by an agent on the end-labeled DNA. The use of the procedure in the examination of the DNA alkylation properties of (+)-CC-1065 (1) and a series of synthetic analogs is reviewed. From these studies a refined definition of the alkylation selectivity of (+)-CC-1065 is detailed. Employing agents possessing the parent 1,2,7,7a-tetrahydrocycloprop[1,2-c]indol-4-one (CI) alkylation subunit constituting the minimum pharmacophore of the CC-1065 alkylation subunit (CPI), comparative DNA alkylation studies illustrate that the activated cyclopropane is not obligatory for observation of the CI\/CPI characteristic alkylation, highlight the relative nonselectivity of the alkylation event in the absence of noncovalent binding selectivity, illustrate a prominent role for agent binding selectivity for agents that possess such capabilities, and demonstrate that a sequence dependent autocatalytic phosphate activation of the alkylation event may not be uniquely responsible for the nonselective or selective alkylations. The ease with which the procedure may be extended to the rapid and convenient examination of additional agents is illustrated with the demonstration of the strikingly similar DNA alkylation properties of the duocarmycins (3-8) and (+)-CC-1065 (1) which suggest that the agents may be acting by a common mechanism.","614":"","615":"The oligomerization of (guanosine 5'-phosphor)-2-methylimidazolide on a poly(C) template proceeds efficiently at temp. as high as 37 degrees, although the helical complex formed by the template and substrate melts at a much lower temp.
