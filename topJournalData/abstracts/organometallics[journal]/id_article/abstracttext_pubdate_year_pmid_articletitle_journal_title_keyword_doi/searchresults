modification of cyclopentadienyl ligands with carefully selected substituents is a widely used strategy for tuning their steric and electronic properties. We describe the synthesis of an extremely bulky penta-terphenyl cyclopentadienyl ligand (CpT5) by arylation of cyclopentadiene. Deprotonation reactions with various group 1 metals and bases afforded a complete series of alkali metal salts MCpT5 (M = Li-Cs). The compounds were isolated as solvate-free salts, which were characterized by multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies of LiCpT5, NaCpT5 (crystallized as a solvate with one tetrahydrofuran molecule per formula unit), and KCpT5 revealed the formation of metallocene-like sandwich structures in the solid state.","3":null,"4":"We report a Pd-catalyzed route to heterocycles bearing a tetrasubstituted alkene fragment. Our approach merges the intramolecular carbopalladation of tethered alkynes with an alkylation step produced by the C-C cleavage of cyclobutanol derivatives. An alkenyl-Pd(II) intermediate has been isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction studies. Interestingly, the nature of the tethering alkynyl chain influences the E\/Z stereochemistry of the alkenyl fragment in the functionalized heterocycles.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":"Recent research has highlighted the key role played by the electron affinity of the active metal-nitrene\/imido oxidant as the driving force in nitrene additions to olefins to afford valuable aziridines. The present work showcases a library of Co(II) reagents that, unlike the previously examined Mn(II) and Fe(II) analogues, demonstrate reactivity trends in olefin aziridinations that cannot be solely explained by the electron affinity criterion. A family of Co(II) catalysts (17 members) has been synthesized with the assistance of a trisphenylamido-amine scaffold decorated by various alkyl, aryl, and acyl groups attached to the equatorial amidos. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, cyclic voltammetry and EPR data reveal that the high-spin Co(II) sites (S = 3\/2) feature a minimal [N3N] coordination and span a range of 1.4 V in redox potentials. Surprisingly, the Co(II)-mediated aziridination of styrene demonstrates reactivity patterns that deviate from those anticipated by the relevant electrophilicities of the putative metal nitrenes. The representative L4Co catalyst (-COCMe3 arm) is operating faster than the L8Co analogue (-COCF3 arm), in spite of diminished metal-nitrene electrophilicity. Mechanistic data (Hammett plots, KIE, stereocontrol studies) reveal that although both reagents follow a two-step reactivity path (turnover-limiting metal-nitrene addition to the C b atom of styrene, followed by product-determining ring-closure), the L4Co catalyst is associated with lower energy barriers in both steps. DFT calculations indicate that the putative [L4Co]NTs and [L8Co]NTs species are electronically distinct, inasmuch as the former exhibits a single-electron oxidized ligand arm. In addition, DFT calculations suggest that including London dispersion corrections for L4Co (due to the polarizability of the tert-Bu substituent) can provide significant stabilization of the turnover-limiting transition state. This study highlights how small ligand modifications can generate stereoelectronic variants that in certain cases are even capable of overriding the preponderance of the metal-nitrene electrophilicity as a driving force.","9":null,"10":"Cobalt complexes supported by a tetramethylated PNP pincer ligand (Me4 iPrPNP = 2,6-(iPr2PCMe2)2(C5H3N)) have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Examples include cobalt(I)-choride, -methyl, -aryl and -benzofuranyl derivatives. The performance of these compounds was evaluated in the catalytic borylation of fluorinated arenes using B2Pin2 as the boron source. While P-C bond cleavage, a known deactivation pathway in [(PNP)Co]-catalyzed borylation was suppressed, the overall activity and selectivity of the borylation of fluoroarenes was reduced as compared to the previously reported [(PNP)Co] catalyst lacking isopropylene spacers. Stoichiometric reactions support an increased barrier for oxidative addition to cobalt(I), a result of the increased steric profile and decreased conformational flexibility of the pincer resulting from methylation distal to the active site. With a more activated substrate such as benzofuran, catalytic borylation with cobalt(I) precatalysts and HBPin was observed. Monitoring the progress of the reaction by NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of cobalt(III) intermediates during the course of the borylation, supporting a cobalt(I)-(III) redox cycle.","11":"Herein, we describe a study of the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties of a cis-dichlorido seleno-chelated Hoveyda-Grubbs type complex (Ru8). Such a complex has been obtained through a straightforward and high-yielding synthetic protocol in three steps from the commercially available 2-bromobenzaldehyde in good overall yield (54%). The catalytic profile, especially the latency of this complex, has been probed through selected olefin metathesis reactions such as ring-closing metathesis (RCM), self-cross-metathesis (self-CM) and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). In addition to its high latency, the selenium Hoveyda-type complex Ru8 exhibits a switchable behavior upon thermal activation. Of interest, while the corresponding sulfur-chelated Hoveyda type catalyst is reported to be only activated by heat, the selenium analogue was found to be active upon both heat and light irradiation.","12":"Intending to deepen our understanding of tungsten acetylene (C2H2) chemistry, with regard to the tungstoenzyme acetylene hydratase, here we explore the structure and reactivity of a series of tungsten acetylene complexes, stabilized with pyridine-2-thiolate ligands featuring tungsten in both +II and +IV oxidation states. By varying the substitution of the pyridine-2-thiolate moiety with respect to steric and electronic properties, we examined the details and limits of the previously reported intramolecular nucleophilic attack on acetylene followed by the formation of acetylene inserted complexes. Here, we demonstrate that only the combination of high steric demand and electron-withdrawing features prevents acetylene insertion. Nevertheless, although variable synthetic approaches are necessary for their synthesis, tungsten acetylene complexes can be stabilized predictably with a variety of pyridine-2-thiolate ligands.","13":"In investigating potential control factors that would permit a palladium-catalyzed benzylic vs arene C-H activation as previously reported by our group, it was discovered that the oxidation state of the homogenous palladium species influences the selectivity of C-H activation. DFT calculations show that Pd0 and PdI preferentially activate the sp3 C-H bond in toluene, whereas PdII and PdIII preferentially activate the sp2 C-H bond. This selectivity appears to originate from the steric environment created by the ligand framework on the palladium. As the palladium oxidation state increases, the number of ligand sites increases, which decreases the energetic favorability for activation of the weaker, yet more hindered sp3 C-H bond.","14":null,"15":null,"16":"We report a variety of rhenium complexes supported by bidentate and tridentate phosphinoamine ligands and their use in the formation of the advanced biofuel isobutanol from methanol and ethanol. Rhenium pincer complexes 1-3 are effective catalysts for this process, with 2 giving isobutanol in 35% yields, with 97% selectivity in the liquid fraction, over 16 h with catalyst loadings as low as 0.07 mol %. However, these catalysts show poorer overall selectivity, with the formation of a significant amount of carboxylate salt solid byproduct also being observed. Production of the active catalyst 1d has been followed by 31P NMR spectroscopy, and the importance of the presence of base and elevated temperatures to catalyst activation has been established. Complexes supported by diphosphine ligands are inactive for Guerbet chemistry; however, complexes supported by bidentate phosphinoamine ligands show greater selectivity for isobutanol formation over carboxylate salts. The novel complex 7 was able to produce isobutanol in 28% yield over 17 h. The importance of the N-H moiety to the catalytic performance has also been established, giving further weight to the hypothesis that these catalysts operate via a cooperative mechanism.","17":null,"18":null,"19":"Tetrahydrothiophene-functionalized N,S-heterocyclic carbene palladium(II) complexes are synthesized through an unexpected rearrangement that proceeds with palladium(II) trifluoroacetate and not with palladium(II) acetate, palladium(II) bromide, or palladium(II) chloride. A series of these complexes were isolated and characterized by X-ray crystallography. The mechanism of formation of these [3.2.1]-palladabicycles was explored, and the catalytic capabilities of these complexes were demonstrated in representative C-C coupling reactions.","20":"In this contribution, we revisit the neglected and forgotten cationic, air-stable, 18-valence electron, heteroleptic sandwich complex (cycloheptatrienyl)(cyclopentadienyl)manganese, which was reported independently by Fischer and by Pauson about 50 years ago. Using advanced high-power LED photochemical synthesis, an expedient rapid access to the parent complex and to functionalized derivatives with alkyl, carboxymethyl, bromo, and amino substituents was developed. A thorough study of these \"tromancenium\" salts by a range of spectroscopic techniques (1H\/13C\/55Mn-NMR, IR, UV-vis, HRMS, XRD, XPS, EPR), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and quantum chemical calculations (DFT) shows that these manganese sandwich complexes are unique metallocenes with quite different chemical and physical properties in comparison to those of isoelectronic cobaltocenium salts or (cycloheptatrienyl)(cyclopentadienyl) sandwich complexes of the early transition metals. Electrochemically, all tromancenium ions undergo a chemically partially reversible oxidation and a chemically irreversible reduction at half-wave or peak potentials that respond to the substituents at the Cp deck. As exemplarily shown for the parent tromancenium ion, the product generated during the irreversible reduction process reverts at least partially to the starting material upon reoxidation. Quantum-chemical calculations of the parent tromancenium salt indicate that metal-ligand bonding is distinctly weaker for the cycloheptatrienyl ligand in comparison to that of the cyclopentadienyl ligand. Both the HOMO and the LUMO are metal and cycloheptatrienyl-ligand centered, indicating that chemical reactions will occur either metal-based or at the seven-membered ring, but not on the cyclopentadienyl ligand.","21":"The isolation of a molybdenum(IV) acetylene (C2H2) complex containing two bioinspired 6-methylpyridine-2-thiolate ligands is reported. The synthesis can be performed either by oxidation of a molybdenum(II) C2H2 complex or by substitution of a coordinated PMe3 by C2H2 on a molybdenum(IV) center. Both C2H2 complexes were characterized by spectroscopic means as well as by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the reactivity of the coordinated C2H2 was investigated with regard to acetylene hydratase, one of two enzymes that accept C2H2 as a substrate. While the reaction with water resulted in the vinylation of the pyridine-2-thiolate ligands, an intermolecular nucleophilic attack on the coordinated C2H2 with the soft nucleophile PMe3 was observed to give a cationic ethenyl complex. A comparison with the tungsten analogues revealed less tightly bound C2H2 in the molybdenum variant, which, however, shows a higher reactivity toward nucleophiles.","22":"The understanding and control of stereoselectivity is a central aspect in ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Herein, we report detailed quantum chemical studies on the reaction mechanism of E-selective ROMP of norborn-2-ene (NBE) with Mo(N-2,6-Me2-C6H3)(CHCMe3)(IMes)(OTf)2 (1, IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene) as a first step to stereoselective polymerization. Four different reaction pathways based on an ene syn or ene anti approach of NBE to either the syn- or anti-isomer of the neutral precatalyst have been studied. In contrast to the recently established associative mechanism with a terminal alkene, where a neutral olefin adduct is formed, NBE reacts directly with the catalyst via [2 + 2] cycloaddition to form molybdacyclobutane with a reaction barrier about 30 kJ mol-1 lower in free energy than via the formation of a catalyst-monomer adduct. However, the direct cycloaddition of NBE was only found for one out of four stereoisomers. Our findings strongly suggest that this stereoselective approach is responsible for E-selectivity and point toward a substrate-specific reaction mechanism in olefin metathesis with neutral Mo imido alkylidene N-heterocyclic carbene bistriflate complexes.","23":"Pd-catalyzed C-H arylation of heteorarenes is an important and widely studied synthetic transformation; however, the regioselectivity is often substrate-controlled. Here, we report catalyst-controlled regioselectivity in the Pd-catalyzed oxidative coupling of N-(phenylsulfonyl)indoles and aryl boronic acids using O2 as the oxidant. Both C2- and C3-arylated indoles are obtained in good yield with &gt;10:1 selectivity. A switch from C2 to C3 regioselectivity is achieved by including 4,5-diazafluoren-9-one or 2,2'-bipyrimidine as an ancillary ligand to a \"ligand-free\" Pd(OTs)2 catalyst system. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the switch in selectivity arises from a change in the mechanism, from a C2-selective oxidative-Heck pathway to a C3-selective C-H activation\/reductive elimination pathway.","24":"A family of cationic cycloplatinated(II) complexes [Pt(dfppy)(P^P)]Cl, dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine, incorporating bisphosphine ligands, P^P = bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (1, dppm), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (2, dppe) and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)benzene (3, dppbz), was prepared. The complexes were characterized by means of several analytical and spectroscopic methods. These complexes displayed acceptable stability in the biological environments which was confirmed by NMR, HR ESI-MS and UV-vis techniques. The antiproliferative properties of these complexes were evaluated by National Cancer Institute (NCI) at National Institutes of Health (NIH) against 60 different human tumor cell lines such as leukemia, melanoma, lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate and kidney. These complexes showed higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin against a wide variety of cancer cell lines such as K-562 (leukemia), HOP-92 (lung), HCT-116 (colon), OVCAR-8 (ovarian), PC-3 (prostate), MDA-MB-468 (breast), and melanoma cancer cell lines. Complex 3 as the most potent compound in this study furnished an excellent anti-proliferative activity compared to the cisplatin against Hela, SKOV3, and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. The main mode of the interaction of 1-3 with DNA was also determined using molecular docking studies.","25":null,"26":"The reactions of dppf-nickel(0) with alkyl halides proceed via three-coordinate nickel(0) intermediates of the form [Ni(dppf)(L)]. The effects of the identity of the added ligand (L) on catalyst speciation and the rates of reactions of [Ni(COD)(dppf)] with alkyl halides have been investigated using kinetic experiments and density functional theory calculations. A series of monodentate ligands have been investigated in attempts to identify trends in reactivity. Sterically bulky and electron-donating ligands are found to decrease the reaction rate. It was found that (i) the halide abstraction step is not always irreversible and the subsequent recombination of a nickel(I) complex with an alkyl halide can have a significant effect on the overall rate of the reaction and (ii) some ligands lead to very stable [Ni(dppf)(L)2] species. The yields of prototypical (dppf)nickel-catalyzed Kumada cross-coupling reactions of alkyl halides are significantly improved by the addition of free ligands, which provides another important variable to consider when optimizing nickel-catalyzed reactions of alkyl halides.","27":"Clean, high-yielding routes are described to ruthenium-diiodide catalysts that were recently shown to enable high productivity in olefin metathesis. For the second-generation Grubbs and Hoveyda catalysts (GII: RuCl2(H2IMes)(PCy3)(=CHPh); HII: RuCl2(H2IMes)(=CHAr), Ar = C6H4-2-O i Pr), slow salt metathesis is shown to arise from the low lability of the ancillary PCy3 or ether ligands, which retards access to the four-coordinate intermediate required for efficient halide exchange. To exploit the lability of the first-generation catalysts, the diiodide complex RuI2(PCy3)(=CHAr) HI-I 2 was prepared by treating \"Grubbs I\" (RuCl2(PCy3)2(=CHPh), GI) with NaI, H2C=CHAr (1a), and a phosphine-scavenging Merrifield iodide (MF-I) resin. Subsequent installation of H2IMes or cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands afforded the second-generation iodide catalysts in good to excellent yields. Given the incompatibility of the nitro group with a free carbene, the iodo-Grela catalyst RuI2(H2IMes)(=CHAr') (nG-I 2 : Ar' = C6H3-2-O i Pr-4-NO2) was instead accessed by sequential salt metathesis of GI with NaI, installation of H2IMes, and finally cross-metathesis with the nitrostyrenyl ether H2C=CHAr' (1b), with MF-I as the phosphine scavenger. The bulky iodide ligands improve the selectivity for macrocyclization in ring-closing metathesis.","28":null,"29":"The oxidation of an acetonitrile ligand coordinated to ruthenium is explored in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide by 1H NMR spectroscopy. When oxidized with an iodosoarene oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reagent, kinetic studies demonstrate that the nitrile ligand does not dissociate before reacting. Instead, OAT to the central nitrile carbon is implicated (nitrile oxidation), and is further supported by the product of the reaction, N-acyl-dimethylsulfoximine. The N-acyl-dimethylsulfoximine likely formed by an imido group transfer reaction from ruthenium to the NMR solvent, and the product was synthesized independently to verify its identity in the reaction. This reaction represents the first time that a nitrile oxidation reaction has resulted in intermolecular imido group transfer to a substrate, presumably through a reactive ruthenium(IV)imido intermediate. This suggests that nitrile oxidation is a plausible route into reactive metal-imido intermediates for amination and aziridination reactions.","30":null,"31":null,"32":"A convenient synthetic method to obtain d-galactose-substituted acylsilanes and acylgermanes is described. These acyl group 14 compounds are easily accessible in good yields. Their structural properties were analyzed by a combination of NMR, single crystal X-ray crystallography, and UV\/vis spectroscopy. A d-galactose-substituted tetraacylgermane represents a new interesting visible light photoinitiator based on its absorption properties as well as its high solubility.","33":null,"34":null,"35":null,"36":"Over the past several years, a number of strategies for the functionalization of dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes (carboranes) have emerged. Despite these developments, B - N bond formation on the carborane scaffold remains a challenge due to the propensity of strong nucleophiles to partially deboronate the parent closo-carborane cluster into the corresponding nido form. Here we show that azide, sulfonamide, cyanate, and phosphoramidate nucleophiles can be straightforwardly cross-coupled onto the B(9) vertices of the o- and m-carborane core from readily accessible precursors without significant deboronation by-products, laying the groundwork for further study into the utility and properties of these new B-aminated carborane species. We further showcase select reactivity of the installed functional groups highlighting some unique features stemming from the combination of the electron-donating B(9) position and the large steric profile of the B-connected carborane substituent.","37":"A Tutorial on factors that determine the selectivity in C(sp2)-H activation and functionalization reactions involving two-electron oxidative addition processes with transition metals is presented. The interplay of the thermodynamics of C(sp2)-H oxidative addition and kinetic influences upon regioselectivity are presented alongside pedagogically valuable experimental and computational results from the literature. Mechanisms and energetics of chelate-assisted C(sp2)-H oxidative addition are examined, as are concepts related to chemoselectivity in the oxidative addition of C(sp2)-H or C(sp2)-X (X = F, Cl, Br, I) bonds with aryl halide substrates.","38":"The metal-free reduction of a range of phosphine(V) oxides employing oxalyl chloride as an activating agent and hexachlorodisilane as reducing reagent has been achieved under mild reaction conditions. The method was successfully applied to the reduction of industrial waste byproduct triphenylphosphine(V) oxide, closing the phosphorus cycle to cleanly regenerate triphenylphosphine(III). Mechanistic studies and quantum chemical calculations support the attack of the dissociated chloride anion of intermediated phosphonium salt at the silicon of the disilane as the rate-limiting step for deprotection. The exquisite purity of the resultant phosphine(III) ligands after the simple removal of volatiles under reduced pressure circumvents laborious purification prior to metalation and has permitted the facile formation of important transition metal catalysts.","39":"Alkoxycarbonylations are important and versatile reactions that result in the formation of a new C-C bond. Herein, we report on a new and halide-free alkoxycarbonylation reaction that does not require the application of an external carbon monoxide atmosphere. Instead, manganese carbonyl complexes and organo(alkoxy)borate salts react to form an ester product containing the target C-C bond. The required organo(alkoxy)borate salts are conveniently generated from the stoichiometric reaction of an organoborane and an alkoxide salt and can be telescoped without purification. The protocol leads to the formation of both aromatic and aliphatic esters and gives complete control over the ester's substitution (e.g., OMe, O t Bu, OPh). A reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of stoichiometric reactivity studies, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. The new chemistry is particularly relevant for the field of Mn(I) catalysis and clearly points to a potential pathway toward irreversible catalyst deactivation.","40":"Yields of organoindium reagents synthesized from indium metal were previously reported to be highly dependent on metal batch and supplier due to the presence or absence of anticaking agent. Here, single-particle fluorescence microscopy established that MgO, an additive in some batches nominally for anticaking, significantly increased the physisorption of small-molecule organics onto the surface of the resulting MgO-coated indium metal particles. An inert and relatively nonpolar boron dipyrromethene fluorophore with a hydrocarbon tail provided a sensitive probe for this surface physisorption. SEM images revealed markedly different surface properties of indium particles either with or without MgO, consistent with their different physisorption properties observed by fluorescence microscopy. We further documented incomplete commercial bottle labeling regarding the presence and composition of this anticaking agent, both within our laboratory and previously in the literature, which may complicate reproducibility between laboratories. Trimethylsilyl chloride pretreatment, a step employed in a subset of reported synthetic procedures, removed the anticaking agent and produced particles with similar physisorption properties as commercial batches of indium powder distributed without the anticaking agent. These data indicate the possibility of an additional substrate\/catalyst physisorption mechanism by which the anticaking agent may be influencing synthetic procedures that generate organoindium reagents from indium metal, in addition to simple anticaking.","41":"We report a variety of manganese-based catalysts containing both chelating diphosphine (bis(diphenylphosphino)methane (dppm: 1, 2, and 7) or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe: 3)), and mixed-donor phosphinoamine (2-(diphenylphosphino)ethylamine (dppea: 4-6)) ligands for the upgrading of ethanol and methanol to the advanced biofuel isobutanol. These catalysts show moderate selectivity up to 74% along with turnover numbers greater than 100 over 90 h, with catalyst 2 supported by dppm demonstrating superior performance. The positive effect of substituting the ligand backbone was also displayed with a catalyst supported by C-phenyl-substituted dppm (8) having markedly improved performance compared to the parent dppm catalysts. Catalysts supported by the phosphinoamine ligand dppea are also active for the upgrading of ethanol to n-butanol. These results show that so-called PNP-pincer ligands are not a prerequisite for the use of manganese catalysts in Guerbet chemistry and that simple chelates can be used effectively.","42":null,"43":null,"44":null,"45":null,"46":"Introducing transition metals into frustrated Lewis pair systems has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Here we report a selection of three metal-only frustrated systems based on Au(I)\/Pt(0) combinations and their reactivity toward alkynes. We have inspected the activation of acetylene and phenylacetylene. The gold(I) fragments are stabilized by three bulky phosphines bearing terphenyl groups. We have observed that subtle modifications on the substituents of these ligands proved critical in controlling the regioselectivity of acetylene activation and the product distribution resulting from C(sp)-H cleavage of phenylacetylene. A mechanistic picture based on experimental observations and computational analysis is provided. As a result of the cooperative action of the two metals of the frustrated pairs, several uncommon heterobimetallic structures have been characterized.","47":null,"48":"In this contribution a convenient synthetic method to obtain the previously unknown dianionic cyclic silenolates and germenolates is described. These dianions 2a,b and 4a,b are easily accessible via a one-pot synthetic protocol in high yields. Their structural properties were analyzed by a combination of NMR, single-crystal X-ray crystallography, and DFT quantum mechanical calculations. Moreover, the reactivity of 2a,b and 4a,b with selected examples of electrophiles was investigated. 2a and 4a were reacted with ClSiiPr3 to give new examples of polysilanes and polygermanes with exocyclic double bonds. The reaction of 2b with ClSiMe2SiMe2Cl led to the formation of the acyl bicyclo[2.2.2]octasilane 6. Moreover, the reaction of 2a,b and 4a,b with MeI, as an example of a carbon-centered electrophile, led to selective alkylation reactions at the negatively charged silicon and germanium atoms. The corresponding methylated structures 9a,b and 10a,b were formed in nearly quantitative yields. The competitive reactivity of the silyl and silenolate anion toward 1 equiv of ClSiMe3 showed that the outcome of the reaction was strongly influenced by the substituent at the carbonyl moiety. 2a reacted with 1 equiv of ClSiMe3 to give the corresponding cyclic silenolate S 1 a, which demonstrated that the silyl anion is more nucleophilic than the silenolate with attached aromatic groups. 2b, on the other hand, reacted with 1 equiv of ClSiMe3 to give the bicyclic compound 11 via an intramolecular sila-Peterson alkenation reaction. These findings clearly showed that the alkyl-substituted silenolate is more nucleophilic than the silyl anion. This paper demonstrates that 2a,b and 4a,b have the potential to be used as unique building blocks for complex polysilane and polygermane frameworks.","49":"The reaction of coordinatively unsaturated Co(II) PCP pincer complexes with nitric oxide leads to the formation of new, air-stable, diamagnetic mono nitrosyl compounds. The synthesis and characterization of five- and four-coordinate Co(III) and Co(I) nitrosyl pincer complexes based on three different ligand scaffolds is described. Passing NO through a solution of [Co(PCPNMe-iPr)Cl], [Co(PCPO-iPr)Cl] or [Co(PCPCH2-iPr)Br] led to the formation of the low-spin complex [Co(PCP-iPr)(NO)X] with a strongly bent NO ligand. Treatment of the latter species with (X = Cl, Br) AgBF4 led to chloride abstraction and formation of cationic square-planar Co(I) complexes of the type [Co(PCP-iPr)(NO)]+ featuring a linear NO group. This reaction could be viewed as a formal two electron reduction of the metal center by the NO radical from Co(III) to Co(I), if NO is counted as NO+. Hence, these systems can be described as {CoNO}8 according to the Enemark-Feltham convention. X-ray structures, spectroscopic and electrochemical data of all nitrosyl complexes are presented. Preliminary studies show that [Co(PCPNMe-iPr)(NO)]+ catalyzes efficiently the reductive hydroboration of nitriles with pinacolborane (HBpin) forming an intermediate {CoNO}8 hydride species.","50":null,"51":"Aryl carbonates, a common protecting group in synthetic organic chemistry, are potentially valuable electrophiles in cross-coupling reactions. Here, after performing a thorough evaluation of different precatalysts, we demonstrate that (dcypf)Ni(2-ethylphenyl)(Br) (dcypf = 1,1-bis-(dicyclohexylphosphino)ferrocene) is an efficient precatalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura reactions using a variety of aryl carbonates as substrates. Mechanistic studies indicate that (dcypf)Ni(2-ethylphenyl)(Br), which contains a bidentate phosphine that binds in a trans geometry, is an effective precatalyst for these reactions for two reasons: (i) it rapidly forms the Ni(O) active species and (ii) it minimizes comproportionation reactions between the Ni(O) active species and both the unactivated Ni(II) precatalyst and on-cycle Ni(II) complexes to form catalytically inactive Ni(I) species. In contrast, the state of the art precatalyst (dppf)Ni(o-tolyl)(Cl) (dppf = 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene), which contains a bidentate phosphine that binds in a cis geometry, forms Ni(I) species during activation and is essentially inactive for aryl carbonate couplings. Although the exact reasons on a molecular level why the dcypf system is more active than the dppf system are unclear, our results indicate that in general Ni catalysts supported by the dcypf ligand will give better performance for catalytic reactions involving substrates which undergo relatively slow oxidative addition, such as aryl carbonates.","52":"Sila-Peterson type reactions of the 1,4,4-tris(trimethylsilyl)-1-metallooctamethylcyclohexasilanes (Me3Si)2Si6Me8(SiMe3)M (2a, M = Li; 2b, M = K) with various ketones were investigated. The obtained products strongly depend on the nature of the ketone component. With 2-adamantanone 2a,b afforded the moderately stable silene 3. 3 is the first example of an Apeloig-Ishikawa-Oehme-type silene with the tricoordinate silicon atom incorporated into a cyclopolysilane framework and could be characterized by NMR and UV spectroscopy as well as by trapping reactions with water, methanol, and MeLi. The reaction of 2b with aromatic ketones also follows a sila-Peterson type mechanism with formation of carbanionic species. With 1,2-diphenylcyclopropenone 2b reacted by conjugate 1,4-addition to give a spirocyclic carbanion. In most cases the underlying reaction mechanism could be elucidated by the isolation and characterization of unstable intermediates and final products after proper derivatization.","53":"We report the synthesis of unsaturated silacycles via an intramolecular silyl-Heck reaction. Using palladium catalysis, silicon electrophiles tethered to alkenes cyclize to form 5- and 6-membered silicon heterocycles. The effects of alkene substitution and tether length on the efficiency and regioselectivity of the cyclizations are described. Finally, through the use of an intramolecular tether, the first examples of disubstituted alkenes in silyl-Heck reactions are reported.","54":null,"55":"Oxidative addition of aryl halides to Ni(0) is a ubiquitous elementary step in cross-coupling and related reactions, usually producing a square-planar Ni(II)-aryl intermediate. Here we show that a triphosphine ligand supports oxidative addition at a tris-ligated Ni(0) center to cleanly form stable five-coordinate Ni(II)-aryl compounds. Kinetic and computational studies support a concerted, two-electron mechanism rather than radical halogen abstraction. These results support the idea that oxidative addition to triphosphine Ni(0) species may be more generally involved in Ni\/phosphine catalytic systems.","56":"An olefin metathesis catalyst bearing a tridentate hemilabile N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand was synthesized and characterized. The solid-state crystal structure reveals coordination from all three donation sites of the NHC ligand, giving rise to a stable 18-electron complex. Catalytic activity in three standard metathesis reactions was demonstrated, revealing our catalyst to be particularly long lived and highly selective in the self-metathesis of 1-decene. Although the catalyst in this work initiates more slowly than its second-generation counterparts, it was shown to have high thermal stability, yielding peak performances at higher temperatures. The unique ligand framework of this catalyst may serve as a template for the synthesis of analogous catalysts with improved efficiencies.","57":"Highly enantioselective Hiyama cross-coupling reactions have been achieved through rhodium(I)-catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations between aryl siloxanes and cyclic racemic allyl halides.

Even though cross-coupling reactions now represent mature technology, there is still a significant amount of research in this area that aims to improve the scope of these reactions, develop more efficient catalysts, and make reactions more practical. In this tutorial, a brief background to cross-coupling reactions is provided, and then the major advances in cross-coupling research over the last 20 years are described. These include the development of improved ligands and precatalysts for cross-coupling and the extension of cross-coupling reactions to a much wider range of electrophiles. For example, cross-coupling reactions are now common with sp3-hybridized electrophiles as well as ester, amide, ether, and aziridine substrates. For many of these more modern substrates, traditional palladium-based catalysts are less efficient than systems based on first-row transition metals such as nickel. Conventional cross-coupling reactions have also inspired the development of a range of related reactions, such as cross-electrophile and decarboxylative couplings as well as couplings based on metallaphotoredox chemistry. The development of these new reactions is probably at the same stage as traditional cross-coupling reactions 30 years ago, and this tutorial highlights how many of the same strategies used to improve cross-coupling reactions may also be applicable to making the new reactions more practical.","65":"There is currently significant interest in the development of efficient nickel precatalysts for cross-coupling. In this work, 14 nickel(II) precatalysts of the form (dppf)Ni(aryl)(X) (dppf = 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene, X = Cl, Br) were synthesized. In particular, both the electronic and steric properties of the aryl group were modified to understand how this affects precatalyst activation. Using EPR spectroscopy, it was demonstrated that the amount of off-cycle nickel(I) species which are formed via comproportionation during precatalyst activation varies depending on the nature of the aryl group. For example, sterically bulky aryl groups reduce comproportionation. Additionally, the catalytic activity of the family of precatalysts was evaluated in five different Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions. The results from these catalytic studies provide information about how precatalyst structure affects catalytic efficiency, which may be useful for the rational design of improved nickel precatalysts for cross-coupling.","66":null,"67":"We report the preparation of enantioenriched secondary alkylcarbastannatranes via a stereoinvertive SN2 reaction of enantioenriched alkyl mesylates and carbastannatranyl anion equivalents.

Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a series of Cr(II) to Cr(V) complexes bearing a 16-atom ringed dianionic tetra-NHC macrocycle are reported. The Cr(II) dimer is diamagnetic and displays a very short Cr-Cr quadruple bond, unprecedented for Cr-NHC complexes to date. Oxidative cleavage of the Cr-Cr bond leads to the formation of a highly stable diamagnetic Cr(IV) oxo complex. Similar reactions with organic azides lead to paramagnetic Cr(IV) imide complexes. Notably, the Cr(IV) oxo can be oxidized in a reversible reaction to yield a Cr(V) cationic oxo complex, which is a very rare high oxidation state Cr-NHC-compound. This Cr(V) oxo undergoes stoichiometric oxygen atom transfer. Similar reactions were attempted with molybdenum and tungsten to form macrocyclic NHC complexes, but only a molybdenum dimer could be isolated.","69":null,"70":"Two methods for the synthesis of bis(imidazol-2-ylidene)pyridine iron dialkyl complexes, (CNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2, have been developed. The first route consists of addition of two equivalents of LiCH2SiMe3 to the iron dihalide complex, (CNC)FeBr2, while the second relies on addition of the free CNC ligand to readily-prepared (py)2Fe(CH2SiMe3)2 (py = pyridine). With aryl-substituted CNC ligands, octahedral complexes of the type ( Ar CNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2(N2) ( Ar CNC = bis(arylimidazol-2-ylidene)pyridine) were isolated, where the dinitrogen ligand occupies the site trans to the pyridine of the CNC-chelate. In contrast, the alkyl-substituted variant, (tBuACNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2 (tBuACNC = 2,6-(tBu-imidazol-2-ylidene)2pyridine) was isolated as the five-coordinate compound lacking dinitrogen. Exposure of the ( Ar CNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2(N2) derivatives to an H2 atmosphere resulted in formation of the corresponding iron hydride complexes ( Ar CNC)FeH4. These compounds catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange between the deuterated benzene solvent and H2, generating isotopologues and isotopomers of ( Ar CNC)Fe(H n )(D4-n ) (n = 0-4). When (3,5-Me2 MesCNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2(N2) (3,5-Me2 MesCNC = 2,6-(2,4,6-Me3-C6H2-imidazol-2-ylidene)2-3,5-Me2-pyridine) was treated successively with H2 and then N2, the corresponding reduced dinitrogen complex (3,5-Me2 MesCNC)Fe(N2)2 was isolated. The same product was also obtained following addition of pinacolborane to (3,5-Me2 MesCNC)Fe(CH2SiMe3)2(N2).","71":"The catalytic asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of ketones is a powerful methodology for the practical and efficient installation of chiral centers. Herein, we describe the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic application of a series of manganese complexes bearing simple chiral diamine ligands. We performed an extensive experimental and computational mechanistic study and present the first detailed experimental kinetic study of Mn-catalyzed ATH. We demonstrate that conventional mechanistic approaches toward catalyst optimization fail and how apparently different precatalysts lead to identical intermediates and thus catalytic performance. Ultimately, the Mn-N,N complexes under study enable quantitative ATH of acetophenones to the corresponding chiral alcohols with 75-87% ee.","72":"The synthesis and characterization of the chiral bifunctional NHC ligands based on the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (ImPy) scaffold are described. These ligands possess a fluxional biaryl axis and a chiral center. The configurational stability of the biaryl axis in their gold(I) complexes is investigated. The application of these axially chiral ImPy-based AuCl complexes in a series of gold catalysis is explored, and varying degrees of asymmetric induction are observed. In most cases, the ligand (aS,R)-L8-H with its cyclohexyl group pointing to the reaction site and hence exerting asymmetric steric influence is more effective in asymmetric induction.","73":"A Pauson-Khand cycladdition of alkynes, alkenes, and carbon monoxide, promoted by cobalt carbonyl and nitrous oxide to furnish cyclopentenones is described. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest that nitrous oxide functions in a similar manner to the N-oxide promoters typically employed in Pauson-Khand reactions. Only dinitrogen and carbon dioxide are produced as a consequence of the activation mechanism, thus avoiding high molecular weight reagents and the build up of basic byproducts. The chemistry is done using equimolar amounts of alkyne, alkene, and dicobalt octacarbonyl, and is performed directly from the acetylenic component without having to presynthesize a cobalt-alkyne complex. Terminal acetylenes were suitable substrates, as was solid calcium carbide, and the corresponding adducts were isolated in good yields. Furthermore, two sequential [4+3] and [2+2+1] cycloadditions were performed, generating funtionalized cyclopentenones in only two steps from readily available starting materials.","74":"In this communication we report a convenient, as short as possible synthesis of aminocobaltocenium hexafluoridophosphate, a very useful compound for further functionalization in cobaltocenium chemistry.

The addition of H2 was reversible as evidenced by the dynamics observed by variable temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and the regeneration of [(iPrPNP)Co(N2)]+ upon exposure to dinitrogen. In contrast, addition of HBPin, (Pin = pinacolato) B2Pin2 and aryl halides resulted in the formation of net one-electron oxidation products: cationic Co(II)-boryl and Co(II)-halide\/aryl complexes, respectively. All products were structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and the electronic structures were determined by a combination of magnetic moment measurements, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

The online tool SambVca2.0 was used to assess steric parameters of ligands and preliminary buried volume determination using XRD-obtained data in a small number of cases proved to be informative. Two modeling approaches were compared for the determination of the buried volume of ligands where XRD data was not available. An approach with imposed steric restrictions was found to be superior in leading to buried volume determinations that closely correlate with observed reaction conversions. The online tool LLAMA was used to determine lead-likeness of potential Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling products, from which 10 of the most lead-like were successfully synthesized.

Recently, it was demonstrated that (1-tBu-Indenyl)Pd(XPhos)Cl (XPhos = 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl) is a highly active precatalyst for room-temperature Suzuki-Miyaura couplings of a variety of aryl sulfamates. Herein, we report an in-depth computational investigation into the mechanism of Suzuki-Miyaura reactions with aryl sulfamates using an XPhos-ligated palladium catalyst. Particular emphasis is placed on the turnover-limiting oxidative addition of the aryl sulfamate C-O bond, which has not been studied in detail previously. We show that bidentate coordination of the XPhos ligand via an additional interaction between the biaryl ring and palladium plays a key role in lowering the barrier to oxidative addition. This result is supported by NBO and NCI-Plot analysis on the transition states for oxidative addition. After oxidative addition, the catalytic cycle is completed by transmetalation and reductive elimination, which are both calculated to be facile processes. Our computational findings explain a number of experimental results, including why elevated temperatures are required for the coupling of phenyl sulfamates without electron-withdrawing groups and why aryl carbamate electrophiles are not reactive with this catalyst.","91":"A benzylation of aldehydes using primary and secondary benzylboronic acid pinacol esters is reported. Activation of the boronic ester with s-butyllithium rendered it nucleophilic toward aldehydes.

The four ligands differ by the alkyl chain length between the thiolate group and the benzimidazole nitrogen (two -C2- or three -C3- carbon atoms) and the second functionality at the NHC being a benzyl (Bn) or a pyridylmethyl (Py) group. The nickel(II) ions are coordinated to the NHC carbon atom and the pendent thiolate group, which bridges to the second nickel(II) ion creating the dinuclear structure. Additionally, in compounds [1] and [2], the fourth coordination position of the square-planar Ni(II) centers is occupied by the halide ions, whereas in [3]2+ and [4]2+, the additional pendant pyridylmethyl groups complete the coordination spheres of the nickel ions. The electrochemical properties of the four complexes were studied using cyclic voltammetry and controlled-potential coulometry methods. The thiolate-functionalized carbene complexes [1] and [2] appear to be poor electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction; the complexes [3]Br2 and [4]Br2, bearing an extra pyridylmethyl group, show higher catalytic activity in proton reduction, indicating that the pyridine group plays an important role in the catalytic cycle.","95":null,"96":"The relative (to BEt3) hydride ion affinity (HIA) of a series of acridine borenium salts has been calculated, with some HIAs found to be similar to that for [Ph3C]+. The HIA at the acridine C9 position is controlled by both acridine and the boron substituents, the latter presumably affecting the strength of the B=N bond in the acridane-BY2 products from hydride transfer. Through a range of hydride abstraction benchmarking reactions against organic hydride donors the experimental HIA of [F5acr-BCat]+ (cat = catechol, F5acr = 1,2,3,4,7-pentafluoroacridine) has been confirmed to be extremely high and closely comparable to that of [Ph3C]+. The high HIA of [F5acr-BCat]+ enables H2 and alkene activation in a FLP with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine. Finally, the HIA of pyridine and quinoline borenium cations has been determined, with the HIA at boron in [PinB(amine)]+ (pin = pinacol, amine = pyridine or quinoline) found to be relatively low.

This proton-responsive ligand coordinates in a straightforward manner to RuCl(CO)(H)(PPh3)3 to generate complex 1. The methoxy-protected analogue LMe was also coordinated to Ru(II) for comparison. Both species have been crystallographically characterized. Site-selective deprotonation of the 2-hydroxypyridine functionality to give 1' was achieved using both mild (DBU) and strong bases (KOtBu and KHMDS), with no sign of involvement of the phosphinomethyl side arm that was previously established as the reactive fragment. Complex 1' is catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of formic acid to generate CO-free hydrogen in three consecutive runs as well as for the dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols, giving high conversions to different esters and outperforming structurally related PNN ligands lacking the NOH fragment.

Unlike the analogous phenylazopyridine (AZPY) complexes, AZBTZ-NMe2 is capable of both N,N-coordination to Os(II) and cyclometalation to form N,C-coordinated species. N,C-Coordination occurs via an azo nitrogen and an ortho carbon on the aniline ring, as identified by 1H NMR and X-ray crystallography of [Os(p-cym)(N,N-AZBTZ-NMe2)Cl]PF6 (1a), [Os(p-cym)(N,N-AZBTZ-NMe2)Br]PF6 (2a), [Os(p-cym)(N,C-AZBTZ-NMe2)Br] (2b), and [Os(p-cym)(N,C-AZBTZ-NMe2)I] (3b). The N,C-coordinated species is more stable and is not readily converted to the N,N-coordinated complex. Analysis of the crystal structures suggests that their formation is influenced by steric interactions between the p-cym and AZBTZ-NMe2 ligands: in particular, larger monodentate halide ligands favor N,C-coordination. The complexes [Os(p-cym)(N,N-Me2-AZBTZ-NH2)Cl]PF6 (4) and [Os(p-cym)(N,N-Me2-AZBTZ-NH2)I]PF6 (5) were synthesized with methyl groups blocking the ortho positions on the aniline ring, forcing an N,N-coordination geometry. 1H NMR NOE experiments confirmed hindered rotation of the arene ligand and steric crowding around the metal center. Complex 2b exhibited unexpected behavior under acidic conditions, involving regiospecific deuteration of the aniline ring at the meta position, as observed by 1H NMR and high-resolution ESI-MS. Deuterium exchange occurs only under acidic conditions, suggesting an associative mechanism. The calculated partial charges on 2b show that the meta carbon is significantly more negatively charged, which may account for the regiospecificity of deuterium exchange.","100":null,"101":null,"102":null,"103":null,"104":"Low-valent TiII species have typically been synthesized by the reaction of TiIV halides with strong metal reductants.

Catalytic quantities of AlCl3 were sufficient to effect high-yielding arylation of (C-N-chelate)BCl2. Boro-destannylation is more rapid than boro-desilylation and leads to double arylation at the boron center, whereas in reactions with arylsilanes either single or double arylation occurs dependent on the nucleophilicity of the arylsilane and on the electrophilicity of the borenium cation.

We thus conclude that the alternative path, nucleophilic attack of water on high-valent Ir-oxo species, may be the preferred mechanistic pathway of water oxidation with these catalysts, and bimolecular oxo-coupling is not a valid mechanistic alternative as in the related ruthenium chemistry, at least in the present system.","177":null,"178":null,"179":"The synthesis of a small family of six electronically and sterically modified 1,3,4-trisubstituted 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene gold(I) chloride complexes is described.

The preliminary mechanistic studies revealed a rapid and reversible ortho-C-H bond activation followed by the rate-limiting C-C bond formation step for the coupling reaction.","261":"The ruthenium-hydride complex (PCy(3))(2)(CO)RuHCl was found to be a highly effective catalyst for the alkyne-to-carboxylic acid coupling reaction to give synthetically useful enol ester products. Strong solvent effect was observed for the ruthenium catalyst in modulating the activity and selectivity; the coupling reaction in CH(2)Cl(2) led to the regioselective formation of gem-enol ester products, while the stereoselective formation of (Z)-enol esters was obtained in THF. The coupling reaction was found to be strongly inhibited by PCy(3). The coupling reaction of both PhCO(2)H\/PhC identical withCD and PhCO(2)D\/PhC identical withCH led to the extensive deuterium incorporation on the vinyl positions of the enol ester products. An opposite Hammett value was observed when the correlation of a series of para-substituted p-X-C(6)H(4)CO(2)H (X = OMe, CH(3), H, CF(3), CN) with phenylacetylene was examined in CDCl(3) (rho = +0.30) and THF (rho = -0.68).

A detailed mechanism of the coupling reaction involving a rate-limiting C-O bond formation step was proposed on the basis of these kinetic and structural studies. The regioselective formation of the gem-enol ester products in CH(2)Cl(2) was rationalized by a direct migratory insertion of the terminal alkyne via a Ru-carboxylate species, whereas the stereoselective formation of (Z)-enol ester products in THF was explained by invoking a Ru-vinylidene species.","262":"The mechanism of the (bis(phosphanylethyl)phosphane)Pt(2+) catalyzed cyclo-isomerization reaction of 7-methyl-octa-1,6-diene to form 1-isopropylbicyclo[3.1.0]hexane was studied using computational methods. The cyclopropanation step was found to be the turnover-limiting step. The overall reaction proceeds via both a 5-exo and a 6-endo route.

For example, the initial turnover rate of the dehydrogenation of 2-methylindoline was measured to be 1.9 s(-1) with the TON of 7950 after 1 h at 200 degrees C. The extensive H\/D scrambling patterns observed from the dehydrogenation reaction of indoline-N-d(1) and indoline-alpha-d(2) suggest a monohydride mechanistic pathway with the C-H bond activation rate-limiting step.","266":"Ru-based olefin metathesis catalysts containing carbohydrate-derived NHCs from glucose and galactose were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy. 2D-NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of Ru-C (benzylidene) rotamers at RT and the rate of rotation was measured using magnetization transfer and VT-NMR spectroscopy.

Compounds 1-5 all decompose by O-O bond homolysis, based on trapping and computational studies. The lack of direct oxygen atom transfer reactivity is likely due to the eta(1) coordination of the peroxide and the inability to adopt more reactive eta(2) geometry.

DFT calculations predict that the meso isomer would be 2.5 kcal\/mol more stable than the d,l isomer due to conventional nonbonding interactions between the methyl groups and the ring hydrogen atoms. Crystallographic analysis of meso-1 confirms that the two methyl groups are equatorial, constraining the diferraazadithiolate bicycle to a conformation that desymmetrizes the diiron center.

The rates of reactions of electron-rich and electron-neutral chloroarenes were independent of the concentration of the bulky alkoxide base OCEt3-, but they were dependent on the concentrations of the less hindered OtBu- and the softer 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenoxide bases. The reactions were fastest when 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenoxide was used as base and slowest when NaOCEt3 was used as base. A concurrent reaction pathway involving simultaneous oxidative addition of chloroarenes to [Pd(PtBu3)] and [(PtBu3)Pd(OR)]- may explain the dependence of the rates of reactions of electron-rich and electron-neutral chloroarenes on the identity and concentration of bases. The rates of reactions of electron-poor chloroarenes and the reactions of bromoarenes were independent of the concentration of OCEt3-, OtBu-, or 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenoxide bases but were dependent on the identity of bases, even though an adduct of the base did not accumulate in any observable amounts.

A kinetic study using UV-vis spectroscopy was carried out on the transformation. Saturation kinetic behavior was observed for the system, which is supportive of a mechanism that involves a reversible formal [2 + 2] retrocycloaddition of 4a to generate the transient imido species Cp(2)Zr=N-t-Bu (7a) and Me(3)-SiN=C=NSiMe(3). Trapping 7a with diphenylacetylene in an overall [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction affords zirconacycle 6a. The study of cycloreversion\/cycloaddition reactions between diazametallacycle complexes and diphenylacetylene was extended to other zirconocene systems.

Kinetic analysis of the reaction of 6e and (i-Pr)N=C=N(i-Pr) to yield 10b supports an associative process wherein alkyne 5a directly inserts into the zirconium-carbon bond of 6e. The diazametallacycle complex 4a underwent a stoichiometric metathetical exchange with symmetrical carbodiimides RN=C=NR (R = p-Tol, m-Tol, i-Pr, Cyc) to generate new cyclic zirconocene complexes and Me(3)SiN=C=NSiMe(3). Kinetic studies were carried out on the exchange reaction between 4a and (m-Tol)N=C=N(m-Tol) to form 4e and Me(3)SiN=C=NSiMe(3).

Additionally, the saturation rate constant derived for this system from the data is the same (within experimental error) as the saturation rate constant obtained from the kinetic study of 4a and diphenylacetylene to form 6a and Me(3)SiN=C=NSiMe(3). These findings provide additional support for a dissociative mechanistic pathway in the exchange reactions, since the rate constant in the formal [2 + 2] retrocycloaddition reaction to generate imidozirconocene species Cp(2)Zr=N-t-Bu (7a) and Me(3)SiN=C=NSiMe(3) should be the same for both reactions.","293":"The titanocene sulfido complex Cp*(2)Ti(S)py (1, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; py = pyridine) is synthesized by addition of a suspension of S(8) to a toluene solution of Cp*(2)Ti-(CH(2)CH(2)) (2) and py.

Complex 1 reacts reversibly with dihydrogen to give Cp*(2)Ti(H)SH (6) and py. Reaction of 1 with HD gives an equilibrium mixture of Cp*(2)Ti(D)SH and Cp*(2)Ti(H)SD; H(2) and D(2) are not formed in this reaction. 1D (1)H NMR magnetization transfer spectra and 2D EXSY (1)H NMR spectra of 6 in the presence of H(2) show that in solution the H(2), hydride, and hydrosulfido hydrogen atoms exchange. A four-center mechanism for this exchange is proposed. The EXSY studies show that the Ti-H and S-H hydrogens exchange with each other more rapidly than either of those hydrogens exchanges with external H(2). A transient dihydrogen complex intermediate is proposed to explain this observation. The infrared spectrum of 6 shows an absorption assigned to the Ti-H stretching mode at 1591 cm(-1) that shifts upon deuteration to 1154 cm(-1).

The structures of 4 and 5 have been determined by X-ray diffraction. Compound 4 reacts with 2 in the presence of py to produce 1. Phosphines react with 4 in the presence of H(2) to provide 6 and the corresponding phosphine sulfide. Reaction of hydrogen with 4 gives Cp*(2)-Ti(SH)(2) (3).

The cycloisomerization is initiated with the formation of metal alkyne pi complex and is followed by the rate-determining step, which transforms the pi complex to a vinylidene carbene complex, considered to be critical for endo-mode cyclization. Several different alkynols have been selected to investigate five- and six-membered ring endo-cycloisomerizations in the presence of Mo(CO)(5) catalyst. The energy barriers calculated for five- and six-membered ring cycloisomerizations are within a range of 25-30 kcal\/mol for most cases studied, showing no significant energy difference between the two metals. The stabilization effect of THF and Et(3)N solvents and the substitution reaction of THF by alkynol substrates in the reaction process with Mo and W complexes are studied as well. The principal difference between Mo- and W-catalyzed cycloisomerization processes appears to be the initial formation of a pi complex, which is more stabilizing for formation of the W-alkyne vs Mo-alkyne complexes.","295":"Anilines react with (POCOP)Ir(C(6)H(5))(H), 12, (POCOP = 2,6-(OPtBu(2))(2)C(6)H(3)) to yield equilibrium mixtures of 12, the Ir(I) sigma-complexes (POCOP)Ir(NH(2)Ar), 13, and the Ir(III) oxidative addition adducts (POCOP)Ir(H)(NHAr), 14. Quantitative studies of these equilibria for a series of anilines were carried out. Anilines possessing electron-withdrawing groups favor the Ir(III) oxidative addition adduct over the Ir(I) sigma complex. Low temperature studies using p-chloroaniline show that the Ir(I) sigma-complex is the kinetic product of reaction and is likely the precursor to the Ir(III) oxidative addition adduct. Reductive elimination of complexes 14 in the presence of ethylene led to the corresponding anilines and the ethylene complex (POCOP)Ir(C(2)H(4)). Kinetic analysis of these reactions for 14e,f,g bearing electron-withdrawing aryl groups (Ar- = p-CF(3)C(6)H(4)-, C(6)F(5)-, 3,5-bis(CF(3))C(6)H(3)-) shows the rate is independent of ethylene concentration. The DeltaG(double dagger) values for these reductive eliminations fall in the range of 21-22 kcal\/mol. X-Ray analysis establishes 14f (Ar- = C(6)F(5)-) as a square pyramidal complex with the hydride occupying the apical site. Reaction of 12 with benzamides 21a,b yields quantitatively the Ir(III) oxidative addition adducts, (POCOP)Ir(H)(NHC(O)Ar), 22. X-Ray analysis of 22b (Ar- = C(6)F(5)-) shows significant interaction of the carbonyl oxygen with Ir in the site trans to hydride. The barrier to reductive elimination of 22a, 29 kcal\/mol, is substantially higher than for complexes 14e,f,g.","296":"The bis(cyclopentadienyl)(tert-butylimido)zir-conium complex 1 undergoes ambient-temperature metathesis reactions with nitro- and nitrosoarenes, providing a rare nonphotochemical synthesis of cis-azoxy and cis-azo compounds, respectively. 2-Nitro-2-methylpropane also undergoes metathesis to give trans-(tert-butylazoxy)-2-methylpropane. This reaction was studied kinetically, and the rate was found to be first order in both 1 and substrate and inversely proportional to the concentration of tetrahydrofuran, with activation parameters DeltaH(double dagger) = 15 +\/- 2 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS(double dagger) = -26 +\/- 3 cal mol(-1) K(-1).","297":"Electron-deficient imines are shown to insert into the zirconium-carbon bond of azazirconacyclobutenes to generate new six-membered ring metallacycles. On heating, these expanded zirconacycles undergo a retro-[4 + 2] cycloaddition to generate alpha,beta-unsaturated imines in excellent yields and novel, fully characterized electron-deficient imidozirconocene complexes.","298":"The reactions of the bis(cyclopentadienyl)(tert-butylimido)zirconium complex (Cp(2)Zr=N-t-Bu)(THF) (1) with epoxides, aziridines, and episulfides were investigated. Heterocycles without accessible beta-hydrogens undergo insertion\/protonation of the C-X bond to produce 1,2-amino alcohols (X = O) and 1,2-diamines (X = NR), whereas heterocycles with accessible beta-hydrogens undergo elimination\/protonation to produce allylic alcohols (X = O) and allylic sulfides (X = S). Mechanistic investigations support a stepwise pathway with zwitterionic intermediates for the first reaction class and a concerted pathway for the second reaction class. Additionally, the feasibility of chirality transfer from the planar-chiral ebthi (ebthi = ethylenebis(tetrahydroindenyl)) ligand was demonstrated with a chiral analogue, (ebthi)-Zr=NAr(THF) (Ar = 2,6-dimethylphenyl), 2, through the diastereoselective ring opening of meso epoxides.","299":"A safe, convenient preparation of the reagent sodium tetrakis[(3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (NaBArF(24)) has been devised by utilizing a magnesium-bromine exchange reaction in the absence of metallic magnesium.
