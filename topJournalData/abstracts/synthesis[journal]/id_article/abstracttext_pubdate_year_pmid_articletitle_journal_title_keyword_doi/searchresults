Specifically, 3-bromo-5-methylphenol is prepared from 3-bromotoluene, without isolation of intermediates, on a multigram scale, and in high yield. The process proceeds under mild conditions and can be completed within one day.","91":"A new route to substituted pyrimido[5,4-e]-1,2,4-triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-diones is outlined. The synthesis proceeds via pre-formed hydrazone intermediates, which are then condensed with an activated chlorouracil to build up the entire molecular framework, followed by a reductive ring closure to provide the parent series. The route has been extended to the isomeric pyrimido[5,4-e]-1,2,4-triazine-5,7(6H,8H)-dione class via the use of methylhydrazine as hydrazine surrogate, followed by regiospecific alkylation of the N(8)-H pyrimidotriazinediones with a range of alkyl and alkaryl substituents. This new methodology permits the generation of a wide range of compounds with variable substitution at the N(1), C(3), and N(8) positions for a heterocyclic scaffold with demonstrated pharmacological activity.","92":"A selection of carbon-fluorine bond-forming reactions is presented with particular focus on transition metal-mediated fluorination. A brief summary of conventional fluorination reactions is followed by a discussion of fluorination reactions mediated by palladium and silver. Investigations into the mechanism as well as the conceptual difficulty associated with transition metal-mediated carbon-fluorine bond formation are presented.","93":null,"94":"","95":"An effective one-pot, regioselective double Suzuki coupling of 2,4-dichloropyrimidine has been developed, which enables the quick and efficient synthesis of diarylated pyrimidines. The choice of solvent proved critical to the success of this reaction sequence, with alcoholic solvent mixtures affording much greater reactivity and correspondingly lower temperatures than the use of polar aprotic solvents.","96":"Multidimensional reaction screening employing complex 1,2-cycloheptanediones is described. The studies have enabled the discovery of regioselective, Lewis acid-mediated condensations with substituted ureas and a diastereoselective hydrogenation process which proceeds via an interesting allylpalladium hydride isomerization.","97":"We report the copper(II)-catalyzed conversion of organoboron compounds into the corresponding azide derivatives. A systematic series of phenylboronic acid derivatives is evaluated to examine the importance of steric and electronic effects of the substituents on reaction yield as well as functional group compatibility. Heterocyclic substrates are also shown to participate in this mild reaction while compounds incorporating B-C(sp(3)) bonds are unreactive under the reaction conditions. The copper(II)-catalyzed boronic acid-azide coupling reaction is further extended to both boronate esters and potassium organotrifluoroborate salts. The method described herein complements existing procedures for the preparation of aryl azides from the respective amino, triazene, and halide derivatives and we expect that it will greatly facilitate copper- and ruthenium-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions for the preparation of diversely functionalized 1-aryl- or 1-heteroaryl-1,2,3-triazoles derivatives.","98":"Details in developing a stereodivergent approach to the lepadin family and establishing an entry to both C2,8a-syn and C2,8a-anti relative stereochemical manifolds through a common intermediate are described here. This works paves a foundation for constructing all members of the lepadin family, which consists of three subsets based on an array of interesting relative configurations. These efforts underline the prominence of aza-[3 + 3] annulation as a unified strategy in alkaloid synthesis.","99":null,"100":"The Julia-Kocienski olefination provides a versatile platform for the synthesis of fluorovinyl compounds. This review describes our efforts as well as those of others in the synthesis of various fluorinated aryl and heteroaryl sulfones and their utility as olefination reagents for the modular assembly of fluoroalkenes. Where data is available, the influence of the fluorine atom on the reactivity of the olefination reagents and the stereochemical outcome of the olefination are described.","101":"Iron chelators have been shown to control the growth of cancer cells in culture by sequestering exogenous iron in the media. Thus, the ligands prevent cellular access to the metal. However, because transferrin provides iron to tumor cells in animals, chelators have not been effective antitumor agents. Polyamine chelator conjugates in which the polyamine vectored ligands into cells were far more active than the free chelators themselves. However, the free ligands were not released from the vector once in the cell. The current study focuses on the synthesis and preliminary evaluation of a polyamine chelator conjugate capable of releasing the free ligand intracellularly via a nonspecific esterase.","102":"The construction of CNS active imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepines has been improved in a one-pot annulation process.","103":"Short stereoselective syntheses of various cyclitols, including the derivatives of conduritol B, conduritol F, myo-inositol and chiro-inositol, have been accomplished. The key steps in the syntheses are a ring-closing metathesis process and a diastereodivergent organometallic addition to a D-xylose-derived alde-hyde.","104":"1-Alkylstyrenes undergo efficient hydrovinylation (addition of ethylene) in the presence of a Ni-catalyst prepared from [(allyl)NiBr](2), Na(+) [BAr(4)](-) (Ar = 3,5-bis-trifluromethylphenyl), and a phosphoramidite ligand giving products in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. In many cases phosphoramidites derived from achiral 2,2'-biphenol are almost as good as ligands derived from the more expensive enantiopure 2,2'-binaphthols. The hydrovinylation products, which carry two versatile latent functionalities, an aryl and a vinyl group, are potentially useful for the synthesis of several important natural products containing benzylic all-carbon quaternary centers.","105":"The use of several variants of the asymmetric aldol reaction as key steps in the syntheses of bioactive target molecules is described.","106":"One-pot double couplings of dibromothiophenes have been investigated. Standard Suzuki couplings work well for 2,4-dibromothiophene, but are much more sensitive to steric effects in the case of 2,3-dibromothiophene. By using the recently reported potassium borates, though, good yields for both dibromothiophene isomers can be achieved.","107":"Practical methodology is reported for the synthesis of a homologous series of side chain extended amino acids containing aminooxy functionality bearing orthogonal protection suitable for Fmoc peptide synthesis. These reagents may be useful for the preparation of libraries containing fragments joined by peptide linkers.","108":null,"109":"Methods for the enantioselective conversion of D-xylose to differentially protected myo-inositol and L-chiro-inositol have been developed. The key transformation is a highly diastereoselective intramolecular SmI(2)-promoted pinacol coupling. The stereoselectivity was extremely dependent on the conditions, suggesting a change in mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic experiments and possible explanations for this behavior are discussed.","110":"An overview of studies on hydrogenative reductive aldol addition is presented. By simply hydrogenating enones in the presence of aldehydes at ambient temperature and pressure, aldol adducts are generated under neutral conditions in the absence of any stoichiometric byproducts. Using cationic rhodium complexes modified by tri(2-furyl)phosphine, highly syn-diastereoselective reductive aldol additions of vinyl ketones are achieved. Finally, using novel monodentate TADDOL-like phosphonite ligands, the first highly diastereo- and enantioselective reductive aldol couplings of vinyl ketones were devised. These studies, along with other works from our laboratory, demonstrate that organometallics arising transiently in the course of catalytic hydrogenation offer byproduct-free alternatives to preformed organometallic reagents employed in classical carbonyl addition processes.","111":null,"112":"Two novel, highly fluorinated macrocyclic chelators with highly branched and spherically symmetric fluorocarbon moieties have been designed and efficiently synthesized. This is achieved by conjugating a spherically symmetric fluorocarbon moiety to the macrocyclic chelator DOTA, with or without a flexible oligo-oxyethylene linker between these two parts. As a result of the spherical symmetry, all 27 fluorine atoms in each fluorinated chelator give a sharp singlet (19)F NMR signal. The hydrophilicity and the (19)F relaxation behavior of fluorinated chelators can be modulated by the insertion of a flexible linker between the fluorocarbon moiety and the macrocyclic linker. These chelators serve as prototypes for (1)H-(19)F dual-nuclei magnetic resonance imaging agents.","113":"A regioselective method for highly efficient C-N and C-S bond formation with 2-halobenzoic acids is described. The Cu\/Cu(2)O-catalyzed reaction is carried out in 2-ethoxyethanol or ethylene glycol diethyl ether and does not require the use of strong base or other additives. This procedure eliminates the need for acid protection, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and provides aromatic and aliphatic amines and sulfides in 81 to 99% yield.","114":"In order to provide an authentic standard and to generate pure material for biological testing, an efficient synthetic route to 1 was developed. This represents the first total synthesis of a major bioactive diynone from E. pallida.","115":"A stereoselective synthesis of (3R,3aS,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-ol, an important high affinity P2-ligand, in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;99%) is reported. The synthesis features an ester-derived titanium enolate based highly stereoselective anti-aldol reaction as the key step.","116":null,"117":"A review on the syntheses of bioactive compounds published since 1995 using tartaric acid and its derivatives as synthons is presented.","118":"The treatment of HIV and AIDS was revolutionized by the introduction of peptidomimetic aspartyl protease inhibitors. One of the major limitations of this type of therapy is that higher therapeutic doses are necessary because of the presence of 'peptide-like' features in the drugs. Therefore, adequate supplies and cost effective syntheses of these drugs are of utmost importance. To date, there are six protease inhibitors approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. This review focuses on the published syntheses of currently FDA approved HIV protease inhibitor drugs, their isosteres and ligands.","119":"A review on cis-1-aminoindan-2-ol derived asymmetric syntheses is described.","120":"(1S,2R)- and (1R,2S)-l-aminoindan-2-ol were prepared in high enantiomeric excess (&gt;96%) by an immobilized lipase-catalyzed selective acylation of racemic trans- l-azidoindan-2-ol.","121":null,"122":""},"articletitle":{"0":"A Convenient Protecting Group for Uridine Ureido Nitrogen: (4,4'-Bisfluorophenyl)methoxymethyl group.","1":"Condensation-Based Methods for the C-H Bond Functionalization of Amines.","2":"Total Synthesis of Oxepin and Dihydrooxepin Containing Natural Products.","3":"Synthesis of 2,24-Diene-12,13,15,16,34,35,37,38-octaphenyl[4.4]-triphenylparacyclophane.","4":"Titanium and Cobalt Bimetallic Radical Redox Relay for the Isomerization of N-Bz Aziridines to Allylic Amides.","5":"Fluorine-Retentive Strategies for the Functionalization of gem-Difluoroalkenes.","6":"Recent Advances in the Development of Catalytic Methods that Construct Medium-ring Lactams, Partially Saturated Benzazepines and their Derivatives.","7":"Recent Advancements in Pyrrole Synthesis.","8":"The Synthesis of Conjugated Bis-Aryl Vinyl Substrates and Their Photoelectrocyclization Reactions towards Phenanthrene Derivatives.","9":"Synthesis of Cyclohexane-Angularly-Fused Triquinanes.","10":"Cobalt(III)-Catalyzed Diastereoselective Three-Component C-H Bond Addition to Butadiene and Activated Ketones.","11":"Cu(OTf)2-catalyzed Beckmann Rearrangement of Ketones Using Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic Acid (HOSA).","12":null,"13":"Recent advances in the application of ring-closing metathesis for the synthesis of unsaturated nitrogen heterocycles.","14":"Structure, Reactivity, and Synthetic Applications of Sodium Diisopropylamide.","15":"Rhodium(III)-Catalyzed Three-Component 1,2-Diamination of Unactivated Terminal Alkenes.","16":"Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Alkyl Heck-Type Reactions.","17":"Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions on functionalized 2-trifluoromethyl-4-chromenone scaffolds.
