crises are increasingly prevalent in health care settings. Existing programs, however, include procedures that lack adaptability, omit critical components, and deviate from clinical best-practice recommendations. Health care employees also continue to report lacking confidence for safely managing behavioral crises. We described the development and acceptability of a comprehensive crisis prevention program and its modification for a large pediatric health care system to help remediate the limitations of existing programs. Chi-square analyses evaluated the acceptability of the crisis prevention program pre- versus post-training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up times. For insignificant outcomes, logistical regressions identify whether responses differed between emergency-department and nonemergency-department employees. Chi-square analyses were significant for 10 of 15 questions suggesting that employees were more confident in managing and communicating during behavioral crises post-training, and that this confidence was maintained. Logistic regressions found that emergency-department employees differed in some responses to the acceptability questionnaire than nonemergency-department employees over time. The present crisis prevention program is adaptable to various settings and patients, and it is well received overall by employees. The safety of patients and employees is integral to the delivery of quality care and improving patient-provider relations. ","1":"Mental health problems are estimated to affect one in six individuals in the European Union. Fifty percent of mental disorders start in adolescence, around the age of 14. The stigma associated with having a mental health problem is one of the main barriers to seeking help for psychiatric and psychological disorders among adolescents and young adults. Interventions to reduce social stigma could contribute to increased help-seeking behavior in this population. AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of a direct contact intervention in the classroom by persons with lived experience to reduce vocational students' stigmatizing attitudes. METHOD: One person with lived experience and one first-degree relative implemented a classroom intervention lasting 90 min. Its effectiveness was measured using a quasi-experimental study with a pretest-posttest design and within-subject control. RESULTS: A total of 128 students from three different Vocational and Technical Schools from Spain participated in the study. After the intervention, statistically significant differences were observed in the scores of 11 of the 13 dimensions measured with the Spanish Mental Illness Stigma Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27-E) and the Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness (CAMI) questionnaires. No differences associated with gender or familiarity with the mental disorder were observed. CONCLUSION: Vocational students' negative attitudes and emotions can be improved through a direct contact intervention in the classroom involving people who have experienced a mental disorder themselves. The age range for optimal results with this type of intervention appears to be 18 to 20 years.","2":"OBJECTIVE: The use of sexual activity to self-injure has been proposed in research literature but remains underexplored. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of identifying sexual activity as self-injury in a U.S. college-based sample and to provide a preliminary examination of sexual activity as self-injury to inform future study on this topic. METHOD: A cross-sectional descriptive pilot study was conducted to assess for recognition of and attitudes toward sexual behavior as self-injury and to identify participant-reported experiences of sexual activity to self-injure. RESULTS: A total of 50 participants completed the online survey. Thirteen (26%) participants reported they had heard of the concept of \"sex as self-injury.\" Six (12%) participants reported ever having used sexual activity to cause physical or psychological harm to themselves. Participants reported intentions for engaging in sexual activity to self-injure, including causing physical pain, reliving past self-harm or trauma, showing vulnerability, proving self-worth, pleasing or wanting to feel needed by their partner, and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Sexual activities have been used by some college students as a means of self-harm. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon and clinicians should consider screening for this in patients who participate in dangerous sexual behaviors or self-injurious behaviors.","3":"The life expectancy of patients with severe mental illness (SMI) is estimated to be 20 to 30 years shorter than in the general population due to avoidable physical illnesses. This gap is widening. Health care professionals' performance with regard to physical health and lifestyle appears to be suboptimal. The purpose of this study is to formulate recommendations to enhance physical care for patients with an SMI. A generic descriptive qualitative study was conducted. Fifteen mental health nurses (MHNs) working in community mental health care in the Netherlands were interviewed. Thematic analysis of the data was performed. Most MHNs perceived physical screening and lifestyle interventions to be an important part of their professional role. However, they recognize discrepancy between their perception and actual practice. Most MHNs focus in particular on the psychiatric illness and its consequences for daily living, and they defined the provision of physical health care as a secondary concern. Participants described building a therapeutic relationship as a crucial, however, difficult part of the process of working on physical health promotion. Many MHNs tend to formulate goals and necessary behavioral changes on behalf of their patients, rather than helping them formulate their own goals and activities for themselves. Building a good therapeutic relationship with patients and supporting patients in defining their own lifestyle goals can enhance nursing physical care. Support by other team members (such as NPs) and managers is needed. In training and education for professionals, the lessons learned in this study should be included. ","4":null,"5":"Research suggests that persons diagnosed with behavioral health illnesses can benefit from shared decision-making. On an inpatient behavioral health unit, low Press Ganey scores related to satisfaction with involvement in care triggered a root cause analysis that identified patients did not feel engaged by nursing during their time together; and discharge meetings with the health care team were not required. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to improve patient perception of involvement in their care as evidenced by increased Press Ganey scores and increased number of patients involved in discharge meetings. Nurses used an evidence-based model for nurse-patient communication: the Seeking information, Engaging in conversation, Exploring options, and Deciding on treatment (SEED) and use of a Control Preferences Scale (CPS) to increase communication about treatment and discharge decisions. A total of 120 patients engaged in the intervention. Patient presence at discharge meetings increased from 39% to 82% (p &lt; .001), and Press Ganey scores evidenced minimal change. Use of the SEED model and CPS by nurses was effective in increasing patients' involvement in their treatment. Although findings were limited due to COVID-19, the study suggests that improving patient involvement from admission through discharge throughout hospitalization can improve patient experience scores. ","6":"","7":"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among undergraduate class status, risky behaviors (i.e., alcohol and marijuana use, sexual activity), life satisfaction, and ability to cope. Undergraduate students (N = 2,961) completed an electronic survey to assess for mental health status and risky behaviors. Compared with others, first-year students reported fewer days of having at least one alcoholic drink, fewer days of having five or more alcoholic drinks in a row, and less frequency of marijuana use. First-year students reported fewer sexual partners and less frequency of sexual activity compared with others. First-year students were more likely to report greater life satisfaction, being able to cope with difficult situations, and greater self-worth, compared with others. As undergraduate students progress through their academic career, they are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and experience life dissatisfaction. ","8":"Adults with severe mental illnesses have mortality rates 2.5 to 3 times higher than the general population, largely due to medical illnesses. Those with the most profound mental illnesses are served by assertive community treatment (ACT) teams that provide intensive mental health care; however, there are no clearly established models to integrate physical health treatment into ACT and this is a critical gap in the literature. To describe perceptions of ACT team members regarding services provided for their clients to treat physical health, how those services can be improved, and what implementation strategies would likely be needed to promote uptake and sustainability of those services on ACT teams. Qualitative interviews were conducted via Zoom using a semistructured interview guide with 19 employees from three ACT teams in a southeastern state. Interview transcripts were analyzed, using manifest content analysis, a form of qualitative analysis, to identify key themes in the interview transcripts. ACT team members described limited physical health services for their clients. They reported (1) system-level barriers to improving physical health care, such as inadequate tools and training; and (2) patient-level barriers, such as limited awareness of physical care needs. ACT team members reported the need for additional medical staff and strengthened relationships with primary care providers. They also recommended changes in policy, education, and quality monitoring to implement new physical health care services. Findings suggest intervention components and implementation strategies for improving physical health care of ACT consumers. ","9":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with substance use disorders (SUDs) are at risk for adverse delivery outcomes, and some of these women have psychiatric comorbidities that increase this risk. AIMS: Although comprehensive care models offering prenatal care services and substance abuse treatment have been found to positively affect delivery outcomes for pregnant women with SUDs, there is a dearth of research to support such models for women who have psychiatric comorbidities. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between pretreatment psychiatric comorbidity and delivery outcomes for pregnant clients with SUDs receiving comprehensive treatment. We analyzed two groups of pregnant women with SUDs and hypothesized that women with psychiatric comorbidities would have worse neonatal and maternal outcomes compared with those who did not have any pretreatment psychiatric comorbidity. Regression models were used to examine changes in delivery outcome criteria (birthweight, neonatal abstinence syndrome, maternal urine toxicology screens at delivery, and hospital length of stay) in relation to psychiatric comorbidity among a sample of 74 mother-baby dyads receiving comprehensive care treatment. RESULTS: Results did not support our hypothesis as delivery outcomes were statistically similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest comprehensive care can reduce the risk of negative delivery outcomes among women with SUDs who have psychiatric comorbidities. Treatment and research implications are provided.","10":"Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are unique and effective pharmacological treatment options for schizophrenia that are underutilized in clinical practice. Research surrounding prescriber barriers to the underuse of LAIs are limited to a few seminal studies which identified psychiatric prescriber barriers to the use of LAIs as knowledge deficits, uninformed attitudes, and poor prescribing practices. There is a gap in the literature regarding effective educational interventions to target the identified psychiatric prescriber barriers to the use of LAIs. The study aimed to develop a web-based educational toolkit that would positively affect the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of psychiatric prescribers regarding LAIs. A one-group, before and after design with a convenience, purposive sample of 17 psychiatric prescribers to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) using a 20-item KAP questionnaire before and after a presentation of a web-based educational toolkit about LAIs was chosen. The web-based educational toolkit slightly improved the total and three subscales KAP scores of psychiatric prescribers. However, only the difference in total KAP scores was found to be statistically significant. The developed and evaluated web-based educational toolkit could provide a foundation for positive change to psychiatric prescribers' KAP regarding LAIs. ","11":"BACKGROUND: Depression has long been accepted as a serious disability and burden globally, while suicide is a misunderstood and complex cause of death. Psychache is the psychological variable most strongly associated with suicidality. Spirituality is considered an important buffer against stressful events and may help people overcome distress and difficulties. AIMS: This study aims to determine how psychache and suicide risk are related to levels of spiritual well-being in patients with depression. METHODS: Data were collected using the Suicide Probability Scale, the Psychache Scale, and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. The sample study consisted of 150 Turkish patients diagnosed with depression and receiving psychiatric care. RESULTS: It was found that higher level of spiritual well-being led to decreased risk of suicide and lower level of psychache. Suicide risk increased in parallel to the increasing levels of psychache (p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that higher levels of spiritual well-being may promote a significantly lower risk of suicide and lower levels of psychache. Likewise, increasing levels of psychache may lead to an increase in suicide risk.","12":"Suicide is of primary public concern for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who commonly use social media platforms to express their suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Understanding how AYAs communicate their suicide-related thoughts and behaviors in texts can support early detection of suicide risk from their social media posts. Therefore, this study sought to identify themes relevant to suicide risk in AYAs and explore words or terms used by AYAs when they described suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This secondary data analysis utilized an existing data set collected from 255 AYAs between 12 and 25 years of age, who provided brief descriptions of how they and their peers expressed their experiences of self-harm, suicidal thinking, and attempts. Text analysis was conducted using KH Coder software. Three-step theory of suicide was used to guide a content analysis to explore the key themes from the narratives. A word co-occurrence network with 24 clusters of words was generated from the text analysis. These word clusters were further grouped into pain or hopelessness, connectedness, and capacity to attempt suicide in the content analysis. Six subthemes corresponding to these three themes were identified to provide detailed information: psychological or physical pain, hopelessness, relationship, help seeking, methods, and outcomes. Moreover, several slang terms and acronyms (e.g., Kermit Sewage Slide, KMS) were also identified. The findings of this study, including themes and slang terms and acronyms, are valuable to facilitate the use of terms or phrases within social media texts to identify suicide risk in AYAs. ","13":"","14":"The physical benefits for patients who spend time with a therapy dog have been reported, including decreased anxiety. Pet therapy has decreased anxiety in various hospitalized patient populations. The human-animal bond is the foundation for the positive interaction therapy dogs create. This study's purpose was to explore the use of pet therapy as an intervention to decrease patients' anxiety levels on two diverse inpatient units: Behavioral Health (BHU) and Pediatrics (PEDS). This was a quantitative study using a convenience sample, with systematic assignment to the experimental and control group. The State Anxiety Scale (SAS), a 6-item, Likert-type Short Form version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, was used with adults and children; a Pediatric Emoji Method was constructed to assist children with the SAS. After consent, both groups completed the SAS pretest. Intervention patients then spent up to 15 minutes with a therapy dog and handler. The SAS posttest was completed 1 hour later by the experimental and control group. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used, including an independent samples t test, paired-sample t test, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and Spearman correlation coefficients. Findings revealed that the therapy dog visitations had a positive effect on lowering anxiety supporting the hypothesis. Both the PEDS and BHU participants experienced a significant decrease in their anxiety level following the dog visits. Patients on the BHU and PEDS units benefitted from their visit with a therapy dog by experiencing a decrease in their anxiety level. ","15":"BACKGROUND: Women use various coping strategies to deal with stress and depression. These strategies are shaped by social contexts over the life course and may attenuate and\/or exacerbate the physiologic effects of depression. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether coping strategies (active, disengaged, or social support coping) moderate depression-related diurnal cortisol dysregulation and to explore how social context influences women's use of coping. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study of pregnant women (N = 65) during mid-pregnancy. Cortisol was measured in saliva collected during the waking hours of the day. Participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Brief COPE. A subset of the sample participated in semistructured qualitative interviews (n = 20). RESULTS: Social support coping, but not active or disengaged coping, moderated end-of-day cortisol levels. Among depressed women, higher use of social support was associated with lower and more dynamic (i.e., less flat) diurnal cortisol rhythms. The qualitative findings revealed how complex social dynamics related to financial insecurity, lack of mutuality, and social identity affected women's use of and access to social support. CONCLUSION: These findings support theories of the stress-buffering effects of social support. Future research is needed to examine how social determinants affect access to social support, and how early life social experiences condition women's adaptive formation of social support coping strategies over the life course. Clinically, these findings underscore the value of relationship-centered nursing care for depressed women.","16":"Nurses and nursing students are at risk for negative mental health as a result of significant work stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to (1) describe the mental health of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) investigate relationships between stressful COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and (3) examine correlates of mental health service use. This observational study used a web-based survey to assess COVID-19 experiences, self-reported mental health, and mental health service utilization among nursing students in Los Angeles in spring 2021 (N = 174, 30.1% response rate). The survey used measures of stressful COVID-19 experiences (personal COVID-19 illness, hospitalization of close friends or family, and death of close friends or family), loneliness, resilience, depression, anxiety, COVID-19-related traumatic stress, and utilization of campus and noncampus mental health services. Students had high levels of depression (30%), anxiety (38%), and traumatic stress (30%). There was no relationship between stressful COVID-19 experiences and mental health, but loneliness was associated with higher odds of mental health problems and resilience with lower odds. Mental health problems were not associated with use of campus or noncampus mental health services. Students with primary caregiving responsibilities (OR = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.87]) and students who identified as Asian\/Pacific Islander (OR = 0.24, 95% CI [0.09, 0.70]) had lower odds of mental health service utilization. Resilience and loneliness affect nursing student risk for negative mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted, accessible mental health support within nursing education programs may be warranted.

AIM: To evaluate the quality of evidence of the therapeutic interventions performed by nurses for anxiety disorders. METHOD: An analysis of the quality of evidence was performed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The systematic review protocol was registered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Prospero), CRD420202939. RESULTS: The interventions performed by nurses were effective (d = 0.44), with significant improvement in reducing anxiety levels, reducing drug use, and improving self-control. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that therapeutic interventions performed by nurses are beneficial for individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders, with significant improvement in reducing anxiety levels, reducing medication use, improving self-control, and remission of anxiety symptoms.","21":"BACKGROUND: The practice environment influences the quality of care and the nursing outcomes achieved in their workplaces. OBJECTIVE: To examine the perception of the clinical practice environment among nurses working in mental health units in the context of their participation in an action research study aimed at improving the nurse-patient relationship. METHOD: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study was designed. The data were collected in three phases in 18 mental health units (n = 95 nurses). Quantitative data were collected through the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index, and qualitative data were collected through reflective diaries and focus groups in the context of participatory action research. RESULTS: The nurses' assessment of their practice environment shifted from positive to negative. Nurse manager leadership was the aspect that worsened the most. In addition, the perception of their participation in the affairs of the center and nursing foundations for quality of care decreased. The nurses considered it essential to be able to influence decision-making bodies and that the institution should promote a model of care that upholds the therapeutic relationship in actual clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses perceived that they should be involved in organizational decisions and required more presence and understanding from managers. Furthermore, nurses stated that institutions should promote nursing foundations for quality of care. This study contributes to understanding how nurses in mental health units perceive their work environment and how it affects the improvement of the nurse-patient relationship in clinical practice.","22":"Although several studies have recently described compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout (BO), and secondary traumatic stress (STS) in nurses, few to date have examined these issues across nursing specialties. Such examination is needed to inform future nursing-subspecialty tailored interventions. To examine (1) differences in CS, BO, and STS across nursing specialties and (2) differences associated with demographic, work-related, and behavioral factors among nurses. A secondary analysis of survey responses from nurses (N = 350) at an academic medical center. Demographic, behavioral, work-related, and professional quality of life variables were analyzed using hierarchical regression analyses. CS, BO, and STS scores significantly varied across specialties with emergency nurses experiencing significantly elevated rates of BO and STS, and lowest rates of CS; scores were also differentially associated with demographic, work-related, behavioral, and workplace violence variables. Key differences in CS, BO, and STS by nursing specialty suggests the importance of tailoring BO and STS mitigative interventions. BO and STS risk factors should be assessed in nurses (e.g., behavioral health problems and poor sleep quality) and specialty-specific interventions (e.g., reducing workplace violence exposure in emergency settings) may be considered to improve CS while reducing BO and STS among nurses.

This study aims to examine the factors associated with HIV psychosocial illness impact among Black\/African American and Hispanic older women living with HIV. Guided by the socioecological model, a secondary data analysis design with cross-sectional data that included 138 Black\/African American and Hispanic women aged 50 years and older was conducted. Higher levels of avoidant coping, depressive symptoms, negative self-perception of health, and decreased social support were significant factors associated with HIV psychosocial illness impact among this sample. Findings from this study can contribute to identifying solutions to prevent and decrease these negative factors associated with HIV psychosocial illness impact among Black\/African American and Hispanic older women. ","24":"In 2017, more than 1,200 opioid-related deaths were reported in Virginia, with slightly fewer in 2018, at 1,193 deaths. The current opioid crisis has placed a strain on an already limited number of mental health (MH) inpatient beds. The industry standard for assessment and treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, in the inpatient setting, is the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and yet some units continue to utilize the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) for this population. The purpose of this nurse-led performance improvement project was to implement COWS in the inpatient MH setting and improve length of stay (LOS) by 1 day. In 2018, in a large federal teaching facility in the mid-Atlantic region, the COWS was implemented to replace the CIWA-Ar for opioid withdrawal, with the focus on decreasing LOS. Prior to implementation of COWS, LOS on the inpatient MH unit for opioid withdrawal was 8.6 days, which was higher than the ~6- to 7-day LOS for surrounding private sector hospitals. Individual electronic medical records were reviewed for LOS and completion of COWS and pertinent details were discussed daily with nursing staff and monthly with the interdisciplinary team. Baseline data were collected from April 2017 to March 2018, with data collection continuing through the project implementation, April to September 2018. Completion of COWS on 100% of patients admitted with opioid withdrawal and a decrease in LOS from 8.6 to 4.7 days was found, a 45% reduction. The nurse-driven performance improvement project affected business acumen, through decreased LOS, as well as quality of care, through better symptom management. ","25":"","26":"BACKGROUND: Despite an increase in access to medications for opioid use disorder, less than 20% of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) receive treatment. Stigmatizing language has been identified as a potential trigger for explicit and implicit biases that may adversely affect treatment enrollment and quality of care for persons with OUD. AIMS: To conduct a narrative review of the literature on stigmatizing language and OUD, examine how treatment outcomes are affected, and present strategies to reduce bias and promote OUD treatment. METHOD: A narrative review of the literature between 2010 and 2019 was conducted using CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO. Key search terms were opioid use disorder (or substance use disorder), stigma, and language. Fifty-two articles were screened for inclusion, and 17 articles were included in this review. RESULTS: The articles reviewed provide consensus that stigmatizing language toward persons with OUD fosters explicit and implicit bias and impedes engagement in treatment. Four themes emerged: (1) stigma and language, (2) stigma and language used by health care professionals, (3) stigma and language used by the general public, and (4) stigma and language used by people with OUD. CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing language is dehumanizing and plays a pivotal role in bias and discrimination that may contribute to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes among persons with OUD. Health care professionals, nursing in particular, must assume an intentional stance against stigma perpetuated toward persons with OUD through advocacy in education, practice, policy, and the media.","27":"Tobacco continues to have a deleterious impact on health outcomes in the United States. Professional nurses at all levels of practice have an opportunity to be a part of the solution. The development of nurse-specific competencies for treating tobacco use disorder (TUD) disorder is long overdue. A task force of American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) subject matter experts was assembled to engage in the process of reviewing the available peer-reviewed literature and additional evidence-based resources (e.g., professional organization position statement, toolkits, national survey results) to create the Nursing Competencies for Treating Tobacco Use Disorders. The aim of this article is ultimately to improve patient access to quality, evidence-based TUD nursing care by all nurses who are competent, full partners in TUD multidisciplinary care. Search terms were defined and a scoping search and review of the TUD literature and resources was performed from November 2018 to November 2020. Over 300 articles and evidence-based resources (e.g., professional organization position statements, toolkits, etc.) were discovered. Thirteen competencies were developed and were internally and externally reviewed prior to APNA Board of Director's approval. TUD competencies have the potential to guide nursing education, practice, and research, allowing nurses to be full partners in the design, development, and implementation of effective TUD treatment.

The rate of restraint use at the institution underperformed compared with the national average, which led to the project implementation. This quality improvement project's objective was to decrease restraint and seclusion use, improve quality of care, and decrease cost through implementation of recovery model principles. Implementation started in October 2019 on a 14-bed inpatient medical\/geriatric psychiatric unit with 38 psychiatric RNs at a large academic medical center. The project was a pre-post implementation design with interventions consisting of staff education, RN language observation, and orientation toolkit development. Changes in staff knowledge were measured by Recovery Knowledge Inventory surveys at baseline, 1 week posteducation, and 4 months posteducation. Restraint and seclusion use data were analyzed 3 months preimplementation and 3 months postimplementation. Staff knowledge of the recovery model increased from baseline to 1 week postimplementation in all four survey domains (range = 6% to 9% improvement). While improvements were maintained in two survey domains, two domains of staff knowledge showed slight declines (1% to 2% decline in scores) 4 months postintervention. Restraint use decreased 73.1% and seclusion use decreased 16.3% from pre to postintervention. Implementation of recovery model principles can decrease restraint and seclusion episodes, which increases quality and decreases cost to the organization.

Although the independent physical and mental health consequences of alcohol misuse and cigarette smoking are well documented, little is known on how substance use moderates the relationship between physical and mental well-being. The purpose of this study was to examine whether substance use moderates the relationship between physical activity and mental health in adults. This was a secondary analysis of data provided by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants (N = 450,016) were adults who completed the BRFSS in 2017. Those who did not drink alcohol had fewer mental health problems when they indicated greater amounts of time spent doing physical activities each week. Last, smokers' number of mental health problems decreased as they engaged in more physical activity, whereas nonsmokers' number of mental health problems increased as they engaged in more physical activity. The relationship between physical activity and mental health outcomes is well established and cannot be overemphasized. Nonetheless, substance abuse can moderate this relationship and should be routinely screened for by health care providers regardless of treatment setting. ","34":"The national average for the occurrence of postpartum depression (PPD) is 11.5%. Women enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program are at an elevated risk for PPD symptoms due to risk factors such as a low income, unemployment, low education level, and younger maternal age. To implement screening for PPD symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (1987) for women participating in the local WIC program with an infant &lt;12 months old and compare results of positive screenings to the national average. The second goal was to provide community resources to those women with a positive score. Of 72 women screened, 69 scores were used in the comparison of the positive scores to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention average of 11.5%. Women were offered community resources after completion of the EPDS. There were 13 positive scores out of the sample size of 69. The percentage of positive scores obtained from these data were 18.84% for the WIC population, which is higher than the national average of 11.5%. This was significant with p = .0494. One limitation of this project was a small sample size. It would be beneficial for the WIC program to screen women for PPD symptoms in this high-risk population, so that recommendations for follow-up care could be made and quality of life could be increased.

It is unknown whether psychiatric nurses' competencies would be enhanced through short training courses. The present study employed a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the effectiveness of an 8-hour sexual health care training for psychiatric nurses to improve sexual health knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy in a teaching psychiatric hospital in southern Taiwan. Volunteered psychiatric nurses were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group. The 8-hour training program contained sexual health knowledge and attitudes, case discussion, role play, and sexual identity or harassment issues. Each nurse received a pretest and a posttest in the 1-month period between August and September 2019. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the effects. Among the 75 psychiatric nurses, 43 were in the control group and 32 were in the experimental group. The two groups were not significantly different in the working year, gender, education, marriage, and other psychosocial variables. After the training, the overall performance of sexual health care knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of the experimental group improved significantly than the controls. The sexual health care training program enhanced psychiatric nurses' confidence and generally improved their sexual knowledge and attitudes. It is suggested that sexual health care needs to be highlighted during in-job training to augment the well-being and life quality of psychiatric patients.

","38":"Postpartum depression (PPD) may have adverse outcomes for mothers, their infants, and families. Despite the negative consequences of PPD many women hesitate to seek treatment. The theoretical concepts of this study were based on the health belief model, which focuses on the individual's attitudes, beliefs, and intentions to seek treatment. The aim of the study was to examine whether health beliefs and social support mediate the links between sociodemographic variables and treatment preferences for PPD. Cross-sectional survey, including 1,000 Jewish mothers attending the maternal and child health clinics in Israel for their infant's medical exam, 4 weeks to 6 months postpartum. Mother's age and years of education correlated positively with preferences to receive treatment in the private sector and from professionals working in mental health clinics. The greater the number of children, the less likely new mothers were to favor these preferences. Structural equation modeling showed several mediating pathways: social support mediated the links between sociodemographic variables to health belief model components such as perceived benefits, barriers, and environmental cues. Health belief model components also mediated the links between sociodemographic factors and preferences for place of treatment, professionals, and modes of treatment for PPD. Health belief model components and social support are important mediating components that help explain mothers' PPD treatment preferences. Health professionals such as psychiatric or public health nurses should increase awareness of women at risk for PPD and elicit their preferred treatment options. ","39":"Integrated behavioral health is a model of health care that aims to meet the complex health care needs of patients in primary care settings. Collaborative Care (CC) is an evidence-based model incorporating an interdisciplinary team to improve outcomes for behavioral health disorders commonly seen by primary care providers. CC was implemented in a nurse-managed health center in a medically underserved community of Chicago with a team of family nurse practitioners, psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners, and a licensed clinical social worker. Integration of the CC model required restructuring of the patient visit, the care team, and financial operations. Weekly team meetings were held for interdisciplinary case consultation and training for the primary care team by the psychiatric nurse practitioner. The model includes suggested goals of reducing patient scores of validated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) screening tools to a score less than 5 points or to less than 50% of original score. During the initial year of implementation, 166 patients received care under the CC model, with 64 patients currently receiving active care. In this cohort, 22% reached suggested goals for depression and 47% for anxiety. CC has benefits for both patients and providers. Patients receive holistic treatment of both mental and physical health needs and access to psychiatric services for medication initiation and behavioral health modalities when necessary. We observed that the CC model improved collaboration with behavioral health specialists and the competence and confidence of family nurse practitioners. ","40":"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common mental disorder. Literature has explored patients' perspectives of the recovering process of depression. However, there is a lack of research to explore both patients' and caregivers' perspectives of the healing process and develop a theory to support patients with depression. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to develop a substantive theory that depicts patients with depression toward healing and recovering. METHOD: This study used a grounded theory approach and collected data between 2019 and 2020 in a medical center in Taiwan. A theoretical sampling was performed after interviewing 29 participants, including 20 patients who had recovered from depression and nine caregivers; data saturation was achieved. Data analysis was conducted with open, axial, and selective coding and used NVivo Version 11 to aid the process of coding. RESULTS: A substantive theory was developed and the core category was \"Patients' fortitude through the healing and recovering process of depression.\" Other main categories interrelated in this core category were reframing negative thinking and cultivating positive thinking, rebuilding a positive self-worth by embracing self-compassion, and learning to cope with everyday stress. CONCLUSION: This theory could help health care professionals to work therapeutically with patients and commend their fortitude while experiencing depression and engaging them with the care they planned together; and find some joy in life. Educators and researchers could use this theory to advance nursing care.","41":"The American Indian\/Alaskan Native (AI\/AN) mortality rate from illicit drug use was 22.7%, double that of the general population between 2007 and 2009.

The purpose was to explore the factors that influence substance use among AI\/AN youth. We performed a systematic review using a results-based convergent synthesis design. Eight electronic databases were searched for articles published between 2014 and 2019 using the search terms \"Native American youth,\" \"Native American adolescent,\" \"Native Youth,\" \"substance use,\" \"substance misuse,\" and \"substance abuse.\" The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to appraise the studies. Forty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria (44 quantitative, one qualitative, and two mixed-methods studies). The results were organized using the ecological systems model and included evaluation of both protective and risk factors related to AI\/AN youth substance use. Three system levels were found to influence substance use: individual, micro- and macrosystems. The individual systems-level coping mechanisms played a key role in whether AI\/AN youth initiated substance use. Family, school, and peer factors influence the microsystem level. At the macrosystem level, community environmental factors were influential. The major factor linking all the systems was the influence of a connected relationship with a prosocial adult who instilled future aspirations and a positive cultural identity. Findings of this systematic mixed studies review will assist in intervention development for AI\/AN youth to prevent substance misuse. ","42":"","43":"The number of patients admitted with infective endocarditis (IE) from intravenous drug use (IVDU) in Appalachia is increasing, a direct downstream effect of the opioid crisis. Extant literature highlights the pejorative attitudes health care workers have toward patients with substance use disorder, with nurses among the most punitive. Rather than describe attitudes, the purpose of this study was to describe the lived experiences of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with IE from IVDU in Appalachia. To describe an unexplored phenomenon in Appalachia to inform nursing practice, nursing education, and health policy. Qualitative phenomenological study using the University of Tennessee method based on the tenets of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Nine nurses (ages 29-53 years) recruited using purposive and snowball sampling participated in unstructured phenomenological interviews. The essential meaning or central theme of the nurse experience working with these patients was a sense of hopelessness\/hope, with four interrelated themes derived from the central theme: (1) guarding\/escaping, (2) responsibility and revulsion, (3) apathy\/empathy, and (4) grief and sorrow\/cold and unemotional. Universally, nurses perceived caring for this population as futile, feeling a sense of powerlessness to change the outcome. These care experiences frustrated nurses, who described being physically and emotionally drained. To improve care delivery and improve patient outcomes, emphasis must be placed on nurse addiction education and standardizing nurse to patient with substance use disorder ratios to decrease work-related stress on nurses. ","44":"Screening for harmful alcohol use (HAU) is standard in clinical settings; however, self-reports of the quantity\/frequency of use are often inconsistent with population survey data and objective assessment. Inaccuracies of self-reported alcohol use prompt exploration of patients' reluctance to share this information with their health care providers. The purpose of this article is to identify the assumptions and biases that affect screening and brief interventions for HAU. A total of 22 research articles were selected for a systematic review of the literature. The studies included prospective and retrospective studies, randomized controlled trials, case studies, and quantitative and qualitative research from 2015 to 2021. This systematic review identified alcohol health literacy, the inherent bias of surveys and screening tools, stigma, avoidance bias, and the normalization\/villainization of alcohol use as contributors to the assumptions and biases that affect screening and brief interventions for HAU. Exploring these assumptions and biases presents opportunities to develop strategies that promote positive change. ","45":"To raise awareness and understanding about the role of trauma in the development of substance use and to define and clarify the need for trauma-informed care within the treatment of patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). This article reviews the up-to-date literature on how and why traumatic life experiences promote a neurobiological vulnerability to development of SUDs and combines this with a discussion of the principles of trauma-informed care for SUDs, as well as a review of the role of stigma and structural violence as foundational concepts in the implementation of trauma-informed care for people with SUDs. Shifting to a trauma-informed care paradigm in treating SUDs more effectively serves patients by improving patient experiences and accounting for a chronic disease model, wherein multiple episodes of SUD care are often necessary. This article reviews the ways in which nurses and other service providers can increase SUD patient retention and decrease recurrence by understanding the role of trauma in the development of SUDs, exploring the role of stigma, and identifying and interrupting structural violence as it relates to SUDs. This article also offers actionable steps that all nurses can take now as well as areas for further inquiry into trauma-informed care substance use services.

There is a need to provide advocacy, education, programming, and resources in the areas of positive coping and self-care to reduce burnout symptoms and promote well-being. RISE is an 8-week psychoeducational group intervention for nurses with four themes: resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of RISE on mental well-being. The sample included 75 registered nurses who work in a hospital-based setting. Outcomes included resilience, insight, self-compassion, empowerment, stress mind-set, perceived stress, and burnout. Independent-samples t tests were conducted to compare outcomes between intervention and wait-list control groups at baseline and 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Supplemental analyses included paired-samples t tests and linear mixed models to compare the outcomes of the intervention group participants at baseline to 1-month follow-up, as well as at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. Participants in the intervention group showed improved levels of insight (i.e., engagement in self-reflection), perceived stress, and burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion) when compared with the control group and improved levels of resilience, self-compassion, stress mind-set, and perceived stress when compared with their baseline. This study informs how RISE affects nurse well-being and may be an effective intervention for reducing burnout and stress. This type of whole-person intervention can support nurses to improve their well-being and ability to cope amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels. ","48":"For psychiatric patients, the issue of falling is complex. The objective of this study was to compare the risk factors for falling in psychiatric inpatients and general ward inpatients who had fallen. The researchers first derived official fall records for 122 psychiatric inpatients and then selected 122 psychiatric inpatients who had not fallen as well as 122 general ward patients who had fallen, matched for gender, age, and length of hospital stay at the time of the fall incident. After controlling other variables, multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that psychiatric inpatients who had fallen and had dizziness (odds ratio [OR] = 7.11, p &lt; .001), had an unsteady gait (OR = 1.97, p = .030), or were not using aids (OR = 0.42, p = .042) were at greater risk of falling than those who had not fallen. The researchers also found that general ward inpatients who had fallen and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (OR = 1.77, p &lt; .001), were clear-headed (OR = 27.15, p = .001), had dizziness (OR = 11.55, p &lt; .001), were unable to walk (OR = 64.28, p &lt; .001), or were using aids (OR = 3.86, p = .001) were at greater risk of falling than those who had not fallen before. The causes of falling among psychiatric inpatients and general ward inpatients are different. Medical personnel should understand the medications and attributes of patients for an accurate assessment of their risk factors for falling and thus implement fall prevention measures and health education to reduce falls. ","49":"Depression resistant to standard treatment is devastating to an individual's quality of life. Ketamine offers a safe and effective alternative to standard depression treatment, but many patients and providers are often unaware of this option. The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists and the American Psychiatric Nurses Association partnered in developing a collaborative approach to providing ketamine infusion therapy for psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this project was to disseminate information through an educational video about the safety and efficacy of outpatient low-dose ketamine infusions as an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant depression. A thorough literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar for articles describing the safety and efficacy of ketamine use in treatment-resistant depression. Based on the current research, an educational video reporting the benefits and safety of ketamine was developed and launched on two social media platforms-YouTube and Facebook-for individuals to view. The effectiveness of the video was evaluated through the number of views, likes, shares, and comments recorded. At 9 months, 156 views, 60 likes, 8 shares, and 4 comments were recorded in both platforms. Comments indicated that viewers found the video informative and encouraging. A short evidence-based educational video provides individuals with information regarding the safety and efficacy of low-dose ketamine infusions as an option for depression treatment. Ketamine outpatient clinics support and treat depressed patients who do not benefit from conventional pharmacologic medications. ","50":"While dysfunction of serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters has been studied in depth, in regard to the etiology of mental illness, the neurotransmitter glutamate and its dysfunction is now being explored as contributing to neurodegenerative psychiatric diseases, schizophrenia, autism, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. This article explains its synthesis, neurotransmission, and metabolism within the brain and subsequent dysfunction that is responsible for neurocognitive loss associated with several psychiatric disorders. The case study will report on the screening for pseudobulbar affective (PBA) disorder in a 29-year-old male with bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual developmental disability who was experiencing extreme, uncontrolled emotional outbursts requiring continuous family isolation (pre-COVID-19) for safety. With the positive screen for PBA, the patient was subsequently treated with a glutamatergic drug, dextromethorphan\/quinidine. The patient's unexpected response to this treatment including the acquisition of language, increased cognition, and improved executive functioning is presented. At 2 years post the initiation of treatment, his PBA screening score is reduced, uncontrolled outbursts and aggression have subsided, and the family can spend time outside of their home. Neurodegeneration and its impact is being researched and treated with medications affecting glutamate. The addition of a glutamatergic medication to this young man's medication regimen has improved both his and his family's quality of life. The psychiatric diagnoses, medications, and treatments associated with glutamate are explained in depth. The importance of nurses' understanding of glutamate, its synthesis, transmission, and dysfunction causing excitotoxicity and brain cell death and its impact on patients' behavior and safety is explained. ","51":"In nursing education and practice, we prepare nurses on topics such as patient care, pathophysiology, pharmacology, nursing leadership, and nursing competencies. Unfortunately, we may be missing the mark when it comes to integrating these topics and applying them to situations that arise in health care such as medication misuse. Nurses work intimately with patients and can recognize potential medication misuse by reviewing medication regimens and assessing necessity of PRN patient requests. In cases where nurses suspect misuse, they may or may not feel comfortable addressing these concerns with other members of the health care team. Study aims were to assess the baseline of whether nurses are comfortable with their level of skill to recognize potential patient medication misuse and to assess nurses' comfortability with communicating these concerns with other nurses, providers, and patients. This survey study was designed to obtain practical information about nurses understanding of misused and diverted prescription medications and level of comfort with expressing concerns about the use of central nervous system depressants to inform education, practice, and research. Three-hundred and fifty nurses at one hospital were invited to participate in an anonymous REDCap survey. Thirty-five percent of the surveyed nurses returned the survey. Responding nurses were more comfortable sharing their own knowledge and the need for more education on the topic than they were discussing interdisciplinary communication. Empowering nurses to communicate this knowledge with others on the health care team has major public health implications to reduce the negative outcomes of misused medications. ","52":"Restraint and seclusion continue to be used with patients demonstrating aggressive and violent behaviors while in the emergency department and as inpatients in behavioral health (BH) units. The use of sensory interventions such as the weighted blanket (WB) is garnering interest as alternatives to aid in managing anxiety, anger, and aggressive behaviors. Reports of the effectiveness of the WB have primarily been anecdotal, and results of research with children have been mixed. Only one study has been conducted with the WB with adults on an inpatient psychiatric unit. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness of the WB by determining whether it decreases anxiety and\/or anger in adult emergency department patients with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses. The study used a quasi-experimental, nonequivalent control group design with pre- and posttests for anxiety and anger. The intervention was a 15-pound WB. Participants (N = 15) were in one of three groups, which included no weighted blanket (NWB), WB for 15 minutes, or WB for 30 minutes. All three groups showed a decrease in anxiety and anger scores. However, participants in the WB groups had a greater decrease in anxiety and anger posttest scores. The small sample size in this study did not allow for the determination of any differences between groups on anxiety or anger scores that could be viewed as a significant finding. ","53":"Nursing is a demanding profession with constant stressors, which makes nurses vulnerable to the detrimental effects of high stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue. There is a need for a multidimensional group intervention facilitated by a licensed mental health professional to improve mental health and well-being in nurses. An intervention called RISE, which is an acronym for resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment, was developed to promote self-care, protect against burnout, and improve indicators of well-being among nurses. We explain the rationale, theoretical framework, and development of RISE. RISE is based on an integrative theoretical framework of mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. It consists of eight psychoeducational group sessions with topics related to the four RISE themes of resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment. RISE is a contribution to the literature on well-being interventions for nurses. It will further the understanding of effective interventions to mediate the detrimental effects of stress and burnout in nursing and to improve the mental health and well-being of nurses amid the complex interplay of factors at the individual, unit, and organizational levels. As an approach that combines education with therapeutic process and support to improve coping and well-being inside and outside of the workplace, RISE addresses the underlying causes and effects of high stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue.

Civilian providers may be unprepared to address issues that are unique to this population. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to develop and implement a survey-based knowledge assessment, in order to assess civilian psychiatric advanced practice nurse's (APN) perceptions, knowledge, and practice of treating ADSMs. The investigator developed and validated a survey that was posted on the American Psychiatric Nurses Association All-Purpose Discussion Forum, and the snowball technique was utilized to enhance psychiatric APN colleague recruitment. Seventy-eight participants scored extremely low with average score of 40.4%; however, the psychiatric APNs who received formal training from the Department of Defense on unique mental health issues of ADSMs scored significantly higher (49.6%) than participants without the formal training (38.2%; p = .03). Understanding the knowledge gap of psychiatric APNs as it relates to the care of ADSMs will allow educators to recommend available trainings or develop trainings that are tailored to meet their needs. ","56":"Recovery in mental health remains inconclusive where the two most prevailing definitions \"clinical\" and \"personal\" remain. In nursing schools, students are predominantly taught straightforward concepts of clinical recovery, which result in only a perfunctory and rudimentary understanding of recovery among the undergraduates. To explore the perceptions of nursing undergraduates on recovery for people experiencing mental health conditions. A descriptive qualitative study was conducted on 14 nursing undergraduates from Years 1 to 4 of the study. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling, and the required sample size was determined by data saturation. Semistructured questions were used during the individual face-to-face interviews from October and December 2019. Recordings were transcribed verbatim; the transcripts were then subjected to thematic analysis. Three themes were identified to support the research questions: (1) semantics of major terms used in mental health care-where participants provided the description of terminologies used; (2) the meaning of recovery-where participants explained their views on \"recovery\"; and (3) sources of conceptualization-where participants explained their conceptual understanding on mental health conditions and recovery. The findings suggest that the need for a more holistic approach encompassing personal recovery should be included in the nursing curriculum. This is necessary to promote enabling support in the recovery of people experiencing mental health conditions beyond medical interventions. ","57":"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health threat in the United States, affecting millions of individuals and families. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing recommends that nursing programs, both baccalaureate and graduate, provide students didactic training and clinical experience in the assessment and management of IPV. Our goal was to expose Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) students and Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) students to a simulated IPV scenario so they are prepared to respond appropriately to a survivor's disclosure of IPV when they begin clinical practice. We integrated a patient simulation scenario into our PMHNP and FNP curriculum. A combined group of PMHNP and FNP students participated in a simulation in which the standardized patient provided an unlikely explanation for her injuries. If students inquired about abuse, the patient revealed that she had experienced IPV. A pre- and posttest survey was used to evaluate student knowledge gain before and after the participating in the scenario. A Related Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to evaluate the results. Compared with pretest scores, students demonstrated improved confidence in screening for IPV as well as responding to a disclosure of IPV. Simulation provides a method to enhance student knowledge of incidence, risk, and best practices in relation to the screening, assessment and management of IPV.

Despite the popular use of PRN medications in mental health units, primary literature supporting efficacy and safety is poor, and there is no single universally accepted practice guideline. PRN psychotropic medications have the potential to cause adverse effects when used inappropriately. Our objective was to characterize the prescribing, administration, and documentation practices of PRN psychotropic medications in a psychiatric intensive care unit. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a 12-bed psychiatric intensive care unit between June and September 2018. All PRN antipsychotic and benzodiazepine orders, administrations, documentation practices, and attempted nonpharmacological strategies were assessed for each order and patient. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. Thirty-two patients with a total of 123 physicians' orders and 1,179 PRN administrations of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were reviewed. Of the total administrations, 720 (61%) were combinations with at least two psychotropic agents. Forty-one (33%) physicians' orders had a prescribed indication, and 559 (47%) administrations had an attempted nonpharmacological method prior to PRN administration. Eight patients (25%) had antipsychotic PRN orders, which exceeded the total daily maximum dose. Three adverse drug effects were attributed to PRN administration. Areas of improvement that we identified included documentation practices of effectiveness of administered PRNs, prescriptions to include clear indications and dosage within the 24-hour maximum limits, and documentation of nonpharmacological methods utilized. ","61":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with severe mental illnesses experience high rates of chronic health conditions; however, the extent to which risk of chronic physical health problems varies by race and gender among these individuals is understudied. AIMS: This study examines variations in health problems by race and gender among individuals with severe mental illnesses. METHOD: Administrative data, which included blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values, were obtained from 603 individuals with serious mental illnesses who received integrated health and behavioral health services from a large mental health agency in the Midwest. Bivariate and multivariate statistical models were used to examine variation in physical health problems by race and gender. RESULTS: Compared with men, women with severe mental illnesses were more likely to have BMI levels indicating obesity or morbid obesity (p &lt; .001). Compared with White participants, Black participants were less likely to have high HbA1c levels (p &lt; .001) but were more likely to have high blood pressure (p &lt; .001). Among race and gender groups, Black women were more likely to have high BMI (p &lt; .05), Black men were more likely to have high blood pressure (p &lt; .001), and White men were more likely to have high HbA1c levels (p &lt; .01) when holding constant all other variables. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that types and severity of physical health problems among individuals with severe mental illnesses varies by race and gender. Replication of these results and more research is needed to ensure that health-related education and integrated health and behavioral health interventions meet the needs of individuals with serious mental illnesses.","62":"Given the restrictions associated with COVID-19, feelings of loneliness among youth may increase. The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (F = 44.95, p &lt; .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores. We found that the high prevalence rate of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with depression and impaired life satisfaction among Middle Eastern youth. Thus, special attention and interventional action plans need to be developed taking into consideration the youths' special situation during COVID-19.

It is highly important to identify\/define barriers to cooperation between families and health professionals from a cultural perspective. The present study was aimed at identifying barriers to cooperation between mental health professionals and families from the perspectives of mental health professionals and family caregivers in Turkey. In the sample of this descriptive qualitative study, 12 family caregivers and 11 health professionals were included. The results of the study indicated seven themes regarding the perceptions of family caregivers and mental health professionals. The themes related to perceptions of family caregivers about barriers are as follows: \"learning the process by living,\" the perception of \"my patient comes first,\" and the perception of \"being neglected.\" The themes related to perceptions of mental health professionals about barriers are as follows: \"lack of collaboration within the team,\" \"family itself as a barrier,\" and \"lack of education about working with families.\" The common theme mentioned by both groups included the \"patient-oriented service understanding.\" The results obtained from this study are believed to be a guide for planning and implementing interventions to eliminate the barriers defined from the perspectives of both mental health professionals and family caregivers. Both mental health professionals and family caregivers need psychosocial interventions for strengthening \"family cooperation.\" ","64":"","65":"BACKGROUND: When compared with all other health care professions, the psychiatric nursing profession has the highest prevalence of workplace violence. The effects of workplace violence can be psychologically and physically devastating. Supportive resources are not always available or fully utilized when available. Aims: The purpose of this study is to explore the true impact of workplace violence toward psychiatric mental health nurses, as well as their personal perspectives on the types of supportive resources necessary for future implementation. Additionally, this study strives to identify the facilitators and barriers to acquiring supportive resources. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study design was utilized. The theory of cognitive adaptation provided an underlying conceptual framework. Data were collected using REDCap software to identify the nature and extent of workplace violence in the study setting (Survey 1) and solicit detailed responses to focus group questions designed to address the study aims (Survey 2). RESULTS: Six pertinent themes were discovered: frequent exposure to workplace violence, attempt to understand workplace violence, the need for supportive means, barriers to accessing supportive means, increase administrative support, and workplace violence has a detrimental impact on various aspects of life. CONCLUSIONS: Although psychiatric mental health nurses express a desire for more psychological support postassault, the underlying meaning and cognitive adaptation following the workplace violence experience is not well understood, and there are barriers to the acquisition of services. The findings from this study are being used to inform a multifaceted program to effectively support psychiatric mental health nurses experiencing workplace violence.","66":"One of the most important aspects of receiving medical care is access to that care. For people with mental illness who have greater healthcare needs and are at risk for poor health outcomes, reduced access to care constitutes a crisis. While the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic continues to affect the United States, specifying what it means to have access to mental healthcare is more critical than ever. The aim of this concept analysis is to review definitions and descriptions of access to mental healthcare in the literature and to synthesize the relevance of these findings to inform future research, theory development, policy, and practice. The concept of access to mental healthcare was analyzed using Rodgers's evolutionary concept analysis method. CINAHL, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were queried for peer-reviewed articles about access to mental healthcare published from January 2010 to April 2020 (n = 72). Data were reviewed for concept antecedents, attributes, consequences, surrogate, and related terms. Five models of access to mental healthcare were identified, with several antecedents and consequences: utilization, economic loss\/gain, incarceration, and patient\/provider satisfaction. Cross-sectional and predictive studies highlighted three interrelated attributes: clinical management, healthcare delivery, and connectedness. The concept of access to mental healthcare is often used stagnantly across disciplines to create health policies, yet the concept is transformative. Future research requires up-to-date operational definitions of access to mental healthcare to target interdisciplinary approaches.

Nurses caring for this vulnerable population may have negative attitudes, which can be mitigated by education and improved for the benefit of patients. This study aimed to assess the impact of an educational intervention on the attitudes of nursing staff toward individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Using a pre-post design, a revised version of the Health Professionals' Attitudes Toward the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) assessed 23 nursing staff working on inpatient medicine units surrounding a brief educational session about persons experiencing homelessness and mental illness. Data were also collected from open-ended questions. There was a small positive increase in mean HPATHI scores postintervention (74.783 [SD = 5.485] to 77.13 [SD = 6.312]) indicating more positive participant attitudes toward homeless individuals. The HPATHI also revealed a 6% increase in score for participant comfortability providing care for homeless persons with major mental illness postintervention. Some participants likely interpreted their answers as displaying more positive and less cynical attitudes based on their comments, while the HPATHI scored them as more negative. Qualitative feedback revealed both positive and negative attitudes toward this patient population, and various associated barriers to care. Nursing staff will likely provide care for patients who experience homelessness with concomitant mental illness. Educating nurses about the needs of this population is feasible and could be beneficial for patient care. ","68":"Implementation of programs that increase both psychiatric patient education and their involvement in treatment programming can lead to positive outcomes postdischarge. Patients involved in programs focusing on skills, recovery, and that are individualized show a reduction in symptoms as well as an increase in engagement, treatment, and recovery posthospitalization. This quality improvement project examines (1) the effectiveness of a safety planning group on an inpatient psychiatric unit for developing individualized safety plans, (2) the usefulness of the safety plans upon discharge, and (3) how helpful the patient found them. A standardized safety plan was presented during 1-hour groups on an adult inpatient unit. Completed safety plans scored using a rubric to determine how patients individualized the content. One week postdischarge, patients were contacted to determine location and use of the safety plan since discharge. Patient's (n = 124) safety plans were relatively individualized when compared to the standardized safety plan (mean [SD] = 32.85 [8.27] on a 44-point rating). Of those patients who were contacted postdischarge (n = 76), 73 (96.1%) had a copy of their safety plan 1-week postdischarge while 28 (36.8%) reported using their safety plan since discharge. Many of the patients who used their safety plan reported that it was helpful (n = 19; 67.9%). Developing a safety plan can be a helpful tool for individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit.

To examine the association between social support and smoking cessation as mediated by SLEs in people with SMI and to examine whether the interrelations among social support, SLEs, and smoking cessation differ by gender. A population sample of 4,610 American lifetime adult smokers with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder were identified in a limited public use data set of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Four mediation and moderated mediation models were used to examine gender differences in the interrelations among social support (total and three subscales of the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12), SLEs (summative score of positive responses to 16 types experienced in past year and related to health, job, death, or legal situations), and smoking status in prior year. Total, appraisal, and tangible support among females exerted indirect effects on smoking cessation via decreasing SLE scores. Among males, only belonging support exerted an indirect effect on smoking cessation via an increased SLE score. Findings suggest that interventions focusing on improving social support should be a priority for those working with smokers with SMI.

Electronic medical record data on adult patients of five medical units admitted with a psychiatric condition between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, were used. Psychiatric ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) codes and diagnosis names extracted were categorized into seven major diagnostic groups. A total of 687 adult patients with 82 psychiatric ICD-10 codes were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Substance-related and addictive disorders were the most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses. Ninety-six percent (n = 658) of patients residing on medical floors with psychiatric disorders were hospitalized for a principal medical problem. Seventy-three cases received psychiatric consultations during their stay. Sixty percent (n = 44) of those cases had psychiatric disorders from two or more diagnostic categories. Multidisciplinary, team-based health care delivery models that include a psychiatric nurse can provide an effective approach to treat patients in community hospitals with multiple psychiatric and medical comorbidities. Hospitals could take a significant role in providing substance use disorder treatment and equipping medical nurses with training to competently care for patients with psychiatric disorders on medical units. Further research into the prevalence and impact of patients with co-occurring and multiple psychiatric diagnoses in community hospitals is needed to implement effective health care delivery models and provide appropriate treatment options in the community.

EDs have high rates of medical and psychiatric morbidity, and a 6% mortality rate, the highest of any mental illness. Early detection of EDs offers the best opportunity for recovery; yet, estimates are that as few as one in 10 individuals with an ED receive treatment. The purpose of this article is to provide an ED identification and management overview for inpatient nurse clinicians in general psychiatric and medical settings, helping to facilitate timely recognition and care. An overview of ED diagnostic criteria and two evidence-based ED tools are introduced for consideration. Opportunities to identify and help manage an ED are numerous. Most individuals with an ED make several health care visits in either medical or psychiatric settings without ever being screened for an ED. General ED screening and assessment tool familiarization can facilitate a treatment trajectory for these patients, improve overall quality of life, and may potentially result in a life-saving intervention for this often-deadly cluster of medical and psychiatric disorders. Screening and assessment in general clinical settings, identifying patients with undiagnosed EDs, beginning basic treatment plans, and referrals for appropriate follow-up care, have the potential to reduce ED recidivism and related health care costs.

Negative feelings toward pursuing a career in mental health nursing may be modified by well-structured practicums. To explore nursing student perspectives of clinical practicums in mental health in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of enhancement of nurse education in mental health care. This qualitative study used thematic analysis from semistructured focus group interviews of 20 female undergraduate nursing students. Inductive outcomes and emergent conceptual data were reviewed by investigators, doctoral prepared faculty peers, and members of the sample. NVivo 10.1 software was used to suggest conceptual groupings into themes based on inductive codes. The core theme-enhancement of mental health care skills-comprised four emerging subthemes, including the application of theory for clinical improvement, positive feelings, and motivation toward removal of discrimination and stigmatization, experience with apprehension, anxiety, fear, and stress, and therapeutic communication skills. Clinical placement in mental health-related practice may assist undergraduate nursing students in addressing anxiety and stress related to contacting patients, confronting stigmatizing and negative emotions, applying theoretical knowledge to clinical practice, having therapeutic communication skills, and enhancing overall professional experiences of nursing students. It is hoped that undergraduate clinical mental health placement will contribute valuable skills and viewpoints to nursing students who aim to enter professional practice in all areas and especially mental health. ","79":"Workplace violence (WPV) is a serious phenomenon affecting nurses in clinical settings around the globe. Like nurses, nursing students are at risk of encountering incidents of WPV, which may lead to negative consequences. WPV training programs are useful in helping nurses and nursing students prevent and manage incidents of WPV. Despite this evidence, the development and implementation of WPV training programs for nursing students pursuing their nursing training in university settings are scarce. The purpose of this literature review was to identify and synthesize the evidence about new training programs on prevention and management of WPV implemented exclusively for undergraduate and graduate nursing students published during the years 2012 to 2018. The literature review utilized five major databases to identify relevant articles containing WPV training programs implemented in university settings to train undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Appraisal of the evidence was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Nine articles included WPV training programs imparted to nursing students in university settings. Overall, nursing students increased their knowledge about WPV and learned practical skills that could be helpful in preventing and managing WPV incidents. WPV training programs were positively accepted by nursing students. WPV training programs for nursing students should be mandated in all nursing schools. These trainings are vital in equipping them with proper knowledge and practical skills that could be used to prevent and manage incidents of WPV. ","80":"The specific aims of this project were to create a fully integrated, nurse-led model of a psychiatric nurse practitioner and behavioral health care team within primary care to facilitate (1) patients receiving an appropriate level of care and (2) care team members performing at the top of their scope of practice. The guiding model for process implementation was Rapid Cycle Quality Improvement. Three task forces were established to develop interventions in the areas of Roles and Responsibilities, Training and Implementation, and the electronic health record. The four interventions that emerged from these task forces were (1) the establishment of patient tiers based on diagnosis, medications, and risk assessment; (2) the creation of process maps to engage care team members; (3) just-in-time education regarding psychiatric medication management for primary care providers; and (4) use of a registry to track patients. The process measures of referrals to the psychiatric care team and psychiatric assessment intakes performed as expected. Both measures were higher at the onset of the project and lower 1 year later. The outcome indicator, number of case reviews, increased dramatically over time. For psychiatric nurse practitioners, this quality improvement effort provides evidence that a consultative role can be effective in supporting primary care providers. Through providing education, establishing patient tiers, and establishing an effective workflow, more patients may have access to psychiatric services. ","81":"A number of variables have been shown to influence whether an individual who experiences an emergency psychiatric assessment is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. This study focused on the theoretical orientation of the assessing clinician as a possibly influential variable. The theoretical orientation being studied was Bowen family systems theory or Bowen theory (Bt). Overall the Bt perspective looks at the family as the primary crucible that generates symptoms but at the same time as the natural unit and the best built-in resource to deal with those symptoms. This study examined whether the theoretical orientation of the nurse psychiatric assessor would affect her inpatient admission rate of patients seen for psychiatric evaluation in an emergency department (ED). A clinician\/researcher with extensive experience applying Bt in clinical practice worked in a Crisis Management Service providing psychiatric evaluation and disposition in a busy community hospital ED. Given Bt's emphasis on the system rather than individual pathology, the clinician researcher hypothesized that her psychiatric hospitalization rate would be lower than the other clinical nurse specialists. A retrospective chart review analyzed 1 year of cases from all referrals that might have resulted in psychiatric hospitalizations (n = 1,801). The clinician\/researcher's psychiatric hospitalization rate was significantly lower (p = .004) than the other clinicians. An approach to psychiatric assessment in the ED applied a Bt perspective in a way that significantly reduced psychiatric hospitalizations. ","82":"Measuring patient experience is an essential challenge in the inpatient behavioral health population. This initiative analyzed the psychometric properties of a revised version of the patient Combined Assessment of Psychiatric Environments (p-CAPE-R) survey. The p-CAPE was revised to encompass the interdisciplinary treatment team and implemented on five inpatient psychiatric units at an academic medical center. A psychometric analysis was performed on the p-CAPE-R. Analysis of factor loadings with a large sample (n = 786) revealed a more coherent item structure under the \"staff competency and engagement\" and \"treatment effectiveness\" domains than presented in the original instrument development research. Although the p-CAPE-R reflects a more useful and psychometrically sound instrument than the original p-CAPE, further analysis and revision to reflect the entire interdisciplinary team is warranted. ","83":"An emerging category of morbidity in research among people experiencing homelessness (PEH) is quality of life (QoL). The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) framework was used to explain the relationship between the resulting factors and their impact on QoL among PEH. The purpose of this systematic mixed studies review was to explore the factors that are associated with QoL among homeless individuals. A systematic mixed studies review was conducted using CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, and SocIndex databases. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies were included and synthesized employing results-based convergent synthesis design. The initial search resulted in 757 studies with 55 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis revealed themes influencing QoL among PEH categorized by the CSDH determinants of structural, social cohesion and social capital, and intermediary determinants. Among these themes, higher social status, strong relationships, better reported physical and mental health, and a positive life outlook were associated with increased QoL. Social isolation, substance use, poorer life outlook, increased years spent homeless, and perceived quality of housing were associated with decreased QoL. Age, sex, and housing programs revealed inconsistent results on QoL. While the factors presented in this review indicate some consistent relationships with QoL in PEH, this review has shown QoL among this population is complex and multifactorial. Future research should focus on relationships between the CSDH determinants, particularly the psychosocial factors and the QoL priorities defined by PEH, and how they may influence QoL among PEH. ","84":null,"85":"The most crucial discussion in psychiatric hospitals is the safety of patients, especially during incidents that have the potential to cause physical harm such as those where mechanical restraints are used. The goal of the project was to reduce the use of mechanical restraints by 25% within 10 weeks in two piloted medical-surgical units. A total of 60 articles were examined for relevance; out of these, the author used 30 studies that were based on observational, literature review, quantitative analysis, or clinical trial methodologies to conduct a comprehensive literature review. The author used a retrospective and descriptive design of chart review data collection to implement the project. The six core strategies framework, coupled with the creation of mental health championship role, was implemented to mitigate the problem. This study shows that the implementation of the six core strategies and the role of a mental health champion helped reduce the use of mechanical restraints by 100%. A total of 3,072 patients' charts were reviewed in which there were three PERT (Psychiatric Emergency Response Team) activation and no mechanical restraint events, which showed a considerable quality improvement compared to the pre-implementation data collection of 37 PERT and 14 mechanical restraint events. The implications for practice and further study in the field are the involvement of more authors with similar expertise, the use of a control group for comparison, and a longer length of study duration. ","86":"Food insecurity affects 15 million households in the United States and is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes including Major Depressive Disorder. Governmental public assistance or food benefit programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) are social intervention services that attempt to minimize food insecurity for low-income households. There is little consensus regarding the effects of food benefit participation on reducing risk of depressive symptoms. This study aims to explore the association between household food insecurity and food benefit participation (SNAP or WIC) on risk for depressive symptoms using nationally representative samples from the Center for Disease and Control and Prevention Nutritional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 cohorts. We hypothesize that food insecurity is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms and food benefit participation with reduced risk. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using survey-weighted logistic regression to explore the relationship between food insecurity, food benefit participation, and the risk of depressive symptoms controlling for relevant income and sociodemographic variables. When controlling for sociodemographic variables, food benefit participation did not reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, while high levels of food insecurity were associated with elevated risk. High levels of food insecurity are associated with elevated risk of depressive symptoms. Nurses and public health professionals can address food security needs through increased knowledge of referral and eligibility requirements. Implications on clinical practice, policy, and future directions for research are discussed. ","87":"Health care settings are a primary location for workplace violence that involves clients, but risk factors for behavioral emergencies in medical settings are largely unknown. This study proposed to identify risk factors for assault and physical aggression among medically hospitalized patients who needed a behavior emergency response team. This descriptive study, conducted at a large Midwestern academic medical center, used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to assess relationships between demographic, medical, mental health, and contextual variables with assault and physical aggression. Predictive ability was summarized using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Among patients who received a behavior emergency response (N = 820), 86 (10%) were assaultive. Physical aggression was the most significant predictor of assault. Physical aggression was predicted by older age, male gender, and verbal threats to others. Conversely, internalizing mental health conditions of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were significant for decreased risk of assault and\/or physical aggression. Contextual factors, identified as wanting to smoke or leave the hospital, were significantly associated with decreased risk of both assault and physical aggression. Health care providers are encouraged to (1) consider the demonstration of physical aggression as a sign to urgently implement precautionary measures for safety, (2) avoid predicting violent situations based on particular medical or mental health conditions alone, and (3) understand that not all disruptive behavior leads to violent situations. ","88":"This discussion paper describes the intricacies of the strong Black woman (SBW) construct and how understanding this construct is significant and relevant within nursing. This article is a discussion piece that provides a succinct conceptual and historical overview of the SBW construct. It then describes the impacts of this construct before presenting implications as they relate to nursing practice, education, policy, and research. The SBW construct is exclusively and routinely applied to Black women. Typically, the SBW construct encompasses five components, which center on independence, caring, and strength. These five components include the obligation to (1) always maintain and present an image of strength, (2) suppress emotion, (3) be self-reliant, (4) succeed despite all odds, and (5) always place the needs [especially comfort] of others above those of oneself. Moreover, the SBW construct posits Black women as possessing superhuman capabilities. The nature of this construct is complex, with some Black women using it as a survival mechanism, and others finding empowerment through this image. Nevertheless, recent research has revealed the harms associated with this image including detriment to physical, mental, and spiritual well-being, with the implications extending to Black families and communities. Understanding this topic is essential in providing support to all Black women in health care and within the Black community-including patients, nurses, faculty, staff, and students. Recognizing the implications of the SBW construct is essential toward ensuring that our care, practices, and policies are not only supportive but also antiracist. ","89":"","90":"At our inpatient psychiatric hospital, which cares for children and adolescents, internal data of use of seclusions and holds as crisis interventions for immediate behavioral health issues demonstrated that we were using these too often. Benchmarking indicated that we were at the 75% in use of these measures, and it became an organizational goal to reduce the use of these strategies in order to reduce the risk of retraumatization to an already traumatized child. We used the Iowa Model for Evidence Based Practice-Revised to initiate an evidence-based practice project introducing and hardwiring Trauma Informed Care to the staff and institution. This involved implementing six core strategies specifically designed to reduce the use of crisis interventions. Data obtained at 6 months revealed a 40% reduction in the use of holds and seclusions, and at 12 months, this change was sustained and even improved, reducing the use of these approaches by another 9%. Furthermore, the culture in the institution was changed, and Trauma Informed Care became the norm. Evidence-based practice is a viable approach to change the culture and improve patient outcomes in inpatient psychiatric care of children and adolescents. Further investigation is warranted to determine the specific patient and staff experiences of being cared for, and caring within, the context of trauma-informed care.

Nurses' levels of satisfaction with their manager's leadership styles are critical to their remaining in the profession. To explore the relationship between the roles of nursing leadership and their influence on the millennial psychiatric nurse's level of job satisfaction and intent to leave. Eighty-three psychiatric registered nurses between the ages of 22 and 37 with 6 months or more experience completed a Managerial Skills and Job Satisfaction Survey questionnaire. The millennial psychiatric nurse who perceived their managers to display the roles in being a mentor (M = 24.95, SD = 2.81), director (M = 23.08, SD = 2.55), and monitor (M = 22.71, SD = 2.51) had higher job satisfaction and would be less likely to leave the specialty, current position, and organization. The study revealed that nursing leaders need to focus on strengthening the monitor and mentor roles and work on changing from having a coordinator role to the director role. ","93":"In 2018, nearly 20% of Americans aged 12 years and older reported using illicit substances, with higher rates in rural areas. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) provide health care to one in five rural Americans. However, estimates suggest that only 13.6% of patients in rural FQHCs receive substance use (SU) screening compared with 42.6% of patients in urban FQHCs. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to improve patient quality and safety and meet Health Resources and Services Administration reporting requirements. These aims were achieved through the design and implementation of a new SU screening protocol in four FQHCs in rural Indiana. Deming's plan-do-study-act model was used to implement QI interventions to increase SU screening rates. A new SU screening tool, the National Institute on Drug Abuse -Modified Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Testwas implemented, and staff were trained on its use. the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment model was used as a guiding framework. Outcome measures included a comparison of SU screening rates from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, as well a pretest-posttest designed to measure staff knowledge and attitudes regarding SU. Baseline SU screening rate in 2019 was 0.87%. This increased to 24.8% by March 2020. Additionally, posttest results demonstrated improvement from staff on all indices, and an approval rating of 77% of the new SU screening practices. This project demonstrated that a low-cost QI intervention can increase SU screening rates in rural FQHCs, as well as improve staff knowledge and attitudes regarding SU. ","94":"Restraint and seclusion in an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric population adversely affects the overall value and safety of care. Due to adverse events, negative outcomes, and associated costs, inpatient psychiatric hospitals must strive to reduce and ultimately eliminate restraint and seclusion with innovative, data-driven approaches. To identify patterns of client characteristics that are associated with restraint and seclusion in an inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric population. A machine learning application of fast-and-frugal tree modeling was used to analyze the sample. The need for restraint and seclusion were correctly predicted for 73% of clients at risk (sensitivity), and 76% of clients were correctly predicted as negative or low risk (specificity), for needing restraint and seclusion based on the following characteristics: having a disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and\/or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, being 12 years old or younger, and not having a depressive and\/or bipolar disorder diagnosis. The client characteristics identified in the predictive algorithm should be reviewed on admission to recognize clients at risk for restraint and seclusion. For those at risk, interventions should be developed into an individualized client treatment plan to facilitate a proactive approach in preventing behavioral emergencies requiring restraint and seclusion. ","95":"Problems that worry patients throughout hospitalization are complex and varied, but they fall within the scope of safe, effective, patient-centered care. To our knowledge, there is no evidence describing the problems that worry patients in inpatient psychiatric units. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to describe common themes of worry experienced by individuals in psychiatric inpatient units in order to improve patient experience. This project took place at an urban, safety net hospital at an academic medical center in the northeastern United States between March and December 2019. All patients across five inpatient psychiatric units were offered the Combined Assessment of Psychiatric Environments (CAPE) survey as they approached the end of their stay. A total of 1,800 patients took the survey. Of these patients, 36% (650\/1,800) patients responded never\/sometimes to \"During my hospitalization, I found solutions to problems that worried me,\" and 46% (297\/650) patients provided a response to the follow-up question \"What are the problems that worry you the most?\" Common themes of worry for inpatient behavioral health patients include (a) life in the hospital, (b) self, and (c) outside life. Each of these worry themes that emerged from this thematic analysis has implications for behavioral health staff who are preparing the psychiatric\/behavioral health inpatient for discharge. These themes can also be used to focus on a variety of quality improvement initiatives to improve the patients experience while in an inpatient psychiatric\/behavioral health unit. ","96":"Assuring quality care is critical to the well-being and recovery of individuals receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment, yet a comprehensive map of quality inpatient care does not exist. To isolate and describe quality elements of inpatient psychiatric treatment. A survey queried psychiatric inpatient nursing leaders on what they considered to be critical elements of quality. The survey was emailed to 40 American Psychiatric Nurses Association members, and 39 individuals responded. In the survey, participants were asked to comment on the importance of six dimensions of quality as well as quality indicators used on their units. Data from this survey indicate how thought leaders conceptualized quality of inpatient care. A unifying philosophy of care was endorsed as a quality element as was structure that affords staff available time on the unit-engaging with patients. While staffing levels were viewed as important, the respondents commented on the nuances between staffing and quality. Participants endorsed the importance of involving individuals in their treatment planning as well as tapping into patients' perspectives on the treatment experience. The participants' responses compliment the quality literature and reinforce the need to develop a comprehensive map of quality elements. These elements interact in complex way, for instance, staffing, engagement, and teamwork is tied to the organizational structure and philosophy of care, which in turn facilitates consumer involvement in care. Thus, gauging the impact of quality on outcomes will demand consideration of the interaction of factors not just the linear relationship of one element to an outcome. ","97":"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatric providers screen mothers for postpartum depression at the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-month well-child visits. However, compliance with this recommendation varies greatly and is far from 100%. This is significant, as perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) represent the most common complication of childbearing. This investigation was conducted to explore barriers to screening in the pediatric setting, reported advantages of screening, providers' knowledge of mental health supports in the community, and commonly observed (and explicitly stated) mental health issues in new mothers. All data collection took place in the state of Georgia, which has the worst rates of maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States. A convenience sample of five pediatric practices was selected through the Mercer University School of Medicine's community preceptor network. All clinical staff at each site participated in one of five focus groups for a total of 31 participants. The conversations were audio-taped, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Providers from two practices were formally screening for Postpartum Depression; they indicated that it added value to their practice. Those not screening cited several barriers including lack of time, training, and access to the mother's medical records. Several clinicians asserted that they were not trained to address mental health issues in their pediatric patients' mothers and that it was out of their realm of expertise. Provider compliance with the current AAP recommendations may increase with mandatory, specialized training in recognizing and treating PMADs. ","98":"Service delivery organizations are advancing the provision of trauma-informed care (TIC) for youth to improve outcomes. However, currently there are no validated, reliable evaluation measures to capture the voices of adolescent clients and how well they perceive TIC implementation. The purpose of this project was to create an evaluation measure with strong content validity for adolescent health and service users to give feedback to organizations about their implementation of TIC. This article outlines Step 1 of our instrument development, by discussing our process creating the measure and affirming content validity. Psychometric testing of this measure (Step 2) is described in a companion paper. We combined deductive theory substruction with an inductive participatory process to create, revise, and finalize the measure. The National Center for Trauma-Informed Care's framework of four practices and six principles was substructed into an 18-item draft measure. A four-member community youth advisory board (CYAB) then worked to inductively modify our draft to provide age-appropriate clarity and ensure a nontriggering respondent experience. Finally, the CYAB members conducted cognitive interviews with 10 other adolescents in local evening data collection events, refining the measure for future psychometric testing. The process resulted in a 20-item form based on CYAB feedback. Refinements included providing an accessible definition of trauma, asking questions about trauma history, and asking whether trauma affected the client's visit on the day of service use. The CYAB involvement enhanced content validity and ensured a trauma-informed instrument development approach.

The most common mental illnesses affecting older Americans include anxiety, cognitive, and mood disorders. These patients may exhibit behaviors indicating agitation or anxiety during necessary hospital stays that warrant de-escalation techniques and appropriate medications to help manage emergent symptoms. This quality improvement intervention was intended to demonstrate enhancement of the nursing assessment and reassessment of patients demonstrating symptoms of agitation and anxiety requiring intervention. Assessment of the established nursing practice demonstrated compromised patient safety and led to planning and implementation of a new practice standard that incorporated an evidence-based tool. Nurses utilized a protocol that employed the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale to augment documentation of the nursing assessment for patients exhibiting symptoms of marked anxiety and agitation. Following a 3-month trial, chart audits were completed to assess results of the protocol's implementation. Significant improvement was noted in the nursing assessment process as evidenced in required documentation of nursing assessment and reassessment including use of the protocol. Implementing standards to guide nursing care can support both patient safety and professional practice.

A search of current literature on the COVID-19 crisis, and topics relevant to the mental health components associated with the pandemic are reviewed. Telemental health (TMH) and PMHNP practice are discussed as they relate to the unfolding picture of the viral pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis is having far-reaching implications for mental health treatment and in particular for PMHNPs in practice settings. There have been widespread consequences of the containment measures used for the protection and mitigation of the disease. One such result has been the inability of patients to have face-to-face contact with their providers. The role of TMH has become increasingly important as an adaptation in professional practice. Technology has rapidly transformed traditional practice due to the COVID-19 crisis and there is strong evidence that it is well accepted by patients and providers. It is incumbent on PMHNPs to embrace TMH and become educated on best practices and TMH services. ","102":"The magnitude for potential burnout is enormous.

Reduce the potential for burnout among outpatient mental health clinicians and staff. Develop an agency wellness protocol utilizing evidence-based interventions to reduce the potential for clinician and staff burnout. Survey data indicated low to moderate levels of burnout and depersonalization. Staff and clinician recommendations provided during feedback sessions were incorporated with evidence-based interventions to establish a wellness protocol. Implementing evidence-based interventions in a wellness protocol may reduce the potential for clinician and staff burnout. ","103":"OBJECTIVES: The first known COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care facility in the United States was identified on February 28, 2020, in King County, Washington. That facility became the initial U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic when they discovered 129 cases associated with the outbreak (81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors) and 23 persons died. The vulnerability of the elderly population, shared living and social spaces, suboptimal infection control practices, and prolonged contact between residents were identified as contributing factors to the rapid spread of the disease. The first known case of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in a U.S. inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit was also in King County, Washington, and occurred soon afterward on March 11th, 2020. Between March 11 and March 18, nine inpatients and seven staff members were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. This article examines how the swift identification and isolation of confirmed patients, an enhanced infection prevention protocol, and engagement of frontline psychiatric care staff prevented a catastrophic outcome in a vulnerable population. METHODS: Here we describe infection control and nursing-led interventions that were quickly enacted in response to this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an inpatient geriatric psychiatry unit. RESULTS: The interventions effectively contained the outbreak, with no further patients and only one staff member testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 over the subsequent 2-month time period. CONCLUSIONS: We share our learnings and preventative infection control measures that can be adapted to a variety of settings to prevent or contain future outbreaks of COVID-19.","104":"People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for falls and fall-related injuries. Depressive disorders (DEP) are common in individuals with CKD and may increase the risk of falls and fall-related injuries. However, not much is known about the relationship between DEP and falls in people with CKD. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of DEP on the relationship between CKD, falls, and fall-related injuries. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we identified 16,574 adults with CKD. Patients with CKD were stratified by history of self-reported DEP (SRDEP), and multivariate logistic regression was conducted to determine the odds for falls and fall-related injuries among those with and without SRDEP. In unadjusted regression analysis, falls (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 2.08-2.76) and fall-related injuries (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.72-2.59) were higher in individuals with CKD and history of SRDEP compared to those with CKD and no history of SRDEP. Adjustment for confounders had little effect on the relationship between a history of SRDEP and either falls (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.60-2.19) or fall-related injuries (AOR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.26-1.97). People with CKD and DEP are at increased odds for falls and fall-related injuries even after adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. Prospective studies are warranted to further understand this relationship, but it may be prudent for clinicians, in particular nurses, to consider fall risk when treating DEP in patients with CKD. ","105":"Cognitive impairments-episodes of mania or psychosis, paranoia, and substance use-are common effects of serious mental illness, which can lead to stigmatization, social isolation, and a decrease in interaction with health care providers. These consequences can obstruct a person with serious mental illness ability to comprehend diagnosed mental disorders and to fully participate in treatment. Consistent with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Recovery Model for Disease Management, nurse practitioner residents in a mental health nurse practitioner residency program developed an interactive psychoeducation series to improve veteran health self-efficacy and self-management. The overall purpose of this sequential quality improvement initiative was to develop and deliver a psychoeducational series, which is both veteran centric and recovery oriented. Series I of the project produced psychoeducational sessions based on collaborative interactions among veterans and members of the treatment team, with a focus on neurobiology, pharmacology, and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Through an innovative and interactive framework, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were utilized to bring about foundational themes and inherent changes in the psychoeducation delivery. With veterans' feedback and collaboration, Series II of the project was developed within the continuous improvement evaluations from Series I. Treatment collaboration between veterans and providers was fostered as veterans experienced learning, symptom recognition, and empowerment. This project is unique in that it is the first known review of a quality improvement initiative to incorporate concurrent changes in psychoeducational session delivery, involving veterans and their providers to foster collaboration. ","106":"","107":"BACKGROUND: National standardized nursing exams serve as critical measures of student readiness for practice and carry significant consequences for students and academic institutions. Educational interventions that can enhance a student's performance increase the probability of academic success. Previous studies link hope to grade point average in college students and on standardized exam (SE) scores in nursing students, yet it is not clear if hope can be increased utilizing a one-time intervention in ways that produce lasting benefits for passing SEs. AIMS: Aim 1 tested the efficacy of a one-time hope intervention on increasing SE passing rates among BSN nursing students. Aim 2 examined the role of the interventions, selected state-mechanism variables, and trait characteristics in predicting SE passing. METHOD: This comparative-effectiveness trial utilized a randomized, controlled, multiple-cohort experimental design to compare a one-time 90-minute hope intervention to an attention-matched progressive muscle relaxation intervention on SE passing scores among BSN nursing students. RESULTS: Levels of hope briefly increased following the hope intervention. Both interventions demonstrated short-term improvement in state-level psychosocial indicators but did not affect SE scores. Among trait and mechanism factors, only academic self-efficacy was linked with passing SEs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a single-session hope intervention can increase short-term hope. In this sample of 292 BSN students, there was no statistically significant long-term effect on passing SEs; however, this study may lay the groundwork for future interventions investigating booster sessions, or how to modify the intervention for struggling students.","108":"When patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder are suffering from acute mania (involuntary), hospitalization is often necessary. Patients are often quite disruptive, which makes it difficult to regulate their behavior and manage them in their current condition. The nursing team must also ensure the safety of the other patients on the ward. Nursing practice in this domain appears to draw primarily on tradition and experience. To achieve consensus on a standard for nursing practice for patients suffering from mania who are admitted to a closed psychiatric ward. Previously, professionals, patients, and informal caregivers in the Netherlands were interviewed about the nursing care and their lived experiences. Based on these findings and on the results of a literature review, 89 statements were formulated. A three-round Delphi study among professionals, patients, and informal caregivers was carried out. The accepted statements were summarized. In the first round, 71 statements were accepted, none were rejected, and for 18 statements, no consensus could be reached. These were reformulated and presented in a second round. Thirteen of these statements were accepted, none were rejected, and five statements needed to be reformulated and were presented in the third and final round of this Delphi study. In this final round, all statements were accepted. Consensus was reached among professionals, patients, and informal caregivers in the Netherlands about essential and valuable components of nursing care for patients suffering from acute mania who are admitted to a closed psychiatric ward. ","109":"Patients with somatic symptom disorders (SSD) are prevalent in primary care, urgent care, and emergency rooms and present with reduced quality of life, increased disability, and suicidality . Criteria for SSD include (1) somatic symptoms that cause distress and disrupt life; (2) concurrent physical illness with thoughts and feelings that are disproportionate to the seriousness of the illness; and (3) distress which is persistent and causes suffering. The frequency of SSD in the general population is 5% to 7%; however, in primary care, it is 5% to 35% . Because patients present with anxiety, depression, and\/or pain, providers are flummoxed when diagnostic findings do not match symptom intensity. The purpose of this project was to provide an intervention for patients with SSD and measure its effectiveness on their somatic symptoms. This study provided a single-session, 30-minute psychoeducational intervention for patients to explain brain pathways for pain and the body's response to stress, including scientific benefits of exercise and healthy diet. Patients were asked questions using the motivational interviewing technique OARS (open-ended question, affirmation, reflection, summary) and were encouraged to talk about their concerns. The study used a pre- and post-intervention visual analogue scale and a self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-15 both before and 3 weeks post-intervention. Measurements showed significant symptom improvement immediately after the intervention with sustained improvement 3 weeks post-intervention. This intervention demonstrates an effective treatment for this insidious illness, which plagues up to 35% of patients in primary care.

Unfamiliar with medical terminology, persons may communicate more effectively by means of metaphors to describe what they are experiencing. To examine the language women used to describe their experiences of postpartum depression with metaphors that can provide a valuable source of insight for psychiatric nurses and other clinicians. Secondary qualitative data analysis of three primary datasets of postpartum depression was conducted. Metaphor identification procedure was the approach used to analyze the texts for metaphorical expressions. Eleven metaphors were identified that women used to help explain their postpartum depression: being hit by a ton of bricks, being a tightrope walker, living in a nightmare, feeling trapped, being in the middle of the sea, feeling like an alien, being a loner, being a basket case, having cobwebs in the brain, feeling like garbage, and hitting rock bottom. These 11 metaphors provide a new voice for women's experiences of postpartum depression. As a result, they provide rich insights for psychiatric nurses and other clinicians to help identify women struggling with postpartum depression. ","111":"OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness of the potential for moral injury in nurses working on the frontlines of COVID-19 patient care and to present aspects of mental functioning that may increase the likelihood of psychological distress. Approaches that draw on psychoanalytic thinking to support frontline nurses' mental health are explained. METHOD: This article draws on recent work that is available from multiple sources, including published journal articles on moral injury, recent reports from news services highlighting the crisis state of the pandemic and effects on nurses, established literature on the structural model of the mind, and recent webinars and online lectures addressing mental health crisis interventions. The author draws on expertise from years of training in the Adult Psychoanalytic Training Program at the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute and graduation as an academic analyst. RESULTS: How nurses navigate moral hazards inherent in the current state of frontline health care may depend on their existing ego strengths and levels of self-blame and guilt from a harsh superego. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health professionals need to be aware of the mental minefields that frontline nurses must navigate when providing care that, due to circumstances beyond their control, may be morally ambiguous. Educating nurses about the meaning of their own emotional and psychic responses amid the realities in the field may help to decrease the damaging effects of moral injury.","112":"Agencies and clinical practices are beginning to provide trauma-informed care (TIC) to their clients. However, there are no measures to assess clients' perceptions of and satisfaction with the TIC care they have received. A 20-item questionnaire, the TIC Grade, was developed, based on the National Center for Trauma-Informed Care principles of TIC, to assess the patient or client perception of the TIC provided in settings that serve adolescents and emerging adults. The goal of this project was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the TIC Grade instrument and to make recommendations for use of the full measure and its short form-an overall letter grade. The TIC Grade questionnaire was administered to youth over the age of 18 years from four community partners providing care to vulnerable young adults. Potential participants were offered questionnaires at the end of their visit. Those interested in participating left their completed anonymous questionnaire in a locked box to maintain confidentiality. Questionnaires were collected from 100 respondents; 95 were complete enough to include in analyses for psychometric evaluation. The findings of this project support the reliability and usability of the 20-item TIC Grade measure to assess youth's perceptions of the quality of TIC they received. This TIC-specific, behaviorally worded client report measure can assist service delivery organizations to assess their success at implementing TIC and to identify areas where further staff training and support are needed.

Nigeria has no existing mental health registry. Data on the prevalence of mental disorders are not readily available owing to lack of mental health registry. Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental disorders in Abakaliki metropolis, Ebonyi State. To determine the prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors among the residents of Abakaliki metropolis, Ebonyi State. This cross-sectional descriptive research study involved 400 participants. Questionnaires adapted from world mental health diagnostic interview and General Health Questionnaire 12 were used for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hypotheses tested using chi-square test at significance level of .05. The prevalence of mental disorders among the respondents was 70% depressive disorders and 52.3% substance use disorders-tranquilizers (34.9%) and stimulants (15.8%) were the commonly used, while 85.3% suffered anxiety disorders. These were common among age range of 19 to 28 years-those with higher education and the unemployed. More females had mental disorders except substance use disorders, which was higher in males (53.4%). There was no significant relationship between mental disorders and the demographic variables, but significant relationship was found to exist between individuals' age and anxiety disorder. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, are common among the respondents and, therefore, calls for urgent attention of the government to improve the mental health of the people.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the barriers for healthy intimate relationships for an individual with autism, strategies to overcome these barriers, recommendations for future practice and research, and resources to improve knowledge of this important yet overlooked topic. Data collection was done using research journals and databases such as EBSCO, SAGE Knowledge, MEDLINE, and CINAHL. The reviewed articles were published from 2015 to the present time. During the search process, the following key phrases were used: autism spectrum disorder, intimate relationships, sexuality education, and social skills. In total, 1,400 articles were found with an additional 52 sources found through other sources, of which 31 met inclusion criteria and were subsequently reviewed. Although those with autism have many strengths and talents, deficits in communication and social interaction can affect the formation of healthy adult relationships, including friendships and romantic relationships. In addition to social challenges, a lack of education regarding safe and healthy relationships can put an individual with autism at risk. It is imperative that that individuals with autism, their families, and health care professionals are educated about the barriers and able to access educational resources and specialized curricula on this topic. ","117":"Substance users are among the most highly stigmatized individuals by both the public and health care providers. However, no multidimensional scale for measuring substance use stigma for substance use disorders (SUDs) currently exists in Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Substance Use Stigma Mechanism Scale (SU-SMS). The study was conducted at the AMATEM (Alcohol and Substance Addiction Treatment Center Clinic). The sample group of this methodological study consisted of 156 participants with SUDs who met the inclusion criteria. \"Social-demographics Questionnaire,\" \"The Substance Use Stigma Mechanism Scale,\" and \"Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale\" were used for data collection. In the validity-reliability analysis of the scale, language and content validity, explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis, criterion-concurrent validity, Cronbach's alpha coefficient, item-total score correlation, split-half reliability analysis, and test-retest reliability methods were used. Using exploratory factor analysis, it was found that the SU-SMS has five factors. Its five-factor structure was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. Its Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .828, and factor loading was between .402 and .971. Analyses indicated that each of the factors of the Turkish version of the scale had high internal consistency. The test-retest correlation value was .752, p = .000. It was concluded that the Turkish version of the SU-SMS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing substance use-related stigma in individuals with SUDs.

Recently the need to limit patient and provider exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated implementation of telehealth across the globe. As telehealth utilization expands, its role in nursing education and training requires systematic evaluation. Since publication of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty white paper supporting telehealth in health care delivery and nurse practitioner education, several studies have demonstrated successful didactic instruction and training in telehealth. However, a recent literature review found no studies evaluating the use of telehealth technology as a means of precepting in clinical training. This small-scale qualitative study investigates the readiness of one behavioral health clinic to provide teleprecepting to psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students. Two preceptors and one student were interviewed using a peer-reviewed semistructured interview guide using video chat. Responses were reviewed, coded, and categorized into themes. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three categories for consideration in establishing teleprecepting. Clinical factors, logistics, and comparison with traditional precepting are discussed. Interviewees viewed teleprecepting as a viable method of increasing access to clinical training. This project supports teleprecepting as a feasible strategy for improving access to clinical training and as a technological resource that merits systematic evaluation. Practice guidelines are needed for teleprecepting of advanced practice registered nurse students, and both preceptors and students may benefit from training to support best practices prior to implementation. ","120":"Cannabis use for medical condition has significantly increased over the past 20 years with 33 states and the District of Columbia passing laws legalizing medical cannabis. Five qualifying psychiatric disorders have been identified. The objective of this review article is to present a brief history of medical cannabis, the evidence for the qualifying psychiatric conditions, and to discuss the implications for psychiatric nurses. A review of the literature on the five qualifying psychiatric disorders was conducted. Databases searched included CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedLine Plus, and EMBASE. Keywords were cannabis, medical cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinaol, cannabidiol, and psychiatric disorders. The evidence that medical cannabis or cannabinoids is an effective treatment for the qualifying psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, agitation in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Tourette's syndrome, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder) is too weak and of low quality to recommend as an intervention at this time. A discussion of the implications of these findings for psychiatric nurses is offered based on the published guidelines by the American Nurses Association and National Council of State Boards of Nursing. There is a significant gap between evidence supporting the effectiveness of medical cannabis for psychiatric disorders and patient interest and use of cannabis for such conditions as well as other psychiatric symptoms. There are tremendous opportunities for psychiatric nurses to make an impact both clinically and be conducting research in this emerging field. We need to educate ourselves and our patients about the benefits and risks of medical cannabis and to help patients make informed decisions about their health care. ","121":"BACKGROUND: Knowledge gaps and stigmatized perceptions regarding electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) among patients and health providers contribute to the underutilization of an important therapeutic modality. The proactive education of future advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) provides an opportunity to optimize the use of this evidence-based clinical practice. AIMS: As part of a general course in psychiatry during the first year of nursing school, we dedicated 1 hour to treatment-refractory depression, including ECT, and a second hour to a summary discussion of mood disorders. We evaluated the efficacy of this didactic offering, which was co-taught by a psychiatrist and a psychiatric APRN. METHOD: At baseline, consenting students (n = 94) provided three words they associated with ECT and then completed three validated instruments: (a) Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT, (b) Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers, and (c) Self-Stigma of Seeking Help. Among the 67 students who repeated the assessment at endpoint, 39 attended the ECT didactic (Intervention group, 58%) and 28 did not (Control, 42%). RESULTS: After completion of the 3-month course, students showed improvement across all measures (p &lt; .001). The only outcomes that improved differentially between the Intervention and Control groups were the Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge of ECT Attitudes and Knowledge scales (p = .01). Word choice valence associated with ECT shifted favorably by endpoint (p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: An educational intervention co-led by a psychiatric-mental health APRN had a significant impact on nursing students' knowledge and perceptions of ECT. This approach can be readily implemented at other institutions. Future refinements will include the videotaped depiction of a simulated patient undergoing the consent, treatment, and recovery phases of ECT.","122":"Lack of motivation is a common phenomenon in treatment of schizophrenia. Despite information that various psychosocial approaches may help overcome lack of motivation, their content and nature remain uncertain. However, in recent years, there is an increasing interest in psychosocial interventions such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques in approaching individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (IDSs). In this study, the therapeutic models of ACT and MI were combined to create an innovative integrative approach to address the problem of lack of motivation in IDSs. This study was conducted to determine how a counseling program based on ACT and supported with MI affected the perceptions of treatment motivation in IDSs. This study addressed the qualitative aspects of a doctoral dissertation designed as a quasi-experimental study that gathered both quantitative and qualitative data. As a result of the content analysis, three main themes and 10 categories that motivated IDSs for compliance with regular treatment were developed. The participants in the experimental group expressed a focused treatment motivation to participate in daily life activities and social relations, acceptance of illness, satisfaction with life despite side effects and leading a value-oriented life in comparison with the control group. Counseling based on ACT and supported with the MI technique is effective in improving treatment motivation in IDSs. This counseling may be implemented as an effective psychiatric nursing intervention for IDSs. ","123":"BACKGROUND: Despite wide-spread use, telepsychiatry use among psychiatric mental health advanced practice nurse practitioners (PMH APRNs) has not been systematically explored in the literature. AIMS: Systematically review the PMH APRN usage of live-time, synchronous telepsychiatry including audiovisual teleconferencing technology. METHOD: A comprehensive, systematic search was performed with no publication date restriction across CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on July 30, 2019, by a medical librarian. Each citation was blinded and independently reviewed by three reviewers, and consensus was reached for inclusion. Eligible articles were peer-reviewed research or quality improvement articles available in full-text, written in English, including real-time, synchronous, audiovisual telepsychiatry services with PMH APRN providers. Discussion articles and literature reviews were excluded. Article quality and bias were assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment tool. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 342 articles, and only nine articles met full inclusion criteria. Overall, risk of bias was high in all studies, and the GRADE rating consisted of three \"very low,\" five \"low,\" and one \"medium\" quality article. However, considering the collectively positive outcomes from PMH APRN telepsychiatry use, the overall GRADE recommendation was to \"probably do it\" for seven studies and \"do it\" for two studies. CONCLUSIONS: Though existent literature is low quality and sparse, evidence supports that PMH APRNs can feasibly and successfully provide telepsychiatry services across a wide range of demographic patients and locations. PMH APRNs should contribute more original evidence to guide telepsychiatry implementation and adoption as the service expands.","124":"","125":"","126":"","127":"","128":"OBJECTIVE: This article presents proven, promising, and potential therapeutic uses for cannabidiol (CBD) in the treatment of psychiatric and neurologic conditions and diseases.

The psychosocial impact of living with HIV among this vulnerable population narrated by their own voices has been understudied. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the psychosocial impact of living with HIV on minority older women. METHOD: In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 minority older women living with HIV at an Ambulatory Care Center HIV Clinic in South Florida. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Conventional content analysis was used to identify and define the major themes that emerged from the interviews. Questions included those concerning description of life after the HIV diagnosis, most challenging aspects of life after the diagnosis, and daily activities since the diagnosis. RESULTS: The analysis of the interview data led to five main themes: (I) Social Impact of HIV, (II) Threats to Health and Well-Being, (III) HIV as a Death Sentence, (IV) Spirituality, and (V) HIV Treatment Adherence. In their narratives, women described a myriad of psychosocial issues such as depressed mood, isolation, economic challenges, stigma, anhedonia of interest, fear of death, among others. CONCLUSIONS: There is a compelling empirical need for rapid implementation of a culturally tailored, holistic, low-cost, multistrategy intervention to early screen and reduce the psychosocial impact of HIV among minority older women.","131":"BACKGROUND: Many transgender individuals of varying ages are at risk of developing eating disorder behaviors or unhealthy weight management behaviors.

The significance of these projections is particularly relevant to older women (&gt;65 years), who are more likely to provide dementia caregiving for a husband than vice versa. Research has identified consistent themes around the impact of caregiving during the caregiving experience, yet there is limited research exploring the ongoing impact during the transition to widowhood. Moreover, there is a paucity of research examining differences between rural and urban spousal dementia caregivers. AIMS: The aims were to compare differences between older rural and urban spousal caregivers on physical and mental health factors affecting the transition from caregiver to widow and to identify resources the women used during this transition over 12 months. METHOD: This mixed-methods longitudinal study recruited 13 urban and nine rural female spousal caregivers. Participants were interviewed three times over 12 months. The dependent variables were depression (measured using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), physical and mental functioning (measured using the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form Health Survey Version 2). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between rural and urban female caregivers on the dependent variables. However, rural caregivers scored higher on depression and lower on both physical and mental functioning compared to their urban counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have clinical and research implications. Psychiatric nurses are well positioned to provide education related to dementia information deficits; implement interventions that facilitate bereavement, resilience, self-care, and identity; advocate for additional services; and conduct larger scale studies with a more diverse sample of female spousal caregivers.","135":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created an unprecedented global health challenge. There is risk that the outbreak will create a \"second pandemic\" of mental health crises in health systems and communities.

Nurses and nurse leaders must anticipate these mental health challenges, assist with preparedness in health systems and communities, and advocate for a coordinated response to promote mental wellness and resilience.","136":"Acute manic episodes are a psychiatric emergency related to violence and poor patient outcomes. Combination psychotropic therapy utilizing a mood stabilizer and an atypical antipsychotic has been shown to be more efficacious for treating acute mania compared to monotherapy with either mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone. This quality improvement project implemented evidence-based interventions for treating acute mania. The mania pathway protocol was created as a comprehensive clinical guide for guiding mania treatment. The protocol was implemented on an inpatient psychiatric unit for patients with mania diagnoses including manic\/mixed episodes of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. (1) to improve the treatment of mania by using evidence-based interventions for rapid mood stabilization and (2) to educate psychiatric providers on up-to-date interventions for treating acute manic states. Psychiatric providers were evaluated for knowledge enhancement through a pre-\/post-educational session quiz. A retrospective chart review was used for data collection for patients treated with the mania pathway protocol. The retrospective chart review spanned 8 weeks post project implementation. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores were analyzed to measure the effect on mania severity. The percentage decrease in mean Young Mania Rating Scale scores from admission to the fifth day of hospitalization was 61%. All psychiatric providers proved knowledge attainment by scoring 100% on the postintervention quiz. Rapid mood stabilization may be achieved by using a combination therapy-based mania protocol.

The improvement of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-R) test results between baseline and evaluation among children participating in the NDBI program (n = 67) was compared with the results among children receiving community treatment as usual (n = 27) using analysis of covariance. The study showed that children in the NDBI group improved their ADOS-R total scores between baseline and evaluation (-0.8 scores per year; 95% CI [-1.2, -0.4]), whereas no improvement was detected in the comparison group (+0.1 scores per year; 95% CI [-0.7, +0.9]). The change in the NDBI group versus the change in the comparison group was statistically significant after adjusting for possible confounders as well. Children in the NDBI group also significantly improved their ADOS severity scores, but the scores were not significantly different from those of the comparison group. The results from the current naturalistic study must be interpreted cautiously, but they do support earlier studies reporting on improvement of autism symptoms after early intensive interventions. Results from observational studies are difficult to interpret, but it is nevertheless of uttermost importance to evaluate costly autism intervention programs. The results do indicate that children with autism benefit from participating in early comprehensive intensive programs. ","138":"","139":"Delirium is common in elderly patients with hip fracture.

Mobile health clinics have the potential to reduce avoidable ED visits by providing easily accessible care. To determine whether psychiatric patients have a significant reduction in ED visits after admission to the mobile mental health clinic (MMHC). This study is a replication of a pilot study on the first 43 patients admitted to the MMHC that was conducted soon after the opening. Results of that study were promising. In the current study, health records from a sample of 265 patients from the MMHC were reviewed retrospectively to determine the number of ED visits post admission to the MMHC. ED visits were examined 8 months prior to admission to the MMHC and 8 months after. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to analyze demographics and determine differences in ED visits pre- and post admission to the MMHC. Findings demonstrated that patients admitted to the MMHC had a significant reduction (p &lt; .05) in ED utilization. There was also a decrease in mean ED visits in patients who received combined treatment, which included medication management and counseling. The MMHC is an effective initiative to reduce ED overutilization, thereby decreasing Medicaid costs. Psychiatric care provided directly in the home can promote health and prevent destabilization.

Affected individuals are known to experience inequities in care, and on average, they die earlier than individuals without SPMI. Currently, little is known about hospice use among individuals with SPMI, including what factors contribute to the use of hospice services. AIMS: The aim of this integrated review was to identify factors associated with the use of hospice services by individuals with SPMI. METHODS: A review of the available literature on this topic was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, and PsycInfo were searched, and relevant records were identified. Ultimately, eight studies were identified and selected for analysis. RESULTS: Themes illustrating the factors associated with hospice use and, within them, challenges to obtaining hospice care were discovered. The three themes identified within the eight studies were fragmentation of care, inadequate communication, and the need for advance care planning. These patterns indicated that multiple barriers to utilizing hospice care exist for individuals with SPMI when compared with the general population. CONCLUSIONS: By recognizing and addressing factors influencing the use of hospice care, as well as barriers to receiving hospice, improved provision of timely end-of-life care that is consistent with individuals' preferences may be facilitated.","145":"BACKGROUND: Depression is a debilitating disease that can significantly affect one's life. Perceived discrimination has been shown to have an impact on depressive symptoms. The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between discrimination and depressive symptomatology. AIMS: This literature review provides a synthesis of recent literature that provides valuable information that can be used to recognize depressive symptomatology and to improve health outcomes for African American men experiencing depression. METHODS: This literature review examines the current literature and synthesizes 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria utilizing metanarrative methodology with RAMSES standards. Attention was paid to the six guiding principles characteristic of a metanarrative review. PRISMA guidelines were followed for this review. Articles that focused on specific subsets of the African American male community were excluded. RESULTS: It was noted that perceived discrimination was positively associated with depressive symptomatology in African American men. While similar methods for measuring depression were noted in several of the studies, measurement of discrimination varied. Additional factors that appeared to have an association with the relationship between discrimination and depression in this population included social supports, masculine role norms, and sociodemographic factors such as age. CONCLUSION: This synthesis of the literature also can be used to improve health care providers' engagement with this population to improve the quality of care and health care outcomes. As a result of this review it was found that a positive relationship exists between discrimination and depressive symptomatology in African American men.","146":"Mothering in the context of mental disorders presents with multiple challenges. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood: It is not known how child caregiving affects the health of their mothers. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between child caregiving load and health indicators in mothers receiving outpatient behavioral health services for mental or substance use disorders. A total of 172 mothers (80% Hispanic\/Latina) completed surveys on their mental and physical health, and children's behaviors and medical problems. Child caregiving load consisted of number of children living with the mother, and presence of children's internalizing, externalizing, or medical problems. Child caregiving load had significantly positive associations with mother's psychological distress, fatigue, pain, and body mass index. Child internalizing and medical problems were associated with mothers' poor health status. Hispanics\/Latinos experience health disparities, and Hispanic\/Latina mothers who are already at risk due to their mental disorders experience an additional health burden associated with caring for children with emotional or health problems. Psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioners should assess child caregiving impact on mothers with mental disorders and seek to mitigate their caregiving burden and maintain their health. Further research is needed to clarify child characteristics and the mechanisms associated with maternal caregiver burden, suboptimal self-care, and adverse health outcomes.

Metabolic syndrome has been reported in 52% of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications, compared to the general population rate of 23%, and has been found to place individuals at high risk of death from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. AIM: This quality improvement project aimed to increase the rate of metabolic monitoring and related lab orders for patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications in a rural community mental health center to improve patient outcomes. METHOD: The use of a metabolic monitoring tool was implemented onsite. Chart audits were used to assess the effectiveness of introducing a metabolic monitoring form at a rural community mental health center and explore the feasibility of implementing a metabolic monitoring tool organization-wide. RESULTS: Metabolic lab orders increased from 1 to 59 at 8 weeks postimplementation for Clinic A after the implementation of a metabolic monitoring tool. CONCLUSION: Prescriber lab order rates improved using a metabolic monitoring form. Adherence to guideline-based care will improve patient outcomes by detecting the onset of metabolic syndrome earlier in the disease course. Early monitoring for metabolic changes will improve the health of patients diagnosed with a mental illness.","149":null,"150":"BACKGROUND: Substance misuse remains a public health crisis and contributor to morbidity and mortality. The nursing workforce is not immune to the impacts of substance misuse as rates are thought to mirror those of the general population. Additionally, as substance misuse often begins in adolescence or early adulthood, prevalence of misuse among practicing nurses highlights the fact that students are also at risk. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine rates and patterns of substance use and adverse childhood experience (ACE) exposure among nursing students while also examining associations between substance use and ACE exposure. METHOD: This study utilizes a cross-sectional and descriptive design through the provision of email surveys to nursing students. Email surveys consisting of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, the Drug Abuse Screening Tool 10-item survey, the ACE Questionnaire, and a demographic inquiry were distributed via Qualtrics survey software. RESULTS: A total of 662 individuals participated in the survey, the majority of whom self-identified as female, were undergraduate students, and were between 18 and 21 years. Moderate- to high-risk alcohol use was identified in 20% of students, while moderate- to high-risk drug use was identified in 3.6% of students. More than half of students endorsed exposure to at least one ACE. Significant associations were found between the Drug Abuse Screening Tool 10-item survey and the ACE Questionnaire.

These factors contribute to increased fear and anxiety when engaging with agitated patients in the psychiatric setting. AIM: The aim of this quality improvement project was to explore how a multilevel approach of psychiatric simulation training, psychiatric emergency code support, enhanced crisis prevention intervention training, and self-care education addressed staff fear and anxiety related to managing agitated patients. METHOD: Data collection was done by voluntary pre and post simulation training surveys, medical record review of high-risk violent patients, documented psychiatric emergency code debriefings, implementation of enhanced crisis prevention education, and voluntary self-care evaluations completed by mental health workers at staff retreats. RESULTS: Findings with psychiatric simulation showed effectiveness in improving role clarity, confidence, and feelings of preparedness for managing crisis situations. Review of code debriefings identified safety as the highest problem. Small work groups were created to address individualized elements that were expressed by mental health workers as safety concerns. Self-care education through staff retreats increased awareness on prevention of compassion fatigue and burnout, while allowing mental health workers to engage in activities that promote and improve cohesiveness of the team. CONCLUSIONS: These approaches effectively addressed management of fear and anxiety with agitated patients as well as solidified the notion that a multilevel approach is necessary.","152":"BACKGROUND: An operational definition of serious mental illness (SMI) with well-defined inclusion criteria allows the identification of the most vulnerable individuals and secures resources to meet their needs and develop social programs for their treatment, rehabilitation, and recovery. In addition, the contents of a clinical construct such as SMI have an impact on both the development and the clinical application of the research results. However, currently, different ways of operationalizing the definition of SMI coexist. AIMS: The aim of this review was to explore whether unanimity exists in the operationalization of SMI definitions in quality-of-life interventions research. METHODS: A review of the literature based on searches of the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Intervention studies were selected in which quality of life was the outcome variable and adults with SMI were the subject population. RESULTS: A wide range of definition of SMI is used in the scientific literature. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of unanimity in the variables considered necessary to identify SMI. The scientific literature uses different approaches to operationalize SMI, and these approaches vary considerably among studies. Caution is required when interpreting quality-of-life research that includes individuals labeled with SMI. It is necessary to reach a consensus on the criteria for applying the SMI label to ensure its content validity.","153":"BACKGROUND: There is robust literature on spirituality in nursing. Despite the unique needs of those with serious mental illness, there has been little exploration of spirituality in the context of nursing care for this population. Lacking a well-defined concept of spirituality in psychiatric care, mental health nurses often struggle to provide optimal, holistic care. AIMS: The aim of this concept analysis was to review definitions and descriptions of spirituality in the psychiatric nursing literature to synthesize a usable definition to inform practice and provide a basis for future study. METHOD: Beth Rodgers's evolutionary concept analysis method was followed to inductively derive a definition of spirituality in psychiatric nursing care. Steps included identification of the concept, setting, and sample; synthesis of key attributes, antecedents, and consequences from the literature; and a discussion of implications. A search in the psychiatric nursing literature (1998-2019) included literature reviews, case studies, concept analyses, qualitative interview studies, and quantitative survey research. RESULTS: Spirituality in psychiatric nursing was defined by attributes of a search for life meaning and purpose and a sense of connectedness. Spirituality in the practice of psychiatric nursing was a result of value-influenced thinking and a capability for interaction with others. Consequences included consolation and positive or negative coping. CONCLUSIONS: A clearly defined concept of spirituality in psychiatric nursing can provide a basis for clinical confidence for nurses in identifying patient spiritual needs and choosing appropriate interventions to support those needs.","154":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders, severe bipolar disorder, or severe recurrent major depressive disorder have a shorter life expectancy compared with those in the general population. This is largely due to the higher rates of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Treatment adherence, diet, exercise, and weight management are modifiable risk factors for these cardiometabolic conditions, yet the use of educational lifestyle interventions is not common practice in the clinical setting. AIM: The purpose of this project was to evaluate a 12-week evidence-based diabetes prevention education program integrated into a primary care behavioral health setting for adults with SMI, diabetes, or prediabetes, and who were overweight or obese. METHOD: This project utilized a pretest-posttest intervention design. Outcomes for this project included diabetes knowledge, self-care, and health indicators (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, weight, body mass index, and medication adherence). The project also addressed feasibility and acceptability of the program in this setting. RESULTS: Project outcomes showed a reduction in weight, waist circumference, hemoglobin A1C, and blood pressure. Outcomes also indicated an improvement in participants' self-knowledge and self-care. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high attendance rate and overall acceptability and feasibility described by participants. This project highlights the important role that primary care providers can play in providing health education to patients with SMI.","155":"BACKGROUND: Academic-practice partnerships are a key component of the provision of innovative patient-centered care throughout a health care system. As consumers gain access to more health care options, patient satisfaction is becoming increasingly important. Patients' satisfaction depends on their perception during utilization of health care services. AIM: The purpose of the project was to assess patients' level of satisfaction with the utilization of a telehealth service to receive psychiatric-mental health care. METHOD: The project used a quantitative survey research design comprising a sample of patients receiving treatment for a psychiatric-mental health disorder. Utilizing telehealth, trained nursing students assisted in the provision of follow-up mental health care to patients residing in a rural area. Participating patients completed the 10-item Telehealth Satisfaction Scale questionnaire on conclusion of the follow-up appointment. RESULTS: Questionnaire responses were scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale, with high scores indicating greater satisfaction. Item means ranged from 3.4 to 3.82. CONCLUSIONS: As a positive association was found between patient satisfaction and the utilization of telehealth as part of an academic-clinical partnership, results suggest that the project was a worthwhile innovative endeavor. The telehealth intervention proved to be a sufficient alternative method of in-person follow-up visits for patients receiving treatment for psychiatric-mental health disorders.","156":null,"157":"Stress and coping skills are essential factors in the etiology of depression. Understanding the stressors and coping strategies of adolescents in Turkey may help determine the content of the country-specific depression prevention program. The purpose of this study was to understand the stressors of adolescents with a high or low risk of depression and how they coped with these stressors. This descriptive qualitative study was conducted in a high school in western Turkey. The data were collected via semistructured individual interviews. Eleven adolescents with high risk of depression and 10 adolescents with low risk of depression were included in the study. Content analysis technique was used to analyze the data. The stressors of adolescents and their coping were grouped into three themes: stressors, factors affecting coping strategies of adolescents, and coping. Stressors theme consists of three subthemes: family relationship, peer relationship, and telephone\/internet usage. The factors affecting coping strategies of adolescents theme consists of four subthemes: cognitive distortions, self-perception, family relationships, and peer relationships. The coping theme consists of two subthemes: engagement coping and disengagement coping. It was determined that adolescents with a high risk of depression had more stressors and used more disengagement-coping techniques. It is recommended that to prevent depression among adolescents, school nurses should take initiatives to strengthen the coping strategies of adolescents with high risk of depression. ","158":"","159":"","160":"INTRODUCTION: Concussions as a result of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in youth are often associated with athletic injury; however, they can also occur as a result of intentional self-injury by head banging. Despite the known neurological sequelae secondary to MTBI, assessment, interventions, and consequences of head banging in the nonintellectually disabled populations have not been well studied. AIMS: The intent of this nurse-led intervention was to develop a brain rest protocol at a residential treatment program serving youth who were between 12 and 19 years old in order to improve the quality of care and moderate negative sequelae resulting from MTBI. METHODS: A nursing assessment guided by an adaptation of the acute concussion evaluation and a strength-based intervention protocol was developed and applied to youth who engage in head banging. RESULTS: The result was a protocol that defined the process by which a youth would be assessed and treated after head banging. There are no outcome measures that would assist to measure the effectiveness of this intervention in the short or long term. CONCLUSION: This intervention filled a need for improved assessment and appropriate interventions in youth with head-banging behavior. It is feasible that the assessment and implementation of the brain rest protocol is the first step in understanding how to best evaluate and manage the sequelae of intentional head banging resulting from MTBI.","161":"BACKGROUND: A fully integrated Obstetric Mental Health Clinic (OBMHC) was established in 2007 in the rural northwest United States to address perinatal depression. AIMS: The purpose of this mixed methods study was to examine depression outcomes in women receiving outpatient psychiatric services between 2007 and 2017 at a fully integrated OBMHC and to explore patient and obstetric team perceptions of OBMHC experiences. METHOD: A retrospective database study was employed; depression was measured at baseline and follow-up visits using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Descriptive statistics, regression models, and trend analysis were employed to determine effectiveness. A subset of patients participated in telephone interviews; the obstetric team was surveyed regarding perceptions of the service. RESULTS: The sample included 192 women (195 pregnancies). Approximately 72% experienced less depression by the first follow-up visit. Patients taking three or more psychiatric medications attended more OBMHC visits. Trend analysis indicated that women with the highest levels of depression had the best response to the intervention. Three qualitative themes emerged: Safe Place, Mental\/Emotional Stability, and Integrated Personalized Approach. Obstetric team members (n = 11) perceived the clinic to be helpful and noted improved access to mental health care. CONCLUSION: OBMHCs can be effective when psychiatric nurses are embedded within an outpatient obstetric service. Improved access, timely services, and patient reassurance can lead to an improved pregnancy experience and reduced depressive symptoms. The longevity of this clinic's experience serves as a role model for other centers to replicate this successful integrated model of care.","162":"Communication with individuals with mental disorder (IMDs) may often be a nonlinear, complex, and variable situation. In general, the first contact of nurses with IMDs occurs during training rotations at a psychiatric clinic. Psychiatric nursing students' initial communication experiences with IMDs may be critical to their thinking of psychiatric nursing as a career. To determine the communication experiences of psychiatric nursing students with IMDs. A qualitative interview study was conducted with psychiatric nursing students studying at a nursing faculty in the east of Turkey in 2019 who completed the clinical practice. Semistructured interviews were conducted by an independent researcher. The data were analyzed using content analysis with an inductive approach. In this study, maximum effort was made for data saturation criteria, and data saturation was achieved with 26 students. As a result of the data analysis, four main themes and 11 categories were developed. The main themes were as follows: (1) restrictions caused by psychological barriers, (2) restrictions caused by thinking and perceptions, (3) restrictions caused by personal and behavioral barriers, and (4) effective communication and therapeutic environment. In this study, although it is seen that nursing students encounter many communication barriers with IMDs, it is an important development that they implement approaches to provide effective therapeutic communication. The results show the importance of effective nurse-patient communication skills as the first step in improving the clinical practice of nurses in psychiatry clinics. ","163":"BACKGROUND:Individuals with psychotic disorders are more likely to have nonpsychiatric hospitalizations than the general population. Moreover, they experience worse outcomes in terms of rehospitalization, adverse events, in-hospital mortality, and longer length of stay. AIM: A patient-centered understanding of inpatient medical-surgical hospitalization experiences could shed light on disparities in hospital outcomes among individuals with psychotic disorders. METHOD: This article reports findings from Phase 1 (Qualitative) of a mixed methods, exploratory sequential study of nonpsychiatric hospitalizations of patients with psychotic disorders. Patients on medical-surgical units with diagnosed psychotic disorders (n = 20) were interviewed about their experiences of hospitalization, and a thematic analysis was conducted of transcripts, case notes, and setting notes. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from analysis: (1) managing through hard times (subthemes: intense emotions, medically complex with many symptoms, strategies for self-management), (2) ignored and treated unfairly, (3) actively involved in health (subthemes: seeking health education, suggesting changes), (4) appreciation of caring providers, and (5) violence: expected and enacted. Participants connected the difficult nature of their hospitalization experiences with a variety of sources and outcomes, including strong emotions, variable relationships with providers and a struggle to receive health education. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who care for patients with psychotic disorders in medical-surgical settings can better meet patients' needs by concentrating on relationship building, especially during initial interactions, and helping patients better manage their medical and psychiatric symptoms through both pharmaceutical and nursing interventions.","164":"OBJECTIVE: To disseminate knowledge to mental health nurse educators regarding a course that is successfully preparing registered nurse (RN) students to pass the psychosocial integrity portion of the National Council Licensing Exam for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). METHOD: Following the implementation of a new concept-based nursing program curricular design, faculty teaching in a psychiatric mental health nursing course embarked on converting lecture-based, content-saturated teaching strategies into active learning strategies. In this article, the overall conceptual framework for the course and specific examples of active learning teaching strategies related to nursing concepts in mental health are described. Information on objectives, clinical placements, testing, class organization, and curricular content are provided. Outcomes are shared revealing success in helping students pass the psychosocial integrity section of the NCLEX-RN. RESULTS: Predictive scores on the HESI RN Psychiatric Mental Health Specialty Exam have been consistently higher than the national average for the United States, and the NCLEX-RN pass rate for the cohort of 90 students was 97%. The majority of student evaluations of the course were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the integration of conceptual and active learning in a psychiatric mental health nursing course may increase the likelihood of student success.","165":null,"166":"BACKGROUND: Secondary traumatic stress can be the cost for clinicians when caring for persons who have been traumatized. Secondary traumatic stress is a syndrome of symptoms similar to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). AIMS: To conduct a secondary qualitative data analysis of three primary data sets of secondary traumatic stress in nurses. METHODS: Cross validation was the type of qualitative secondary analysis used to compare qualitative findings across these multiple data sets. In the three primary studies, the data were analyzed for themes. In this secondary qualitative analysis, a different defining unit was chosen. This time, the four categories of PTSD symptoms (intrusions, avoidance, arousal, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood) were used to analyze the data sets using content analysis. RESULTS: For all three groups of maternal-newborn nurses, the intrusions category was ranked first and the negative cognitions and mood category was ranked second. The remaining two symptom categories were where their rankings differed. The labor and delivery and neonatal intensive care unit nurses ranked arousal symptoms third and avoidance symptoms fourth. For the nurse-midwives, the rankings for these two categories were reversed. The neonatal intensive care unit nurses comprised the one group that did not report any avoidance symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This secondary qualitative analysis confirmed the presence of PTSD symptoms that maternal-newborn nurses struggled with as a result of caring for either critically ill infants or women during traumatic births. Hospital preventive strategies and interventions for secondary traumatic stress in nurses are discussed.","167":"BACKGROUND: Estimates of substance use (SU) in nurses is on par with that of the general population: between 6% and 8%. However, collecting sensitive information such as SU is difficult based on social desirability and fears of disclosure. AIMS: Part of a larger study surrounding nurses' self-reports of SU (n = 1,478), the purpose was to explore open-ended responses of nurses (n = 373) who were invited to \"Please add any additional comments related to substance or alcohol use that you have experienced or witnessed in registered nurses.\" METHOD: This qualitative study employed a content analysis of 373 nurses' open-ended responses collected via an online survey. RESULTS: The majority of nurses (n = 250) forwarded comments that described SU in other nurses, while 24 comments reflected the nurse's past or current SU. Content analysis revealed the following four themes: (1) differing social network proximity to SU; (2) individual process: vulnerability to adaptive\/maladaptive coping resulting in positive and negative outcomes; (3) bedside, system, and organizational spaces and effects; and (4) there are no SU issues in nursing. CONCLUSIONS: Although direct reports of SU constitute approximately one quarter of the comments forwarded, nurses reported peers' struggles with SU, including observing nurses working in patient care while impaired and the use of substances to cope with work and personal stressors. Individual factors and system-related failures appear to be contributors to SU in nurses.","168":"BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been associated with psychological and physiological disease, and risky health behaviors. A person's ability to be resilient may protect them from these negative health outcomes, as resilience has been associated with increased emotional awareness, coping, belonging, and greater likelihood of good health and well-being. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a strengths-based resilience intervention to improve access to internal and external resources that effect perceptions of stress, resilience, emotional awareness, and belonging among student-athletes. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used to examine variables of interest between intervention and control groups. A sample of 56 college athletes completed surveys and engaged in expressive writing during a 5-week resilience intervention. RESULTS: Self-report data indicated that student-athletes in the intervention group improved decision making, lowered perceived stress, and increased resilience compared with controls. Of note, participants with ACEs showed greater increments of positive change in emotional awareness scales than participants without ACEs. Descriptions of emotion management, authentic connections, and increased ability to request support from others were identified in the qualitative data. CONCLUSIONS: A strengths-based course designed to increase resilience-offered as academic and athletic stress is mounting-provided a unique opportunity to promote student-athlete success. Participants gained skills key to victory on and off the field, including health-promoting behaviors, a sense of belonging, persistence, and the ability to negotiate external resources.","169":null,"170":"","171":"BACKGROUND: Historical trauma (HT) among American Indians (AIs) has been linked with poor mental health but has been inadequately studied among urban populations. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe historical trauma, historical loss associated thoughts, ethnic experience, and psychological symptoms among a population of urban AIs. METHOD: This was a mixed methods study. In addition to focus groups, survey participants were administered the Historical Losses Scale, the Historical Losses Associated Symptoms Scale, the Scale of Ethnic Experience, and the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Adult Self-Report. Rates of psychological symptoms were compared with matched controls from a normative data set. RESULTS: Participants reported a strong sense of ethnic identity, a moderate desire to associate with other AIs, moderate comfort within mainstream society, and moderately high perceived discrimination. The most common HT themes were loss of culture, respect by children of traditional ways, and language. Compared with controls, participants had higher rates of aggressive behavior, substance use, thought problems, and obsessive symptoms, but some of these issues are likely explained by cultural factors. A greater number of participants met the clinical threshold for multiple problems compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: This sample of AIs reported frequent experiences of discrimination. HT is a significant factor in the lives of many urban AIs who also have significantly higher rates of a number of mental health problems. Providers must be aware of these issues to provide the most effective care to AIs.","172":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the size and distribution of the advanced practice psychiatric nurse workforce relative to the total psychiatry workforce to determine whether nurses are predominantly working in areas with higher or lower levels of behavioral health specialists. METHODS: State-level data for psychiatric nurses were obtained from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, and included mental health psychiatric nurse practitioners, adult psychiatric nurse practitioners, child psychiatric clinical nurse specialists, and adult psychiatric clinical nurse specialists. Supply estimates of the full psychiatry workforce were calculated for comparison purposes. State population estimates were obtained from U.S. Census Bureau data. State workforce estimates were converted to a 1:100,000 provider-to-population ratio to analyze the density of providers across states. RESULTS: In 2018, the psychiatric workforce supply was estimated to be composed of 66,740 providers, including psychiatrists (n = 47,046; 71%), psychiatric nurses (n = 17,534; 26%), physician assistants (n = 1,164; 2%), and psychiatric pharmacists (n = 966; 1%). Overall, psychiatric providers appeared to be most densely concentrated in the northeast region of the United States. A dearth of providers was most pronounced within areas in the 12-state Midwest region, southern states, California, and Nevada. The average concentration of psychiatric workers was 22.61 per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study find inconsistent pattern of how psychiatric nurses are distributed relative to the rest of the workforce, but reinforce the idea that they are essential in addressing care needs in areas with low concentrations of psychiatry specialists-especially if they are authorized to work to the full extent of their training\/education.","173":null,"174":"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of individual wellness interventions are well studied in relation to their respective impacts on psychiatric and mental wellness. To date, there is limited research on programs that incorporate multiple wellness domains and measure psychiatric and wellness markers. AIM: To assess the psychiatric and wellness impact of a nonpharmacologic wellness intervention on subjects receiving psychiatric treatment. METHOD: Forty-one adults with a psychiatric disorder completed the first 30 days of WILD 5 Wellness (Wellness Interventions for Life's Demands), a 90-day self-management mental wellness program that incorporated exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition. Subjects recorded participation in both workbooks and online surveys. Participants were recruited nationally via online and outpatient clinic advertisements. Wellness and mental health were measured on Days 1 and 30 of the intervention via five instruments: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for mood, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale for anxiety, the Sleep Condition Indicator for sleep quality, the Sheehan Disability Scale for functionality in psychiatric patients, and the HERO Wellness Scale, which measures happiness, enthusiasm, resilience, optimism, and overall mental wellness. RESULTS: Subjects reported statistically significant improvements across all measures on Day 30. CONCLUSION: The research suggests that this multidomain wellness program may be a valuable adjunct to traditional psychiatric treatment and an accessible tool for all health care providers.","175":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the current rural mental health system crisis in the United States and how psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) can holistically mitigate this systemic issue. METHOD: Respective to the objective, relevant literature is reviewed. RESULTS: PMHNPs have successfully increased access to care in underserved rural communities by practicing at the fullest extent of their scope without mandated supervision, utilizing telepsychiatry practice, while expanding PMHNP rural mental health education and research to meet and absolve pressing rural mental health challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports that rural mental health care improves when PMHNPs have full scope of practice, utilize telepsychiatry, engage in related scholarly activity, and have formalized education and training for rural health care delivery, which collectively answer the professional and moral call serving the underserved rural population with mental illness.","176":"","177":"","178":"INTRODUCTION: The application of mechanical restraints is a high-risk emergency measure that requires psychiatric intensive care to assure patient safety and expedite release at the earliest opportunity. While current Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services regulations require trained staff to continuously observe restrained individuals, assessment by a registered nurse is required only once an hour. The experience of an acute psychiatric hospital demonstrates that more frequent registered nurse assessments can decrease duration of mechanical restraint episodes. AIMS: The aim of this three-part quality improvement project was to decrease duration of mechanical restraint episodes by increasing the frequency of registered nurse assessment and surveillance. METHODS: First, the requirement for frequency of face-to-face registered nurse assessment during episodes of mechanical restraint was increased from once every hour to once every 30 minutes. Second, the frequency of assessment was increased on half the hospital's units, from every 30 minutes to continuous registered nurse presence during restraint. Finally, the remaining units adopted 1:1 registered nurses during restraint. Mean hours of restraint per episode were measured and compared before and after each practice change. RESULTS: Mean duration of restraint episodes decreased 23% in the first change cycle, 12% in the second, and 44% in the third. Overall, there was a statistically significant 30% decrease in mean duration of restraint episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Increased frequency of registered nurse assessment and surveillance can significantly decrease duration of mechanical restraint episodes. Nurses are encouraged to adopt mechanical restraint practice standards that provide continuous psychiatric intensive care by a registered nurse.","179":"BACKGROUND: Trauma and its consequences have been identified as a high-priority public health risk. A growing body of research reveals the devastating long-term consequences from common and widespread adverse events across the life span. In addition, recent research links medical procedures and medical illnesses with posttraumatic stress disorder. Nurses too are at risk and suffer vicarious trauma. Nurses must be able to recognize and assess for early trauma symptoms and assist in enhancing resilience in order to prevent and care for those with trauma. However, there is a lack of trauma-informed and trauma-specific training in nursing education. Given the ubiquity of traumatic events, the pervasive physical and emotional sequelae of trauma, and the existence of evidence-based treatment for trauma; there is a critical need to develop core competencies for nursing education and practice. AIM: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate Trauma and Resilience Competencies for Nursing Education. METHOD: An expert panel of 16 nurses met in 2018 to develop Trauma and Resilience Competencies for undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, and for psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner education. Following the Expert Panel's work and approval from the institutional review board, a modified e-Delphi survey was sent to experts in trauma and resilience to validate this work. RESULTS: The competencies were validated and edited to 88 competencies through two rounds of a Delphi survey. CONCLUSIONS: Implications for education, practice, and research are discussed. The Trauma and Resilience Competencies for Nursing Education will be disseminated widely through publications and are available online.","180":"BACKGROUND. Between 4% to 70% of inpatients engage in self-harming behaviors and effective interventions are needed to address this population. AIM. This article reviews literature from 2007 to 2017 to address treatment and management strategies specific for the treatment of nonsuicidal self-injury in the inpatient psychiatric setting. METHODS. Cochrane, PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL were searched for relevant articles with 34 studies reviewed for applicability to the question, and 9 parsed into a summary of Findings table. RESULTS. Therapeutic approaches that show promise include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mentalization as well as medications that act on the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and opioid systems. Effective models of care aim toward enhancing therapeutic relationships with staff, providers, and most important, encouraging the internal shift toward recovery within the patient. CONCLUSIONS. More research with controlled designs in the inpatient setting is needed, however, regardless of which approach is used, the impact of the individual caregiver on the patient's recovery is key.","181":"","182":"BACKGROUND: Technology is disrupting every modern industry, from supermarkets to car manufacturing, and is now entering the health care space. Technological innovations in psychiatry include the opportunity for conducting therapy via two-way video conferencing, providing electronic consultations, and telementoring and education of community health care providers. Use of mobile health applications is also an expanding area of interest and promise. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and pros and cons of technology-enabled health care since the digital movement in psychiatry began more than 50 years ago as well as describe the University of Rochester's innovative digital behavioral health care model. METHODS: A review of the literature and recent reports on innovations in digital behavioral health care was conducted, along with a review of the University of Rochester's model to describe the current state of digital behavioral health care. RESULTS: Given the lack of access to care and mental health professional shortages in many parts of the United States, particularly rural areas, digital behavioral health care will be an increasingly important strategy for managing mental health care needs. However, there are numerous hurdles to be overcome in adopting digital health care, including provider resistance and knowledge gaps, lack of reimbursement parity, restrictive credentialing and privileging, and overregulation at both the state and federal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health innovations are transforming the delivery of mental health care services and psychiatric mental health nurses can be on the forefront of this important digital revolution.","183":"OBJECTIVE: To adapt a diabetes survival skills education (DSSE) program for delivery on inpatient behavioral health units (BHUs) and to evaluate implementation feasibility within nursing unit workflow. METHODS: We employed mixed methods to codesign, implement, and evaluate a DSSE program for inpatient BHUs. The Diabetes to Go core program incorporates linking knowledge deficits to video education content, a companion book on diabetes survival skills, and education for nurses on delivery processes and teaching content. The Diabetes to Go adaptation for BHUs was codesigned in partnership with BHU staff and patients. Implementation evaluation included patient surveys and nursing staff feedback obtained during field observations. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients participated in nine group education sessions among whom 17 (20%) had diabetes. Nursing unit staff and patients expressed willingness to engage in program design. Barriers to implementation were encountered in both groups including lack of standardization of education content by nurse facilitators and difficulty engaging patients for the time required for completion of surveys plus group education. Preferred education media for both nurses and patients was a book. Diabetes knowledge deficits were identified among over two thirds of participants with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Group class may not be the optimal delivery model for specialized DSSE on BHUs. It remains to be determined if individual diabetes education alone or a model which combines individual and group sessions is preferable. Translation of standardized approaches for diabetes education on inpatient BHUs will require further redesign to meet the unique needs of this population.","184":"OBJECTIVE: To review the challenges and issues facing educators as they prepare the psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing workforce to meet the needs of future practice. METHODS: Based on the author's 40-plus-year career as an educator, clinician, and researcher, combined with a review of the literature, this article analyzes the current educational milieu for undergraduate, graduate, postgraduate, and continuing education of PMH nurses, including urgent educational priorities. It also offers recommendations to meet the needs of PMH nurses both in education and in clinical practice. RESULTS: PMH nursing education must evolve to provide nursing experiences in nontraditional as well as traditional clinical settings, and incorporate simulation and telehealth\/digital\/mobile platforms for delivery of content. Development of qualified faculty members and preceptors who represent the diversity of the American population must be addressed to adequately train PMH nurses to meet the demands of their future roles. Methods must also be created to define, teach, and evaluate PMH nurses' clinical competencies pre- and postclinical experiences. CONCLUSIONS: PMH nursing education must evolve and transform to attract, appropriately educate and prepare students for practice, and meet the growing need for qualified practitioners as well as faculty members and preceptors.","185":"BACKGROUND: An estimated 30% to 50% of people with a mental illness also have a substance use problem. Referred to as having a dual diagnosis, these patients experience high levels of unmet needs, poor health outcomes, and require specialized care during psychiatric hospitalization. Research on nursing inpatients with a dual diagnosis is limited and patient perceptions of helpful care during hospitalization are unknown. AIMS: What nursing interventions, attitudes, actions, and\/or behaviors are perceived as helpful by patients with a dual diagnosis during psychiatric hospitalization? METHODS: A qualitative-descriptive design was used. Twelve adult inpatients with a dual diagnosis were recruited using purposive sampling. Individual, semistructured interviews were conducted, and interview data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Helpful nursing occurred across three themes: (1) promoting health in everyday living, (2) managing substance use in tandem with mental illness, and (3) building therapeutic relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Specific examples of helpful interventions and their reported outcomes reinforce the critical role that nurses play in the health and recovery of inpatients with a dual diagnosis. The importance of collaborative, strengths-based approaches is highlighted, and expanding the nurse's role to include evidence-based responses to substance use is recommended.","186":"BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive and social cognitive impairments are core characteristics of psychotic disorders, which are present in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) and strongly predict poor social functioning. Addressing cognitive impairments through cognitive training and remediation (CTR) may be a crucial component of recovery-oriented treatment. AIMS: The objectives of this review were to (1) evaluate the CTR theoretical basis and intervention components and (2) examine the effects of CTR on cognition and social functioning in FEP. METHOD: A combined search of Ovid Medline, Embase, and Psych Info databases was conducted using keywords. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Quality and risk of bias were assessed using established instruments. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were included in this review and had an overall fair to poor quality. CTR interventions in FEP utilize a range of theoretical backgrounds, with most including a focus on higher order cognitive processes. Varied doses and intervention components are used. All but one study found improvements in at least one cognitive domain. Global cognition, verbal learning, and memory and executive function were most commonly improved. Three studies found an effect on a range of functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of CTR interventions have promising effects for addressing cognitive impairments in FEP. Evidence of functional impact is less consistent. Further research is needed in FEP on CTR targeting sensory and perceptual processes, and to identify CTR intervention targets and treatment components that will lead to robust improvements in cognition and functioning.","187":"OBJECTIVE: Adults with serious mental illnesses have a lower life expectancy attributable to many factors including metabolic disorders and cancer. Access to cancer screening has been shown to decrease morbidity and increase chances of survival. This study examined access to cancer screening services among individuals with serious mental illnesses served by a community behavioral health care agency partial hospitalization program at four locations. METHOD: A self-administered paper-and-pencil survey was provided to adults attending partial hospitalization programs. The survey consisted of open- and closed-ended questions about utilization, access to, and barriers to cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screenings. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 136 individuals. Participant screening rates were above national rates for cervical and breast cancer but lower for colorectal cancer. The main cited barrier to receiving the screening tests was lack of physician recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric nurses are ideally suited to communicate with this population and other behavioral health care professions about the importance of these screenings. Communication should also advocate for improved education and increased support for cancer screenings to address this health care disparity.","188":"BACKGROUND: The development of de-hospitalization policies in mental health has resulted in a growing emphasis on self-management. In the chronic care model, self-management support is an essential element. Because of the episodic nature of severe mental illness (SMI) and its high relapse rates, we assume that the extent of self-management support needs of individuals with an SMI is considerable. However, a clear overview of the nature of the self-management support needs of persons with SMI is missing. AIMS: This study aimed to identify self-management support needs from the perspective of individuals with SMI. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted using the method of thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. After searching the databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE, we screened the papers for the eligibility criteria: individuals with an SMI, adequately representing the voice of persons with SMI and describing their self-management support needs. Thirty-one papers were included. RESULTS: The main findings showed that participants in the studies described the need for informational support, emotional support, acknowledgment, encouragement, and guidance to make sense of their illness experiences, ease suffering, obtain validation and recognition, execute self-management tasks, and be led through unfamiliar territory. CONCLUSION: The perspectives of persons with SMI can provide a road map for constructing a self-management support intervention for persons with SMI. Important others have an essential role in fulfilling support needs. Independently managing an SMI is difficult. Therefore, it is preferable to let important others participate in self-management interventions and to introduce peer support.","189":"Workplace bullying is a highly prevalent occupational burden in health care settings. It is associated with various negative consequences in nurses, but its unique relationship with nurses' positive mental health (PMH) has yet to be established. The purpose of this study was to examine the unique relationship between bullying at the workplace and positive mental health among registered nurses. A descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 231 registered nurses was recruited from two governmental hospitals, two private hospitals, and two teaching hospitals. Self-reported data were obtained about nurses' demographic variables, their experience of bullying at the workplace, and their perceived positive mental health. About 73.6% of the participants were exposed to workplace bullying. Regarding the positive mental health subscales, the spirituality subscale had the highest mean score (M = 4.93, SD = 1.11), while the global affect had the lowest mean score (M = 3.55, SD = 1.17). Factors associated with the total PMH or at least one of its subscales were gender, experience, working shift, type of hospital, and the position of the participant. There was a significant negative relationship between bullying at the workplace and positive mental health (r = -.16, p &lt; .05). After controlling participants' characteristics, workplace bullying accounted for significant variance in PMH. Regardless of the nurses' characteristics, bullying at the workplace has a negative impact on nurses' mental health and well-being. ","190":"BACKGROUND: Mothers' depressive symptoms affect their children's growth as well as physical and mental well-being. Moreover, mothers of young children with developmental delay or disability (DD) tend to have higher depressive symptoms. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between maternal depressive symptoms and number of children with DD among mothers with significant levels of depressive symptoms, while accounting for maternal diathesis factors and family stress factors. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of pooled baseline data collected from 2004 to 2012 in the northeastern and southeastern United States from three intervention studies to reduce depressive symptoms of mothers with young children (n = 364). Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between maternal depressive symptoms and number of children with DD, followed by the post hoc pairwise comparison. RESULTS: In the model including family stress factors, we found a significant test for linear trend in the mean for maternal depressive symptoms across the number of children with DD (F[1] = 4.3, p = .0388). CONCLUSIONS: Mothers who have multiple children with DD tend to experience higher depressive symptoms; thus, interventions are needed to help prevent these mothers from experiencing higher depressive symptoms or to reduce their current depressive symptoms. Both theory-based and strength-based interventions can target conflict management at the family level, reducing maternal depressive symptoms while improving mothers' self-efficacy, which would help mothers care for their own health, manage family conflict, and seek appropriate support to manage the children's medical and developmental needs.","191":"BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbearing can affect the entire family unit. Health professionals must strive to identify and develop effective, feasible solutions for women during this critical period. AIMS: To determine whether postpartum maternal functioning (as measured by the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning) and depression symptoms (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were improved after participation in the Visiting Moms program. METHOD: Paired data were collected from women at program intake and after completion of the Visiting Moms program. Visiting Moms provides services through eastern and central Massachusetts and was designed to support new mothers throughout the infant's first year of life. The study population was composed of adult women living in the Jewish Family and Children's Services geographic catchment area, who enrolled in Visiting Moms between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all 402 women enrolled in this timeframe. Utilizing a pretest\/posttest design, paired t tests were performed for the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (n = 149) and for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (n = 156), where women had complete scores at both intake and completion, to determine the program's potential impact on depressive symptoms and functional status. RESULTS: Functioning and depression scores were significantly improved after participation in the program. CONCLUSIONS: Visiting moms, and similar programs, aimed at delivery of enhanced social support, may be effective in promoting mental and emotional wellness among new mothers who are require additional support in the postpartum period.","192":"BACKGROUND: First responders (FRs) are at significant risk for developing mental health (MH) problems due to the nature, frequency, and intensity of duty-related traumatic exposure. However, their culture strongly esteems strength and self-reliance, which often inhibits them from seeking MH care. AIMS: This study explored factors that influenced FRs' perceptions of MH problems and engagement in MH services. METHODS: A community-based approach and individual ethnographic qualitative interviews were used. Recruitment of a convenience sample of firefighters and emergency medical technicians\/paramedics from across Arkansas was facilitated by our community partners. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis and constant comparison. RESULTS: Analysis generated three broad factors that influenced FRs' perception of MH problems and engagement in MH services: (a) Knowledge, (b) Barriers to help-seeking, and (c) Facilitators to help-seeking. Knowledge was an overarching factor that encompassed barriers and facilitators: A lack of knowledge was a barrier to help-seeking but increased knowledge served as a facilitator. Barriers included five subthemes: Can't show weakness, Fear of confidentiality breech, Therapist: negative experience, Lack of access and availability, and Family burden. Facilitators included five subthemes: Realizing \"I'm not alone,\" Buy-in, Therapist: positive experience, Problems got too bad, and Recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide unique perspectives from FRs about how to best address their MH needs. First responders, as well as mental health care providers, need a more thorough understanding of these issues in order to mitigate barriers and facilitate help-seeking. As advocates, educators, and health care providers, psychiatric nurses are well-positioned to care for this at-risk population.","193":"BACKGROUND: Parent training is a method for strengthening parenting skills, reducing child behavior problems, and promoting positive parent-child relationships. However, few parents have access to these evidence-based programs. The ezParent program, a tablet-based delivery adaptation of the group-based Chicago Parent Program, is a parent training program designed to address the needs of families raising young children in urban poverty. AIMS: This study aimed to explore (a) parents' perceptions of the benefits and barriers associated with their use of the ezParent program and (b) the ways in which the ezParent components and perceived usability varied by program use (module completion). METHOD: An explanatory mixed-methods design was used with the overall intent to use the qualitative data to help explain in greater detail the quantitative results. RESULTS: Fifty-nine parents of 2- to 5-year-old children from two pediatric primary care clinics serving predominantly low-income and racial\/ethnic minority families in Chicago (Cohort 1) and Baltimore (Cohort 2) participated in follow-up interviews. Among those interviewed, 23 (38.9.5%) parents completed all six modules and 12 parents (20.3%) completed none of the modules. However, of those 12, 8 (67%) logged in to the program and completed portions of Module 1. Parents who completed more modules reported more program benefits, and those who completed fewer modules reported more barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Exploring users' experience with current digital applications, researchers and application developers can better design future tablet-based interventions to be both effective and acceptable by consumers.","194":"INTRODUCTION: Prolonged QT interval (PQTI) is a cardiac condition widely documented in the mental health literature and linked to psychotropic medication use. Medications notable for contributing to the condition are antipsychotics, antidepressants, and some mood stabilizers. Although additional medication classes and other contributing risk factors are often present, the prudent mental health provider benefits from having a basic understanding of this condition and how to prevent and manage it with safe prescribing practices. AIMS: This guide seeks to provide mental health prescribers with a basic understanding of the risk factors, pathophysiology, identification, and management of PQTI. METHOD: Relevant literature and practice guidelines were reviewed and summarized with a focus on practical interventions for the psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP). RESULTS: One of the primary contributing factors to PQTI development and complications is polypharmacy. Patients with co-occurring medical, mental health, and\/or substance use disorders may receive medications from multiple providers. Anticancer drugs, antiarrhythmic medications, and even a number of common antibiotics can increase the QT interval, making it a challenge for even the most experienced mental health provider to monitor medication interactions and side effects that contribute to PQTI. Having a sound knowledge base of these factors can guide safe PMHNP practice. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making trees grounded in evidence-based research were developed in order to direct thorough assessment and safe treatment of patients requiring psychotropic medications.","195":"","196":"BACKGROUND: Nurses are in key positions to reduce the global burden associated with alcohol, yet many are ill-prepared to screen for alcohol use and intervene accordingly. The purpose of this integrative review was to identify best practices for educating nurses to work with patients who are at risk for alcohol-related adverse consequences, implement alcohol screening, and deliver alcohol brief interventions (ABIs). AIMS: To identify and synthesize findings from randomized control trials of ABIs delivered by nurses to patients identified through screening to be at risk because of alcohol use. METHOD: The results of 11 published randomized control trials identified from a multi-database search were synthesized. RESULTS: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test was used for alcohol screening in more than half of the studies. Most of the ABIs were based on motivational interviewing and delivered in 30 minutes or less. While there was limited information on the characteristics of nurses who delivered the interventions and how nurses were prepared to deliver the ABIs, the exemplar was a full day workshop teaching nurses on an evidence-based framework for the ABI. All studies measured alcohol consumption as an outcome, yet few used rigorous methods for obtaining this self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS: A 1-day workshop is recommended as an educational modality to prepare nurses to implement the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test for identification of persons who are at risk because of alcohol use, deliver a structured brief intervention in less than 30 minutes, and utilize a standard measure of alcohol consumption for evaluation.","197":"","198":"","199":"BACKGROUND: Researchers have documented significant psychological problems among nursing students, but findings have been inconclusive as to whether nursing students are \"at-risk\" for mental health problems compared with their non-nursing peers. AIMS: This study examined whether nursing students have unique mental health characteristics compared with students from other professions. METHOD: Undergraduates (N = 18,312; nursing n = 1,399) were selected from the 2016-2017 National Healthy Minds Study. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (anxiety), and the Flourishing Scale (positive psychology). RESULTS: Nursing students were equally likely to screen positive for depression and anxiety compared with their non-nursing peers. However, when controlling for gender, age, and year in school, multigroup structural equation modeling analyses revealed that female (but not male) nursing students reported significantly higher levels of specific anxiety symptoms and certain psychological strengths than female students from other professions. Nursing students are equally likely to screen positive for depression or anxiety as their non-nursing peers; however, anxiety disorders may reflect symptom profiles unique to nursing students. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest a need for tailored screening and interventions to reduce mental health problems and harness psychological strengths unique to nursing students.","200":"INTRODUCTION: Measurement-based care (MBC) uses standardized measurement to systematically monitor treatment response over time. Although MBC is underutilized in mental health settings, primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI) settings are expected to provide MBC. This article describes a quality improvement (QI) process to increase Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) utilization within a PC-MHI setting. AIMS: Pre-intervention, rates of baseline and follow-up PHQ9 administration for veterans with a depressive disorder were 76% and 35%, respectively. This article describes a QI process to increase PHQ9 utilization rates within a PC-MHI setting, with the goal to improve provider PHQ9 utilization rates at baseline and within 4-week follow-up to 90%. METHOD: An educational intervention and weekly motivational enhancement sessions were implemented in 2017. Chart review data compared PHQ9 utilization rates from fall 2016 and 2017. RESULTS: Following intervention, provider PHQ9 utilization rates increased to 98% and 88% at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a brief education-based intervention can increase clinician use of MBC within a PC-MHI setting. Meaningful use of MBC to inform treatment was not evaluated in this QI project and is an area for future investigation.","201":"INTRODUCTION: Nonadherence to medications for schizophrenia relates to frequent readmissions. Long-acting injectable (LAI) medications are shown to increase adherence and reduce admissions. AIMS: (1) Identify frequent readmissions to psychiatry. (2) Improve nursing advocacy for patients appropriate for LAIs through in-service. METHODS: Chart audits were employed for data collection. Academic detailing and dashboards were used for voluntary nursing education. The chart audit spanned 90 days pre and post in-service. All admissions to psychiatry were screened; patients with readmissions under 30 days (with the same admitting diagnosis), a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis, and nonadherent with oral antipsychotics were included. Results: Forty-four patients met criteria and amassed 49 frequent readmissions. For inclusion criteria, the admission rate decreased by 53% and LAI prescriptions increased by 9%. Three patients from the first audit group and one from the second were initiated on LAIs. CONCLUSIONS: Attitudes toward LAIs may be improving based on RN advocacy and collaboration.","202":"BACKGROUND: Efforts to examine alternative classifications (e.g., personality) of anorexia nervosa (AN) using empirical techniques are crucial to elucidate diverse symptom presentations, personality traits, and psychiatric comorbidities. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to use an empirical approach (mixture modeling) to test an alternative classification of AN as categorical, dimensional, or hybrid categorical-dimensional construct based on the co-occurrence of personality psychopathology and eating disorder clinical presentation. METHODS: Patients with AN (N = 194) completed interviews and questionnaires at treatment admission and 3-month follow-up. Mixture modeling was used to test whether indicators best classified AN as categorical, dimensional, or hybrid. RESULTS: A four-latent class, one-latent dimension mixture model that was variant across groups provided the best fit to the data. Results suggest that all classes were characterized by low self-esteem and self-harming and suicidality tendencies. Individuals assigned to Latent Class 2 (LC2; n = 21) had a greater tendency toward being impulsive and easily angered and having difficulties controlling anger compared with those in LC1 (n = 84) and LC3 (n = 66). Moreover, individuals assigned to LC1 and LC3 were more likely to have a poor outcome from intensive treatment compared with those in LC4 (n = 21). Findings indicate that the dimensional aspect within each class measured frequency of specific eating disorder behaviors but did not predict treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the complexity of AN and the importance of considering how facets of clinical presentation beyond eating disorder behaviors may have different treatment and prognostic implications.","203":"","204":"","205":"","206":"BACKGROUND: Substance use among adolescents remains a major public health concern, which is correlated with mortality. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to (1) examine risk factors predisposing adolescents to substance use and (2) identify patterns of simultaneous drug exploration among adolescents. METHOD: Data (N = 15,624; collected in 2015) were drawn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which is a national school-based survey of 9th- to 12th-grade students to monitor health risk behaviors. Substance use was assessed using self-reported questionnaires, and latent class analysis and logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Five latent patterns of substance use were identified: (1) abstinent (64%); (2) 1st-step social experimenter (25%) (i.e., used alcohol, e-cigarettes, and\/or marijuana); (3) 2nd-step social experimenter (6%) (i.e., used alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, marijuana, synthetic marijuana, and\/or prescription pills); (4) pill experimenter (4%), (i.e., used prescription pills); (5) full experimenter (2%) (i.e., likely to use all assessed substances). Gender, race, grade, and depressive mood were strong predictors of membership in a particular substance use class. CONCLUSION: Adolescents presenting for care may possess symptoms associated with various substances beyond those being managed. Mental health nurses can leverage these results in reducing adolescent substance use through primary and secondary prevention. A longitudinal study of not only substance use patterns but also the progression to substance use disorders among adolescents is warranted.","207":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression spans age-groups, but it can be particularly destructive for older people with chronic illness. Among older Black women living with HIV (OBWLH), multiple social determinants have been associated with the prevalence and severity of depression. A greater understanding of the impact of the social determinants at the individual, interpersonal, and community levels is needed. AIMS: To explore social determinants of depression among OBWLH at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community levels. METHOD: Cross-sectional descriptive design. RESULTS: A total of 118 OBWLH were analyzed in the study. Depression was prevalent among the participants. Approximately 89.8% of the participants had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Health status, exercise, and social support were significant predictors of depression in the sample. CONCLUSION: Social determinants at multiple levels play a significant role in the occurrence and management of depression among OBWLH. Implications for practice, education, and research can be drawn from these findings.","208":"BACKGROUND: Public often obtains mental health information from mass media and Saudi Arabia is characterized by high media penetration. Fictional and nonfictional media dramatize, trivialize, and misrepresent characteristics and needs of clients who need mental health care and may create and reinforce existing stigma. This pattern of stigma may adversely affect mental health care clients, practitioners, education, and programs. Portrayal of mental illness and opportunities for care in Saudi Arabia need development. OBJECTIVE: This study examined Saudi graduate nurses' perceptions of stigma created by mass media and influence on public perceptions of mental health issues and use of these views to formulate ways to effect changes in mental health care availability and delivery. METHOD: Participants included 18 graduate practicing female mental health nurses at King Saud University School of Nursing. Qualitative data were collected using individual interviews and analyzed using NVivo 10.1 software for thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The core theme that emerged was \"stigma in media,\" which in turn had five subthemes: (a) media portrayal, (b) mass media, (c) social stigma, and (d) mental health care services. CONCLUSION: This inquiry may be helpful in enabling development of stigma-reduction programs by shedding light on the role of mass media in forming normative behavior and attitudes toward mental illness in Saudi culture.","209":"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that animal-assisted activity (AAA) effectively improves physiological, psychological, emotional, and social well-being in various environments. AIMS: To identify how AAA affects mood states and feelings among both patients and staff on inpatient psychiatric units. METHODS: This study used a quasi-experimental, pre-\/posttest design with nonequivalent comparison groups. Quantitative data were collected using the Visual Analog Mood Scale. Demographic data, with an open-ended question, were obtained postsessions. RESULTS: Significant changes were observed pre- and postexposure to AAA sessions with a therapy dog. Negative moods decreased, and positive moods increased as measured by the Visual Analog Mood Scale. Content analysis identified themes of feeling happy, feeling relaxed, and feeling calm. CONCLUSIONS: This research expands scientific evidence associated with AAA by identifying changes in mood states and feelings among individuals in a psychiatric setting.","210":"","211":"BACKGROUND: The correlation of paternal depressive symptomatology to maternal postpartum depression can approach 50%. Paternal depression during a female partner's postpartum time period can include feelings of fear, confusion, frustration, anger, helplessness, and lack of support. There are only a few published studies that address the interaction between paternal and maternal mental health during the postpartum period. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of men whose partners had postpartum depression as a foundation for intervention and program development. METHOD: This qualitative study used a descriptive phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 10 men who lived with a partner diagnosed with postpartum depression was recruited via flier postings in mental health clinics, a perinatal mental health email listserv, and word-of-mouth. Single, audiotape-recorded interviews were completed. Qualitative data analysis was used to reduce initial coding to final themes that described participant experiences. RESULTS: The participants described efforts to provide support and care for their families; their efforts not to make things worse; their fears, anxieties, and physical responses; and the isolation associated with not knowing how to ask for help. The five themes included needing to support partners, maintaining stability, experiencing mutual symptoms, feeling isolated, and providing insight for others. CONCLUSIONS: Depression is known to have a negative effect on all members of a family. It is imperative that fathers' experiences are understood in order to fill this gap in caring for families.","212":"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders seriously affect both physical health and psychosocial functioning. Breaking the confines of an eating disorder requires engagement in a multifaceted recovery process. OBJECTIVE: This article provides a synthesis of 12 qualitative research studies with various eating disordered populations (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified, and other specified feeding and eating disorders) to elucidate the recovery process from the perspective of those who have overcome the disease. METHOD: A metasynthesis of qualitative studies was conducted using Noblit and Hare's metaethnographic methodology. RESULTS: Five overarching themes emerged from the data: (1) the eating disorder as a life jacket, (2) drowning: recognizing consequences, (3) treading the surface: contemplating recovery, (4) swimming: the path toward recovery, and (5) reaching recovery: a sense of freedom. CONCLUSIONS: Eating disorder treatment often entails a cycle of transitions before recovery occurs. Synthesizing the experiences from the perspective of individuals who have overcome an eating disorder presents a unique understanding of the treatment and recovery process.","213":"BACKGROUND: Positive mental health (PMH) is described as the sense of feeling good and functioning well. PMH is vital for the individual's positive functioning and psychological well-being, particularly regarding the factors important for living a purposeful life and accomplishing personal goals. Nursing students are exposed to a variety of stressors that are very likely to decrease well-being and trigger stress, anxiety, and depression. Data focusing on PMH in nursing students are lacking, and this subject has been frequently neglected in nursing practice and research on positive functioning. AIMS: To assess positive mental health levels in two samples of nursing students. METHODS: A quantitative cross-sectional study. A convenience sample of 2,238 nursing students with an average age of 21 years (17-36 years old) were recruited from two nursing schools-Porto (Portugal) and Barcelona (Spain). The Positive Mental Health Questionnaire and sociodemographic items were used to measure the PMH. RESULTS: The majority of participants were female (88.6%), and 7.7% had physical health problem and 2.6% referred to a mental health problem. The mean PMH score was 83.4, indicating a good PMH level. A total of 58.4% reported a moderate PMH, and only 0.5% indicated low PMH level. Results were not significantly different between genders (p &gt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study make important contributions to our understanding of PMH levels in a large sample of nursing students and the efficacy of Positive Mental Health Questionnaire, which is an accurate tool to measure PMH. Our findings also prompt discussion about PMH and its implications for practice and teaching.","214":"","215":"","216":"","217":"BACKGROUND: Substance use is a global mental health issue. There has been limited research exploring the relationships among body, mind, and spirit well-being and the possibility of relapse across different categories of substance users. AIMS: The purpose of the current path analysis was to examine the relationship between body-mind-spirit well-being and the possibility of relapse intention as well as other relevant predictors in people who had a history of substance use. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used. Participants were recruited in Southern Taiwan between December 2015 and June 2016. Data were collected from 467 participants who had a history of using controlled substances. RESULTS: Path analysis results revealed that body-mind-spirit well-being was negatively predictive of the possibility of relapse intention. Out of several predictors, stress influence and duration of substance use had direct effects on body-mind-spirit well-being and the possibility of relapse intention, respectively. Stress influence and duration of substance use were associated with decreased body-mind-spirit well-being and increased relapse intention scores. In addition, no history of health problems and male gender were associated with increased body-mind-spirit well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Stress management and the duration of substance use play an important role in body-mind-spirit well-being and relapse intention in people with a history of substance use. Health care professionals could teach substance users coping strategies to address their stress and problems, which may improve their health and reduce the possibility of relapse intention.","218":"BACKGROUND: Promoting spiritual well-being aids the mental health recovery process. Furthermore, nursing governance bodies and national mental health care regulators support spiritual care as a mental health-promoting approach. Although spiritual well-being is integral to quality of life in people with mental illness, little is known about the psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurses' provision of spiritual care. AIMS: Spiritual perspectives, frequency of spiritual care, and knowledge of recovery-oriented practice were measured. Variables were explored to identify a model of spiritual care. METHOD: A descriptive correlational cross-sectional design was employed. Analyses of data using descriptive statistics, correlations, and hierarchical multiple regression were conducted with a convenience sample of 171 PMH nurses. RESULTS: Participants scored high on measurement of spiritual perspectives, moderate on measurement of knowledge about recovery-oriented practice, and indicated a moderate degree of frequency of provision of spiritual care. Nurses who viewed themselves as \"spiritual and religious\" provided more frequent spiritual care and had higher levels of spiritual perspectives than those who viewed themselves as \"spiritual but not religious.\" Significant contributors to spiritual care were spiritual perspectives and years of experience as a PMH nurse. Knowledge of recovery-oriented practice, however, did not contribute to a model of spiritual care. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses' spiritual perspectives, religiosity, and years of experience are factors that may explain nurse-provided spiritual care. Findings imply that spiritual and\/or religious development may support PMH nurses to provide spiritual care.","219":"","220":"BACKGROUND: The United States is experiencing a shortage of mental health practitioners. A growing body of evidence shows that nursing students state that mental health is among the least desirable specialties, citing anxiety as a prominent factor. This study builds on existing knowledge and seeks to understand undergraduate nursing students' goals and perceptions about mental health prior to a mental health course utilizing a semistructured clinical journal. AIMS: To explore undergraduate nursing students' goals and perceptions in order to develop strategies that may positively influence students' thoughts about mental health nursing. METHOD: Utilizing qualitative methodology, students' journal entries (n = 90) were coded into keywords by frequency, forming the basis of themes in this study. RESULTS: Analysis found that nursing students are primarily concerned with their ability to communicate effectively with mental health patients, leading to fears about the upcoming mental health practicum. Although not prompted, students also discussed various stigmas surrounding mental health patients and disorders. CONCLUSION: Students enter the mental health course and practicum with a variety of preconceptions. Nurse educators play a central role in identifying and developing psychoeducational strategies to address student concerns and increase students' interest in mental health nursing.","221":"","222":"BACKGROUND: Persistent pain causes a significant decrease in quality of life and increases overall disability more than any other condition. Hypnotherapy is emerging as a treatment option for pain management; examination of this treatment modality and its effectiveness is needed. AIM(S): To examine evidence for effectiveness of hypnotherapy to treat persistent pain in adults. METHOD: A consolidated review was completed through searching biomedical and life sciences literature databases. RESULTS: Results were obtained through appraisal of six identified studies meeting inclusion criteria. Hypnotherapy decreases pain and improves pain-related function and quality of life outcomes to a greater extent than other psychological interventions or usual treatments. Furthermore, it has been shown to be effective in a variety of chronic pain conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatment practices fail to alleviate pain adequately; there is sufficient evidence to suggest hypnotherapy as a viable treatment modality for persistent pain. However, more definitive studies are needed for it to be a first-line intervention.","223":"Background: Adults who suffer with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) rarely access medical care to receive preventive vaccines. Aims: To increase the rate of vaccines among the SPMI population in an outpatient community mental health center (CMHC). Methods: A review of the literature identified a gap between the general population and SPMI clients in receiving preventive vaccinations. An initial mixed-method convenience survey of SPMI clients (n = 392) provided information on current vaccination status, demographics, beliefs, and interest in receiving vaccines. A vaccination program was developed to address identified barriers and increase vaccination rates. Postintervention data were collected through a mixed-method convenience survey of SPMI clients (n = 60) who participated in immunizations clinics to evaluate client satisfaction. A partnership between the health department and CMHC was developed to deliver vaccines in a nontraditional site. Vaccines administered included annual influenza; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; herpes zoster; measles, mumps, and rubella; pneumococcal; and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap). Results: More than 1,000 vaccines were administered in the first 8 months, with a significant increase in vaccination rates over baseline for individual vaccines ranging from 18.75% to 83%. Postintervention survey results found a 95% satisfaction rate. Conclusions: Implementation of a vaccination program in a nontraditional site that facilitates access for SPMI clients can promote an overwhelming increase in the vaccination rates for this underserved population. Results suggest that the integration of mental health and CMHC services can have a profound positive effect on SPMI population health.","224":"INTRODUCTION: Restraints in the inpatient child\/adolescent psychiatric population pose a threat to client safety and quality of care. Nurses are key in reducing restraints through implementation of evidenced-based interventions to improve quality and safety. AIM: To identify the impact of milieu nurse-client shift assignments on monthly restraint rates when compared with individual nurse-client shift assignments on an inpatient child\/adolescent psychiatric unit. METHODS: A quantitative, retrospective, comparative project design was used. The sample included all inpatient child\/adolescent clients admitted to the child\/adolescent psychiatric unit between the months of January-May 2016 and 2017 who were physically or mechanically restrained. Retrospective chart audits were conducted, and information transcribed onto an adapted chart audit tool by Edwards et al. (2006). Monthly restraint rates were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value of &lt;.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: The Mann-Whitney U test revealed statistical significance between the impact that the individual nurse-client shift assignments (Mdn = 61.2, n = 6) and the milieu nurse-client shift assignments (Mdn = 6.8, n = 6) had on monthly restraint rates, U = .000, z = -2.88, p = .004, r = .83. CONCLUSION: Use of milieu nurse-client shift assignments are associated with lower monthly restraint rates when compared to individual nurse-client shift assignments. Milieu nurses provide structure, safety, consistency, and security, leading to early intervention and de-escalation of clients who display aggressive behaviors. Nurse staffing structures also need to be optimized to meet the needs of this population.","225":"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are irreversible, progressive brain disorders that slowly destroy memory, language, problem solving, and cognition. In the United States, dementia is the fifth leading cause of death for people age 65 years and older. Early diagnosis could have important benefits stigma related to dementia remains a significant impediment to diagnosis, treatment, and accessing services. While a growing body of research documents the existence and negative outcomes of stigma, less is known about how dementia-related stigma produces ill effects. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to explore how stigma manifests within families from the perspective of family caregivers of people with dementia. METHOD: Using a grounded theory approach, we interviewed 13 family caregivers of people with dementia. RESULTS: Shame emerged as the central theme experienced by family caregivers of people with dementia. Attempting to manage shame, produced three categories of responses: (1) silencing and not calling attention to the symptoms, (2) concealing the diagnosis, and (3) shunning and avoiding contact. CONCLUSIONS: Shame may be an underlying mechanism by which stigma is enacted and perpetuated, resulting in caregivers' isolation and delay in access to diagnostic and supportive services. Efforts to dispel the misconception that dementia is a shameful disease may be one way to diminish stigma.","226":"","227":"","228":null,"229":"","230":"To characterize the future Psychiatric Mental Health (PMH) Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) workforce in light of the high demand for psychiatric providers in all aspects of mental health service delivery. Over the past 20 years, there has been significant growth of the PMH APRN workforce, a provider group capable of addressing mental health provider shortages. However, continued growth may be limited by anticipated retirements and traditional volume of graduations from PMH nurse practitioner (NP) programs. Optimum utilization of PMH APRNs in service delivery systems and State workforce planning may also be impeded by their frequent mischaracterized in federal reports and mental health workforce studies. Based on a review of the literature, this discussion paper evaluates trends related to PMH NP programs and graduates, anticipated retirements of current PMH ARPNs, facilitators and barriers to increasing the PMH APRN workforce, and opportunities and threats to workforce development. The PMH APRN workforce faces significant challenges owing to barriers and facilitators to growth of the specialty. These factors conspire to limit the supply of PMH APRNs at a time when they are needed to compensate for declining numbers of providers in the United States, particularly practicing psychiatrists. Recommendations are forwarded as to how best shape the educational pipeline to meet the current and emerging needs of American citizens for quality mental health care. ","231":"","232":"To define and describe the current psychiatric mental health registered nursing (PMHN) workforce providing care for persons with mental health and substance use conditions, evaluate sources of data relevant to this workforce, identify additional data needs, and discuss areas for action and further investigation. This article uses currently available data, much of it unpublished, to describe the current PMHN workforce. The available data indicate that PMHNs represent the second largest group of behavioral health professionals in the United States. As is true of the overall nursing workforce, PMHNs are aging, overwhelming female, and largely Caucasian, although the PMHN workforce is becoming more diverse as younger nurses enter the field. PMHNs are largely employed in the mental health specialty sector, and specifically in institutional settings. Similar to other behavioral health professionals, a significant shortage of PMHNs exists in rural areas. Because of data limitations and difficulty accessing the best available data on the PMHN workforce, it is often overlooked or mischaracterized in published research and government reports on the behavioral health workforce. Although PMHNs are one of the largest groups in the behavioral health workforce, they are largely invisible in the psychiatric literature. Psychiatric nursing must correct misperceptions about the significance of the PMHN workforce and increase awareness of its importance among government agencies, large health care organizations, and within the broader nursing profession. ","233":"To describe the development of a data-driven policy platform for psychiatric nurses roles and outcomes to alleviate the current mental health crisis in the United States. Drawing on census data, statistical reports, and analysis of the current psychiatric mental health nursing (PMHN) workforce, a data-driven policy platform is designed to recruit, train, and prepare psychiatric nurses for addressing the nation's mental health crises. As noted by the Institute of Medicine's 2010 &amp; 2016 reports on the future of nursing, the largest available health care workforce is not being used effectively, particularly to address the nation's mental health care needs. The development of a data-driven platform provides direction for psychiatric nurses in developing the workforce to meet the national mental health crisis. From education through practice and research, psychiatric-mental health nursing must build and share a data-driven, relationship-to-care platform emphasizing how PMHN care affects patient outcomes. Using a data-based platform to grow supportive public opinion, psychiatric mental health nursing can build a workforce to modify national accreditation standards and laws supporting data-driven PMHN care. The specialty profession must also seek to modify the nursing profession's attitude toward embracing data-driven platform of care relationships to psychiatric mental health outcomes. ","234":"","235":"BACKGROUND: The excess of mortality in people with severe mental illness is due to unnatural causes such as accidents or suicides and natural causes such as metabolic syndrome. The presence of modifiable risk factors like tobacco consumption increases cardiovascular and metabolic risk. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular risk factors in people with severe mental illness. This study also aimed to identify the prevalence of patients receiving treatment for any metabolic syndrome risk factor. METHOD: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. A total of 125 participants from two community mental health centers in Spain were recruited. RESULTS: More than half of the participants (58.4%) were active smokers. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 60%. A total of 16.8% received previous treatment for hypertension, 17.6% for hypertriglyceridemia, and 11.2% for diabetes. No differences were found between centers (22.7% vs. 18.7%, p = .9). CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the importance of monitoring the physical health of patients on antipsychotic therapy. The identification and management of cardiovascular and metabolic risks factors is an essential part of nursing care for people with severe mental illness. Mental health nurses are ideally positioned to carry out this task by performing physical health screening, health education, and lifestyle interventions.","236":"BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 7% of children, with consequences lasting into adulthood for an indeterminate number of people. Children with ADHD need special interventions that start with effective parenting. Yet parent-education programs are often inappropriate for low-income or single-parent families who lack transportation, availability, or resources to attend. AIMS: We evaluated a remotely administered, 6-week, Six-step Parenting Program (SsPP) at two community health centers in Trenton, New Jersey. METHODS: Eight low-income, single-parent families were selected for participation. The parent\/teacher rating scale of ADHD symptoms (SNAP-IV [Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV questionnaire]) was administered pre- and post-application. RESULTS: Six out of 8 (75%) participating parents\/guardians perceived improvements in children's symptoms. Completion of SsPP resulted in reduced SNAP-IV values by an average of 12.4% (n = 8), with improvements in 16 of 18 variables. CONCLUSIONS: The remotely administered SsPP may hold promise for parents unable to attend training and deserves further consideration and evaluation.","237":"INTRODUCTION: Programs for assertive community treatment (PACT) serve persons with severe mental illness who have been unsuccessful with traditional outpatient services. Many PACT clients struggle to obtain symptom relief with medications that often have poor efficacy and undesired side effects, which can result in nonadherence, relapse, and increased health care utilization with associated costs. AIMS: This quality improvement project aimed to improve client and PACT program outcomes by incorporating pharmacogenomic testing into the psychopharmacological decision-making process. METHODS: The project used a pre-posttest design with each client serving as their own control to evaluate changes in clients' symptoms and program outcomes resulting from pharmacogenomics-guided medication management. RESULTS: Following project implementation, clients' symptoms were decreased and both engagement in care and stability in the community increased. Psychiatric hospitalizations and associated costs decreased. CONCLUSIONS: This project suggests utility for using pharmacogenomics testing to personalize care for persons with severe mental illness.","238":"OBJECTIVE: This practice improvement project evaluated the cost of health care services utilized by patients with comorbid mental and physical chronic conditions who were psychiatrically hospitalized but transported for health care services of physical symptoms that developed during their psychiatric hospitalization. METHOD: A retrospective review of invoices to a regional psychiatric hospital for non-psychiatric health services utilized by inpatients revealed high costs of emergency room (ER) visits from July 2016 to June 2017. Medical records for these seriously mentally ill inpatients who visited the ER for evaluation of sudden emergent physical symptoms were reviewed. The collected data were analyzed. RESULTS: ER invoices revealed that 41 visits had been made by 28 patients with a total cost of $308,466.67, of which $258,668.15 was judged to be for the treatment of patients with symptoms of preventable side effect syndromes. This chart review and analysis suggest a need for improved strategic medication management in an integrated model of care. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy was found to be responsible for increased debilitating physical symptoms requiring ER visits for this seriously mentally ill, medically fragile population. An integration of care services for comorbid conditions by advanced practice registered nurses with protocols specifically designed for this population was recommended.","239":"BACKGROUND: There is an increased need for mental health providers to be more attuned to behavioral health needs of racial\/ethnic\/cultural minorities and the role of social milieus. AIMS: We prioritized training and assessing racial\/ethnic and cultural sensitivity among psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students throughout coursework, clinical practice, and experiences in underserved settings. METHOD: Prior to beginning clinical coursework, students completed a course on culturally competent care where we measured their (n = 26) perception of their ability to be racially\/ethnically sensitive providers at the beginning and end of the semester, demonstrating significant improvement. During clinical coursework, preceptors measured students' racially\/ethnically and culturally sensitive clinical behaviors with patients. RESULTS: Sensitivity of students in clinical training significantly improved over a semester of clinical supervision. Our results indicated that placements in underserved settings improved students' racial\/ethnic\/cultural sensitivity but only among advanced students. At final evaluation, advanced students in underserved settings self-reported significantly higher racial\/ethnic and cultural sensitivity than students not in an underserved setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that we can produce more racially\/ethnically and culturally sensitivity providers through coursework, supervised clinical practice, and experiences in underserved settings. These data are preliminary, and we plan to follow up these results and replicate this work with other cohorts in future semesters.","240":null,"241":"BACKGROUND: Alcohol and\/or opioid stigma perceptions are barriers to screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) implementation. AIM: To examine SBIRT education and clinical exposure efficacy at decreasing nursing students' stigma perceptions toward caring for patients affected by alcohol and\/or opioid use problems. METHOD: A single-sample, pretest-posttest design with N = 124 nursing students. The students had a 1.5-hour SBIRT education session and a 12-week clinical experience with some patients who had alcohol and\/or opioid use problems. RESULTS: The participants' stigma perceptions improved toward patients who had alcohol and\/or opioid use problems. CONCLUSIONS: SBIRT education and clinical exposure may provide a basis for promoting understanding of alcohol and\/or opioid use-related stigma and can be used as an intervention to decrease some of stigma's negative effects.","242":"BACKGROUND: Members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community suffer from disproportionate rates of physical and mental illness. This population experiences enhanced vulnerability to illness as a result of societal marginalization, known as minority stress, which is compounded by insufficient LGBT education for health care professionals and stigmatizing experiences within medical institutions. AIMS: The aims of this study were to review the literature on LGBT cultural competence interventions; evaluate the effect of a 4-hour pilot workshop, \"Converging Cultures,\" on the development of cultural competence; and make recommendations for best practices in developing LGBT cultural competence among health care providers. METHOD: The study used a repeated-measures pre-\/posttest design among a sample of 130 hospital employees and undergraduate nursing students. The GAP (Gay Affirmative Practice scale) scale, a measure of LGBT-affirmative practice beliefs, and an objective Knowledge Quiz were administered before and directly following the training. The posttest included three open-ended questions to elicit self-reflection and capture the development of cultural competence according to Campinha-Bacote's theory, the process of cultural competence in the delivery of healthcare services. RESULTS: Paired sample t tests revealed significant improvement on the GAP and Knowledge Quiz. Open-ended responses reflected the five constructs of Campinha-Bacote's theory. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reflection is an essential component of LGBT cultural competence education to uncover personal biases that affect clinical behavior. Future educational efforts for sexual and gender minorities should strive to avoid inadvertent marginalization of LGBT people through integration of concepts with existing curricula and workplace training.","243":null,"244":"","245":"","246":"BACKGROUND: The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic. Better approaches to encourage outpatient utilization of Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder, including extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), are needed. Withdrawal management before initiation of XR-NTX is challenging for clinicians and patients and represents a major barrier to treatment. AIMS: To review psychoeducational strategies that support patients during outpatient withdrawal management and transition to XR-NTX. METHOD: We reviewed the literature on psychoeducational strategies used during opioid withdrawal management and described the role that nurses can play in facilitating transition to XR-NTX in a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, outpatient trial comparing induction regimens. RESULTS: Supportive interventions include general psychoeducation on addiction, overcoming ambivalence, treatment adherence, anticipating XR-NTX induction, managing psychological and physiological aspects of opioid withdrawal, risks of opioid use, and sources of support during recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Psychoeducational strategies led by nurses can promote treatment adherence during withdrawal management and induction onto XR-NTX.","247":"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to identify methods used to decrease the application of physical restraints in acute inpatient psychiatric hospitals. METHOD: A literature search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines using key words related to physical restraint. RESULTS: Three data-based studies met eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that multimodal intervention strategies may reduce the number of hours of physical restraint used in inpatient psychiatric settings, but quality evidence to support specific strategies is lacking. The search highlights the need for more quality research using standardized restraint reporting measures.","248":"BACKGROUND: The aggression of hospital patients costs money and affects outcomes. Most methods to assess risk for aggression are developed for adults. This study recommends the use of a predictive tool, the Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression-Youth Version (DASA-YV) to improve accuracy in identifying aggression risk in youth. AIMS: To determine if aggressive behavior of youth is better predicted with DASA-YV versus instinct. We sought to validate the feasibility of DASA-YV and determine its predictive validity for aggressive behavior in a youth-specific psychiatric hospital population, which could lead to prevention of aggression and improve interventions or outcomes. METHOD: After establishing interrater reliability of the DASA-YV, a 6-month pilot study with a prospective validation design compared aggressive behavior outcomes predicted with those that occurred within the next 24 hours. RESULTS: DASA-YV was found to be reliable and valid in predicting aggression in a youth population. CONCLUSIONS: Predicting aggression with the DASA-YV tool demonstrates a useful best practice application for psychiatric nurses that positively affects safety.","249":"Promising treatment avenues have been developed and studied that align well with the skills of psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nurses. The treatments are relationship-driven, nimble and accessible, and recovery-guided. They emphasize a whole-person approach with care delivered by a team of experts working in a contextually coordinated way. To describe the challenges facing the United States with regard to mental illness and substance use disorders and the ways in which PMH nurses can use their skills to mitigate these challenges. Published research and government reports were reviewed to obtain current mental health and substance use data. The number of people not being treated for mental illnesses-particularly serious mental illness, major depressive episode, and suicidal thoughts-has not improved since 2009. Although inroads have been made in reducing the rate of smoking in the United States, we are facing an opioid crisis. There are limited data on marijuana use, but it is apparent that many Americans use cannabis routinely. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, approximately 44.7 million people need mental health treatment and 20.1 million Americans need substance use treatment, but only 10% to 30% receive it. PMH nurses must take a leading role in retooling the therapeutic relationship and partnering with clients, families, and caregivers to improve the quality of life and well-being of those dealing with mental illness and substance use disorders. To accomplish this essential task, the PMH nursing workforce must be robust and distributed throughout the United States. ","250":"","251":"INTRODUCTION: There is a national agenda in the United States for the establishment and implementation of an evidence-based recovery model of care in patients with psychiatric illness. Recovery principles include self-direction, individualization\/patient-centered, empowerment, holistic, nonlinear, strengths-based, peer support, respect, responsibility, and hope. Recovery education has shown to improve patients' quality of life, decrease readmission rates, and increase nursing knowledge of the recovery process in acute psychiatric care settings. Providers, patients, and governmental agencies have supported this agenda to assist psychiatric patients to remain in the community, reduce readmission rates, and improve health outcomes. AIMS: This quality improvement project aims to reduce 30-day readmissions, assess recovery knowledge of nurses, and evaluate patients' perceived quality of life. METHOD: The quality improvement project featured a pre-post survey design with a convenience sample of nurses and patients across acute two adult inpatient units. Nurses facilitated recovery groups. Comparisons were made pre\/post implementation on nursing knowledge and readmission rates. Evaluation of patients' perceived quality of life was made postimplementation. RESULTS: Readmission was 5% in the recovery group. Nurse recovery knowledge increased (M = 2.97, SD = 0.35; M = 3.40, SD = 0.21). Significant correlations were noted with patients' quality of life measures and patient demographic data (p &lt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: Recovery education provided the opportunity for nurses to gain knowledge and for psychiatrically ill patients to obtain patient-centered care that guided the recovery process, improved their quality of life, and decreased readmission within 30 days of discharge.","252":"BACKGROUND: This article summarizes the experiences that a Midwest college of nursing had when telepsychiatry was introduced for psychiatric-mental health post-master's nurse practitioner students to use in a clinical internship. AIMS: Implications for nurse practitioner educators will be identified, and recommendations for future research will be explored. METHOD: Described are the following: (1) policies and procedures the institution considered, (2) challenges that were encountered by faculty and students, and (3) strategies and limitations of these strategies defining best practice, what didactic content should be taught, and how clinical placements needed to be structured. RESULTS: Implications for nurse practitioner educators, practice, and research are identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that telepsychiatry has an important role in the clinical education of psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners. It is working well as a clinical internship option. The college of nursing is continuing to examine and address issues and is looking forward to enhancing the telepsychiatry experiences for students in the future.","253":"","254":"","255":"The loss of a loved one, especially by a caregiver, can be stressful. Grief can affect one emotionally, mentally, behaviorally, spiritually, and physically and affects individuals differently. Complicated grief (CG), especially for a caregiver, can be intense, prolonged, and interfere with normal activities accompanied by destructive thoughts and behaviors. To synthesize the available research on persons experiencing CG and the effect on cortisol levels. A literature search for articles published on CG and cortisol was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. Search terms included CG, cortisol, and their variants. No date limitations were applied. In accordance with PRISMA, articles were sorted and evaluated against specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 18 articles, of which 5 were included in the review. Cortisol levels and diurnal patterns are shown to be affected in individuals experiencing CG. With prolonged bereavement and dysregulated cortisol, physical and mental health outcomes may result warranting a need for effective stress reduction therapies for this population. ","256":"Nurse residency programs (NRPs) provide new graduate nurses (NGNs) with social support and experiential activities as a formal transition to clinical practice. The study was conducted to answer the question: What is the effectiveness of an NRP in retaining NGNs in a psychiatric-mental health setting? This study used a quantitative time-sequenced comparative study of multiple cohorts of NGNs hired into an NRP at a freestanding hospital in California. The study yielded a turnover rate of 11.7% in Year 1 (88.3% retention) and 2.9% in Year 2 (97.1% retention rate), which are lower than reported turnover rates (17.5% and 33.5%, respectively). Significant correlations are described in the workplace domains of knowledge and skills, social support, organizational citizenship behavior, civility, coping self-efficacy, organizational and occupational commitment, person-organizational fit, and burnout. NRPs are effective in attracting and retaining competent, confident NGNs in psychiatric-mental health nursing. ","257":"INTRODUCTION: There is considerable need for effective and accessible treatment for opioid use disorder. AIMS: Our study explored differences in buprenorphine treatment retention and duration, with a focus on selected sociodemographic factors and treatment indicators, in two different settings: an office-based buprenorphine induction and stabilization clinic (OBIC) and a community-based primary care clinic (CPC). METHOD: This nonexperimental retrospective chart review compared demographic information and buprenorphine treatment details, including treatment retention and duration. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in buprenorphine treatment indicators between the OBIC and CPC groups, with two exceptions: the number of written buprenorphine prescriptions was significantly greater for the OBIC group, as was the number of filled buprenorphine prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Given similar treatment retention and duration in two different buprenorphine treatment settings, our findings suggest that access to buprenorphine treatment in standard integrated care settings can be supplemented by novel treatment structures such as the OBIC in order to increase access to care during the current opioid epidemic.","258":"BACKGROUND: Despite the use of weight management programs among veterans, the impact of mental health diagnoses on weight reduction goal achievement is unknown. AIMS: We aimed to describe the prevalence and association of mental health diagnoses with a 5% weight reduction goal achievement. METHODS: Logistic regression was used to describe the association between mental health diagnoses and weight reduction goal achievement at 6, 12, and 24 months among 402 veterans enrolled in a weight management program. RESULTS: More than 43% of veterans had a mental health diagnoses, with depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders being the most prevalent. At all three times, simply having a mental health diagnosis was not associated with weight reduction goal achievement. Specific diagnoses were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving weight reduction goals at 12 months (PTSD and Drug Use Disorder) and 24 months (Anxiety Disorder and Other Mental Health Diagnosis). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that unhealthy weight is quite common for individuals with mental health diagnoses; however, weight reduction goal achievement may be equally likely for those with and without mental health diagnoses. The prevalence of mental health diagnoses among veterans seeking weight reduction suggests that psychiatric nurses should be aware of this common comorbidity.","259":"BACKGROUND: The cultural and social background of the individual would seem to be important factors that can affect recovery from major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, there is little information on the process of recovery from MDD in Middle Eastern countries, such as Iran. AIMS: This study was conducted to explore the process of recovery from MDD in Iran. METHOD: A grounded theory approach by Corbin and Strauss was used to explore recovery from MDD. Twenty patients were recruited using purposive and theoretical sampling methods. RESULTS: Several themes emerged from the data, the primary of which was \"Attempting to restore integrity of the self,\" which included the two subthemes of \"Attempting to restore health,\" and \"Attempting to reacquire the lost abilities.\" Various contextual factors also affected recovery, including poverty, inefficient health care systems, perceived support, feelings of failure, and social stigma. During the recovery process, participants adopted both \"effective strategies\" and \"ineffective strategies.\" Following the attempt to restore integrity, participants experienced different levels of integrity, ranging from \"complete recovery\" to \"no recovery\/relapse.\" CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study contribute to the body of knowledge regarding recovery from MDD in Iran. The data suggest that recovery from depressive disorder is a very personal experience that is affected by different and variable factors and conditions. However, the attempt to restore integrity of the self can result in achieving a higher level of performance and health.","260":"","261":"","262":"","263":"BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression (PD) screening has been defined for decades, but treatment remains ill-defined, with few mental health (MH) providers helping depressed women during this delicate time. The nurse practitioner (NP) is in a position to help women through PD with the use of a collaborative treatment model. AIMS: This DNP (doctor of nursing practice) inquiry investigated a stepped collaborative care model (CCM) to see whether the PD model improved time from referral to evaluation and decreased depression scores over a 6-month treatment period for women who came to an NP MH practice. METHOD: After obtaining approval from the institutional review board and the clients, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was administered to 37 women at psychiatric evaluation and subsequent MH visits over a 6-month period. Time from referral to evaluation and depression scores were analyzed. RESULTS: The CCM met the goal of 30 days from referral to evaluation. Prenatal clients had a statistically significant decrease in depression scores, and postpartum client scores were clinically significant. CONCLUSION: A CCM among care providers facilitates prompt intake to treatment time within 1 month of identification of depression, and a decrease in depression scores in women measured by sequential depression screen scores. The study may provide ideas for evidence-based NP practice by use of the model to treat depression in this group of women.","264":"INTRODUCTION: The current de-escalation program utilized in this organization was not adequately meeting the needs of all the pediatric populations served. AIMS: Identify a de-escalation program, which is evidenced-based and able to be effective across all sizes and ages of patients served at this organization. METHOD: The work described in this article displays the thorough systematic process used to select a new behavioral health crisis prevention\/de-escalation training program within a large children's hospital. RESULTS: Fourteen de-escalation programs were initially identified, nine of them were further analyzed based on curriculum, cost, training requirements, emphasis on verbal de-escalation, ability to address needs of those with Autism Spectrum Disorders, and overall fit for this organization. One final program was selected for implementation after a robust selection process. CONCLUSIONS: The team used a comprehensive approach during program selection to attempt to decrease or limit potential resistance to change from affected employees.","265":"BACKGROUND: Mental illness is a serious health problem. Understanding the views of different communities toward patients with mental illness is important in understanding how communities deal with these patients. AIM: To investigate Saudi adults' knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to interact with patients with mental illness. METHOD: The study followed a quantitative approach, a descriptive correlation design. RESULTS: The study results indicate that while participants had knowledge and positive attitudes toward certain aspects, they had negative knowledge and attitudes regarding other aspects. Most participants (61.1%) mentioned that the cause of mental illness is biological, 61.9% stated that medication is a useful way to treat patients with mental illness, and 90% believed that patients with mental illness deserve respect. Furthermore, 35.8% of participants believed that patients with mental illness had a tendency toward dangerous and aggressive behavior, whereas 33.2% believed that the community is safer if patients with mental illness are kept in hospitals. There was a positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes toward patients with mental illness (r = .305, p &lt; .01). On the other hand, the study found that there is a statistically significant and negative correlation among adults' attitudes and their readiness to interact with patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study will ideally encourage stakeholders to design and initiate an educational strategic program at the community level in order to improve community members' awareness and attitudes and enhance their readiness to interact with patients with mental illness.","266":"","267":"","268":"","269":"BACKGROUND: Workplace violence is a major public health concern. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 2002 to 2013, incidents of serious workplace violence (those requiring days off) were four times more common in health care than in private industry. AIMS: An interprofessional committee developed, implemented, and evaluated a quality improvement project from 2012 to 2016 to reduce workplace violence and prevent staff injury. The initiative termed S.A.F.E. Response stands for Spot a threat, Assess the risk, Formulate a safe response, Evaluate the outcome. METHOD: An institutional review board-approved quality improvement survey was implemented and evaluated. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. An interprofessional committee developed and implemented a comprehensive program to prevent injury, which included (a) a mandatory eLearning educational training, (b) a S.A.F.E. Response with standardized interventions for the clinical conditions affecting safety, and (c) a clinical debriefing process. A reduction in nursing staff assault incidence rates was identified as a success. RESULTS: Nursing staff injury rates decreased an average of 40%. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in nursing staff assault incidence rates was notable. Clinicians equipped with knowledge, skills, and resources can identify and defuse unsafe situations to prevent violence. This clinical approach shifts the focus from crisis intervention to crisis prevention, which reduces injury.","270":"The Freedom Commission's recommendations, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's framework, and policy directives on recovery-oriented services have fueled the recovery transformation. Mental health recovery services have been implemented in a broad range of outpatient settings. However, psychiatric inpatient units remained embedded in the traditional model of care. The purpose of this article is to describe an ongoing quality improvement implementation of recovery services in a Veterans Health Administration acute psychiatric inpatient unit. An interprofessional Partnership for Wellness delivered 4 to 6 hours per day of evidence-based recovery and holistic population-specific health programs. Veteran, system, and program indicators were measured. Preliminary indicators over a 2-year period suggest that Veterans rated group content and relevance high, pre-post psychiatric rehospitalization rates decreased by 46%, and fidelity to recommended strategies was high. The project success reflects strong leadership, a partnership of committed staff, effective training, and an organizational culture exemplifying excellence in Veteran services and innovation. ","271":"Up to 40% of patients with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed, usually with major depression disorder. The purpose was to describe the current state of the science of the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, with the ultimate goal of improving psychiatric diagnostic workups including screening. An integrative review was conducted using standard criteria for evaluating research articles. Forty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Articles explored patient-related and health care provider-related factors contributing to the misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder as well as consequences of misdiagnosis. Clinically oriented, reliable, and valid screening tools for bipolar disorder also were reviewed. Awareness of multiple, challenging patient-related factors and more comprehensive assessment and screening by health care providers may reduce misdiagnosis. ","272":"The lifespan effects of adverse childhood experiences and their complex posttraumatic sequelae include early physical morbidity and mortality. Attention to physical sequelae and recovery is gaining clinical and research momentum. However, patient-centered communication in health care is hampered by lack of a common concept and word for a positive subjective, embodied outcome of trauma recovery. To address this gap in theory, research, and practice vocabulary. We applied the six-step concept identification method described by Morse. The concept we identified is distinct from the trauma-reactive states of \"fight or flight\" and \"freeze or faint.\" We call it \"flow.\" Further deductive or inductive work to validate the concept would be useful as a step toward instrument development, followed by validation of its utility as a self-report proxy endpoint for patient centered health outcomes research. Qualitative research could be useful to elucidate the process of attaining \"posttraumatic flow.\" ","273":"College is a time of major transition in the lives of many young adults. Roughly 30% of college students have reported that anxiety and depressive symptoms negatively affect their lives and academic functioning. Currently, anxiety has surpassed depression as the reason college students seek help at counseling centers. Unfortunately, only one third of students receive treatment for anxiety and only 25% of students receive treatment for their depression. The objectives of this pilot project were to (a) assess levels of depression and anxiety in identified \"at risk\" college students who present to the college Student Health Services (Primary Care), (b) implement a new cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention titled \"Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment\" (COPE), and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on students' levels of depression and anxiety as well as satisfaction with the intervention. A one group pre- and post-test design was used. Students who received COPE demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. COPE is an effective brief program for reducing depression and anxiety in college-age youth. Implementation of evidenced-based programs into the college experience could lead to less severe depression and anxiety and better academic performance, ultimately increasing the likelihood of students successfully completing their academic programs. ","274":"BACKGROUND: Leading scholars have called on nursing schools to pay more attention to smoking cessation in the education of nursing students. AIM: This article argues that attention to this subject should include a rethinking of the behavior-change framework that forms the methodological basis of this field. METHOD: Drawing on classic and contemporary work in sociology, anthropology, and critical public health, this article explores the specific example of smoking in long-term inpatient units to illustrate the limitations of a behavior-based ontology and suggest an alternative conceptual vocabulary. RESULTS: An alternative approach posits smoking as a social practice. It sheds light on situational factors that incentivize smoking and might be contributing to patient resistance to cessation. CONCLUSIONS: A different conceptual framing of smoking can point to interventions beyond the level of individuals, focusing instead on the broader interface between people and situations, where decisions and desires meet institutional and organizational dynamics and structures of opportunity and access.","275":"Further exploration of the practice roles of psychiatric mental health (PMH) advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) is warranted. In March of 2016, the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) conducted a national survey to gather data on the demographics, practice roles, and activities of certified PMH APRNs. The e-mail survey contained 46 questions consistent with minimum data set requirements of the Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers. The data indicate that PMH APRNs are a clinically active workforce; the majority deliver a wide variety of mental health services including diagnosis and management of both acute and chronic mental illness, prescribing, and providing psychotherapy. PMH APRNs are delivering care to clients dealing with a range of serious mental illnesses across the life span in a variety of roles. It will be critical to monitor the activities and outcomes of this expanding behavioral health care workforce.

Many studies found that cultural stressors contribute to this disparity, but these findings have not been integrated into a cohesive picture of the specific cultural stressors that contribute to the development of depressive symptoms for Latino\/a adolescents. The purpose of this integrative review is to identify cultural stressors that are associated with depressive symptoms in Latino\/a adolescents. Procedures outlined by Ganong were used to conduct the review. The results of 33 articles that met inclusion criteria were synthesized. Discrimination, family culture conflict, acculturative and bicultural stress, intragroup rejection, immigration stress, and context of reception were identified as cultural stressors that are associated with depressive symptoms in Latino\/a adolescents. Clinicians should employ strategies to help Latino\/a youth cope with cultural stressors and advocate for policies that support the mental health of Latino\/a youth. ","277":"The needs of people with schizophrenia are great, and having extensive knowledge of this patient group is crucial for providing the right support. The aim of this study was to investigate, over 4 years, the importance of repeated assessments by patients with schizophrenia and by professionals. Data were collected from evidence-based assessment scales, interviews, and visual self-assessment scales. The data processing used descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analyses. The results showed that the relationships between several of the patients' self-rating assessments were stronger at the 4-year follow-up than at baseline. In parallel, the concordance rate between patient assessments and case manager assessments increased. The conclusions drawn are that through repeated assessments the patients' ability to assess their own situation improved over time and that case managers became better at understanding their patients' situation. This, in turn, provides a safer basis for assessments and further treatment interventions, which may lead to more patients achieving remission, which can lead to less risk for hospitalization and too early death.","278":"National health priorities identify adolescent sexual-risk behavior outcomes as research and intervention targets for mental health. Reduce sexual-risk behavioral outcomes by applying self-determination theory to focus on decision-making autonomy. This study examined late adolescents' recollections of parental autonomy support\/sexual-risk communication experiences and autonomy motivation as predictors of sexual-risk behaviors\/knowledge. A convenience sample ( N = 249) of 19- and 20-year-old university students completed self-report questionnaires. Structural equation modeling with latent variables examined direct\/indirect effects in the hypothesized model. Parents contributed uniquely through sexual-risk communication and\/or autonomy support to late adolescents' autonomous motivation. The final model evidenced acceptable fit and explained 12% of the variation in adolescent sexual-risk behavior, 7% in adolescent autonomous motivation, and 2% in adolescent sexual-risk knowledge. Psychiatric mental health nurses should conduct further research and design interventions promoting parent autonomy support and adolescent autonomous motivation to reduce sexual risk-behavior and increase sexual-risk knowledge. ","279":"The influence of the physical environment on patient falls has not been fully explored in psychiatric units, despite this patient population's vulnerability and the critical role of the physical environment in patient safety. The research objective is to describe the spatial and temporal pattern of falls occurrences and their location in relation to the levels of safety continuum model. This article presents an exploratory case study design. Seven years of retrospective data on patient falls, yielding 818 sentinel events, in an 81-bed psychiatric hospital in the United States were collected and analyzed. Data focused on extrinsic factors for falls, emphasizing the physical environment. Through a content analysis of the sentinel event narratives, recorded by the hospital staff, this study explored patient falls related to location and elements of the physical environment. The analysis revealed that 15% of recorded falls were attributed to some aspect of or element within the physical environment. The most typical locations of falls were patient rooms (39%), patient bathrooms (22%), and dayrooms (20%). Also, the results identified patterns of environmental factors that appeared linked to increasing patients' susceptibility to falls. Risk factors included poor nighttime lighting, flooring surfaces that were uneven, and spaces that inadvertently limited visual access and supervision. The physical environment plays an often-unexamined role in fall events and specific locations. These results are deserving of further research on design strategies and applications to reduce patient falls in psychiatric hospital settings.

To look at the feasibility of using emoticon as a screening and assessment tool for depression in the elderly. Cross-sectional study. A total of 77 elderly patients completed the study from June 2014 to August 2015 in a general geriatric outpatient clinic of an acute care hospital in Singapore. Patients rated their mood using an emoticon scale, which ranges from 1 ( most happy face) to 7 ( most sad face). Depression was assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity for depression were calculated for the cutoff scores from 1 to 7 on the emoticon scale. The sensitivity percentages were low across all cutoff scores. The specificity was more than 90% for the cutoff score of 5 and above on the emoticon scale. However, all the patients who had depression diagnosed using the DSM-IV criteria did not have emoticon scores of 5 and above. The emoticon scale was easy to use, but its effectiveness in the screening of depression in the elderly needs to be explored further. The inability to use the emoticon scale as a tool may be the lack of measurements in the other domains of the DSM-IV criteria (sleep, energy, appetite, etc.), rather than failure of the emoticon scale to assess mood.

About 50% of people with SMI become nonadherent to treatment in the first month following discharge from the hospital. This study examined literature in the past decade (2006-2016) on the use of mobile phone contacts in individuals with SMI to improve medication adherence post hospital discharge. This integrative review used the search terms texting, text messaging, SMS, cell\/mobile phone, medication adherence, medication compliance, and mental illness. Databases (CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus) and manual searching of reference lists were done. The main inclusion criteria were the use of mobile phone contacts on medication adherence in individuals with SMI. Adults 18 years and older, studies conducted from 2006 to 2016, and studies conducted in English were also criteria for inclusion. Only five studies met criteria for inclusion. Outcomes from the review showed that mobile phone contacts have been used to improve medication adherence in individuals with SMI and able to provide the four types of social support (instrumental, informational, emotional, and, appraisal). When phone contacts especially text messaging was used as an adjunct to other interventions, it yielded better medication adherence than when used alone. However, results on medication adherence rates were mixed in participants on both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications. Although mobile phone contacts are a promising tool to enhance medication adherence after hospital discharge, its effectiveness to increase medication adherence in this population remains inconclusive.

This article aims to provide a description of informal caregivers' learning experiences in self-management support of BD in order to guide professionals in tailoring future psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions. In-depth open interviews with 10 informal caregivers of patients with BD who followed treatment in the context of specialized outpatient bipolar care were conducted. Four learning phases emerged from the phenomenological analysis describing the informal caregivers learning process: (1) understanding BD, (2) overcoming the dilemmas in self-management support for individuals living with BD, (3) dividing tasks and responsibilities, and (4) acquiring a personal definition of self-management support for individuals living with BD. By grasping the concept of BD, informal caregivers gradually learn how to overcome dilemmas resulting from living with someone with BD, and how to control the expression of emotions. They learn to reflect on the nature of conflicts and how to share the responsibilities of illness management with individuals living with BD and professionals. Mastering these skills eventually allows them to define and delimit their supporting informal caregiver role in the self-management of BD.

Assess the acceptance and feasibility of rocking chair therapy as a self-implemented intervention for mood and substance cravings. For homeless Veterans in SUD treatment, how does adding vestibular stimulation by use of a rocking chair compared with treatment as usual affect levels of anxiety and substance cravings? Two significant findings were observed. First, a greater number of minutes spent rocking was associated with significantly greater scores on the Expectancy scale of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ; p = .05), suggesting participants experiencing higher urges and desires to drink rocked to self-soothe. Second, a significant association was observed between a greater number of minutes spent rocking and lower scores on the ACQ Purposefulness subscale ( p = .03), indicating greater time rocking was associated with fewer urges and desires that are connected with the intent and plan to drink. Vestibular stimulation by rocking in a rocking chair may increase the ability to self-regulate mood and substance cravings, thereby potentially reducing risk of relapse and recurrent chronic homelessness.

The purpose of this article is to present TRM and current literature on the neuroscience of trauma and resiliency, and the rationale for body-based therapy. Two case examples illustrate the practical use of TRM therapy. The literature on the neuroscience of trauma, resiliency, and somatic approaches in therapy is reviewed. TRM teaches the biology of trauma responses and the practice of emotion regulation through biologically based skills. Neuroscience theory supports somatic awareness models; however, research on somatic therapies is limited. Chronic distress from trauma derails the ability to live life resiliently. TRM addresses trauma processing in a gentle and invitational manner and is a novel departure from existing therapies.

It is important to develop and test new approaches to prevent and mitigate the effects of trauma in military personnel. One such area of research is focused on psychological resilience to prevent the sequelae of trauma. This article examines empirical research of resilience training in military personnel and discusses the potential applicability of such training in this population. In this literature review, four randomized control trials and one retrospective, parallel group study were reviewed. Each intervention had the goal of mitigating behavioral health issues after trauma exposure. The results of the various interventions were wide-ranging from no measurable difference in treatment groups to significant differences in outcomes. Despite the inconclusive results of our review, we have determined that resilience training for active duty service members to help prevent the deleterious effects of trauma on mental health is a compelling and necessary avenue for further research.

Nursing cost, occupancy, discharge volume, unit closures, observer expense, and incremental nursing costs were tracked. Staff satisfaction and reported patient behavioral\/safety events were assessed. The pilot initiatives ran for 8 months. Unit\/bed closures fell to zero on both units. Occupancy, patient days, and discharges increased. Incremental nursing cost was offset by reduction in observer expense and by revenue from increases in occupancy and patient days. Staff work satisfaction improved and measures of patient safety were unchanged. The intervention was effective in reducing observation expense and improved occupancy and patient days while maintaining patient safety, representing a cost-effective and safe approach for management of acuity on inpatient psychiatric units. ","329":"Primary health care professionals are in an excellent position to identify, screen, and conduct brief interventions for patients with mental health and substance use disorders. However, discomfort in initiating conversations about behavioral health, time concerns, lack of knowledge about screening tools, and treatment resources are barriers. This study examines the impact of an online simulation where users practice role-playing with emotionally responsive virtual patients to learn motivational interviewing strategies to better manage screening, brief interventions, and referral conversations. Baseline data were collected from 227 participants who were then randomly assigned into the treatment or wait-list control groups. Treatment group participants then completed the simulation, postsimulation survey, and 3-month follow-up survey. Results showed significant increases in knowledge\/skill to identify and engage in collaborative decision making with patients. Results strongly suggest that role-play simulation experiences can be an effective means of teaching screening and brief intervention.

However, there is little data to guide protocols and procedures regarding weight assessment. To describe institutional practices regarding weight assessment of individuals during acute illness of AN. Treatment facilities ( N = 24) completed a survey about written protocols and procedures regarding weight assessment and disclosure of weight to patients. The majority of facilities ( n = 22; 92%) have written protocols for weight assessment. Weight assessments occurred mostly in the morning ( n = 23; 95.8%), in hospital gowns ( n = 21; 87.5%), and after voiding ( n = 14; 58.3%). Respondents described mixed practices for disclosing weight to patients. Results indicate widespread variability in weight assessment and disclosure of weight. Further research is necessary to help develop evidence-based guidelines about weighing practices during acute illness for individuals with AN.

There are currently no standard educational guidelines to prepare psychiatric mental health advanced practice nurses (PMH-APRNs) in TMH delivery. To survey practicing PMH-APRNs across the United States about their experiences and attitudes about use of TMH. Eighty-three participants from the American Psychiatric Nurses Association online discussion board completed a nine-item survey. Length of time practicing as a PMH-APRN, TMH use in practice, populations served, and TMH background. A majority had been practicing as a PMH-APRN for less than a decade and had used TMH, although most reported no prior education or training in this delivery method. Participants did indicate a desire for TMH education. This survey affirms the prevalence of TMH use among PMH-APRN providers, lack of formal training, and necessity for standardized educational guidelines in TMH delivery.

Department of Defense Directive 1304.26 \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" created a barrier for service members to speak candidly with their health care providers, which left specific health care needs unaddressed. There are no standardized cultural education programs to assist Military Health System (MHS) health care providers in delivering care to LGBT patients and their beneficiaries. The purpose of this project was to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an LGBT educational program for health care providers within the MHS to increase cultural awareness in caring for this special population. This multisite educational program was conducted at Travis Air Force Base and Joint Base Lewis-McChord from November 15, 2014, to January 30, 2015. A 15-question multiple-choice questionnaire was developed based on the education program and was administered before and after the education program. A total of 51 individuals completed the program. Overall posttest scores improved compared to pretest scores. This program was designed to begin the process of educating health care providers about the unique health care issues of military LGBT Service Members and their beneficiaries. This program was the first to address the disparities in LGBT health care needs within the Department of Defense. It also provided a platform for facilitating open communication among providers regarding LGBT population health needs in the military. ","336":"Simulations using standardized patients (SPs) are increasingly used to teach and assess competencies in psychiatric\/mental health (PMH) nursing education. To advance the field, it is important to identify current knowledge, practice, and evidence. To determine the current knowledge, evidence, and practice of using SPs in PMH nursing education by conducting an integrative review of the empirical research on the use of SPs in PMH nursing education, and by providing a supplementary descriptive review of non-research articles on PMH simulations using SPs. A comprehensive search using electronic databases was conducted to identify both research and simulation description papers meeting inclusion criteria. The research literature was reviewed using an integrative review approach and a simple descriptive review of the non-research simulation literature was also conducted. Six research studies and 18 simulation description articles were included in the review. Although there are several PMH SP simulation descriptions in the literature, and anecdotal indications that they are a valuable educational tool, there is insufficient research evidence regarding their effectiveness as a method in psychiatric nursing education due to few published studies and methodological limitations of existing studies. Well-designed research studies are needed to develop an evidence base for this promising and increasingly employed teaching method. ","337":"Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric illness with limited evidenced-based treatment options. Mindfulness appears useful in many conditions, but few studies focus on its use in individuals with anorexia nervosa. To examine and summarize studies of mindfulness in individuals with anorexia nervosa and identify areas for future research. An integrated review was conducted by searching health care computerized databases. Results were mixed among the eight studies that met inclusion criteria. Multimodal mindfulness-based therapies appear effective, while brief interventions may be equally useful or result in greater anxiety compared to distraction. Qualitative data support that some participants feel mindfulness is challenging but beneficial. Mindfulness as a concurrent part of therapy and\/or when routinely practiced may be more clinically useful than single-episode mindful eating interventions. Due to the complexity of the concept of mindfulness and limited existing data, additional research is needed. ","338":"The sexual abuse phenomenon is considered taboo. It has been discussed, to date, mainly in relation to children and young women, with insufficient attention to sexual abuse in a late-life context. The aim of this survey was to explore professionals' awareness of elder sexual abuse (ESA). The survey was conducted among 161 Jewish and Arab professionals from health care and social services, who worked with older adults in Israel. Of the entire sample, 70 professionals (only 43%) reported encountering at least one to three cases of ESA. A total of 98% of the victims were women, and the primary offender was the spouse (75%). In most cases (70%), the victim reported the abuse, which was mainly sexual assault (64%). All participants (100%) noted taking action. This exploratory survey indicates that professionals are partially aware of the existence of and the need to address the ESA phenomenon. ","339":"Women with bipolar disorder have an increased risk of relapse during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and they often express broad concerns about family planning. To explore the thoughts and considerations of women of childbearing age with bipolar disorder, about family planning and pregnancy. A qualitative study was conducted: 15 women with bipolar I disorder were individually interviewed. Content analysis was applied. Women worried about heritability of bipolar disorder, medication issues, and risk of relapse during pregnancy. They mentioned their fear to be incompetent as a mother during future mood episodes. Support of partner, family\/friends, and professionals was mentioned as essential. Family planning is an essential topic in the treatment of every woman with bipolar disorder of childbearing age. These women expect early consultation with professionals for support, and specific information about heritability of the illness and use of medication during and after pregnancy. ","340":"Addressing the quality of life (QOL) of patients with schizophrenia is of special importance in the Arab world, where little knowledge is available about their well-being, and most of them experience stigma and living in poverty. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of sociodemographic characteristics, severity of depressive symptoms, and various aspects of public stigma against mental illness, with QOL among Jordanian patients with schizophrenia. In this descriptive correlational study, 160 Jordanian outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia completed measures of demographic characteristics, perceived public stigma against mental illness, severity of depression, and QOL. Participants had poor QOL. Age, marital status, relapse, education level, stigma against mental illness, and severity of depression were significantly associated with QOL among Jordanian patients with schizophrenia. Data analysis revealed that the severity of depression accounted for an additional 27% of the variance above and beyond the 36.7% accounted for by age of the participants and perceived public stigma against mental illness. Health care professionals should develop culturally competent nursing practice considering the specific factors associated with QOL among Arab patients with schizophrenia. ","341":"Studies of the relationship between cortisol and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have had inconsistent results. Gender, trauma type, and age at trauma exposure may explain the inconsistencies. The objective of the review was to examine cortisol levels in relation to PTSD in women with a history of child maltreatment trauma. A review of literature found 13 articles eligible for inclusion. Despite limiting focus to the relatively homogeneous population, the patterns of associations between PTSD and cortisol levels were still inconsistent. The reasons for the inconsistencies likely include highly varied methods across studies, small convenience samples, and unmeasured neuroendocrine hormones that may be stronger predictors of PTSD. The review does not point to a clear bio-behavioral target for psychiatric nursing intervention. It is important to continue to address the developmental and clinical stress response aspects of child maltreatment trauma-related PTSD without assuming that these stress responses are hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis driven.

It is a disadvantage that renders people less protected to face negative life experiences. The purpose of this study was to adapt and test the psychometric properties of the Psychological Vulnerability Scale in a sample of 267 Portuguese higher education students. A psychometric study of the Psychological Vulnerability Scale, after translation into Portuguese, was performed with a convenience sample of higher education students. Participants were asked to fill in the sociodemographic questionnaire, the Psychological Vulnerability Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory, and a one-item question about the Perception of Vulnerability. The mean age of the participants was 20.5 years ( SD = 3.3). A factor analysis confirmed the original one-factor structure, explaining 42.9% of the total variance. The Psychological Vulnerability Scale showed adequate internal consistency and excellent test-retest stability. Convergent validity was confirmed by positive correlations with the Brief Symptom Inventory and Perception of Vulnerability. Overall, the Psychological Vulnerability Scale showed good validity, reliability, and stability over time. The Psychological Vulnerability Scale is now ready to be used by practitioners and researchers to measure the psychological vulnerability among Portuguese higher education students.

This has a significant impact on the faculty-student relationship. The purpose of this study was to identify the basic social psychological process that occurs when nursing faculty interact with students with MHI. Grounded theory methodology was implemented to identify the basic social psychological process that occurs when faculty encounter students with MHI. Thirteen nursing faculty were interviewed. Data were analyzed using line by line coding and constant comparative analysis. The resulting substantive theory, navigating the faculty-student relationship in the context of student MHI, is an iterative four-phase process: noticing, responding, experiencing, and reflecting. This theory provides a framework for understanding how nursing faculty recognize and address student MHI. The theory can be used to establish interventional strategies and best practice guidelines.

This study examines a nurse-delivered telephone support intervention provided to low-income, pregnant women living in rural settings. This study had a complementary mixed-methods design, using secondary data. Peplau's theory of interpersonal relations was used as a framework to guide the study. The phases of Peplau's theory of interpersonal relations were evident in the interactions. Underserved women at high risk for depression appreciated this type of support, with the women at highest risk for depression utilizing more of the nursing support provided. On average, Mental Health Index-5 scores improved from 45 to 66.

Given the various risks associated with later life, a valid and reliable integrative screening tool for assessing risk perception among the elderly is warranted. The study examined the psychometric properties and factor structure of a new integrative risk perception instrument, the Perceived Risk Scale. This eight-item measure refers to various risks simultaneously, including terror, health issues, traffic accidents, violence, and financial loss, and was developed specifically for older adults. An online survey was conducted with 306 participants aged 50 years and older. The scale was examined using exploratory factor analysis and concurrent validity testing. Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure: later-life risks and terror risks A high percentage of explained variance, as well as internal consistency, was found for the entire scale and for both factors. Concurrent validity was supported by significant positive associations with participants' depression and negative correlations with their life satisfaction. These findings suggest that the Perceived Risk Scale is internally reliable, valid, and appropriate for evaluating risk perception in later life. The scale's potential applications are discussed.

The purpose of this exploratory study is to describe PTSD symptoms in survivors bereaved by the suicide of a significant other. The relationship of PTSD to mental health and grief were explored, as well as gender differences in PTSD symptoms. To measure PTSD symptoms, the 15-item Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used. The IES intrusion and avoidance subscales were significantly correlated with the mental health subscale of the MOS SF-36 (Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36), indicating that lower mental health scores were associated with higher PTSD symptoms. Those survivors scoring higher than 25 on the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) had significantly higher scores on both the intrusion and avoidance subscales of the IES compared with those scoring lower than 25 on the ICG. Females reported significantly higher intrusion symptoms and total stress than males. Our results suggest that a death by suicide may lead to the development of PTSD symptoms, at least in some individuals, and is associated with lower mental health quality of life and complicated grief responses.

Comparisons of patient characteristics and treatment delivery were conducted between veteran groups. The sample (N = 504) was predominantly White (82%) and male (91%), with a median age of 50 years. The 6-month reattempt rate was 6%. Timing of first appointment was earlier in the reattempt group (n = 20) versus the no-reattempt group (n = 467). Appointment intensity, especially telephone appointments, was greater in the reattempt group. The effect of postdischarge treatment on preventing suicide cannot be determined by evaluating only treatment timing and intensity.

This is a clinical translation of a research article by Delaney and colleagues (this issue of JAPNA) that describes the development and testing of a new measure called the Combined Assessment of Psychiatric Environments (CAPE). The measure was tested with patients and staff on six different inpatient psychiatric units. The staff and patient versions of the CAPE were shown to be valid (accurate measure of safe, patient-centered care) and reliable (precise measure that shows stability over time). The CAPE is a new measure that can be used to examine staff and patient experiences of nursing practice on inpatient psychiatric units.

To develop and conduct psychometric testing of a measure that evaluates person-centered care on inpatient psychiatric units, the Combined Assessment of Psychiatric Environments (CAPE). The measure is built on a theoretical framework holding that if optimal care is to be achieved, all major stakeholders (patients and staff) need to experience a positive environment. An instrument development design was used to create the patient\/staff nurse versions of the CAPE and to test their dimensions. The pilot versions of the CAPE were tested on six inpatient psychiatric units to determine the psychometrics of the staff\/patient versions. The overall reliability of both versions of the CAPE (staff\/patient) was .91. The test-retest reliability for both versions was significant at the .01 level. Construct validity was established via factor analysis. Criterion-related validity was demonstrated by correlations of the two versions of the CAPE to instruments that were conceptually related. The CAPE is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to examine practice and the patient experience on inpatient psychiatric units. The CAPE highlights that patient-centered environments of care are intertwined with staff experiences of support for their role.

This pilot study developed and tested an innovative active learning strategy using simulated standardized patients to determine its effectiveness in teaching suicide assessment skills to a sample of 34 junior and senior baccalaureate nursing students. This study employed an experimental, two-group posttest design and three National League for Nursing\/Laerdal Simulation Evaluation instruments. After reading about suicide assessment, the experimental group was exposed to a simulated standardized patient portraying a suicidal patient. The control group received a recorded lecture on suicide assessment. The experimental group demonstrated a significant difference in student scores of self-confidence, satisfaction, and student perceptions of the educational practices (active learning, collaboration, and appeal to diverse learning styles) when compared to the lecture format. Suicide assessment is a critical assessment skill set that can be effectively taught to nursing students using standardized patients.

This article provides an integrative review of published literature within the past decade reporting on the characteristics of BE in minority compared with White racial groups. Health care computerized databases were searched using key terms. Eighteen research studies met the inclusion criteria. More than half of the studies reviewed reported racial differences in some aspect of BE; however, heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of BE limits the ability to compare findings across studies. BE is reported across racial groups. To determine whether meaningful differences in BE exist by race, further studies using the same conceptual and operational definitions of BE are needed.

Two weeks after delivery, we measured their breast milk SIgA levels and simultaneously documented their psychological state using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scales. Breast milk SIgA levels were negatively correlated with negative POMS states (tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue, and confusion). A negative correlation was also observed between SIgA levels and GHQ mental health (r = -.625, P = .000), and a similar negative correlation was observed with STAI trait and state anxieties.

Data were collected once a month for 5 months on 84 parents recruited in South Florida using the Pediatric Quality of Life Family Impact Module. Physically, parents were tired when they woke up: too tired to do the things they liked to do and with little energy for chores or social activities. Mentally, they were frustrated, anxious, and angry; felt helpless and hopeless; had cognitive problems remembering and focusing on tasks; were worried about the child's medications, treatments, side effects; and were anxious about child's future and effect of the child's condition on other family members. Socially, they felt isolated and that people did not understand their family situation; they found it hard to talk with others including physicians and nurses. Average weekly hours of direct care was 33.0 (SD = 30.4 hours); average monthly out-of-pocket expenditures was $348.78 (SD = $623.34).

Participants focused on falls prevention instead of fall injury prevention, were committed to reducing risk, and were receptive to learning how to improve safety. Participants recognized unique features of their patients and care settings that defined risk, and were highly motivated to work with other disciplines to keep patients safe. Selling fall injury prevention to staff in psychiatric settings is similar to selling fall injury prevention to staff in other health care settings.

The transitional care model (TCM) is evidence-based and demonstrated to improve posthospital outcomes for elderly with physical health conditions, but it has not been studied in the population with serious mental illness. Using a randomized controlled design, 40 inpatients from two general hospital psychiatric units were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 20) that received the TCM intervention that was delivered by a psychiatric nurse practitioner for 90 days posthospitalization, or a control group (n = 20) that received usual care. Outcomes were as follows: service utilization, health-related quality of life, and continuity of care. The intervention group showed higher medical and psychiatric rehospitalization than the control group (p = .054). Emergency room use was lower for intervention group but not statistically significant. Continuity of care with primary care appointments were significantly higher for the intervention group (p = .023). The intervention group's general health improved but was not statistically significant compared with controls. A transitional care intervention is recommended; however, the model needs to be modified from a single nurse to a multidisciplinary team with expertise from a psychiatric nurse practitioner, a social worker, and a peer support specialist.

Using a community-based participatory research framework, 61 Black, Hispanic, and White women participated in focus groups around their experiences with anxiety\/depression. Researchers recorded verbal communication, nonverbal behavior, and patterns of interaction. The women's communication and interaction patterns gave evidence of three themes that were evident across all focus groups and five subthemes that emerged along ethnic lines.

This framework proposes that public stigma is a unique chronic traumatic stress that mediates the effects of similar trauma types in mental health patients. To test this proposition, this study explores the relationships between internalized stigma of mental illness (ISMI), different trauma types, and posttrauma spectrum disorders. ISMI, posttraumatic stress disorder, other posttrauma spectrum disorders, and cumulative trauma measures were administered to a sample of 399 mental health patients that included Arab (82%), Muslim (84%), and refugee (31%), as well as American patients (18%). Age in the sample ranged from 18 to 76 years (M = 39.66, SD = 11.45), with 53.5% males. Hierarchical multiple regression, t tests, and path analyses were conducted. Results indicated that ISMI predicted posttraumatic stress disorder and other posttrauma spectrum disorders after controlling for cumulative trauma. ISMI was associated with other chronic collective identity traumas. While Arab Americans, Muslims, and refugees had higher ISMI scores than other Americans, the elevated chronic trauma levels of these groups were significant predictors of these differences.

Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine sociodemographic characteristics, recent substance use, and current psychiatric problem severity in addition to lifetime histories of sexual\/physical abuse in a cross-sectional design. Gender, substance use, and psychiatric problem severity predicted increases in HIV-risk sexual behavior beyond what was predicted by abuse histories. Proportionately more women than men reported abuse histories. In addition, significantly more unprotected sexual than safer sexual practices were observed, but differences in these practices based on lifetime abuse histories and gender were not significant.

Given the increasing emphasis and efforts toward integrating physical health and behavioral health care, it is likely that ACT will continue to be challenged to meet the physical health needs of its consumers. To improve primary care receipt, this may mean a departure from traditional staffing patterns (e.g., the addition of a primary care doctor and nurse) and expansion of the direct services ACT provides to incorporate physical health treatments.

Few empirical studies have been conducted to measure these practices in psychiatric-mental health (PMH) nursing, particularly in short-term acute hospital settings. This study examined the reliability of the Recovery Self Assessment-Registered Nurse Version (RSA-RN) and explored recovery practices of PMH nurses and nursing staff in an acute treatment setting. A descriptive one-group design with convenience sampling was employed. One hundred and five participants completed the RSA-RN and the demographic data form. The RSA-RN full-scale instrument demonstrated excellent internal consistency, and the five subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. Significant, favorable relationships were found between RSA-RN scores and nursing staff who (a) had formal education in mental health recovery, (b) considered themselves knowledgeable about recovery, and (c) considered their place of work to be \"recovery-oriented.\" The RSA-RN is a useful tool in measuring recovery-oriented practice. Formal education should be considered as an intervention to increase recovery-oriented practices in PMH nursing.

As such, person-first language places emphasis on the person first rather than the disability (e.g., \"person with schizophrenia\" rather than \"a schizophrenic\"). This article champions the use of person-first language as a foundation for recovery-oriented practice and enhanced collaborative treatment environments that foster respect, human dignity, and hope. ","525":"Approaches to measuring recovery orientation are needed, particularly for programs that may struggle with implementing recovery-oriented treatment. A mixed-methods comparative study was conducted to explore effective approaches to measuring recovery orientation of assertive community treatment (ACT) teams. Two ACT teams exhibiting high and low recovery orientation were compared using surveys, treatment plan ratings, diaries of treatment visits, and team leader-reported treatment control mechanisms. The recovery-oriented team differed on one survey measure (higher expectations for consumer recovery), treatment planning (greater consumer involvement and goal-directed content), and use of control mechanisms (less use of representative payee, agency-held lease, daily medication delivery, and family involvement). Staff and consumer diaries showed the most consistent differences (e.g., conveying hope and choice) and were the least susceptible to observer bias but had the lowest response rates. Several practices differentiate recovery orientation on ACT teams, and a mixed-methods assessment approach is feasible.

To support patients' recovery and improve their experiences of care in a Canadian forensic mental health hospital, an intervention was launched to increase patient engagement by establishing a peer support program, strengthening a patient advisory committee, and creating a patient-led research team. The effect of the intervention on patient- and system-level outcomes was studied using a naturalistic, prospective, longitudinal approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from inpatients and service providers twice during the 19-month intervention. Despite succeeding in supporting patients' participation, the intervention had minimal impacts on internalized stigma, personal recovery, personal empowerment, service engagement, therapeutic milieu, and the recovery orientation of services. Peer support demonstrated positive effects on internalized stigma and personal recovery. Strengthening patient engagement contributes toward improving experiences of care in a forensic hospital, but it may have limited effects on outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to determine the common ways in which teens end violent dating relationships. Grounded theory methods were used to analyze transcribed interviews conducted with a community sample of 83 young adults who had experienced dating violence as teens. Participants described six ways of ending violent dating relationships: deciding enough is enough; becoming interested in someone else; being on again, off again; fading away; deciding it's best for us both; and moving away.

The purpose of this article is to perform a critical analysis of the literature to identify current rates of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI in military and veteran populations who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan and their combined effects on persistent postconcussive symptoms. A search of the literature with military and veteran populations published after 2001 in Pubmed, OVID\/Medline, Cochran Database, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsychInfo was conducted using keywords. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria. The literature search yielded mixed results for rates of PTSD, TBI, and comorbid conditions. There is some evidence that comorbid PTSD and TBI result in greater reports of postconcussive symptomology than either condition alone. Limitations include lack of consistency of measurements, sampling biases, and lack of experimental design, and these warrant further exploration.

A qualitative study design was used to conduct individual interviews with a purposive sample of community mental health service users (n = 24) and professionals (n = 25). Thematic analysis was employed to establish superordinate and subordinate themes, which were transformed into conceptual maps. All service users considered routine enquiry about domestic violence in mental health settings to be acceptable but a small minority of professionals did not. Service users described positive experiences of help seeking, including receiving acknowledgement for the abuse and support for their multiple needs, and negative experiences, including nonvalidating responses from clinicians following disclosure, discrimination, and an absence of support from services. Main themes for professionals included difficulties in assessment and management of domestic violence, reporting requirements, and unclear referral pathways.

Adoptive mothers (N = 136) were surveyed for depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Analyses included correlations and a regression analysis between depressive symptoms and unmet expectations with the Five-Factor Model personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness to experience) as measured by the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. Both the CES-D and EPDS were significantly, negatively correlated with all five personality dimensions. Mothers whose expectations of themselves as parents matched pre- and postplacement were more likely to be emotionally stable and extraverted. Approximately 36% of the variance in depressive symptoms was explained by personality traits (emotional stability: p &lt; .0001). The postadoption period is a crucial time of transition for mothers and their children. Maternal emotional stability, depressive symptoms, and unmet expectations may affect this period.

Anecdotal data and clinical observation underscore the promise of yoga as a viable approach to build self-regulatory capacity of traumatized youth. Future directions in the development and evaluation of trauma-informed yoga practices for youth are discussed. ","591":"Despite a U.S. prevalence of 9%, less than 25% of depressed adolescents receive evidence-based treatment. To describe lessons learned from implementing the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment) program in a community mental health practice as part of an evidence-based practice change to improve an advanced practice psychiatric nurse's clinical practice and provide treatment for depressed teens. A preexperimental one-group pre- and posttest design was used to assess the feasibility and effects of a brief manualized seven-session cognitive-behavioral skills-building intervention titled COPE delivered to 15 depressed adolescents in routine 30-minute mental health medication management outpatient visits. Applying the evidence-based practice model led to improved adolescent outcomes. Adolescents reported significant decreases in depression, anxiety, anger, and destructive behavior as well as increases in self-concept and personal beliefs about managing negative emotions. Challenges (limited organizational resources) needed to be addressed to implement the advanced practice psychiatric nurse's evidence-based practice change. COPE is a promising brief cognitive-behavioral therapy-based intervention that can be delivered within 30-minute individual outpatient visits. With this intervention, advanced practice nurses can work with current practice limitations and still provide evidence-based treatment for depressed teens. Collaboration between research-focused and clinically based nursing colleagues is a model of clinical scholarship that holds great promise in bridging the gap between research and practice. ","592":"Competing theories exist regarding the importance of premigration trauma as compared with postmigration stressors and resources with respect to the risk to immigrant mental health. To examine how type of premigration trauma, postmigration stressors, and postmigration resources differentially predict posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptomatology in Arab immigrant women who have been exposed to premigration trauma. Descriptive, using multinomial logistic regression to explain membership in one of four groups: (a) PTSD only (n = 14), (b) MDD (n = 162), (c) comorbid PTSD-MDD (n = 148), and (d) subclinical symptoms (n = 209). Parameter estimates for postimmigration-related stressors (as measured by the Demands of Immigration [DI]) indicated that a unit increase in DI scores was associated with a nearly 16-fold increase in the likelihood of being in the comorbid relative to the subclinical group, and a nearly 2.5-fold increase in the likelihood of being in the comorbid relative to the MDD-only group (p &lt; .05). Odds ratios for social support, age, and type of premigration trauma ranged between 0.95 and 1.95 and only differentiated between subclinical and comorbid PTSD-MDD groups (p &lt; .05). Postmigration stressors exert substantive effects on immigrant mental health outcomes. Nursing interventions are needed to reduce immigration-related stressors. Screening Arab immigrant women for depression and PTSD is important, given the high levels observed in this community-based sample.

As these men pass through the criminal justice system, discontinuation of health care access and nonadherence to prescribed treatments often occur. Men who are not engaged in health care during and after incarceration are at risk for treatment interruption and disease progression. Correctional facilities are therefore important sites for secondary prevention of HIV\/AIDS. Unprecedented scientific attention and resources are currently directed at detecting and treating HIV in the criminal justice system. To support these efforts to increase health care access, we must have a better understanding of the cultural and situational factors that structure opportunities for secondary prevention during incarceration and during the transition from correctional facilities back into the community. This article presents a timely review of the literature on the health needs of incarcerated men living with HIV\/AIDS. The author uses the primary health care framework to describe the movement of HIV-positive men through the criminal justice system as a series of strategic opportunities to initiate and establish a process of care. The author concludes that although we understand many of the challenges of providing care to men who become incarcerated, and have evidence of effective health-promoting services, we are only beginning to understand how to make health care services accessible and acceptable to HIV-positive male inmates, and we have not yet used some proven HIV prevention tools.","601":"To conduct a formative evaluation of a treatment program designed for inmates with impulsive and aggressive behavior disorders in high-security facilities in Connecticut correctional facilities. Pencil-and-paper surveys and in-person inmate interviews were used to answer four evaluation questions. Descriptive statistics and content analyses were used to assess context, input, process, and products. A convenience sample of 26 adult male (18) and female (8) inmates participated in the study. Inmates were satisfied with the program (4-point scale, M = 3.38, SD = 0.75). Inmate hospital stays were reduced by 13.6%, and psychotropic medication use increased slightly (0.40%). Improved outcomes were noted for those inmates who attended more sessions. The findings of the formative evaluation were useful for moving the START NOW Skills Training treatment to the implementation phase. Recommendations for implementation modifications included development of an implementation team, reinforcement of training, and attention applied to uniform collection of outcome data to demonstrate its evidence base. ","602":"Sexual assault research has focused almost exclusively on urban areas, and research examining the experiences of expert service providers is nearly nonexistent. The purpose of this study was to add to the understanding of providers' experiences in working with sexually assaulted women in rural communities. Secondary victimization theory suggests that the nature of postassault expert interventions may have an adverse impact on victims. The focus of this hermeneutic phenomenological study was to explore the lived experiences of providers regarding their interactions with sexual assault survivors living in rural communities. Data were gathered from prosecutors, law enforcement, crisis center advocates, social workers, and victim-witness associates. Data analysis led to the identification of five significant themes: (a) rural-specific confidentiality issues, (b) resource needs in a rural setting, (c) the connection between victim blaming and low levels of reporting, (d) negative provider views of the community, and (e) smaller communities provided better victim care. Psychiatric nurses and mental health care systems have many opportunities to intervene with abused women in inpatient, outpatient, and other community settings. In primary and acute care setting, nurses should assess patients for a history of violence using multiple screening questions and should also educate victims and their families about available resources.","603":"Healthy living programs (HLPs) within the context of mental health units are an applied response to the concerns of metabolic syndrome and the associated physical illnesses to which people with serious mental illness are susceptible. To illustrate how nurses, with other health professionals and service users, have established and maintained HLPs in two locked forensic mental health units in New Zealand. This illustrative case study adopts a multimodal approach to data collection and analysis. Across two programs, interviews were undertaken with service users (n = 15) and staff (n = 17), minutes of meetings were analyzed for major decision points, and clinical notes were reviewed to identify which service-user health status measures (body mass index, glucose tolerance test results, blood pressure, and medication use) were recorded. Similarities were identified in the way the HLPs were implemented and maintained by champions who advocated for change, challenged staff attitudes, secured funding, and established new systems and protocols. Successful implementation depended on involvement of the multidisciplinary team. Each program operated within a different physical environment and adopted its own philosophical approach that shaped the style of the program. The HLPs had an impact on nurses, other staff, and on the culture of the institutions. The programs raised dilemmas about restrictions and risk versus autonomy and self-management. Understanding the effects of the clinical and philosophical contexts in which HLPs are established and the way challenges and benefits are affected by context has practical significance for the future development of health programs in forensic settings, prisons, and general mental health units. ","604":"","605":"The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of individuals who survived the loss of one or both parents through parental homicide or homicide\/suicide as adolescents. Participants (N = 34) were aged between 12 and 19 years at the time of the death and were aged between 29 and 64 years at the time of the interview. Participants were interviewed twice and asked to tell the story of their lives. Data were analyzed in the hermeneutic phenomenological tradition using a stepwise process of developing categories and then a single complex theme. Common categories of participants' childhoods included abuse both before and after the uxoricide and vivid memories of the homicide. As adults, most participants reported difficulties with intimate relationships, legal problems, and substance use. Integrity was an overarching theme for these participants. Among those who had integrated the story of the homicide into their adult lives, some believed that they were doing well whereas others did not. Some participants had isolated the event and considered that they were doing well as a result. These findings are limited by the convenience sample but offer a rich portrait of the lives of individuals who experienced uxoricide as adolescents. Clinicians might be advised to tread carefully if individuals report that they have isolated rather than integrated the uxoricide into their adult lives. No evidence exists in support that either stance is preferable.","606":"Forensic assertive community treatment (FACT) is a recent adaptation of the assertive community treatment (ACT) model; however, more information is needed about how FACT and ACT consumers differ and how FACT should be modified to accommodate these differences. Linked, multisystem administrative data from King County, Washington, were used to compare the demographic, clinical, and criminal justice characteristics of ACT- and FACT-eligible consumers. FACT consumers were more likely to be male, persons of color, and had more complex clinical profiles. Also, some FACT consumers were incarcerated for sex offenses, and more than half had violent offenses. Traditionally, ACT teams avoid serving consumers with personality disorders, violent consumers, and sex offenders; however, given increased use of mandated outpatient treatment and mental health courts, FACT teams may have less discretion to choose whom they serve. The addition of clinical interventions and other modifications may be particularly important for FACT teams. ","607":"Practitioners variably use restrictive practices with assertive community treatment (ACT) consumers. Little is known about practitioner attributes, such as pessimistic attitudes and lack of advanced education, which may predict greater use of restrictive practices. To describe the frequency of restrictive practices in ACT and examine the relationship between practitioner attributes, particularly pessimistic attitudes and education, and the frequency with which restrictive practices are reportedly used in daily treatment of adults with severe mental illness. A cross-sectional study of 122 ACT practitioners in one state. More restrictive practices were rarely reported by practitioners. Pessimistic attitudes and lack of graduate-level training were associated with self-reported higher use of restrictive practices, even when controlling for select consumer caseload variables and ACT program fidelity. This study indicates the need to identify practitioner-related factors that may contribute to the high use of restrictive practices, and develop and implement relevant staff training. ","608":"Assertive community treatment (ACT), for persons with serious mental illness, includes a vocational focus as an important aspect of community integration. Nevertheless, research suggests that ACT does not assist significant numbers of consumers in achieving employment goals. A two-step survey of New Jersey ACT team members was designed to identify the key issues that hinder ACT staff members in assisting consumers with obtaining employment. Survey items were categorized into three sections: (a) staff attitudes, (b) consumer barriers, and (c) staff barriers to working on employment. The initial survey asked staff members to rate items in each of these categories. Highly rated items were used in a subsequent paired comparison survey to determine the relative importance of each. This method highlighted the following issues: four staff attitude items-(a) returning to work is positive, (b) employment is key to recovery, (c) abstinence from substance abuse is needed to work, and (d) consumers are too ill to work; four consumer barrier items-(a) fear of loss of Social Security Administration benefits, (b) symptoms related to the illness, (c) lack of motivation, and (d) poor social skills; and three barriers to working on employment issues items-(a) clinical issues take priority, (b) other case management issues takes priority, and (c) too many emergencies. The implications for staff training are discussed.","609":"Despite the high rate of co-occurring medical conditions experienced by individuals receiving assertive community treatment (ACT), this comprehensive service model continues to be considered primarily a mental health intervention. Without compromising fidelity to the model, ACT can serve as an ideal platform from which to provide both primary and behavioral health care to those with complex service needs. Using a case example, this article considers the transformation of the ACT mental health care model into an integrated health care delivery system through establishing nursing and primary care partnerships. Specifically, by expanding and explicitly redefining the role of the ACT nurse, well-developed care models, such as Guided Care, can provide additional guidelines and training to ACT nurses who are uniquely trained and oriented to serve as the leader and coordinator of health integration efforts.","610":"Assertive community treatment (ACT) is characterized as a service delivery platform and represents an ideal setting in which mental health and physical health care can be integrated. Little is known about the extent to which ACT integrates physical health care with mental health care or the challenges ACT teams experience. To address this gap, focus groups were conducted with five ACT teams in a Midwestern US state to explore how ACT teams address the physical health care needs of persons with severe mental illness. A qualitative study design was used. Three major themes emerged: ACT teams recognize serious and chronic physical health problems, ACT teams take on a variety of roles to address physical health problems, and there are challenges to integrating primary and mental health care within an ACT setting. ACT needs to be adapted to incorporate promising practices designed to better integrate physical health care and mental health care. ","611":"This study analyzed data from a randomized trial to examine the impact on medication adherence of integrated treatment delivered via assertive community treatment (ACT) versus standard clinical case management (SCCM). Data from the original study included 198 study participants with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders who were randomly assigned to receive integrated treatment via ACT or SCCM and were followed for 3 years. We applied mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate group (ACT vs. SCCM) by time effects on a self-report measure of medication adherence. Adherence was dichotomized as 20% or more missed medication days (\"poor adherence\") versus less than 20% missed medication days (\"adequate adherence\"). Participants who were assigned to ACT reported significant improvement in medication adherence compared with those assigned to SCCM. Integrated treatment delivered via ACT may benefit persons with co-occurring psychotic and substance use disorders who are poorly adherent to medications. ","612":"Assertive community treatment (ACT) is an evidence-based practice that provides intensive, in vivo services for adults with severe mental illness. Some ACT and intensive case management teams have integrated consumers as team members with varying results. The authors reviewed the literature examining the outcomes of having consumer providers on case management teams, with attention devoted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Sixteen published studies were identified, including eight RCTs. Findings were mixed, with evidence supporting consumer-provided services for improving engagement and limited support for reduced hospitalizations. However, evidence was lacking for other outcomes areas such as symptom reduction or improved quality of life. Including a consumer provider on an ACT team could enhance the outreach mechanisms of ACT, using a more recovery-focused approach to bring consumers into services and help engage them over time. More rigorous research is needed to further evaluate integrating consumer providers on teams.

The TMACT, an enhanced fidelity tool, was developed and pilot-tested to better assess critical ACT structures and processes. Ten ACT teams were administered the TMACT and the long-standing ACT fidelity measure, the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS), at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Overall, fidelity scores for all 10 teams were relatively high. Six teams showed improvement, concluding with high TMACT scores at 18 months. Four teams with significantly lower total scores had experienced turnover and organizational barriers. TMACT ratings were higher in core ACT practices than in recovery practices and EBPs. TMACT scores rose steadily but were significantly lower than DACTS scores, which remained unchanged. The TMACT sets higher performance standards through enhanced assessment of recovery-orientation, EBPs, and teamwork and is more sensitive to change than the DACTS.

Krippendorff 's method for qualitative content analysis was used to describe patient perspectives about psychiatric symptoms and potential side effects of IFN treatment. Transcripts from face-to-face, semistructured interviews with 20 patients in 3 residential substance abuse treatment programs were analyzed. Themes included patients' powerlessness and their evaluation of risk and confidence. Participants commented that residential substance abuse treatment programs offered a unique opportunity to undergo antiviral treatment because they capitalized on a patient's heightened readiness for change. Barriers to treatment included perceived obstacles, such as compulsory waiting periods before treatment initiation, fear that neuropsychiatric treatment side effects would sabotage addiction recovery, and concern that psychiatric providers lacked sufficient HCV knowledge. However, when patients perceived clinicians as knowledgeable and genuinely caring, they were amenable to considering antiviral treatment. Increasing HCV-specific psychiatric education and staff training, exploring combined psychiatric and antiviral treatment combinations, and therapeutically supporting patient decision making are needed to better use substance abuse residential treatment programs as sites for treating HCV infection. Novel antidepressant treatment approaches are required in this population. Advanced practice psychiatric nurses are well-positioned to develop new integrative models of care addressing the medical, psychiatric, and substance abuse comorbidities in this highly vulnerable group. ","620":"Tobacco use disproportionately affects the well-being of individuals with mental illness. In community psychiatric settings, there are culturally embedded attitudes and behaviors regarding smoking that enable practitioners to remain ambivalent about their clients' tobacco use. Given these cultural norms, the authors aimed to introduce evidence-informed smoking cessation interventions to a variety of interdisciplinary mental health care providers by using an innovative approach to knowledge translation. The authors used a case study design in which six community psychiatric settings were targeted. The organizational culture related to smoking was examined at each site before tailored tobacco reduction interventions were delivered. The study design was guided by the knowledge-to-action (KTA) process and two supplementary approaches to change: motivational interviewing (MI) and appreciative inquiry (AI). The principles of the KTA process, MI, and AI helped the authors to meaningfully engage with practice groups and change the organizational culture surrounding tobacco use in several community psychiatric settings.

Clinicians can increase the efficiency of evidence-based practice searches by using the correct form of PICOT (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, time frame) question to focus the search, based on (a) diagnosis, (b) treatment, (c) prognosis, (d) etiology, (e) prevention, and (f) meaning. The correct form of a PICOT question focuses the literature search by requiring a minimum of sorting to find relevant studies. Quickly and effectively locating the critical evidence will help meet the performance standard mandates required by new health care reform legislation.","623":"Trauma developmental theory identifies gender discrimination (GD) as a type of persistent, ongoing trauma that has the potential for serious, negative effects on mental health. This study was conducted to examine the potential role of GD in the development of cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as the role of GD in mediating the effects of other traumas on these disorders. The sample included 160 female torture survivors from more than 30 countries. Measures of PTSD, CTD, and types of trauma exposure were acquired as part of a larger study on refugee torture survivors. Structural equation modeling was used to test several plausible models for the direct and indirect effects of GD on PTSD and CTD, within the context of other trauma exposure. Results suggest that GD mediates the effects of identity traumas on CTD and PTSD. GD also had direct effects on CTD, including relationships with dissociation, suicidality, and deficits in executive function. GD did not appear to directly influence the development of PTSD. The implications of these results for assessment and treatment of women's trauma-related disorders as well as strategies for their prevention are discussed.","624":"There is a high incidence of assault against nursing staff in mental health care. Efforts to reduce the incidence of assault are hindered by the complexity and nature of the problem and by the fact that incidents of assault are underreported. To identify factors influencing nurses to report staff assault by patients in an inpatient mental health care facility. The study used a modified nominal group technique in which nurses worked together to identify themes in decisions about reporting incidents of assault. The participants were nurses at two sites of a mental health care organization. Nurses used a complex decision-making process to decide whether an incident of assault was worth reporting. Safety culture, the design of the incident reporting system, and the effect on patients were important components of the decision-making process. Strategies that consider all levels of the organization's system should be used to improve reporting of assault incidents.

A total of 36 data-based articles authored by nurse investigators met eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Most were single studies by individual nurse investigators; few studies reflected ongoing programs of research related to alcohol and women's health. Studies were categorized into four main groups, including (a) determinants of alcohol use and alcohol problems; (b) patterns of use, assessment of alcohol use, and comorbidity; (c) consequences of alcohol use; and (d) the effects of treatment or specific interventions and the contributions of nursing research to the knowledge base of each group are summarized. The authors then propose a research agenda for nursing that addresses the most pressing issues related to alcohol use and alcohol problems in women.","627":"Adolescent alcohol use is a significant public health problem. Drinking before 13 years of age is correlated to the use of illicit drugs and other risky behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between adolescents' early alcohol use and participation in risky behaviors such as smoking marijuana and cigarettes, as well as risky sexual behaviors. Respondents for this cross-sectional secondary analysis came from a sample of 809 racially diverse adolescents in a community-based study examining familial influences on offspring outcomes. Early-onset drinking, compared with nondrinking, was significantly related to participating in many of the risky behaviors. Many of the relationships persisted in the multivariable models that adjusted for demographic characteristics. Early drinking was associated with participation in various risky behaviors (e.g., multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse), which may negatively alter an adolescent's future. Screening should focus on the co-occurrence of such behaviors.

The purposes of this study were to determine if mental health patients had preferences related to nursing attire, to determine if patient preference varied with age, and to determine if nursing attire affected patients' thoughts on approachability, competence, and professionalism. A six-question survey was distributed to patients who met specific criteria between August and December 2008. Overall, patients did not have a preference for the type of attire worn by staff. Identification of nurses was a concern for many. More than half of the respondents indicated approachability was not affected by attire; however, 29% said that street clothes made the nurse less approachable. Attire did not affect patient perception of competence or professionalism. As behavioral health care changes, staff attire may need to be reconsidered.

An exploratory, descriptive study using a convenience sample of 97 postpartum women attending seven monthly visits. Women provided serum 25(OH)D samples and completed the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) at each visit. A significant relationship over time was found between low 25(OH)D levels and high EPDS scores, indicative of postpartum depression.

The objective of this study is to determine if emotional intelligence (EI) and social support differ in traumatized depressed patients when compared with controls. The present study examines two psychosocial factors that may contribute to this link: EI and social support. Participants who experienced a trauma and had current MDD (n=38) were compared with nontraumatized healthy controls ( n=40). Traumatized depressed participants exhibited lower total EI, because of reductions in strategic EI ability, as well as lower levels of social support compared with the control group. EI and social support were significantly correlated. These findings suggest that EI may be a novel target for intervention to prevent and treat MDD.

The goal of this article was to describe the efficacy of ACT in treating co-occurring substance use disorders and suggest approaches to make it more efficacious. A literature review was conducted and randomized clinical trials describing ACT's impact on substance use were reviewed. Four randomized clinical trials of ACT that measured substance abuse adequately were identified, all of which showed small to no effect on substance abuse compared with control conditions. Methodological issues might account for the small effects. ACT might further reduce substance use by being paired with evidenced-based substance abuse treatment, helping clients become housed or helping them manage their money better. Integrated ACT, in which the ACT team provides substance abuse counseling, has the potential to reduce substance use by several mechanisms, but this has been difficult to demonstrate in clinical trials when participants in control groups receive similar interventions.

Face-to-face interviews with 34,653 respondents to the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, of whom 3875 had prevalent AUDs between Waves 1 and 2 and ASPD, AABS, or no antisocial syndrome at Wave 1. In unadjusted analyses, baseline ASPD predicted AUD treatment but AABS did not. After adjustment for additional need, predisposing, and enabling factors, antisocial syndromes did not predict treatment. Baseline predictors of treatment included more past-year AUD symptoms, and past-year nicotine dependence and AUD treatment. That baseline antisocial syndrome did not predict AUD treatment may reflect strong associations of antisociality with previously identified predictors of help seeking.

Data are reported from 15 countries comprising the Emergency Room Collaborative Alcohol Analysis Project and the WHO Collaborative Study on Alcohol and Injury. Case-crossover analysis was used to analyze the risk of injury (among current drinkers) from drinking six hours prior to the event, based on frequency of usual drinking, for violence-related injuries and separately for non-violence related injuries. Relative risk (RR) for a violence-related injury was significantly greater than for injuries from other causes across all countries (pooled RR=22.22 vs. 4.33), but the magnitude of risk varied considerably (ranging from 4.68 in Spain to 942 in Canada). Pooled effect size was found to be heterogeneous across countries, and was explained, in part, by the level of detrimental drinking pattern in a country. Risk for a violence-related injury was not significantly different by age (&lt;30 and 30+), reporting 5 or more drinks on at least one occasion during the last year, or reporting symptoms of alcohol dependence. A number of methodological concerns suggest that risk of a violence-related injury compared to injuries from other causes may be inflated, and such variables as context of drinking should be taken into consideration in establishing relative risk and alcohol attributable fraction of violence-related injury across countries and cultures.","650":"Despite the relatively high prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), associations of ASPD with clinical presentation of PTSD, including additional comorbidity, have not been investigated.

This study used the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations to examine mental health service utilization among 155 African Americans and Whites with severe mental illness for 12 months after discharge from a residential crisis program. This cross-sectional study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial. Race did not emerge as a significant predictor of mental health service utilization. Factors associated with frequency of service use were diagnosis, age, drug use, gender, health benefit status, and enrollment in an outpatient mental health program. It is possible that the geographic location of the study, equal access to services, and equal rates of substance use between racial groups explain the lack of racial differences found in this sample.

Previous studies have increased scholars' understanding about how and when identity changes occur in those with schizophrenia; less is understood about the process by which individuals with schizophrenia reconstruct their self-identity. The objective of this study is to describe the process of self-identity reconstruction in people with schizophrenia. A grounded theory study was conducted with 10 purposively selected participants and 4 significant others; 19 semistructured interviews were completed. Constant comparative analysis led to a theory of a six-stage process of self-recovery in those with schizophrenia. For some participants, the successful struggle to care for a new self led to the refinement and eventual recovery of self-identity. Individuals with schizophrenia experience a process of distinct changes in self-identity occurring between engulfment by a severe mental illness and emergence of a new self. ","661":"Emerging evidence from longitudinal studies has suggested that many with schizophrenia can meaningfully recover over time. Recovery, though, is not a uniform process but varies from person to person and can involve a range of different experiences including the attainment of psychosocial milestones, the remission of symptoms, and changes in self-experience or personal narrative. To address the issue of recovery from schizophrenia, this article reviews currently evolving definitions of recovery and possible ways to understand recovery as involving both an objective and two subjective dimensions. Emerging operational definitions are explored and then empirical research is reviewed regarding actual rates and forms of recovery. It is concluded that although many with schizophrenia experience significant challenges linked with illness over time, more people than not experience meaningful periods of relative wellness. Implications for how daily practice can reinforce and promote recovery are discussed.","662":"The high rates of tobacco use among individuals with schizophrenia are well documented, but there has been less attention paid to identifying what are the special needs for this population. In fact, there have even been suggestions from early work that standard interventions and approaches might be adequate. In contrast, based on more than a decade of experience supporting change smoking behavior among people with schizophrenia, three key factors were identified as unique considerations that are associated with success. The first factor involves readiness to change; smokers with schizophrenia are rarely given opportunities to even try to quit unlike their counterparts in the general population and therefore have not benefited from the self-efficacy aspects of attempt experiences. The second factor is medication and symptom monitoring; there are special needs for nurses and medical staff to monitor symptoms (including schizophrenia symptoms and mood symptoms), medication dosage and side-effects, during the period when individuals with schizophrenia are changing (reducing) their tobacco use, particularly when nicotine replacement therapy is being implemented. Finally, the third factor is peer and caregiver support; the use of peer assistants in group-based programs and the teaching of nurses and other professional casegivers as well as family members about their role as supports can make an important difference in tipping the balance toward successful change and toward maintenance of change over time.","663":"Men and women with schizophrenia suffer not only from their illness but also from the side effects of their medications. To review the toll of antipsychotic side effects specifically on women. A review of the literature in the PubMed database since 1990 using search terms: sex difference, antipsychotics, schizophrenia, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics and retrieving additional publications from the reference lists of the original articles. Findings suggest that, because of differing pharmacokinetics, women are more vulnerable than men to weight gain secondary to antipsychotics and to the consequences (metabolic, cardiovascular, reproductive) of weight gain. They are also more vulnerable to hyperprolactinemia and QTc prolongation. Dosing guidelines need to be critically appraised. The greater toll of side effects in women may undermine adherence to prescribed treatments, add to the stigma that attaches to mental illness, and diminish the quality of women's lives. Side effects increase the cost of mental illness and heighten the burden experienced by caregivers. They exacerbate morbidity and raise mortality rates.

Patient records revealed no significant differences between recorded indices of disruptive patient behavior before or after the smoking room opening. The staff survey identified a perceived beneficial impact on unit atmosphere, where less time was spent discussing smoking privileges and off-unit privileges were granted more appropriately.

Each participant was asked to describe the experience of undergoing rTMS for depression treatment and encouraged to provide as much details as possible. Four preliminary themes emerged to describe participants' experiences of rTMS for depression treatment: (a) a narrative of frustration and helplessness with medication treatment resistance, (b) the sensory experience of rTMS, (c) mindfulness- an enhanced awareness of the content of consciousness, and (d) the importance of connection with clinicians. Preliminary results of this phenomenological study make the struggle of persons with treatment-resistant depression more visible and should assist clinicians to understand how rTMS is experienced by depressed persons undergoing treatment. Moreover, results shed new light on the changes participants observe and describe with rTMS and the high value they place on a therapeutic relationship with clinicians administering treatment.

However, the experience of \"being misunderstood\" is more prevalent in patients' relationships with health care providers. Negative consequences such as vulnerability, dehumanization, and frustration reveal that being misunderstood has the potential to damage or destroy therapeutic relationships. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to examine mental health patients' experiences of being misunderstood. Data consisted of transcripts from 20 interviews with community-dwelling adults with mental illness, which were analyzed using an existential phenomenological approach.

The study sample consisted of 302 adults in inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment facilities, who completed a set of instruments that included the Ecological Assessment of Substance Abuse Experiences (EASE), a new instrument designed to measure the influence of social context referents on addiction and recovery attachment processes. Results showed that all three contextual indicators moderated relationships among social context referenced attitudes, drug use concern, and intention to change drug using behaviors.

In this article, the authors describe how magnet forces that focus on empowering nurses, empowering evidence-based care, and strengthening unit-based leadership have the potential for generating transformational change at the point of service. Engaging in the recovery movement within the magnet structure may generate innovations critical to the growth of the specialty.

The study explored the lived experience of growing up as a young Latino MSM and motivators to HIV risk behaviors. Five young Latino MSM ages 18 to 25 years were enrolled in a qualitative, phenomenological study using semistructured interviews followed by a HIV risk-taking behavior survey. A relationship was identified between patterns of belonging and self-acceptance of sexual orientation and motivators of HIV sexual risk-taking behavior. La familia, machismo, hiding, and guilt were themes related to belonging and self-acceptance. The need to belong and be accepted by the family and self-acceptance of sexual orientation are related to the HIV sexual risk-taking behavior of young Latino MSM.

","721":"BACKGROUND Adolescents with substance-abusing parents need interventions to reduce their risk for a variety of problems. School-based support groups (SBSGs) have been proposed to increase resilience in this population. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate a SBSG for adolescents with substance-abusing parents. STUDY DESIGN The randomized, controlled study was conducted with high-school students (n = 109) to evaluate the impact of SBSGs on resiliency. Resiliency was operationalized as positive physical health, mental health, and risk behaviors in the presence of adverse life events. Data were collected pre- and postintervention. RESULTS Significant improvements in knowledge of substance abuse were noted. Findings suggested gender differences in coping and health outcomes and positive trends in substance use. CONCLUSIONS SBSGs may increase resilience in this at-risk population. However, there were gender differences in response to the intervention, and group facilitators should be aware that participants' gender may influence response to the groups.

Ecological sampling departs from laboratory study norms, with implications for analysis. To inform ecological study designs, this article compares salivary cortisol levels and effect sizes of \"focal\" psychiatric factors, such as trauma history, posttraumatic stress diagnosis, comorbidity, and chronic stress, and \"nuisance\" factors, including endocrine disorders and medications and physiological factors such as gestational age and smoking. This is a descriptive analysis of ecologically collected cortisol specimens, assayed in an ongoing perinatal psychobiological study, addressing methodological considerations. Focal and nuisance factors are often interdependent with similar effect sizes. Careful specimen deletion decisions and model specification are needed to achieve the hoped-for external validity while maintaining internal validity. Results of multivariate models lend support to the validity and usefulness of an ecological approach to incorporating biomarkers in health research. J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc, 2008; 14(4), 285-296.

This article uses salivary cortisol specimens collected early in a perinatal mental health study to describe (a) return rate and returner characteristics, (b) adherence to procedures, (c) sources of laboratory error, (d) effects of deleting specimens with \"nuisance\" factors, and (e) effects that selection bias could have on cortisol concentration distribution. This includes methodological analysis of collection, assay, and preanalysis decision components. Rates of return do not differ by participants' sociodemographic, perinatal, or psychiatric characteristics. Excluding smokers affects representativeness. Selection bias in favor of more or less disadvantaged participants affects cortisol distribution. The large yield of useable specimens permits multivariate modeling of cortisol level in association with health outcomes, potentially enhancing ecological validity.

The HIPAA regulations, using the principle of patient autonomy were designed to increase patient's control over the all health related information. The Department of Health and Human Services did not identify rules related to research regulations believing HIPAA regulations facilitate investigations through use of de-identified information. Yet, under HIPAA guidelines, health care agencies can not allow access because of the need to obtain a patient's prior permission to release raw data. The problem of how to conduct investigations in the face of the HIPAA \"Privacy Rule\" raises concerns for effects on subject recruitment and selection.

This study examined the prescribing practices of advanced practice nurses attending a psychopharmacology continuing education program. Participants were surveyed about (a) first-line strategies for the treatment of major depression and first-episode psychosis and (b) choices for managing insomnia and the side effect of weight gain. Participants completed an onsite questionnaire regarding advanced practice characteristics and management of specific clinical situations. The majority of prescribing advanced practice nurses surveyed were psychiatric-mental health specialists. Approximately two thirds (65.9%) of the advanced practice nurses prescribed psychotropic medications, most often for depression. First-choice agents for depression and first-episode psychosis were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (97.3%) and atypical antipsychotics (93.9%), respectively. Interventions for insomnia and medication-related weight gain were more varied.

Although research indicates that survivors often report that interactions with health care professionals are distressing, little is known about what renders these encounters helpful or hurtful. The purpose of this study was to use Hildegard Peplau's (1952) conceptualization of nurses' helping roles (i.e., stranger, resource person, teacher, leadership, surrogate, counselor, technical expert) in nurse-client interactions to explore how survivors of sexual violence perceive their encounters with health care professionals. Content analysis was conducted on the transcripts of 60 minimally structured interviews in which participants discussed their experiences of sexual violence. The results revealed that the helping roles of counselor and technical expert, as identified by Peplau, were most important to survivors of sexual violence. Regardless of role, participants perceived health care professionals to be helpful when they exhibited interpersonal sensitivity, especially in regard to the participants' experiences with violence. The findings indicate that health care professionals need to maintain an attentive and compassionate stance when working with survivors of sexual violence.
