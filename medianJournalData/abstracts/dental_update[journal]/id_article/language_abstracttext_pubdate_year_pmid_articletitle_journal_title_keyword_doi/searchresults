plastic and aesthetic surgery are gaining significant momentum owing to the increasing aesthetic demands by patients. Along with the fulfilment of aesthetic needs, it is imperative that clinicians also enhance function. From these two important viewpoints, subepithelial connective tissue grafting remains an optimum treatment choice for periodontists when treating gingival recession defects accompanied by periodontal attachment apparatus breakdown. Clinical relevance: Subepithelial connective tissue grafting is a successful procedure in its dual role of gingival recession coverage and predictable periodontal regeneration.","3":"All dental restorations are liable to failure during function. Failure could be biologic, aesthetic, mechanical or a combination. Ceramic restorations in particular, including metal-ceramics, are prone to mechanical fracture, especially the fracture of veneering porcelain. Fracture of a metal-ceramic restoration jeopardizes function as well as aesthetics. It is equally onerous to manage for both patient and dentist. Optimal management of such cases requires a detailed knowledge of the aetiology behind this phenomenon. The current paper aims to highlight possible causative factors involved in the mechanical failures of metal-ceramic restorations. Clinical relevance: Ceramic fracture in metal-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures is routinely encountered in dental clinics. Knowledge of the aetiology is required to diagnose and manage such cases accurately as well as to avoid these errors in future.","4":"We report a case of a mandibular arteriovenous malformation in a 3-year-old child, who attended our department, and have carried out a literature review.\nClinical relevance: Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare condition but clinicians need to be aware of it as this lesion can have potentially life-threatening complications due to massive haemorrhage.","5":null,"6":"popularity as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. The purpose of this article is to determine the applicability of VRET in the treatment of dental phobia of two patients. Two case examples of female dental patients, aged 56 and 24 years, who met the criteria for dental phobia according to the Phobia Checklist, illustrate the use of VRET in the dental setting. VRET that is used as a psychological treatment for dental fear and dental phobia can potentially be given by a non-specialist (for example dental assistant), thereby making it a cost-effective therapy for the treatment of dental phobia.\nClinical relevance: This article is the first of its kind to demonstrate Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) in the treatment of dental anxiety.","7":"This case describes the oral rehabilitation of a patient following maxillary hemi-section due to squamous cell carcinoma of the palate. Planned treatment was construction of a maxillary implant-supported obturator. Two dental implants were placed in his maxilla to aid the support and retention of an obturator. However, owing to bone availability, their angulation was suboptimal and compromised the retention of the obturator. This case describes alternative implant attachments to aid the retention and stability of implant-retained dentures constructed in cases with suboptimal implant placement. Clinical relevance: This case highlights the importance of careful planning for implant placement, and reinforces the need to plan the prostheses before implant surgery. This case highlights possible difficulties that can arise if implants are non-ideally angulated, and how to adapt restorations to manage such difficulties in cases with maxillary removable prostheses.","8":"Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a commonly used analgesic; its 'over the counter' availability, low cost and popularity amongst patients often make it the first choice for dental pain. It is in this that its potential toxicity, made more complicated by the ever extending range of paracetamol-containing products, make the understanding of this medication key to the safe management of patients presenting to surgery with dental pain. Clinical relevance: The purpose of this article is to supply dental practitioners with the knowledge to manage patients who present having taken an oral supra-therapeutic paracetamol overdose. Consideration is given to those patients who can be treated safely in primary care and to those who require transfer to Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E).","9":"The first paper of this three-part series discussed periodontal disease pathogenesis and highlighted elements in the clinical assessment which will help the clinician to establish the diagnosis of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. This second paper will focus on the management of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. Finally, the diagnosis and management of chronic and aggressive periodontitis will be reviewed in the third part of the series using two clinical examples. Clinical relevance: This paper aims to provide the general dental practitioner with an understanding of the aim of periodontal treatment, the management of chronic and aggressive periodontitis and the prognosis of periodontally involved teeth.","10":"This is the second-part of this three-part series. The first paper discussed the occlusal and cracked tooth aetiological factors which may be responsible for restoration failure.

This was set up to limit the surgical treatment of these teeth to symptomatic patients. There are numerous risks involved with surgical treatment of mandibular third molars and these should be explained in detail to the patient. Common and serious complications of mandibular third molar surgery are damage to the inferior alveolar and lingual nerve. Predicting the risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury is useful for treatment planning. The orthopantomogram (OPT) is the baseline special test for assessing this and numerous signs on an OPT can predict an increased risk of injury to the nerve. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is being more frequently used to assess this relationship further and can influence treatment planning. Coronectomy is a technique whereby the crown of the tooth is sectioned and removed leaving the roots in situ. This has proven to be a useful technique in high risk cases, but is not without its own complications. The increase in availability of CBCT imaging and the recent resurgence of coronectomy as a treatment modality can increase the number of treatment options available to patients. We have proposed an algorithm to aid the treatment planning and informed consent processes associated with mandibular third molar surgery.

Over recent years, it has also been used in other healthcare products as well as in cosmetics. Anaphylaxis to chlorhexidine has been increasingly reported throughout the world, including two incidents in the UK where chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash had been used to wash tooth sockets following recent tooth extraction. Chlorhexidine is under-recognized as a cause of anaphylaxis and dentists should be aware of its potential for serious adverse effects. Dentists need to consider whether the washing out of a tooth socket with chlorhexidine solution should be avoided in the treatment of established dry socket. On current evidence the potential risks of using chlorhexidine as irrigation solution for treating an established dry socket appears to outweigh any known benefit. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Chlorhexidine has the potential to cause anaphylaxis in the dental surgery.","125":"Syphilis is on the increase globally. While recognized more frequently in patients with, HIV\/AIDS, it is not unusual among immune competent individuals sometimes presenting with unusual manifestations and\/or behaviour.

The aetiology of BMS remains an enigma. Recent evidence suggests it likely to be neuropathic in origin, the cause of which remains unknown. There is no cure for this condition and the unfortunate patients remain managed on a variety of neuropathic pain medication, salivary substitutes and other non-medical interventions that help the patient 'get through the day'. Some simple strategies can assist both clinician and patient to manage this debilitating condition. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: The dental team will recognize patients presenting with burning mouth syndrome. They are difficult patients to manage and are often referred to secondary care and, ultimately, depend on their general medical practitioners for pain management.","127":"Controversy exists surrounding resin-bonded bridges (RBBs), particularly with regards to abutment preparation. Should the abutments be prepared? If the abutments are prepared what design should be adopted? If there is to be no preparation, will there be space for the restoration? Many factors need consideration when planning for this treatment. This article aims to explore the effect of abutment preparation. In this regard, a literature review was conducted to present the latest available evidence. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Minimal intervention is key in modern dentistry, so clinicians must be able to make confident decisions in the provision of minimally invasive treatments like the RBB and be aware of the latest evidence.","128":"This report provides important background information on osteoporosis (OP) and bone complications of cancer for the dental team, and discusses why bisphosphonate (BP) therapy is vital for patients with the two conditions. It also addresses several questions, including in particular: 'Is withholding BP therapy the best way to prevent osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurrence?' Also,'Of the two, which is more important: ONJ or OP fracture prevention?' CPD\/Clinical Relevance: BP therapy offers OP patients the promise of a fracture-free life and the prevention of fracture-related pain, disability, loss of qualify of life (QOL) and the shortening of life. Without BP therapy, the lifetime risk of fracture occurrence in OP patients is as high as 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men; whilst using it, the relative risk of ONJ occurrence is as low as between 1 in 10, 000 and 1 in 100, 000. To cancer patients with bone complications, it offers the much needed pain relief and improvement in QOL. In cancer patients, the risk of ONJ is almost 100 times higher but, despite that, oncologists advocate BP therapy for virtually all the patients. Therefore, when prescribed, BP therapy merits the whole-hearted support of the dental team.","129":"Clinicians are often faced with endodontic cases that are significantly more challenging than the primary root canal treatment of mature adult teeth.

This will significantly impact UK dentistry, given the still extensive use of amalgam in U.K. general dental practice. However, until now there has been little national discussion or debate. In Spring 2015, The British Society of Prosthodontics dedicated a significant part of its Annual Conference to debating the implications of this issue. Clinical case examples were discussed with audience interaction and voting facilitated using innovative Audience Response System Technology. A remarkable range of concerns and opinions were given. The debate elicited specific concerns amongst clinicians regarding the suitability of mercury-free alternatives to amalgam; particularly where cavities are large and extend beneath the gingival anatomy. There are also anecdotal reports of Dental Foundation (DF) dentists not being adequately taught the use of dental amalgam in undergraduate dental schools. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Many clinicians, especially those treating patients for whom moisture control is challenging, feel that amalgam should remain available for clinicians to choose in certain clinical circumstances for the restoration of posterior teeth, even in the event of a complete phase-down.","194":"","195":"","196":"","197":"","198":"","199":"","200":"","201":"","202":"The practitioner may have difficulties making decisions regarding the most appropriate therapeutic approach in the case of the persistence of periodontal pockets after initial periodontal treatment.

CPD\/Clinical Relevance: NHS dental services need to evolve and address the challenges inherent in caring for vulnerable migrants. Education and appropriate training needs to be developed for the dental profession in order to enable new ways of promoting intersectoral care and community engagement.","223":"Macrodontia is a rare dental abnormality, which can cause cosmetic concerns. Various management techniques for this condition have been documented in the literature. This case describes the initial management of macrodontia in the mixed dentition stage with the use of a minimally invasive approach to treatment. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: The importance of early referral of dental abnormities is highlighted. Short- and long-term treatment options for macrodontia are described, including the impact such anomalies can have on the developing dentition.","224":"Enamel opacities can appear as white, cream, yellow or brown patches. They can result from developmental or acquired conditions. The diagnosis, severity of the opacity and patient's desire for treatment guide the clinician when choosing the correct management option. Microabrasion is indicated for surface opacities, whereas bleaching can treat opacities deep within the tooth. When these techniques have failed to achieve the desired result, camouflaging the opacity with composite resin may be useful. Novel techniques, such as infiltrating or sealing the opacity, can alter enamel's refractive index, offering further treatment choices. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: There are many conservative treatments available which can improve the appearance of enamel opacities.","225":"Intracoronal resorption of the permanent dentition in cases of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare finding which poses an added complication to the already complex management of this condition. This paper presents three cases of AI associated with delayed eruption of permanent teeth in which asymptomatic intracoronal resorption occurred. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: This paper highlights the fact that teeth affected with amelogenesis imperfecta may undergo asymptomatic intracoronal resorption which is only identifiable radiographically.","226":"Part 2 of this series of two articles addresses the Hall Technique for preformed metal crowns. It will discuss the need for an effective child and dentist friendly method to restore carious primary molars. The technique is described in detail and the evidence for its effectiveness and acceptance by children, parents, dentists and dental educators is presented. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Dentists and dental care professionals should be aware of the evidence to support the adoption of the Hall Technique.","227":"This article details the clinical techniques for conventional preformed metal crown placement. It aims to increase the readers' awareness of the clinical advantages of preformed metal crowns and the indications for their use. The second part will discuss the Hall Technique.

Globodontia is characterized by distinctively bulbous, enlarged crowns of molar and primary canine teeth. Anomalies including taurodontism and hypodontia also occur. We report on the dental treatment and multidisciplinary management of an eight-year-old girl with this rare condition. Referral to Clinical Genetics and Oral Pathology was instrumental in establishing a diagnosis of otodental syndrome for this young patient and her mother, who had similar dental defects. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: To increase awareness among practitioners of this rare dental disorder and highlight the need for multidisciplinary management of such cases.","229":"Interproximal reduction (IPR) has become particularly popular with the use of removable aligners. Clinical and ethical factors concerning the use of interproximal reduction to facilitate orthodontic alignment are discussed. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: An understanding of the aetiological factors of a malocclusion is essential to enable full discussion of the risks and benefits, or the alternatives to IPR.","230":"Which materials should be used to restore primary teeth? The second part in this series summarizes the current evidence base relating to this question, and describes the biological approach to caries management. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Our decisions regarding material choices should be based, where possible, on up-to-date evidence. This will help to ensure that the appropriate material is placed in the appropriate clinical scenario.","231":"Dental caries is a disease that affects many people, including children, and presents numerous challenges to healthcare providers. As clinicians it is important that we consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating carious primary teeth, and make an informed decision about when it is appropriate or not. This paper describes the background to the treatment of carious primary teeth, looking at the differences between primary and permanent teeth, and the relevance of this. It also suggests points to consider when looking at restoration survival studies, as the ability to appraise the literature critically is important for us all in this 'evidence-based' age. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Our early life experiences have the ability to shape our future attitudes and behaviour. Children with carious teeth require careful management so that pain and suffering is minimized, and positive attitudes towards dentistry are fostered.","232":"","233":"","234":"","235":"","236":"Patients taking bisphosphonates and other anti-resorptive drugs are likely to attend general dental practice. The term 'bisphosphonate'is often immediately associated with osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). Risk assessment and subsequent management of these patients should be carried out taking into account all the risk factors associated with ONJ. The introduction of newer drugs, also shown to be associated with ONJ, demands increased awareness of general dental practitioners about these medications. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This paper provides an update on medication-related ONJ and considers the effects of anti-resorptive drugs on the management of patients needing exodontia, treatment for periodontal disease and dental implant placement.","237":"A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer. Not all publications contain robust evidence. We endeavour to encapsulate the most important of the latest information and advances now employed in practice, in a form comprehensible to healthcare workers, patients and their carers. This series offers the primary care dental team, in particular, an overview of the aetiopathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and multidisciplinary care of mouth cancer, the functional and psychosocial implications, and minimization of the impact on the quality of life of patient and family. This article offers the dental team an overview of oral potentially malignant disorders. ","238":"Orofacial chronic pain provides a significant challenge to all clinicians and the patients seeking treatment for it. Due to the anatomical and regional complexities, diagnosis can be extremely difficult, and due to the lack of cross specialty training, patients will undergo a variety of treatment under different disciplines. Dysfunctional pain provides a unique challenge for patient management and requires a multidisciplinary team. Lack of recognition of dysfunctional chronic pain can result in inappropriate dental treatment and further damage. to the patient. Appropriate patient reassurance and referral to an orofacial pain multidisciplinary team is recommended as most of these conditions require medical management. ","239":"The management of dental patients taking either antiplatelet medication, anticoagulant medication or both has been well established in the previous literature. Recently, new generations of drugs have emerged which are becoming increasingly common, including direct thrombin inhibitors, factor X inhibitors and a new class of oral thienopyridines. The implications of these drugs for the dental surgeon are not yet fully known. Awareness remains low and there is very little information available within the literature on safe use during surgery. This review paper aims to provide some guidance for dental practitioners performing invasive procedures. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A new generation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs have serious implications for patients undergoing surgery and their use is increasing.","240":"A large number of Class V restorations are placed per annum to restore cervical lesions. This paper evaluates the pathogenesis of these lesions, with particular reference to the role of occlusal factors, and reviews the literature in order to provide advice on the material(s) which are most likely to produce optimal longevity of a Class V restoration. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Resin-modified glass ionomer materials appear to provide optimal survival for a Class V restoration, but a (flowable) comDosite miaht Droduce a better aesthetic result.","241":"The removal of mandibular third molars can be complicated by injury to the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN). Coronectomy retains the tooth root; this method has been found to be preferable to extraction in the context of mandibular third molars. A failed coronectomy may cause mobilization of these roots, thereby requiring a subsequent extraction. Having undergone a previous coronectomy, extraction is then safer as the roots usually migrate away from the IAN. Computed tomography is more accurate than radiography when imaging mandibular third molars pre-operatively owing to its three-dimensional nature. Longer studies need to be conducted to evaluate the long term benefits of coronectomy. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The removal of mandibular third molars can be complicated by the presence of the close lying inferior alveolar nerve. Coronectomy can be useful in this setting and therefore it is important to be aware of the pros and cons of this technique.","242":"The purpose of instrumentation is to facilitate irrigation and allow controlled obturation. This article will revisit methods of instrumentation of the root canal system with consideration given to length determination, apical preparation and the concept of patency filing. It will discuss hand instrumentation and rotary preparation looking at emerging technology such as reciprocating systems and the self-adjusting file. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mechanical preparation of the root canal system is of fundamental importance in achieving success, creating a more easily managed environment from a biological perspective.","243":"Dentine becomes infected as a result of caries lesion formation on root surfaces and when lesions progress following cavitation of enamel lesions. However, this infection is unimportant because the driving force for lesion formation and progression is the overlying biofilm. This explains why root surface caries can be controlled by mechanical plaque control and fluoride, and restorations are not needed to arrest these lesions. Similarly, the infected dentine in cavitated coronal lesions does not have to be removed to arrest the lesion. If the lesion is either accessible or opened for cleaning by the patient or parent, the lesion can be arrested. Sealing of infected dentine within the tooth, either by a Hall crown in the primary dentition or by partial caries removal prior to placing a well-sealed filling, will also arrest the lesion. When restoring deep lesions in symptomless, vital teeth, vigorous excavation of infected dentine is likely to expose the pulp and make root canal treatment necessary. Thus complete excavation'is not needed and should be avoided. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Root surface caries can be arrested by cleaning and fluoride application. Restorations are not essential. Vigorous excavation of softened dentine in deep cavities of symptomless, vital teeth is contra-indicated. It is not needed and increases the risk of pulp exposure.","244":"","245":"","246":"","247":"The term ectodermal dysplasia (ED) is used to describe a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by abnormalities of two or more ectodermal structures such as the skin, hair, nails, teeth and sweat glands. This paper will give an overview of the aetiology of ED and describe the manifestations and dental management of this condition. In particular, the important role of the dental practitioner in the identification and management of patients with ED will be highlighted. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Dental practitioners should be aware of the oral features of ectodermal dysplasia and be able to make timely referrals and provide appropriate continuing care for these patients.","248":"A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer.

Whilst taking good photographs is just one part of improving record-keeping, the other part, which is arguably the more, important aspect, is to store securely this vast amount of data that is created. This article intends to explore the options available to practices to store the data securely and recommends the easiest and most effective ways available today. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: With clinical photographs becoming ever more important in the field of dentistry, correct storage and use of camera equipment is important.","250":"Neuropathic pain is a significant social and economic burden. Back pain, joint pain and headaches affect over 30% of the population. Chronic orofacial pain is a common condition and is difficult to diagnose and manage. This two-part paper aims to provide an overview of novel understanding of neuropathic pain, and furnish clinical teams with an update on the less common and less well-recognized chronic orofacial conditions. Headaches and temporomandibular disorders are the most common conditions and are covered in separate papers (6 and 10). Trigeminal neuralgia, burning mouth, and trigeminal autonomic cephalgias are also covered in separate papers (7, 8 and 9). The remaining conditions: post-traumatic neuropathy (nerve injury); and persistent idiopathic facial pain and atypical odontalgia are discussed in this and the following paper. Clinical Relevance: Neuropathic pain, though rare, is a consequence of dental treatment. Nerve injury in relation to M3M surgery, dental implants, endodontics and local anaesthesia result in 70% of affected patients experiencing chronic neuropathic pain.","251":"Topical silver nitrate may be used in oral and maxillofacial clinical settings owing to its astringent, caustic and disinfectant properties. Uses of the toughened silver nitrate pencil stick include haemostasis at bleeding points and for the management of aphthous ulcers, hypergranulation tissue, warts and verrucas. We present an interesting case of apparent silver nitrate-induced, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the hard palate following mucosal lesion biopsy in a multiple myeloma patient receiving zoledronic acid intravenous infusions. Our review of the literature indicates that this is the first report of such a scenario. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Clinicians must consider all potential sources of chemical and mechanical trauma to the bone and overlying mucosa when managing patients at risk of developing bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.","252":"Tooth-coloured, resin composite restorations are amongst the most frequently prescribed forms of dental restoration to manage defects in posterior teeth. The attainment of a desirable outcome when placing posterior resin composite restorations requires the clinician to have a good understanding of the benefits (as well as the limitations) posed by this material, together with a sound knowledge of placement technique. Numerous protocols and materials have evolved to assist the dental operator with this type of demanding posterior restoration. With the use of case examples, four techniques available are reported here. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: This article explores varying techniques for the restoration of Class II cavities using resin composite.","253":"Poor access and iatrogenic damage can result in failed root canal treatment. Understanding tooth anatomy improves access and ensures that the clinician is cleaning and shaping the whole root canal system. If a canal is missed treatment usually fails. This paper revisits tooth anatomy and discusses how to ensure that access is optimized, but not at the expense of precious tooth structure. The concept of multi-visit root canal treatment is also addressed with emphasis on the, often overlooked, aspect of temporization. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: Good anatomical knowledge of teeth is the cornerstone of endodontics. Once root treatment has begun the clinician must be logical about how many visits to take and how to temporize teeth between such visits.","254":"This review article considers the development of the Intercollegiate Advisory Committee for Sedation in Dentistry (IACSD) guideline produced by the four dental faculties of the Royal Colleges and the Royal College of Anaesthetists for conscious sedation use in dentistry. An outline of the scope of the document, which aims to set definitive standards for conscious sedation provision within the dental environment, is given. The IACSD guideline sets a national standard for all aspects of dental conscious sedation provision, from training of the team, environment requirements and clinical delivery; it is therefore a requirement that all dentists, doctors and healthcare professionals providing, or supporting, dental conscious sedation are aware of the content. CPD\/Clinical Relevance: This article should help with the understanding of the development background, scope of the guideline and relevance to the dental practice of dental conscious sedation.","255":"","256":"Use a low shrinkage stress composite but, if not, use incremental placement and a layer of flowable at the gingival box; Ensure good bonding to dentine and enamel and avoid (over) etching the dentine; Ensure good adaptation at the gingival floor of a Class II box; Make sure that the restoration has received sufficient light; Provide good isolation; Use reliable and tested materials throughout.","257":"","258":"","259":"","260":"","261":"Tooth surface loss (TSL), the non-carious loss of tooth tissue, is considered pathological if the teeth involved experience sensitivity and pain, are functionally compromised or they detract from the patient's appearance. TSL is a common clinical finding in many patient groups, although differences between the primary and permanent dentition contribute to TSL occurring at a faster rate and with worse outcomes in the primary dentition. This case report presents localized abrasion and associated apical periodontitis affecting a single primary tooth in a 2-year-old infant following the misuse of a babies' dummy clip whilst teething. Abrasion is rare in the primary dentition. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This article highlights an unusual presentation of dental abrasion affecting the primary dentition caused by a previously unreported foreign object; abrasion in this case was a side-effect of soothing the discomfort of teething.","262":"This paper describes the handling evaluation (by a group of practice-based researchers, the PREP Panel) of a recently introduced Light Curing Unit (LCU), the Kerr Demi-Ultra, which possesses a number of novel features such as its ultracapacitor power source, and the Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) which provide the light output being placed close to the tip of the light guide. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Testing of new devices and materials with respect to their handling is of importance, given that an easy to handle device should produce better clinical results than one which is difficult to use.","263":"Multiple Idiopathic Cervical Root Resorption (MICRR) is a rare condition. It initiates at the cemento-enamel junction of multiple teeth. The lesions continue to grow until they unite, thereby undermining the entire coronal structure of affected teeth. Its distribution can vary from a single region to the entire dentition and the number of teeth affected by resorption tends to increase as the condition is followed over time. The teeth themselves appear clinically normal. The aetiology of MICRR is unknown and it is considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion. The condition tends to be progressive. Consequently, root treatments\/surgical curettage and restoration of the lesions have been unsuccessful at arresting the condition. Affected teeth are often extracted in anticipation of catastrophic fracture and have been replaced with partial or complete dentures. In this case report, we describe how a young female patient was dentally managed over 10 years and ultimately rehabilitated with dental implants. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients suspected of having multiple idiopathic cervical root resorption may require specialist, multidisciplinary care and require referral to an appropriate secondary care unit for treatment planning and potential oral rehabilitation.","264":"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited condition presenting early in life and characterized by the accumulation of hyaline-like tissue in the skin as well as various organs. Gingival overgrowth is a significant oral manifestation. This paper highlights how early and essential periodontal intervention may be necessary to improve mastication and subsequent weight gain, and to eliminate pain and improve the patient's quality of life. Here we highlight the key features of this condition and demonstrate how appropriate surgical management can have a significant impact on a patient's wellbeing. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis has a significant impact on patient wellbeing and it is therefore important that clinicians are able to recognize the condition and ensure that patients receive appropriate care and management.","265":"A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer.

This article offers the dental team an overview of the main cancer risk factors, namely tobacco and alcohol, betel and other chewing habits, and environmental factors. ","266":"Class II division 1 malocclusion is common and various methods have been suggested for successful treatment in the growing patient. A number of recent high-quality studies have been undertaken to assess the efficacy of these treatments. We aim to outline the existing best evidence that supports current practice, with a review of the effect of treatment timing on outcome. This will provide a sound evidence-base for General Dental Practitioners for assessing, advising and referring young patients for treatment. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: General Dental Practitioners should understand the management options and optimal time for treating growing patients with a Class II division 1 malocclusion.","267":"Pain is one of the major reasons that lead patients to seek dental care. For the majority of patients, the pain is of odontogenic origin, as a consequence of dental disease. The timely diagnosis and management of dental pain is an essential component of dental care, and this article reminds readers of the common presenting symptoms of simple dental pain, diagnoses and pragmatic management. Pain of odontogenic origin is common, and distressing. However, the pathology is consistent, as are the symptoms, and an understanding of this underpins the careful history-taking that will lead the clinician to the diagnosis. ","268":"This article will discuss the clinical stages in the fabrication of a definitive acrylic hollow box obturator to restore a hard palate defect. The first two papers described the restorative\/surgical planning phase and the principles of obturator design. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Each of the clinical stages required to make a hollow box obturator must be performed to the highest possible standard to ensure than an optimal prosthesis.is fabricated.","269":"Following a diagnosis of irreversible pulpal disease, periapical disease or failed endodontic therapy, the options for the tooth are extraction or root canal treatment. There is increasing evidence that certain factors may allow the clinician to predict the likely outcome of root canal therapy (RCT) and thus better inform the patient of the possible success rates. Should the patient choose root canal treatment, the clinician must also be able to gauge the potential difficulties that may be encountered and consequently determine whether it is within their competency. CPD\/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Assessing outcomes and complexity of care is an essential part of informed consent. Knowing when to refer is an essential component of best clinical practice.","270":"","271":"","272":"","273":"","274":"","275":"Sweet's syndrome is a relatively rare but important skin condition which can affect the oral cavity.

Causes of recurrent oral ulceration are numerous and there may be an association with underlying systemic disease. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most common underlying diagnosis in children. The discomfort of oral ulcers can impact negatively on quality of life of a child, interfering with eating, speaking and may result in missed school days. The role of the general dental practitioner is to identify patients who can be treated with simple measures in primary dental care and those who require assessment and treatment in secondary care. Management may include topical agents for symptomatic relief, topical corticosteroids and, in severe recalcitrant cases, systemic agents may be necessary.","279":"Stem cells are defined as clonogenic, unspecialized cells capable of both selt-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation, contributing to regenerating specific tissues. For years, restorative treatments have exploited the lifelong regenerative potential of dental pulp stem cells to give rise to tertiary dentine, which is therapeutically employed for direct and indirect pulp capping. Current applications of stem cells in endodontic research have revealed their potential to continue root development in necrotic immature teeth and transplanted\/replanted teeth. Successful application of pulp revascularization is highlighted here with support of a clinical case report. This article also discusses the role of dental stem cells as a promising tool for regeneration of individual tissue types like dentine, pulp and even an entire functional tooth.","280":"This article aims to discuss the clinical features, radiological assessment, histopathology and management of a variety of odontogenic cysts. It also highlights the reclassification of odontogenic keratocysts to keratocystic odontogenic tumours.","281":"Pain-related temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is one of the top three most common chronic pain conditions, along with headaches and back pain. TMD has complex pathophysiology and significant associations with a variety of other chronic pain conditions, eg fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and migraine. Chronic TMD is associated with a negative impact upon quality of life and high levels of healthcare utility. It is important that clinicians are able to diagnose TMD correctly, provide appropriate management in keeping with current evidence-based practice, and identify when to refer patients to specialist care. The presence of risk factors, eg anxiety, depression, pain-related disability and chronic pain conditions elsewhere in the body, may help to identify which TMD patients require referral for multidisciplinary management. TMD should be managed using a holistic approach, incorporating patient education and encouragement towards self-management. TMD care pathways should consider using the three'pillars'of pain management: physical therapies, pharmacotherapy and clinical psychology.","282":"The incidence of toothwear in the population is increasing, as is the number of referrals regarding this problem to secondary care dental hospital consultants and specialists. This paper outlines current theories in aetiology, diagnosis and management of localized and generalized toothwear, as well as describing clinical tips for assessing such patients.","283":"Facial skin lesions are common; patients may present with a.nodule, crack, ulcer or abnormal discoloration of the skin that is not normally present. Ideally, dentists should include face examination in their routine clinical examination. Any suspicious lesion should be referred to a dermatologist as an early diagnosis and treatment could be life-saving. This article will discuss the diagnosis and treatment of common lesions of the face.","284":"A lot of effort has been directed towards developing dental implant surfaces which in turn have seen the increased success rate of osseointegration. Peri-implantitis and peri-implant mucositis are inflammatory conditions of implants that can lead to implant failure. Monitoring and maintaining implant restorations is aimed at preventing these complications.","285":"Sugars are used by the industry to enhance the attractiveness of foods and drinks. These added sugars, or 'free sugars', are not easily identified in food or drink labels. Certain manufactured foods and drinks with 'safe' names, such as dried fruit and fruit juice, still contain free sugars and can be confusing. Guidance states that daily consumption of free sugars should be less than 10% of total energy intake (no more than 5% in the UK). However, it is found that both tooth decay and obesity are associated with consumption of free sugars in large quantities and at inappropriate times.","286":"","287":"","288":"","289":"","290":"","291":"","292":"","293":"","294":"Aesthetic treatment may be patient driven and usually by a 'want', rather than a 'need'. This paper describes the management of a patient who presented with aesthetic wants and clinical needs, both of which were caused as a result of unsuccessful aesthetic treatment which the patient had received previously. The diagnostic process, discussion of the treatment plan and clinical procedures, which produced a satisfactory result, are described and illustrated. Clinical Relevance: This case demonstrates that aesthetic treatment may commit the patient to future dental treatment needs, particularly if treatment provided is poorly planned and carried out to an unsatisfactory standard.","295":"The techniques described in this article are based on facial measurements and an analysis of the patient's existing dentures to provide measurements that will enable registration blocks to be constructed for individual patients rather than the arbitrarily produced block more commonly seen. Employing the methods shown will lead to a saving in clinical time and contribute to a more accurate registration. It is important to remember that the technician can only provide occlusal registration blocks of the appropriate dimensions if the clinician has assessed the patient and existing dentures and then passed this information to the laboratory. Clinical Relevances: Being able to assess the clinical suitability of a patient's existing dentures and then take measurements from those dentures will allow occlusal registration blocks to be constructed that have the correct dimensions and anatomical features for a particular patient. This will save time during the registration stage and help to improve accuracy.","296":"Fortunately, needle fracture is a rare complication following the administration of dental local anaesthetic. We present a case of needle fracture following administration of an inferior dental nerve block. The fractured needle was retrieved successfully under general anaesthetic. We also provide some suggestions on how to prevent needle fracture, and advice on how to manage the situation should it arise. Clinical Relevance: Dental practitioners are the largest user group of local anaesthesia in the UK. It is important that practitioners are aware of the risks to the patient of needle fracture, how to minimize the risk of this occurring and be aware of how to manage the situation should it arise.","297":"Seen through the author's eyes on the basis of his practising dentistry for almost three decades, light-activated flowable resin restoratives (FRCs) or, in common clinical dental terminology, flowable composites have gradually gained major importance in restorative dentistry. Inputs to this ongoing trend are coming from continuous improvements in material properties and the favourable handling characteristics experienced with this particular group of restoratives. Intended to be used in direct adhesive filling procedures, the number and variety of recent generations of flowable composites for lining, restoration of all cavity classes (I-V), core build-ups and, more recently, 'bulk-fill-restorations', however, necessitates a profound clinical understanding of the selective use of flowable composites to ensure clinical success and guarantee long-term high quality results. Clinical relevance: Today's flowable composites allow for reliable restoration of all kinds of defects. However, both the handling characteristics and the material properties of FRCs must be fully understood before taking advantage of their potentially excellent clinical performance.","298":"A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer.

It is important for this relatively silent deformity to be identified early and referred appropriately as a delay in diagnosis may affect the patient's quality of speech in the long-term. This paper presents a case of submucous cleft palate which was diagnosed late (age 14). Nevertheless, by the appropriate intervention of the multidisciplinary cleft team, the patient was treated successfully. Clinical Relevance. Dentists and doctors need to be aware of the signs and symptoms associated with submucous cleft palate so that they can refer the patient to an appropriate specialist centre for further investigation and treatment. Moreover, patients with this condition are shown to have a higher incidence of dental abnormalities, such as hypodontia and peg-shaped laterals.","300":"In order to understand the underlying principles of orofacial pain it is important to understand the corresponding anatomy and mechanisms. Paper 1 of this series explains the central nervous and peripheral nervous systems relating to pain. The trigeminal nerve is the 'great protector' of the most important region of our body. It is the largest sensory nerve of the body and over half of the sensory cortex is responsive to any stimulation within this system. This nerve is the main sensory system of the branchial arches and underpins the protection of the brain, sight, smell, airway, hearing and taste, underpinning our very existence. The brain reaction to pain within the trigeminal system has a significant and larger reaction to the threat of, and actual, pain compared with other sensory nerves. We are physiologically wired to run when threatened with pain in the trigeminal region and it is a 'miracle' that patients volunteer to sit in a dental chair and undergo dental treatment. Clinical Relevance: This paper aims to provide the dental and medical teams with a review of the trigeminal anatomy of pain and the principles of pain assessment.","301":"This is the second paper in this two-part series. Paper one provided an overview of managing gingival tissue excess and paper two will focus on increasing clinical crown height to facilitate restorative treatment. Crown lengthening is a surgical procedure aimed at the removal of gingival tissue with or without adjunctive bone removal. The different types of procedure undertaken will be discussed over the two papers. In order to provide predictable restorations, care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the margins. If this is not taken into account it can lead to an impingement on the biologic width, which may in turn lead to chronic inflammation resulting in recession or the development of periodontal problems which can be hard to manage. Clinical Relevance: This paper aims to reinforce the need for thorough diagnosis and treatment planning and provides an overview of the various procedures that can be undertaken.","302":"In the second of two papers, management of orthodontic emergencies involving appliances other than Fixed appliances will be detailed. Problems relating to removable appliances, as well as other orthodontic adjuncts, will be discussed. Unfortunately, orthodontic appliance breakage does occur, despite the clinicians giving clear and concise instructions to the patients and their parents at fitting. If general dental practitioners have a practical knowledge of how to diagnose problems and to provide appropriate advice or timely 'emergency' treatment, this will significantly reduce the inconvenience for all parties concerned. It should also ensure that treatment progresses in the most efficient and comfortable manner for their patients. In specific situations the early, accurate identification of the problem and instigation of its appropriate management can avoid more serious consequences. Clinical Relevance: Appropriate handling of an orthodontic 'emergency' by the dentist can, on many occasions, provide immediate relief to the patient. This will, in turn, allow treatment to continue in the right direction, thus allowing more efficient and effective use of valuable resources.","303":"This paper explores the implications of the Francis Report for education of the dental team. It considers selection of candidates for training, issues relating to the curriculum itself, including assessment and the importance of listening to trainees. The overriding importance of the 'informal' or 'hidden' curriculum, through which students and trainees observe their teachers and develop a sense of the professional and ethical culture within an educational institution, is stressed. Clinical relevance: Sound education, rooted in the recognized ethical principles highlighted in the Francis Report, is essential to the delivery of a dental work force that will deliver care according to the fundamental standards laid down by the GDC.","304":"The relational elements of care are often described as'soft skills'or'nice to have'but not essential in the modern world of evidence-based healthcare. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, this type of language relegates person-centred approaches to a lower status compared to other key aspects of quality, such as safety or financial performance. Person-centredness is a powerful underpinning philosophy that has the potential to transform the way we deliver care and support as well as enhancing the quality of services. However, our healthcare system will not become more person-centred of its own accord. Thoughtful, deliberate action is required to support this change. Clinical relevance: The person-centred approach is vital in achieving safe, effective, efficient care.","305":"The Francis Report into the deaths at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust highlighted the problems facing the NHS when patients, families, clinicians and nurses are not heard, and where the management, leadership and ensuing culture are focused on the system's business, not patient care. This paper, the first in a series based on the implications of the Francis Report, provides the background and context for the subsequent 'perspective' articles from a range of relevant stakeholders and care-providers. The overriding message is that in all areas of healthcare, dentistry included, the quality of patient care, especially patient safety, must be placed above all other aims. Clinical Relevance: The overriding importance of patient-centredness and quality of care, above all other aims, is the key message of clinical relevance from the Francis Report.","306":"","307":"","308":"","309":"In recent times there has been raised interest regarding the use of articaine hydrochloride as a dental local anaesthetic solution. The use of articaine hydrochloride as a dental local anaesthetic agent has been reported to be safe and effective. Paraesthesia is a rare but unwanted adverse effect attributed to the use of this local anaesthetic in dentistry, particularly following the administration of a nerve block injection. There is no evidence to support the opinion that the use of articaine carries a greater associated risk of paraesthesia than with the use of any other local anaesthetic. Clinical Relevance: The aim of this article is to review the relative merits of articaine hydrochloride against its documented potential drawbacks. The article will also aim to update readers on the use of articaine hydrochloride for local analgesia in dentistry, including the pharmacology, efficacy and safety concerns (including the risks of nerve paraesthesia) commonly associated with the administration of this agent.","310":"The flux of patients seeking to make changes to the appearance of their smile zone appears to be on a pathway of continual increase. This is possibly due to an increase in awareness towards oral health, and perhaps social, peer and media pressures, respectively. Cohorts of dental practitioners have thus responded to the latter demands by attending a plethora of educational courses, often focusing on either restorative techniques or other disciplines, notably orthodontics and clear aligners in particular. Consequently, treatment planning and thus treatment provision may carry the risk of being biased or indeed 'outcome driven' whereby the skills and knowledge of any clinician towards a particular faculty may significantly influence the ultimate treatment plan, with the unfortunate tendency sometimes to overlook the role of the interdisciplinary approach of concomitant restorative and contemporary techniques. The role of orthodontics to facilitate the provision of such treatment, along with predictable enamel bonding, has the distinct advantage of providing an acceptable aesthetic result with minimal biological intervention. However, to achieve an optimal result in such cases requires meticulous treatment planning and patient selection to avoid pitfalls with regards to long-term stability and function. This article suggests a standardized approach to patient assessment, with an interdisciplinary perspective in mind. Clinical Relevance: With the growth of patient demand for improving the appearance of the smile, a meticulous assessment protocol is required along with effective interdisciplinary communication. This enables a comprehensive treatment plan to be developed with the correct priorities.","311":"Patients who suffer dento-alveolar trauma present a unique challenge for the dentist. There are numerous options to consider when attempting to restore the dentition. This article reviews the role of dental implants and how thorough planning and execution of such treatment could result in an optimal outcome. Clinical Relevance: Knowledge of the role of dental implants and factors imperative for a successful treatment outcome will assist the clinician in achieving optimal restorative results.","312":"The use of magnification by dental clinicians when carrying out examinations and treatments is becoming more commonplace. The best instrument for this purpose is the operating microscope which has been shown to enhance quality, longevity and outcome of clinical work as well as facilitating better ergonomics for both the dentist and dental nurse. This paper, the second of two, explores the potential uses for the operating microscope in general dental as well as specialist practice (such as endodontics) and discusses how the interested clinician can use such equipment in a practical manner. Clinical Relevance: The operating microscope enhances the dental surgeon's vision so improving treatment outcomes not only in specialist fields, such as endodontics, but also in many of the disciplines which general dental practice encompasses.","313":"Patients with a hyper-responsive gag reflex pose dentists with a challenging problem. The gag reflex of some patients may be so severe that patients (and operating clinician) may favour extraction of any painful, infected teeth as opposed to more lengthy and complicated procedures such as root canal therapy. However, consistently adopting this approach may render the gagging patient completely edentulous. Such patients may then present to the dental surgeon requesting tooth replacement with some form of denture. This in itself can be a challenging task given the difficulties one may experience whilst taking impressions in this cohort of patients. This article will discuss the prosthetic management of the maxillary arch in edentulous patients with a severe gag reflex. There will be particular emphasis on the aetiology and physiology of the gag reflex, impression-taking techniques to allow the construction of an acrylic training plate (as an interim measure), principles of training plate design and construction of the definitive removable denture. Clinical Relevance: Removable training plates can be used as an interim measure to desensitize edentulous gagging patients before providing them with a definitive removable denture.","314":"This report discusses the challenges, complications and management of traumatic intrusion injuries affecting the permanent dentition. A case is described where trimming of the incisal edge of a severely intruded and ankylosed upper lateral incisor resulted in an unexpected re-eruption of the tooth. It is suggested that the vibrations from drilling may have disrupted the ankylosis, initiating spontaneous re-eruption and this approach could provide a minimally invasive and conservative pathway to treating ankylosed teeth. Clinical Relevance: To date no effective treatment has been described to reverse the development of replacement root resorption leading to the loss of the affected tooth. The hypothesis proposed here suggests that mechanical vibrations, if strong enough, may disturb the ankylosis and allow re-eruption of the intruded tooth.","315":"Crown lengthening surgery aims to increase the amount of supragingival tooth tissue by resection of the soft and\/or hard tissues to enable otherwise unrestorable teeth to be restored by increasing the retention and resistance forms of the teeth. Restoration of the worn dentition may require significant prosthodontic knowledge and skill. A prosthodontist should be involved from the beginning of the management of the patient. A number of key stages should be considered for correct management. Although the periodontist may guide the prosthodontist with regards to what may or may not be possible surgically, the overall treatment plan should be prosthodontically driven. Clinical Relevance: Toothwear of the anterior dentition provides a unique challenge to restore not only function but also to manage the aesthetic demands of the patient. To ensure that the correct outcome is reached, clinicians should be familiar with the normal anatomical proportions and relationships to enable planning and treatment to take place.","316":"The need for long-term retention following orthodontic treatment is now considered essential to prevent post-orthodontic treatment relapse. The vacuum-formed retainer (VFR) has gained popularity in recent times. This paper describes briefly the characteristics of VFRs and summarizes the evidence in relation to their effectiveness. Clinical Relevance: VFRs are now widely used after orthodontic treatment and it is important that clinicians adopt an evidenced-based approach to their use.","317":"Ebola is a highly dangerous infectious disease seen mainly in West Africa or travellers from there. All healthcare workers should check the recent travel history of their patients and follow formal guidance issued. Clinical Relevance: This article discusses the relevance of the Ebola virus in dentistry.","318":"","319":"","320":"","321":"Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is an inflammatory disease characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction. This case report presents the 10-year results in a subject with generalized AgP treated by a regenerative periodontal therapeutic approach and the adjunctive use of antibiotics, following a systematic maintenance periodontal therapy. The use of enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) and adjunctive antibiotic therapy to treat AgP yielded improvements in clinical parameters and radiographic bony fill. This combined therapeutic approach following a systematic supportive periodontal therapy supports the long-term maintenance of teeth with previous advanced periodontal defects, demonstrating successful stability after 10-years follow-up. Clinical Relevance: The combined treatment protocol using EMD plus adjunctive antibiotic therapy, associated with a systematic supportive periodontal therapy, benefits the long-term maintenance of teeth with previous advanced periodontal defects in subjects presenting AgP, supporting this approach as an alternative in the treatment of AgP.","322":"Needle phobia is a common problem encountered by dental practitioners and it can pose a challenge, especially in the paediatric patient. Needle desensitization can be used for patients who have needle fear or phobia and help them overcome this by repeated, non-threatening and controlled contacts. This paper will describe an accepted technique of needle desensitization and work through the steps required to achieve a successful outcome of local anaesthesia being delivered in a calm, safe and controlled manner. Clinical Relevance: Needle desensitization is an effective technique which can be used to enable a needle phobic patient to receive a dental injection.","323":"An osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle is a rare tumour of the maxillofacial region that could first present to the general dental practitioner. This case report describes an osteochondroma of the posterio-medial mandibular condyle presenting with marked facial asymmetry and trismus over a six- month period. Appropriate referral and investigation enabled successful removal of the tumour, recontouring of the condyle and an uncomplicated, positive outcome for our patient. Clinical Relevance: Temporomandibular joint disorders can be a cause of dento-facial asymmetry. Pathology of the temporomandibular joint should be considered in the differential diagnosis when such a patient presents.","324":"Replacing missing teeth is an integral part of the clinical services of the dental practitioner. The fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) bridge is a relatively new method for replacing missing teeth. This article will explain and discuss this alternative treatment option. Practical instructions on how to construct a FRC bridge will be given, by means of a clinical case. Different technique options will be illustrated to provide the reader with a good understanding of the most practical way to use the FRC strips. The fibre-reinforced composite provides a non-destructive, aesthetically pleasing and cost-effective way to restore missing teeth. Clinical Relevance: Minimally invasive options should always be considered and destruction of healthy enamel and dentine during the preparation phase of a replacement treatment should be avoided as much as possible.","325":"A MEDLINE search early in 2015 revealed more than 250,000 papers on head and neck cancer; over 100,000 on oral cancer; and over 60,000 on mouth cancer. Not all publications contain robust evidence. We endeavour to encapsulate the most important of the latest information and advances now employed in practice, in a form comprehensible to healthcare workers, patients and their carers. This series offers the primary care dental team, in particular, an overview of the aetiopathogenesis, prevention, diagnosis and multidisciplinary care of mouth cancer, the functional and psychosocial implications, and minimization of the impact on the quality of life of patient and family. Clinical Relevance: This article offers the dental team an overview of the changing epidemiology of, and increases in mouth cancer.","326":"Halitosis is an unpleasant condition that may be the origin of concern not only for a possible health condition but also for frequent psychological alterations which may lead to social and personal isolation. The most frequent sources of halitosis that exist in the oral cavity include bacterial reservoirs such as the dorsum of the tongue, saliva and periodontal pockets. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) are the prominent elements of oral malodour. Genuine halitosis and pseudo-halitosis should be in the treatment realm of dental practitioners. Clinical Relevance: Halitosis can be a symptom of underlying systemic disease, therefore the exact diagnosis and its source (oral or non-oral) is important in the proper approach to its management.","327":"The classification of chronic orofacial pain remains a contentious area. However, more recently, with the clarification of pain mechanisms and improved understanding of the underlying neurophysiology and modulation factors, there is more clarity of the possible division of pain conditions. Interestingly, the pathophysiology provides a basis for classification that has more clinical relevance. The principles of assessing and managing patients with pain have modified significantly, in line with recent improved understanding of the affective and emotional components in pain behaviour and suffering. Clinical Relevance: This paper aims to provide the dental and medical teams with a review of the classification of trigeminal pain with an overview of how to assess and diagnose patients with trigeminal pain.","328":"This article is the first in a series of three papers that will discuss the conventional non-implant retained prosthodontic rehabilitation of oncology patients with surgically acquired hard palate defects. In this first paper, the dental challenges posed by the oncology patients will briefly be discussed. The interface between the specialist restorative dentist and the maxillofacial surgeon when planning the conventional dental rehabilitation of an oncology patient with a hard palate defect will be discussed in detail. Clinical Relevance: To highlight the importance of the restorative dentistry\/surgical interface when planning a treatment for a patient requiring a maxillectomy and conventional obturation.","329":"This article explores the potential implications of the Francis Report for members of the dental team from a dento-legal perspective. It looks at the broad recommendations in light of the existing ethical environment in which dental registrants work and asks what is new and what the recommendations will actually mean for dental professionals in practical terms. Clinical Relevance: The fundamental recommendations of the Francis Report, namely, that those who provide care should put patients' interests first and be open about outcomes and performance, are not new concepts. A breach of these ethically based expectations may, however, create grounds for legal proceedings, which is clearly a significant point for all members of the dental team. It is therefore important to be aware of what is expected of those providing clinical care.","330":"Oral health is an essential, yet often neglected, aspect of care in the elderly population. A mouth free of pain and disease which is functional, comfortable and aesthetic improves quality of life. Following the shocking reports of patient neglect and abuse published in the Francis Report, the dental profession must acknowledge that there are longstanding deficiencies in the provision of oral healthcare for the elderly, whether residing in care homes, hospitals or at home with support. It must be a universal goal to improve the care provision for this population through developing a greater understanding and overcoming the multi-factorial barriers to care. This article will highlight the key features of the Francis Report and its significance in the context of oral healthcare provision for the elderly. Clinical Relevance: To provide insight into the oral healthcare needs of the growing elderly population and the necessity of dealing with the current limitations in service provision.","331":"The professional regulators were identified in the Francis Report as having a central role in maintaining fundamental standards of care. This paper describes the key themes in the Report and the importance of regulatory powers to ensure that the serious failings in patient care highlighted by the Mid-Staffs Inquiry cannot be repeated. The central role of the GDC Standards in the profession's response to the Francis Report is stressed. Clinical Relevance: The importance of our professional regulator in ensuring adherence to fundamental standards of care is a central tenet of clinical dentistry.","332":"The starting point in the assessment and management of any patient is dependent on good history-taking. The main parts of the history-taking process well known to practitioners are the presenting complaint, the history of the presenting complaint and the current and past medical history. This paper concentrates on those aspects of the process that are particularly important to dental practitioners. Clinical Relevance: The cornerstone of safe and effective patient management lies with the history. This paper describes various aspects of history-taking and highlights important areas.","333":"","334":"","335":"","336":"This paper reviews six key communication models and frameworks in healthcare contexts. Comparison suggests key inter-relationships between the different stages of the clinical consultations. Implications are identified for future study in healthcare provider-patient communication. Clinical Relevance: To understand the healthcare provider-patient interaction through communication models.","337":"The use of dental implants in replacing missing teeth is proven to be a valid treatment with a high success rate. To achieve the best treatment outcome in all implant systems, the implant has to be able to integrate with the surrounding tissue. However, dental implants are affected by peri-implant diseases and may fail as a result. As the number of implants placed continues to increase, the prevalence of peri-implant disease will also increase. This requires preventive measures to inhibit the development of the disease and stop its progression. Clinical Relevance: Understanding how to maintain healthy peri-implant tissue as well as diagnosis and treatment of disease are vital for every dentist and dental student.","338":"New evidence suggests that the extent and severity of periodontal disease may be a significant risk factor for erectile dysfunction, sperm motility and time to conception. This paper reviews the evidence and informs members of the dental team when dealing with this sensitive issue. As more research is forthcoming the topic of oral and sexual health is likely to be part of regular routine medical screening. Any issue concerning oral health as a risk factor for sexual health is likely to be a sensitive subject, rarely discussed in the dental setting. However, as new evidence emerges, this topic is likely to get into the public domain. All members of the dental team should be aware of such an association. Clinical Relevance: Furthermore, the information in this paper may provide further incentive for certain patients to improve their oral health.","339":"This article aims to update the practitioner on the various techniques and interventions available to prevent or control caries during this high-risk period. The evidence to support provision of toothbrushing advice, placement of fissure sealants and fluoride varnish application is considered, along with more novel methods. An evidence-based protocol is suggested to help the practitioner determine when further intervention is required and what action to undertake. Clinical Relevance: This article aims to reinforce the need for rigorous caries prevention in an erupting permanent molar and provides an update on the evidence behind a range of clinical techniques used for this purpose.","340":"This is the first article in a two-part series which aims to provide an overview of the different techniques used to increase clinical crown height. In the first paper, the focus will be on the management of patients who present with gingival tissue excess. The different aetiologies are discussed and illustrated with clinical cases, following which a range of procedures that may be employed in the management of these patients are presented. With an increasingly ageing population, more patients are taking regular medications prescribed from their general medical practitioner, and so having a working knowledge of the specific drugs that may cause gingival enlargement is essential. Clinical Relevance: When patients with gingival tissue excess present in primary or secondary care, a clinician must have a good knowledge of the possible causes of the condition, as well as an idea of how the patient may be managed.","341":"Whilst transient effects of orthodontic appliances on the oral mucosa are well recognized, chronic lesions, persisting post therapy are unusual. We describe a persistent lingual mucosal defect related to a transpalatal arch (TPA) in a healthy 19-year-old female. The asymptomatic lesion is presently being monitored, however, surgical revision in the future may be requested by the patient if the area fails to remodel. Clinical Relevance: Soft tissue trauma to the tongue by anchorage reinforcing appliances may result in long-term effects that could require surgical management.","342":"Fixed appliance treatment is a popular treatment modality with a burgeoning increase in the numbers of children and adults realizing the benefits that can be gained. Appliance breakage is an unavoidable nuisance which is at best inconvenient, and at worst may result in significant pain or discomfort for the patient. General dental practitioners (GDPs) should have the practical knowledge of how to provide timely and appropriate orthodontic 'emergency treatment'. This will significantly reduce the sometimes considerable inconvenience and discomfort for both the patient and his\/her parents, and the inevitable frustration for the clinician providing ongoing care. This first paper will deal with general orthodontic problems that commonly present, as well as some issues specific to fixed appliances. The second paper will deal with the other orthodontic appliances that may be encountered by GDPs in their daily practice. Clinical Relevance: Appropriate handling of an orthodontic 'emergency' by the general practitioner will, on many occasions, provide immediate relief of pain and distress for the patient. This will in turn allow treatment to continue moving in the right direction, thus allowing more efficient and effective use of valuable resources.","343":"A case of an unusual anomaly in a maxillary canine is described. A deep enamel invagination resulted in pulpal necrosis, longstanding infection and development of an associated radicular cyst. Diagnostic X-ray imaging was invaluable in demonstrating the complex root anatomy of the dilated odontome. In particular, a cone beam CT scan helped in the formulation of an appropriate treatment plan. Clinical Relevance: Three-dimensional imaging using cone beam CT was valuable in this case to demonstrate the complicated anatomy of a rare dental anomaly, and to help plan treatment.","344":"This series of papers aims to provide the dental and medical teams with an update in pain, both acute and chronic orofacial conditions, relevant to dentistry and medicine. Pain is the most common symptom for patients presenting to their dentist, and is increasingly commonly presenting to doctors as well, in general practice and A &amp; E departments. Most of the dental team take for granted their knowledge and ability to manage acute dental pain. However, the education and preparation in managing patients with chronic pain conditions remains poor in many medical and dental schools. Conversely, medics are better educated and exposed to chronic pain during their undergraduate education, however, with regards to orofacial pain education, exposure is diminishing due to decreased exposure to dentistry, ENT, otolaryngology, OMFS and oral surgery. Thus many clinical teams remain disadvantaged when diagnosing and managing orofacial pain. Clinical Relevance: Significant advances that have been made in understanding the pain mechanisms are not to be overlooked and have a huge impact on how we manage patients in pain.","345":"","346":"","347":"","348":"","349":"","350":"Today's dentistry is dominated by restorative procedures which are carried out to meet the demands of not only function but also aesthetics. Prosthetic and restorative therapies generally require a healthy periodontium as a prerequisite for successful treatment outcome. A mouth with a healthy periodontium may be affected by restorations of poor quality, and restorations of the highest quality may fail in a mouth with periodontal disease. This is the first of two articles that attempt to explain the concept of the complex question of biologic width and the problems that occur after improper margin placement in the periodontium. Initially, the dimensions of biologic width are considered and then margin placement and reasons for restorative procedures are discussed. This article also addresses the interactions between periodontal tissues and restorative procedures. Understanding the impact of restorative procedures on periodontal health in regular dental examination by dentists can help in early diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases. This could prevent further progression of disease and reduce the frequency of tooth loss. ","351":"A unifying theory has been proposed that links anomalies of tooth size and number. Application of this theory suggests that anomalies of tooth size and number may share a common aetiology but could also be predicted. This article highlights an association between macrodontia and hyperdontia as demonstrated by two clinical cases. These cases demonstrate a localized association and effect on the dentition and highlight the possible predictive application of this theory. Clinicians should be made aware of the possibility of supernumeraries associated with macrodont teeth. ","352":"Dental anxiety is a widespread problem. Behavioural interventions are effective in reducing dental anxiety and dentists are well placed to carry out these interventions. This article aims to familiarize dentists with simple behavioural techniques that can be used to treat patients presenting with dental anxiety. A case study detailing the assessment and treatment of an uncomplicated needle phobia using in vivo graded exposure is included in order to demonstrate the use of these techniques. Familiarity with simple, behavioural interventions for dental anxiety will enable dentists to respond appropriately to patients who present with mild fear and anxiety. Early intervention may play a role in the reduction of phobic anxiety in the dental setting. Dentists with an interest in behavioural management may also wish to treat patients with uncomplicated dental phobia. ","353":"As dental professionals, we should all be familiar with the most common oral anticoagulant, warfarin, and how to manage our patients that are taking it. However, several new oral anticoagulants which have recently been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) are now being prescribed for patients in the United Kingdom. These new oral anticoagulants fall into two different categories: a direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bracknell, Berkshire) and activated Factor X inhibitors rivaroxaban (Xarelto Bayer HealthCare, Newbury, Berkshire) and apixaban (Eliquis Bristol-Myers Squibb, Uxbridge, Middlesex). These new drugs will have potential consequences for how dental practitioners manage patients requiring dental treatment, especially extractions and minor surgical procedures. It is important that dentists are aware of new anticoagulants which are being prescribed for patients to ensure that they receive safe and appropriate dental treatment. As healthcare professionals we should also be aware of how and when to report adverse drug reactions. ","354":"Orofacial viral infections may be less common but appear in different clinical forms. Often these infections get initially treated by antibiotics which obviously will have limited or no effect. The authors review the current concepts of orofacial viral infections, causative agents, their classification and clinical manifestations and a basis for treatment. Most viral infections do not require any specific treatment except in patients who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Appropriate diagnosis and timely management of orofacial viral lesions are important irrespective of whether it is localized or a manifestation of a systemic infection. ","355":"This case report illustrates the use of hemisection to minimize the distal extension span. The LR6 was the only molar next to a distal extension of the lower Kennedy's Class II ridge. Its unrestorable distal root was removed and its mesial portion was retained to serve as an effective antagonist and abutment tooth and lessen the extent of right distal extension. Regarding the prosthetic rehabilitation of distal extensions, hemisection can be advantageous and offered as an alternative to other treatment modalities. ","356":"Complete loss of teeth from one or both arches is a disabling condition which is usually managed by a conventional removable denture. Rehabilitation may be poorly tolerated by patients, particularly in the lower jaw, and is more difficult in situations when the anatomy of the denture-bearing area is less favourable. These situations may require specific prosthodontic or surgical techniques, or a combination of both. Prosthodontic solutions involve special impression techniques and the use of soft linings and it is vitally important to manage patient expectations in such cases. This article describes prosthodontic management options for dealing with the fibrous (flabby) anterior ridge and bony exostoses. Although tooth loss in the UK is diminishing, it is nevertheless important that dental practitioners are able to demonstrate good prosthodontic skills for managing an ageing population. Surgical correction of anatomical defects may occasionally be employed. ","357":"As described in the first paper of this two part series, the expansion of our older population and the concomitant reduction in levels of edentulism will result in an increase in the number of patients presenting in general practice with complex restorative challenges. The application of the concepts of minimal intervention dentistry and minimally invasive operative techniques may offer a powerful armamentarium to the general dentist to provide ethical and conservative treatment to older patients. When it is unavoidable, operative intervention should be as minimally invasive as practicable in older patients to preserve the longevity of their natural dentition. ","358":"Dismantling restorations from teeth which require endodontic re-treatment can be difficult. Many dentists are reluctant to remove posts through fear of weakening, perforating or fracturing the remaining root structure. A variety of techniques have been described and developed for post removal. This is the first in a series of two papers which provide an overview of these techniques.The rationale for endodontic re-treatment, pre-operative assessment and factors affecting post removal are discussed. Techniques are illustrated with clinical case reports. The second paper describes the use of specific post removal devices and the removal of fibre posts. Endodontic re-treatment has a more successful long-term outcome than surgical treatment for failed root canal treatment. This may involve the removal of existing post restorations or portions thereof. ","359":"Patients seek dental treatment to improve oral function as well as their attractiveness. In order to improve smile attractiveness, clinicians need to carry out a comprehensive smile assessment. The aim of this paper is to help clinicians to adopt a systematic approach toward smile assessment by introducing a smile assessment form. Smile analysis is an essential part of smile diagnosis. A smile assessment form will assist clinicians in identifying and recording smile features for diagnosis and treatment planning. ","360":"","361":"","362":"","363":"Periodontal disease has a wide spectrum of presentation, any of which can have an effect on the patient's dental well-being and overall quality of life. This sporadic but sometimes rapidly progressing condition can easily be missed in a busy general practice setting. It is essential that the correct diagnosis is made and our duty of care to the patient fulfilled. If the condition, along with the treatment options and appropriate advice, is not explained to the patient, the individual may well feel that he\/she has been let down by the professional person trusted over many years. Clinical Relevance: This article discusses the screening and referral of periodontal patients, taking into account the medico-legal challenges that are currently faced by general dental practitioners (GDPs).","364":"Maxillary midline diastema is a common aesthetic complaint of patients. Treating the midline diastema is a matter of concern for practitioners, as many different aetiologies are reported to be associated with it. The appearance of midline diastema as part of the normal dental development makes it difficult for practitioners to decide whether to intervene or not at an early stage. The aim of this article is to review the possible aetiology and management options which will help the clinician to diagnose, intercept and to take effective action to correct the midline diastema. The available data shows that an early intervention is desirable in cases with large diastemas. Treatment modality, timing and retention protocol depends on the aetiology of the diastema. Therefore, priority needs to be given to diagnosing the aetiology before making any treatment decisions. Clinical Relevance: This article aims to determine and evaluate the aetiology and possible treatment options of midline diastema.","365":"Traditionally, deep carious lesions are treated by removal of all carious tissue, which may lead to pulp exposure. To minimize this risk, conservative carious tissue removal techniques have been proposed, including partial removal and stepwise excavation. However, there is no consensus in the literature about which is the better technique. Thus, the aim of this article is to describe and discuss the main techniques for carious tissue removal, according to scientific evidence. It was observed that both stepwise excavation and partial carious tissue removal presented lower pulp exposure rates and higher success rates. Clinical Relevance: Clinicians must be aware that conservative carious tissue removal techniques, such as stepwise excavation and partial carious tissue removal, present lower pulp exposure rates and higher success rates than traditional methods.","366":"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) following bisphosphonate use is well documented. However, to our knowledge, there are few cases reported on ONJ related to the use of other pharmaceutical agents, such as denosumab--a monoclonal antibody that is prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis and is used as an anti-cancer agent. Here we present the first case in the UK of a patient who has developed ONJ following treatment with denosumab. The purpose of this report is to highlight the potential effects of this monoclonal antibody on bone turnover and the subsequent results of osteonecrosis of the jaw. It is hoped that this will allow early recognition by medical and dental practitioners, and appropriate referral and treatment. Clinical Relevance: Readers should be aware of other causes of osteonecrosis of the jaw.","367":"Tooth discoloration is a common problem for which patients seek dental care. Various medications can directly or indirectly result in tooth discoloration. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to know these therapeutic drugs which can cause tooth discoloration and educate our fellow colleagues to take necessary precautions when prescribing these medications. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of the various medications that can be linked to tooth discoloration and to suggest the precautionary measures that can be taken to avoid or minimize it. Clinical Relevance: Dental discoloration potential of medications always needs to be considered before prescribing them.","368":"Twelve members were selected at random from the PREP panel, a group of UK-based dentists who are prepared to carry out research in their practices. A questionnaire was designed to determine the views of the participants, who were asked to use the retraction paste capsules where clinically indicated. They were asked to return the questionnaire after 8 weeks and the information contained therein was collated and presented mainly on visual analogue scales (VAS). A total of 160 impressions were taken using the Astringent Retraction Paste (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) plus use in the placement of 25 restorations. Of evaluators, 83% (n = 10) agreed that Astringent Retraction Paste was a suitable product for gingival retraction and 75% (n = 9) agreed that it had good haemostatic properties. Overall dispensing and handling of the paste was rated as 4.9 on a VAS scale where 1 = Inconvenient and 5 = Convenient. The viscosity of the paste was rated as 3.6 on a VAS where 1 = too thin and 5 = too thick. Good scores were achieved across all criteria for the product. Clinical Relevance: Practitioners may wish to be aware of a novel compule-based gingival retraction system.","369":"For more than a hundred years, it has been supposed that canine guidance should be avoided in conventional complete dentures, since it would result in denture instability. Thus, bilateral balanced articulation has been held by many authors as fundamental for treatment success. However, randomized clinical trials have shown that balanced articulation is not as important as previously thought. The issue about which occlusal concept is the most appropriate for individual needs is clinically and economically relevant for both the dentist and dental technician. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an evidence-based update on complete denture occlusion. Clinical Relevance: The issue about which occlusal concept is the most appropriate for individual needs is clinically and economically relevant.","370":"Patient complaints invariably cause concern and distress. Whilst prevention should be the primary objective, this is not always possible. This final article in the series describes strategies for the management and resolution of complaints, as well as the advantages of good complaint handling. Clinical Relevance: Early and efficient resolution of complaints will reduce stress to all members of the dental team.","371":"Dysphagia is defined as a 'difficulty in swallowing' and is commonly found in the general population, particularly in the elderly. This article gives an overview of the more frequently encountered swallowing disorders and provides advice on how to manage the dysphagic patient in the dental surgery. Clinical Relevance: By identifying patients with dysphagia and being aware of the potential problems that the clinician may experience when treating them, the risk of aspiration, choking and healthcare-acquired upper respiratory tract infections may be reduced.","372":"Ten million people in the UK today are aged over 65. The latest projections estimate that there will be 5 1\/2 million more people aged 65 and older in the next 20 years. This projected pattern of population ageing will have profound consequences for dentistry. Minimal intervention dentistry (MID) is a modern evidence-based approach to caries management in dentate patients that uses the 'medical model' whereby disease is controlled by the 'oral physician'. This approach offers considerable benefits over conventional dentistry for older patients. It encourages patients to be responsible for their oral health through the provision of both knowledge and motivation. MID encompasses risk assessment for dental disease, early detection and control of disease processes, and minimally invasive treatment. Clinical Relevance: Risk assessment tools can aid the general dental practitioner and the patient to develop a suitable caries prevention programme for that individual and reduce the need for future operative intervention.","373":"Post-operative haemorrhage is a recognized complication in dental practice. This may be more prevalent in patients taking antithrombotic medications. It is important that the dentist understands the mechanism of action of these drugs and how they may affect management of dental patients. Clinical Relevance: Dental professionals must be aware of those medications affecting haemostasis and how they may impact on management. The emergence of different therapeutic regimens has increased the number of such drugs.","374":"Failure of a post-retained restoration can provide a challenge to the general dental practitioner (GDP) in terms of diagnosis, treatment planning and communication with the patient. The cause of failure must be identified, and a thorough assessment of the restoration, remaining tooth and its functional and aesthetic demands carried out in order to plan treatment to provide the most reliable result. Clinical Relevance: This article discusses the assessment of failing post-retained crowns, with discussion of reasons for failure, thereby assisting the GDP in decision-making and treatment planning for such teeth.","375":"","376":"","377":"","378":"","379":"","380":"","381":"","382":"Impressions are taken regularly in practice giving vital information to the dental laboratory, but are there quality assurance systems in place to make sure that they are up to a sufficient standard? As dental professionals we have to appreciate that dental technicians can only work with the information given to them. This makes the skill of taking a good impression vital in order for us as clinicians to provide prostheses of good quality. This paper outlines an audit of alginate impressions and their quality in the making of removable prostheses. To record the quality of impression taking, and how one's own ability to critique an impression may differ from that of our colleagues. ","383":"Tooth surface loss can present in a variety of ways, some of which can appear rather strange on first examination. This case report demonstrates an unusual presentation of tooth surface loss (TSL) and its subsequent treatment. This loss of hard dental tissue appeared to be affecting the whole of the patient's remaining dentition, both lingually and buccally. Detailed questioning revealed the origins of this problem which turned out to be due to excessive use of an intra-oral Miswak chewing stick. Cinical Relevance: This article will enable clinicians to understand the importance of specific, targeted history-taking, involving a rare case of tooth surface loss as well as the use of minimally destructive restoration composites and a fibre-reinforced composite bridge.","384":"Head and neck cancer (HNC) constitutes approximately 3% of all cancers in the UK, with in excess of 8500 new cases annually. Management of HNC depends on site, extent, histology, previous medical history and patient choice. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize patient wellbeing, owing to the significant functional and psychosocial implications that can impact on quality of life. Members of the dental team, to include the general dental practitioner, have a key role in patient care; therefore the dental team should be knowledgeable in the short-term and longer-term implications and how this impacts on quality of life. This article offers the dental team with an overview of how HNC and the various treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, impact upon quality of life, both in the short-term and longer-term. ","385":"Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) lack the endogenous steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone and require daily steroid therapy (usually hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) to replace them. These patients are unable to adapt physiologically to stress and may need supplemental steroid therapy when having dental procedures, to prevent adrenal crisis. This paper provides guidance on dental procedures for which steroid supplementation may be required in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and gives advice on doses and timing of supplementation. It does not address the management of patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency caused by long-term use of high doses of steroids. This document is for guidance only. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency should be assessed individually as steroid requirements will vary. Although patients with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) are invariably very well informed about their steroid requirements prior to a dental procedure, dental staff should have an understanding of the steroid supplementation that may be required. ","386":"Clinical and ethical risk management requires not only the correct treatment being provided, and appropriate consent obtained, but also good records of that treatment. This third article of the series describes the characteristics of good records and their role in helping to prevent the progression of complaints, General Dental Council (GDC) cases and legal claims. Good records are of fundamental importance in managing risk and preventing and resolving complaints and legal claims. ","387":"Dental plaque-induced periodontal diseases are common in children and adults. Guidelines were previously not available for the periodontal screening of under 18s. However, new guidelines have been introduced by the British Society of Periodontology and the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry which set out recommendations for the periodontal screening and management of under 18s in primary dental care. This article provides a practical guide for general dental practitioners on how to use the BPE in children and adolescents, and highlights the importance of early detection and management of periodontal diseases in this age group. A failure to use the modified BPE in a young patient who is later diagnosed with periodontitis may leave a dentist vulnerable to a medico-legal complaint or claim. New BPE guidelines for children and adolescents have been introduced by the BSPD and BSP; it is important that all dentists are aware of these guidelines and how to implement them in general practice. ","388":"Dental radiographic imaging is slowly transferring to digital format. The decision to invest in this new technology should be based on a good understanding of the different types of digital imaging available within the dental field. This article outlines its use in general dental practice, highlighting the pros and cons of the various systems both for intra-oral and extra-oral radiography. An understanding of the mechanisms of digital imaging and their associated potential problems are required by any clinician moving to film-less imaging. ","389":"This article considers the importance of current orthodontic practice in retention and stability when considering anterior tooth alignment. With the exponential increase of general dentist-based orthodontic systems for anterior tooth alignment, with considerably shorter treatment times, practical recommendations along with a current literature review are required to improve success and outcome of the long-term result. ","390":"Direct pulp capping is a proven method of preserving tooth vitality of a mature permanent tooth in cases of pulp exposures. The indications for this treatment, treatment modalities and materials are discussed in this paper. This paper answers many of the frequently asked questions by general practitioners, dental students and specialists about direct pulp capping. ","391":"The management of bleeding complications following a dental extraction is an essential skill for the dental practitioner. Extractions are often carried out on patients with complex medical histories and a long list of medications. This paper aims to help the clinician manage post-extraction haemorrhage. A review of the management of patients on anti-thrombotic medications will be covered in a subsequent paper. This article reviews the management of haemorrhage following tooth extraction; from the risk assessment of any underlying medical conditions and medications, to the clinical techniques used to control bleeding following an extraction. ","392":"","393":"","394":"","395":"The relationship of a sound mind to the maintenance of a healthy body has been recognized throughout most of recorded history. The term 'stress' is used to describe adverse emotions or reactions to unpleasant experiences. Individuals with high levels of stress and poor coping skills experience twice as much periodontal disease as compared to those with minimal stress and good coping skills. Although stress may predispose an individual to more destruction from periodontitis, the presence of periodontal pathogens remains the essential aetiologic factor. This review presents a summary of stress, discussing how it can predispose an individual to periodontal disease. Stress, which is a universal phenomenon, is implicated to have various systemic effects besides being a risk factor for periodontal disease. This article elucidates the relationship between psycho-social stress and destructive periodontal disease. ","396":"The aim of the article is to assist practitioners in the diagnosis and management of complete denture problems by addressing the problems from a theoretical viewpoint and in a clinically diagnostic way. To assist practitioners and undergraduates to understand the clinical basis of complete denture prosthodontics. ","397":"This is a literature search about the clinical use of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) as a means of providing effective orthodontic anchorage. It takes the reader through a journey from the initial description of the technique to the enormous popularity TADs are currently experiencing in clinical practice. This paper aims to present good quality clinical information to allow the clinician and the patient to make an informed decision. The purpose of this literature review is to provide readers with an overview of the current available literature on this subject and encourage general dental practitioners to adopt a more evidence-based approach to this aspect of orthodontic care. ","398":"Valid consent is an absolute requirement of ethically correct treatment. This second article, in a series covering the management of risk, defines consent but also describes the role that appropriate consent, through good communication, plays in clinical and ethical risk management and the reduction of complaints. Valid consent is fundamental to the ethical and legal treatment of patients. ","399":"Metastatic involvement of the jawbones is uncommon, particularly in the maxilla. Case reports of such metastases from renal cell primaries are few, making a consensus on treatment difficult to establish. We present a case of metastatic involvement of the maxilla two years following a nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. The case exemplifies the broad range of symptoms attributable to metastases in the maxilla and the management dilemmas. The case highlights the role of practitioners in primary dental care in identifying the potential for such pathology based on clinical and radiographic features. ","400":"All too often, those patients who complain are thought to be unreasonable. Healthcare professionals often feel that patients do not have an understanding of the pressures and hardships that they struggle with on a day-to-day basis. When a patient complains, it is seen by the professional complained about as a wholly negative event, leading to loss of confidence and leaving that professional feeling demoralized. Often complaints are due to a breakdown in communication. Sometimes a patient is unhappy with a treatment charge or simply there is a perception that he\/she has been poorly treated. The General Dental Council and Primary Care Trusts (and now their successors) take a dim view of dental practitioners who deal with complaints poorly. This article sets out to offer a different perspective on complaints, so that the complaint system can be used to build trust between dental professionals and patients, instead of instilling demoralization and fear of litigation into those on the receiving end of a complaint. This article is relevant to all dental professionals as complaints are an inevitability of practice. ","401":"ART is less anxiety- and pain-provoking than traditional restorative treatments; administration of local anaesthesia is rarely required. Systematic reviews have provided evidence of the high level of effectiveness of high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restoration in restoring single-surface cavities, both in primary and permanent posterior teeth, but its survival rates in restoring multiple-surface cavities in primary posterior teeth needs to be improved. Insufficient information is available regarding the survival rates of multiple-surface ART restorations in permanent teeth. Evidence from these reviews indicates no difference in the survival rates of single-surface high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restorations and amalgam restorations in primary and permanent posterior teeth. Where indicated, high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART restorations can be used alongside traditional restorations. ART provides a much more acceptable introduction to dental restorative care than the traditional 'injection, drill and fill'. ","402":"Toothwear is now common, especially in younger patients, with high demand for the restoration of the damaged teeth which is likely to increase further over time. Fixed prosthodontic options range from direct composite resin to conventional tooth preparation and cemented indirect restorations. This paper summarizes the views of a variety of clinicians on a plan delivered to a patient with toothwear in secondary care and explores the possible reasons for the variation in decision-making in the treatment of toothwear. With levels of toothwear increasing, the clinician needs to be aware of the different treatment modalities which are appropriate. ","403":"This is the second article of a two part series covering the aetiology, prevention and broad range of management options for the single discoloured tooth. The article covers situations where masking and simulation techniques with direct composite are required. Direct composite, indirect composite and ceramic veneers are then considered, as well as full coverage crowns. The option of extraction of the affected tooth and its prosthodontic replacement will also be considered. Clinical cases are used to illustrate various scenarios. The single discoloured tooth is a commonly encountered clinical problem in general dental practice. A wide variety of management options exist and it is recommended that general dental practitioners consider adopting minimally invasive techniques in the first instance before moving on to more invasive therapies. ","404":"","405":"","406":"","407":"An update and overview of the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in dentistry is described. Specific aspects discussed include the evolution of the technology and the basic process of light beam interference used to obtain OCT images. In addition, aspects of the optical properties of dentine and enamel and the range of current diagnostic applications of OCT in dentistry are reviewed. The technique of optical coherence tomography is considered to be significant since the technology involved allows imaging using light to around 2-3 mm in teeth and can, for example, allow the extent and progression of carious lesions to be determined. ","408":"There is increasing concern amongst dentists, and dental care professionals (DCPs), about the risks associated with complaints from patients and the possibility of escalation to legal action or referral to the General Dental Council (GDC). This is the first of a series of four articles considering the management of risk. It will describe why complaints happen, how to identify problems at an early stage and strategies for preventing complaints occurring. The prevention of complaints will reduce stress and anxiety for all members of the dental team. ","409":"This paper offers some guidance on aspects of dento\/medico-legal report writing, citing anonymized examples from the author's caseload for clarification of the points made, and also serves to illustrate that sometimes not everything is as straightforward as it may initially appear.

","410":"This study investigates the attributes of a 'good dentist' with respect to the opinions of dental patients, dental students and qualified dentists and determines whether the dental profession and its patients are in agreement with the standards published by the General Dental Council (GDC) in 2005. A questionnaire was circulated amongst the above groups at the University Of Birmingham, School of Dentistry. Each participant was asked to rank 14 attributes for a dentist in order of their importance. The results indicated that generally there was no consensus between individual participants. There was, however, significant overlap between the top six attributes chosen by dental care professionals and the GDC standards. Patients tended to rank other non-GDC mentioned attributes more frequently. Attributes which were considered important by all were 'putting patient interests first and acting to protect them, respecting a patient's dignity and choices and having good technical ability'. It is important to gain an insight into patient attitudes and to be knowledgeable of the GDC professional standards, in order to improve overall conduct and performance as a dental practitioner. ","411":"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing significantly and, therefore, dental practitioners are having to manage diabetic patients on a more regular basis. Alongside the systemic effects on the various tissues and organs of the body, diabetes can adversely affect oral health and all clinicians should be aware of the issues that may arise. Dental practitioners are almost guaranteed to encounter both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetic patients. It is therefore important that they are aware of the oral signs and symptoms of disease and the reciprocal relationship between oral health and glycaemic control, so that diabetic patients are managed accordingly. ","412":"Restoring the edentulous mandible with a removable prosthesis can be a challenging prospect for both the dentist and patient during and after treatment. Poor retention and support are the major problems reported with a mandibular complete denture and these can be significantly improved with the use of implants and retentive attachments. Utilizing implants requires careful planning from both the surgical and restorative aspects to ensure that the intended treatment aim and outcome is achieved. This case highlights the importance of both restorative and surgical considerations when planning the rehabilitation of the mandible with dental implants. ","413":"Quality assurance (QA) is essential in dental radiography. Digital radiography is becoming more common in dentistry, so it is important that appropriate QA tests are carried out on the digital equipment, including the viewing monitor. The aim of this article is to outline the tests that can be carried out in dental practice. Quality assurance for digital equipment is important to ensure consistently high quality images are produced. ","414":"Sealing caries-prone pits and fissure systems is an effective caries-preventive measure. There are basically two types of sealant materials: glass-ionomer and resin-based materials. Low- and medium-viscosity glass-ionomers were initially used and showed a low level of retention. With the advent of the ART approach in the mid-nineties, high-viscosity glass-ionomers were introduced as sealant material and the retention rate of ART sealants increased substantially. As the effectiveness of a sealant is measured by its capacity to prevent (dentine) carious lesion development, sealant retention is considered a surrogate endpoint. The ART sealant protocol is described. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis covering low- medium- and high-viscosity glass-ionomer (ART) sealants have concluded that there is no evidence that either glass-ionomer or resin-based sealants prevent dentine carious lesions better. The annual dentine carious lesion development in teeth with high-viscosity glass-ionomer ART sealants over the first three years is 1%. These ART sealants have a high capacity of preventing carious lesion development. Because no electricity and running water is required, ART sealants can be placed both inside and outside the dental surgery. High-viscosity glass-ionomer ART sealants can be used alongside resin-based sealants.41:119-124 ","415":"The incidence of skin cancer in the United Kingdom is increasing and is associated with an ageing population and increasing lifetime exposure to sunlight. The three most common types of skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, all three of which may present on the skin of the face. The dental team are, therefore, well-placed to recognize suspicious lesions and arrange for further advice or assessment. This paper outlines the epidemiology, important clinical features and principles of modern management of facial skin cancers to aid dental practitioners in the recognition of suspicious lesions. In addition, some of these treatments have side-effects which have the potential to affect a patient's oral health or its management and these aspects are also discussed. The dental surgeon is ideally placed to recognize malignant or potentially malignant lesions on patients'faces and to advise on seeking further advice or refer for assessment, as appropriate. Dental practitioners will increasingly encounter patients who have undergone surgical or non-surgical management of facial skin cancer and should understand the potential oro-facial side-effects of such treatment. ","416":"The single discoloured tooth is commonly encountered in general practice. This is the first of two articles covering the broad range of management options for the single discoloured tooth. This first part outlines the common causes of discoloration and possible methods of prevention. Minimally invasive techniques are covered. Clinical procedures are outlined and clinical cases used to demonstrate outcomes that can be achieved. The single discoloured tooth is a commonly encountered clinical problem in general dental practice. A wide variety of management options exist and any one in particular may be most appropriate given the clinical scenario. It is therefore essential that general dental practitioners are familiar with the range of options that exist, as well as their indications, and consider adopting minimally invasive techniques in the first instance before moving to more invasive therapies.

Hypnosis can be effective but is underused. A comparison of the conscious, alert state and hypnosis\/nitrous oxide sedation is shown by electroencephalogram examples. The benefits and drawbacks of the use of hypnosis are discussed and suggestions of ways of learning and using hypnosis outlined. This paper is an overview of the common problem of dental anxiety and a pragmatic approach to overcoming it using hypnotherapy.

This is to improve awareness of recurrent parotitis of childhood and aid early diagnosis. ","422":"With recent reports of increasing hospital admissions relating to dental infection, the authors believe it is time to re-visit the importance of its effective early treatment. A series of three cases is used to illustrate the potentially life-threatening progression of what, in the early stages, is an easily treatable condition. The principles of effective management of dental infection are highlighted in the first instance and then indications for specialist maxillofacial referral are discussed. ","423":"The clinical and laboratory steps involved in rehabilitating the maxillary arch following the loss of several teeth due to periodontal disease are outlined in this case report. This article illustrates the use of a laboratory based CAD\/CAM system (Sirona In-Lab) and a copy milling technique in the fabrication of a fixed-movable bridge, high strength, all-ceramic, cross-arch bridge. Adopting a semi-fixed approach in cross-arch rehabilitation has conventionally involved the use of porcelain fused to metal (PFM) components but the demands placed by patients and clinicians have led to the development of novel techniques in order to achieve highly aesthetic and functional results. ","424":"Canal irrigation during root canal treatment is an important component of chemo-mechanical debridement of the root canal system. Traditional syringe irrigation can be enhanced by activating the irrigant to provide superior cleaning properties. This activation can be achieved by simple modifications in current technique or by contemporary automated devices. Novel techniques are also being developed, such as the Self-adjusting File (Re-Dent-Nova, Ra'anana, Israel), Ozone (Healozone, Dental Ozone, London, UK), Photoactivated Disinfection and Ultraviolet Light Disinfection. This paper reviews the techniques available to enhance traditional syringe irrigation, contemporary irrigation devices and novel techniques, citing their evidence base, advantages and disadvantages. Recent advances in irrigation techniques and canal disinfection and debridement are relevant to practitioners carrying out root canal treatment. ","425":"The different ways that clinicians perceive adult patients with dental phobia is varied and diverse. From treating the dental phobia as a separate illness to dismissing it as a neurosis, sometimes little consequence is attached to its existence. True dental phobia is classed as a psychological illness and therefore comes under the remit and guidance of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Failure to assess the impact of dental phobia upon an individual's capacity to consent could lead to allegations of negligence or even assault. This paper highlights the importance of considering the capacity to consent of some of the most vulnerable dental ","426":"The concept of dental tourism can be considered two-fold. On one side it is a term used to describe non-UK residing patients who visit, requesting NHS dental care whilst here in the U.K. Alternatively, it also encompasses patients who travel to destinations outside their residing countries to receive care. The latter has become an ever-growing issue in the U.K.; one that warrants appropriate management and knowledge of current legislation amongst dental professionals. Clarity and guidance on who is eligible for care under the NHS when visiting the U.K. and who, if anyone, is ultimately responsible when treatment abroad fails. ","427":"Toothwear is affecting increasing numbers of the population. In the past, treatment of patients whose teeth were affected by toothwear often involved the reduction of these teeth for crowns; a severe form of toothwear. Contemporary management of such cases is by the bonding of resin composite restorations to the worn and wearing surfaces, with these restorations being placed at an increased occlusal vertical dimension. The advantage of the technique is its minimal- or non-intervention nature and its high reported degree of patient satisfaction. There are, however, short-term disadvantages to the technique, such as the potential for lisping, pain from the teeth which will be subject to axial orthodontic tooth movement, and difficulty in chewing on the posterior teeth if these are discluded. It is therefore important, as with any treatment, that the advantages and disadvantages are fully explained to the patient. This paper therefore describes the clinical technique and presents a Patient Information Leaflet that the author has used for over five years. Patients should be advised regarding the disadvantages and advantages of any technique. ","428":"Patients with a cleft lip and palate (CLP) deformity require the highest standard of care that the NHS can provide and this requires multidisciplinary care from teams located in regional cleft centres. Care of these cases is from birth to adulthood and requires several phases of intervention, corresponding to the stages of facial and dental development. Management ideally starts pre-natally, following the initial diagnosis, and occasionally pre-surgical appliances are prescribed. The lip is ideally repaired within three months, followed by palate closure between 12 and 18 months. Careful monitoring is required in the first few years and ENT referral, where necessary, will diagnose middle ear infection, which commonly affects CLP patients. Speech therapy is an integral part of the ongoing care. Excellent oral hygiene is essential and preventive dietary advice must be given and regularly reinforced. Orthodontic expansion is often needed at 9 years of age in preparation for a bone graft and, once the permanent dentition erupts, definitive orthodontic treatment will be required. Maxillary forward growth may have been constrained by scarring from previous surgery, so orthognathic correction may be required on growth completion. Final orthodontic alignment and high quality restorative care will allow the patients to have a pleasing aesthetic result. CLP patients and their families will need continuing support from medical and dental consultants, specialist nurses, health visitors, speech and language specialists and, perhaps, psychologists. The first article in this series of two outlined the principles of care for the CLP patient and this second part illustrates this with a case report, documenting one patient's journey from birth to 21 years of age. A successful outcome for CLP patients requires a sound dentition.The general dental practitioner role is vital to establish and maintain excellent oral hygiene, a healthy diet and good routine preventive and restorative care. Understanding the total needs of CLP patients can help the dentist to provide high quality care as part of the multidisciplinary management. ","429":"This article looks at the background to the current changes in primary care dentistry being piloted in England. It looks at the structure of the different elements being piloted, such as the oral health assessment, interim care appointments and care pathways. It also examines advanced care pathways and how complex care will be provided when clinically feasible and beneficial to the patient. The authors have worked in a type 1 pilot practice since September 2010. The NHS contract currently being piloted in England delivers care through care pathways and clinical risk assessments with prevention as an important building block for the delivery of services. There are new measures planned for measuring quality outcomes in primary care. This has implications for how services are delivered, who delivers them and how dentists will be remunerated in the future.

This case report describes the treatment of a 41-year-old male who presented at University of Glasgow Dental Hospital and School with established oromandibular dystonia. The use of removable appliances as a treatment option for this condition will be discussed. This case highlights the potential role of the dental practitioner in providing oromandibular dystonia sufferers with an effective and relatively easy treatment modality in the form of a removable appliance. ","440":"Glass ionomer materials have been available for 40 years, but have not been indicated for loadbearing restorations, other than when used in the ART concept. However, there is anecdotal evidence that dentists are using the reinforced versions of this material in posterior teeth, possibly as a result of demands from patients to provide them with tooth-coloured restorations in posterior teeth at a lower cost than resin composite. This paper reviews the existing literature on reinforced glass ionomer restorations in posterior teeth, concluding that, under certain circumstances (which are not fully elucidated) these materials may provide reasonable service. However, the patient receiving such restorations should be made aware of the minimal amount of evidence for the success of these restorations and the potential need for the restorations to be re-surfaced in due course. Reinforced glass ionomer restorations may provide patients with tooth-coloured restorations in posterior teeth, but their survival may not equate to restorations in resin composite in loadbearing situations. ","441":"Exposure to excessive fluoride intake during the early childhood years can disrupt the normal development of enamel, resulting in dental fluorosis. This varies in severity, ranging from white opacities in mild cases to more severe black and brown discoloration or enamel pitting. This article aims to give the reader a better understanding of the aetiology, diagnosis and subsequent treatment of dental fluorosis in the paediatric patient. Fluorosis can have a marked effect on dental aesthetics. The prevalence of fluorosis in the United Kingdom may increase following the publication of Delivering Better Oral Health, published by the Department of Health in 2007, which suggested changes to fluoride levels in children's toothpastes. This article highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis of fluorosis and also explains the treatment options available to paediatric patients. ","442":"Common problems with the long term clinical use of implant-supported mandibular overdentures (ISMDs) include fractures of dentures, bars and clips, and reactivation of clips. Many general dental practitioners (GDPs) are reticent to be involved in the maintenance of ISMDs, especially if they have not had any further training or are unfamiliar with implant components and systems. This article highlights the need for the training of GDPs in maintenance and management of ISMDs as an increasing number of edentulous patients are being provided with ISMDs, resulting in an increasing need for the maintenance of the prosthesis in the primary care setting at a possible cost to the patient. Implant-supported overdentures are becoming a common treatment option for edentulous patients, however, they are not without their clinical challenges, many of which can be easily rectified in a primary care environment, such as general practice. ","443":"The use of conscious sedation for the management of anxious paediatric dental patients is extremely beneficial.

This paper will discuss and outline the dental management of patients with acquired bleeding disorders that can result from medical conditions. Again, these may be associated with vascular defects, platelet defects or coagulation defects. In an age when people are living longer, and medical interventions are continually becoming more advanced, clinicians will need to be aware of systemic disorders and treatments that may cause complications in the dental setting. Being able to recognize which medical conditions, including their management, may cause bleeding problems at an early stage will lead to good patient management, particularly in planning and delivering treatment involving any invasive dental procedures that can cause bleeding. Whilst most patients can be successfully treated in general dental practice, the clinician may need to make a decision on whether or not to refer a patient to specialist services for all dental treatment, or to share care between primary care and specialist services.

CLP patients and their families will need continuing support from medical and dental consultants, specialist nurses, health visitors, speech and language specialists and, perhaps, psychologists. These two articles outline the principles of care for the CLP patient and, secondly, illustrate this with a case report, documenting one patient's journey from birth to 21 years of age. A successful outcome for CLP patients requires a sound dentition.The general dental practitioner role is vital to establish and maintain excellent oral hygiene, a healthy diet and good routine preventive and restorative care. Understanding the total needs of CLP patients can help the dentist to provide high quality care as part of the multidisciplinary management.

The aim of this paper is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of cases which present in general dental practice. Canine position is considered in four categories; canine overlap with adjacent incisor, vertical canine height, angulation to midline and position of canine root apex. Good, average and poor prognostic outcomes are considered for each category and a brief outline of their management is included. Canine impactions frequently present during routine examination. Appropriate recognition, investigation and referral, if necessary, are paramount to successful treatment. ","453":"Many materials are available for the fabrication of indirect restorations such as, metal alloys, resin-based composites and ceramics. Resin cements have long been valued as luting agents for indirect restorations because of their high retentive strength, resistance to wear, and low solubility. However, one of the common discouraging factors regarding their chairside use is the need of multiple-steps (etching, drying, priming and luting) for bonding. Thus the current impetus is towards the use of self-adhesive cements that require no etching, priming or bonding agents to bond to the tooth surface. Their increased popularity can be judged by the commercial availability of more than a dozen self-adhesive resin products\/brands, in a short span of time. This article reviews the composition, physical and biological properties, adhesion characteristics and clinical performance of self-adhesive (resin) cements. Self-adhesive resin cements are dual-cured and adhere to tooth structure without the requirement of a separate etching step and application of an adhesive\/bonding agent. ","454":"There are many myths and fallacies surrounding the conservative or non-surgical management of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).This paper is not a treatise on splint design and does not champion any one particular treatment philosophy. It is, however, produced as the outcome of many years of lecturing and talking to fellow practitioners and represents the most frequently asked questions and common misconceptions encountered by the authors, who have addressed the topics raised with the intention of helping to avoid pitfalls. The common symptoms encountered in general dental practice are pain, either from muscles or the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) itself, limitation or deviation of mandibular movement, and joint sounds, and the authors have attempted to separate fallacy and fact. When appropriate examples are given. There are general treatment guidelines but, while some methods apply to an individual, there is no panacea - individual patient treatment needs vary. It is important that all treatments delivered to a TMD patient should be evidenced-based and should always be in the patient's best interests. Many treatment modalities are proposed that do not fulfil these parameters and can lead to confusion in management. A reference and reading list will be given which will direct the reader to an evidence-based approach to treatment. Some treatment suggestions are founded on the extensive clinical experience of the authors. There will not always be evidence from a randomized, controlled clinical trial to substantiate support for a specific treatment, but the reader should be directed by what the majority of clinicians would undertake as a responsible approach. ","455":"This case series considers the incidence of patients taking bisphosphonate medication that suffer with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) following an exodontia procedure. Forty five such patients who attended the Wigan Royal Albert Edward Infirmary (RAEI) Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) department for an exodontia procedure were examined. A patient's age, gender, exodontia technique, bisphosphonate route (Oral\/IV), smoking status and reason for taking the bisphosphonates, eg osteoporosis\/cancer\/ arthritis was considered. All of the patients that experienced BRONJ were smokers. Bisphosphonates are now widely accepted for the management of medical conditions, including arthritis, osteoporosis and various forms of cancer. Such patients are regularly referred to OMFS departments for dental extractions. ","456":"Bisphosphonate use has been described in children diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), fibrous dysplasia, neuromuscular disorders, bone dysplasia, idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, rheumatologic disorder and even Crohn's disease. In OI patients, bisphosphonates have become an important symptomatic therapy for moderate and severe forms of the disease, because their inhibitory effect on osteoclasts increases bone mineralization and density, thereby reducing the risk of bone fractures. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) has become an increasingly common complication as the use of these drugs is becoming more widespread in adults. However, the evidence for BRONJ in paediatric patients is scarce. We present a case of a patient with OI on IV bisphosphonate therapy who required dental extractions and review the literature of the risk of BRONJ in this group of patients. Dental clinicians need to be aware of the potential risk of BRONJ in paediatric patients who have had intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. It is important that these patients are identified and managed appropriately. ","457":"The use of conscious sedation in paediatric dentistry is very beneficial for the management of anxious children. It is essential that it is provided according to national guidelines in a safe and effective manner. Dentists carrying out conscious sedation in children must be aware of current national guidance and the most appropriate techniques to use. ","458":"This article highlights the fundamental issues which the primary care team should consider when developing preventive dental advice for their patients. Although it is important to have a clear understanding of the carious process, this knowledge must take account of social influences on health when assessing the preventive strategy for individuals. A key factor is that caries is a lifelong process involving fluctuations in demineralization and remineralization. The dental team should ensure that the oral environment favours remineralization and avoids irreversible loss of enamel and dentine. An understanding of this'see-saw' process will influence not only our preventive philosophy but how we, as health professionals, diagnose and treat dental caries. Preventing dental caries is an essential skill for all dental professionals. This article brings together the scientific basis of the appropriate advice. ","459":"The first of this series of three articles discussed the dental management of patients with inherited bleeding disorders. This paper will discuss and outline the dental management of patients with acquired bleeding disorders that can result from drug therapy. These may be associated with vascular defects, platelet defects or coagulation defects. In an age when people are living longer, and medical interventions are continually becoming more advanced, clinicians will need to be aware of systemic disorders and treatments that may cause complications in the dental setting. According to National Statistics, the UK population is projected to increase by 0.7% by 2016. This trend is shared with other European countries which also have ageing populations. The proportion of people aged over 65 is predicted to increase from 16% in 2006 to 22% in 2031. Being able to recognize which drugs may cause bleeding problems at an early stage will lead to good patient management, particularly in planning and delivering treatment following invasive procedures such as dental extractions. Whilst most patients can be successfully treated in general dental practice, the clinician may need to make a decision on whether or not to refer a patient to specialist services for all dental treatment, or to share care between primary care and specialist services for selected procedures. ","460":"As part of treatment planning, options are presented to patients by dentists. An informal discussion takes place involving a cost-benefit analysis and a treatment plan is agreed. Evidence-based dentistry takes into account the best available literature, clinical experience and patient factors to guide the dentist. Dentists exert considerable influence on which treatment modality is selected. This paper focuses on the importance of patient factors which lead to less than ideal, clinically acceptable, treatment plans that nevertheless give patient satisfaction over the long term. Though no universally accepted healthcare model exists for restorative dentistry, patients' decisions are most influenced by their relationship with their dentist over factors such as time, access and cost. Letters should be sent to patients clarifying the nature of all proposed options, including advantages and disadvantages, complications, success rates, biological and financial costs and what happens if no treatment is carried out. Many psychological and social determinants influence patients'values and decision-making when planning for restorative dentistry. These lead to a treatment plan agreed between the patient and the dentist. Often an element of compromise is considered acceptable to both parties when the evidence would suggest an alternative treatment to be preferable.

A case of GCA that presented as headache, jaw claudication, unilateral visual loss and tongue ulceration leading to necrosis is reported and the literature reviewed, with an emphasis on dentally relevant aspects. It is vital that GCA is not overlooked in patients over the age of 50 with unexplained dental pain, tissue necrosis or jaw pain which may be misdiagnosed as a temporomandibular joint disorder. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is the key to preventing visual loss. Early referral in such cases would be warranted. Dental clinicians may play a part in the early diagnosis of GCA by having a high index of suspicion for its symptoms in patients, so that devastating ischaemic consequences, such as irreversible visual loss, can be prevented. ","467":"A telephone survey was used to assess adequacy of pain control after third molar removal in a series of three audits. After each audit, factors contributing to failure to control pain adequately and poor patient compliance with our analgesic regimen were identified. Changes in practice were then introduced to remedy areas of weakness and improve outcome. Despite an apparently sound protocol for the prescription of analgesics for patients having third molar surgery, the first audit revealed that 53% of patients experienced moderate to severe pain. After the introduction of written patient instructions to clarify the use of post-operative analgesics, the second audit demonstrated that 86% had their pain managed successfully. After subsequently increasing the post-operative Ibuprofen doses from 400 mg to 600 mg, the third audit showed that 96% of patients had satisfactory pain control. The use of clinical audit with an evidence-based analgesic regimen and clear, written patient instruction has improved post-operative pain control. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of clinical audit for the monitoring and improvement of pain control and analgesic prescribing regimens following oral surgery, which in turn may improve patient experience and outcome. ","468":"Treatment of dental trauma can be an infrequent, unpredictable and stressful experience for a dental practitioner. Correct diagnosis and management of such cases is of primary importance in the prognosis of the affected dentition. We have therefore constructed a number of easy to follow algorithms in management, both short and long term, for the range of traumatic injuries that can affect the permanent dentition. Immediate as well as longer term management of dental trauma cases can be difficult, therefore a clear treatment plan is of great importance in successful results.

However, it is common practice for radiographs to be printed out and attached to referrals.This study investigates the loss of diagnostic information of printed radiographs compared to the on-screen digital image.The best quality was achieved with images printed onto radiographic film or onto photographic paper with an inkjet printer. Laser and inkjet printer output onto 80 gsm office paper resulted in a loss of diagnostic information. Wherever possible, radiographs should be transmitted digitally between clinicians to maintain image integrity. This paper illustrates the potential pitfalls of printing radiographs to be sent with referrals.

However, a detailed appraisal of these papers revealed lack of detail in the cleaning methods used prior to sterilization and none of the papers considered the risks of prion contamination. An examination of the evidence base on sterilization of oil-lubricated handpieces is of potential value to dental clinicians and their teams. ","471":"The most common cause of excessive bleeding is idiopathic, but bleeding can also be caused by inherited or acquired conditions associated with vascular defects, platelet defects or coagulation disorders. This paper will cover inherited bleeding disorders. Every clinician will encounter a patient who complains of prolonged bleeding following certain procedures; most commonly dental extractions. In the majority of cases the cause is often a local one and can be managed using simple local measures. However, prolonged post-operative bleeding following dental treatment might be one of the first signs of a bleeding disorder in an undiagnosed patient, necessitating referral for further investigations. Some patients may present with an already confirmed diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, requiring appropriate treatment planning and dental management in an appropriate setting with haematological advice. This paper will provide guidance on how to achieve this. To update clinicians on the dental management of patients with inherited bleeding disorders and how to decide the most appropriate setting for the provision of dental care.

A modified approach to traditional bridge design may be necessary to restore edentulous spaces in the presence of poorly aligned abutment teeth and abutment teeth of guarded prognosis. The coping bridge is a useful technique in the dentist's armamentarium for patients in whom implant-supported or removable prostheses are inappropriate. This paper examines the use of coping-retained bridges as a modification on traditional design and discusses how these appliances may be applied in general practice. A case report is presented describing the application of this design in general practice.

The primary goal is removal of the tumour, however, with a gradual increase in survival rates, post-operative rehabilitation is now becoming increasingly important. Specialists in restorative dentistry, along with oral and maxillofacial surgeons, general dental practitioners and other members of the multidisciplinary team play a vital role in planning treatment for, and rehabilitating, these patients. This paper presents a case series to show how recent advances in computerized tomography (CT) and the use of stereolithographic models can help in the rehabilitation of oral cancer patients. The principles discussed can also be applied to other patients undergoing dental implant treatment to help plan and carry out treatment and improve the quality of peri-implant tissues.

Traditionally, a dentist's role has been to treat disease and promote oral health. Elective, invasive dental treatment needs careful consideration and, often, interdisciplinary planning. The issues dentists may need to consider and discuss with their patients are outlined with reference to dental literature. Requests to dentists to embark upon complex elective treatments to improve their patients' dental appearance are on the increase. It is important that clinicians appropriately assess cases prior to committing to a treatment plan. Considerations to be taken when assessing these patients are discussed. ","489":"Dentine hypersensitivity (DHS) remains a worldwide under-reported and under-managed problem, despite making some dental treatments more stressful than necessary and having a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. This article is designed to build dental professionals' confidence and remove any confusion regarding the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of sensitive teeth caused by dentine hypersensitivity in those patients known to be at risk. There is a need for simple guidelines, which can be readily applied in general practice. However, it is also obvious that one strategy cannot suit all patients. This review describes a DHS management scheme for dental professionals that is linked to management strategies targeted at three different groups of patient. These patient groups are: 1) patients with gingival recession; 2) treatment patients with toothwear lesions; and 3) patients with periodontal disease and those receiving periodontal treatment. The authors also acknowledge the role of industry as well as dental professionals in a continuing role in educating the public on the topic of sensitive teeth. It is therefore important that educational activities and materials for both dental professionals and consumers use common terminology in order to reduce the possibility for confusion. This review article provides practical, evidence-based guidance on the management of dentine hypersensitivity for dental professionals covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Sensitivity associated with gingival recession, toothwear and periodontal disease and periodontal treatment are specifically addressed in the article.

It may also be indicated because of unpleasant or lengthy treatment or to prevent exacerbation of a patient's medical or behavioural condition by anxiety. The indicator of sedation need (IOSN) tool has been developed to help support dentists in their clinical decision-making and uses information about a patient's anxiety, medical and behavioural status and treatment complexity. The IOSN has been used to measure sedation need and has shown that 5.1% of patients attending general dental practices have a high need of conscious sedation. IOSN has also been used to investigate the need for conscious sedation in the general population among dental practice attenders and those who don't attend. The proportion was found to be 6.7%. Some patients require conscious sedation in order to access dental care. The indicator of sedation need (IOSN) tool helps in the decision-making process.

This article reviews the various factors associated with the decision-making when considering an extra-coronal restoration for a molar tooth. The current literature is disseminated and compared to results obtained from clinicians at the Dental Pan Society meeting in 2007. Dentists were seemingly less likely to consider restorations with greater complications for themselves than they were for their patients. The various implications of the results are discussed. With the plethora of dental materials available, the clinician has a wide choice of restorations. As clinicians become increasingly aware of the relative complications associated with different restorations, they are less likely to choose those that may result in problems, such as loss of vitality. In comparison, patients, if not kept fully informed, are unlikely to be aware of these problems and therefore may be happy to accept a more 'aesthetic' restoration. This decision dynamic-is examined in this article. ","511":"Coronectomy of mandibular third molars is a well established technique that is going through a resurgence as it seems to reduce the risk of inferior dental nerve (IDN) injury. The reservation with the technique arises because of fear that the retained root will become infected and symptomatic over time. General dental practitioners will be responsible for the long-term review and care of these patients and, consequently, it is important that they are aware of the technique and its sequelae. Coronectomy of mandibular third molars to avoid nerve injury is becoming increasingly popular. It is important that general dental practitioners (GDPs) are aware of the immediate and later sequelae of treatment and the implication of the retained root. ","512":"Decoronation of high risk mandibular third molars (M3Ms) has become common practice in parts of UK and USA. With the introduction of Cone Beam CT scanning, there has been an evolution in the practice, with avoidance of unnecessary coronectomies based on CBCT findings. Also, additional anatomical features found only on CBCTs have introduced possible additional indications to undertake intentional coronectomy. Trigeminal nerve injury is the most problematic consequence of dental surgical procedures with major medico-legal implications. Iatrogenic injuries to the third division of the trigeminal nerve remain a common and complex clinical problem. Altered sensation and pain in the orofacial region may interfere with speaking, eating, kissing, shaving, applying make-up, toothbrushing and drinking; namely just about every social interaction we take for granted. Usually after oral rehabilitation, the patient expects and experiences significant improvements, not only regarding jaw function, but also in relation to dental, facial, and even overall body image. Thus these injuries have a significant negative effect on the patient's self-image and quality of life and the iatrogenesis of these injuries lead to significant psychological effects. Coronectomy is an alternative procedure to complete removal of a mandibular third molar in situations where there is high risk of damage to the inferior alveolar nerve.

This was managed by cautery, followed by excision of the fistula, both of which were unsuccessful. Following this, further investigations revealed that the cause of the facial sinus was in fact a cyst associated with a mandibular fourth molar in the posterior ascending ramus. The tooth was extracted, via a pre-auricular extra-oral approach, under general anaesthetic.

While such techniques are invariably more conservative of tooth tissue than indirect procedures, operative techniques using direct composite can be challenging and are considered technique sensitive. Clinicians require both technical and artistic skill to provide composite restorations that restore function and aesthetics to blend seamlessly with the residual dentition. This paper provides an update on the aesthetic considerations involved in the restoration of anterior teeth with directly placed composite and outlines the contemporary materials, equipment and techniques that are available to optimize every clinical stage. Successful restoration of anterior teeth with direct composite is an integral component of contemporary clinical practice. ","526":"","527":"Periodontitis is a complex disease that has both oral and systemic consequences. The treatment of periodontitis may be both surgical and non-surgical but, in recent years, there has been a shift towards managing disease non-surgically in preference to surgery. Fundamental to all types of therapy is the patient's role in disease control, in the form of self-performed plaque control, and it is important that the patient understands this. Non-surgical periodontal therapy has a long history and has traditionally been carried out using a variety of hand and powered instruments, the objective being root surface disinfection by the removal of plaque, calculus and contaminated root cementum. However, over the last 30 years or so, it has become apparent that calculus does not cause disease, cementum does not become significantly infected and bacteria and their toxins are only loosely adherent to the diseased root surface. This has led to the development of less invasive instrumentation principles which may be better for patients, more cost-effective and more easily applied in different clinical settings. This paper aims to describe and justify a minimally-invasive approach to the management of the diseased root surface in periodontitis, to clarify the terminology used and to suggest how these principles may be applied in general practice.

The lesion may or may not progress and lesion progression can be controlled, slowed down or arrested. Control of the biofilm is the treatment of caries, the most important measure being to disturb the biofilm mechanically using a fluoride-containing toothpaste. The informed patient controls caries and the role of the dental professional is to advise how this should be done. This is the non-operative treatment of caries and it is worthy of payment. It should be mandatory as part of any operative treatment to ensure that the patient understands, and is able to perform, adequate plaque control.

However, dentine pin placement can be a hazardous procedure and there are a number of problems associated with their use. Alternative techniques have been described which may be utilized and are effective at retaining the restorative material without the shortcomings of dentine pins.

Successful management of this common inflammatory condition necessitates team work by the patient, dental hygienist and dentist. A variety of complex skills are required including, not only the necessary clinical skills, but also excellent communication, education and motivation of patients. Above all, time is required to treat the condition properly, and successful outcomes depend heavily on engaging with and empowering the patient to manage his\/her condition. Patients need to be active partners in the management of their periodontitis (supported by the dental team), and this will only happen if the time is spent to educate them on their role. Communication is essential for successful management, and behaviour change is always required of patients.

Although severe destructive periodontal conditions are uncommon in children, it is essential that children receive a periodontal screening as part of their regular dental examination. Early diagnosis ensures a high likelihood of a successful therapeutic outcome, primarily by reduction of aetiologic factors, remedial therapy and development of an effective maintenance protocol. This prevents the recurrence and progression of disease and reduces the incidence of tooth loss. In the first article, we discussed the classification, plaque-induced and non plaque-induced gingival diseases, localized and generalized forms of chronic as well as aggressive periodontitis. In this second article, we discuss periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, necrotizing periodontal diseases, periodontal screening and basic periodontal examination, and treatment of periodontal diseases in children and adolescents.

","577":"Caries infiltration is a micro-invasive treatment to arrest non-cavitated caries lesions. The method is based on the penetration of low-viscosity light-curing resins, so called infiltrants, into the pores within the enamel lesion. That way, diffusion pathways for cariogenic acids are occluded, resulting in a reduction or even arrest of lesion progression. A positive side-effect of caries infiltration is that lesions change their optical properties and appear similar to sound enamel. Therefore, caries infiltration can also be used to camouflage aesthetically disfiguring white spot lesions on buccal surfaces. Resin infiltration is a micro-invasive treatment to arrest and to camouflage non-cavitated proximal caries lesions that virtually bridges non-invasive and restorative treatment options.

The first and most important role is to offer preventive services, particularly to smokers and to patients who drink alcohol to excess. It is of critical importance that every patient has a systematic examination of oral soft tissues when seen by a GDP. All patients with suspicious lesions should be referred for urgent attention to a specialist centre. Once oral cancer has been diagnosed, GDPs may be presented with patients requiring urgent dentistry, including extractions before commencement of treatment, requiring palliation of symptoms during treatment, or requiring general dentistry after treatment. Radiotherapy provides increased survival but has serious adverse consequences, which may be lifelong, including dry mouth, radiation caries, limitation of mouth opening and high risk of osteonecrosis after extractions. Extraction of teeth in irradiated bone should be referred to specialist centres. Improving survival rates and an ageing population mean that GDPs will see many more survivors of head and neck cancer in the future, with an increased burden of dental care in the longer-term and an increased need for monitoring and secondary prevention. The management of patients with head and neck cancer is complex and involves a multi-disciplinary team, both in the primary treatment but also in the long-term care.

Tumoral calcinosis is a rare disorder of mineral metabolism with oral manifestations. ","630":"The provision of fixed prosthodontic restorations that meets the patient's functional and aesthetic demands can be challenging, especially in the anterior maxilla. It requires close communication with the technician and knowledge of the available options. This article will outline the options for pontic design and focus on the ovate pontic, which has the potential to provide the most aesthetic outcome. This should equip the practitioner with the knowledge as to which pontic to prescribe if such a challenge arises. Fixed bridgework is a commonly prescribed prosthesis for the replacement of missing teeth. In order for this to be provided successfully, the practitioner should have a working knowledge of the available options for pontic design.This is especially important in cases where aesthetic demands are high.

Their expectations, hopes and fears need to be explored in detail. The long-term biologic costs of some invasive procedures need to be explained to patients in advance so that they can make properly informed decisions. Failure to do so renders the practitioner vulnerable to a charge of behaving unethically.

Patients who are on anticoagulants represent a large group of bleeding disorders. This article reviews the latest evidence in regard to managing those patients. Most of the articles reviewed seem to agree on the negligible risk of modification or interruption of oral anticoagulants when performing most dental treatments because a decreased risk of excessive bleeding might be associated with an increased risk of thrombo-embolic complications. However, extensive pre-operative assessment is essential to reduce the risk of serious complications. Patients with bleeding disorders pose a challenge for dentists. Adequate understanding of the underlying medical condition is essential to reduce the risk of dangerous complications.

Each'solution'or combinations thereof could play a significant role but no detailed guidelines exist on their use. An audit was undertaken to compare current practice in Belfast Dental School to the others across the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI). This audit highlighted three main differences between Belfast and other dental schools. Many other institutions utilized other irrigants besides sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), different intracanal medicaments, including calcium hydroxide, and higher concentrations of NaOCl. Having gathered this information, we ask, 'Is there sufficient evidence to change the endodontic regime currently used at Belfast Dental School?'. Using the findings from the literature review (Part 1), we introduce new evidence-based protocols for primary and secondary cases for use in Belfast Dental School. In the absence of detailed clinical guidelines on the use of endodontic lubricants, irrigants and medicaments in primary and secondary cases, it is important to be aware of current practice in UK and ROI dental schools where dentists and specialists are trained.

It is important that the patient understands what the consequences and limitations of treatment are likely to be, and what the potential failures could entail later in his\/her life. Informed consent should be obtained (preferably in writing) and the clinical notes and records should be clearly documented, with accurate and concise details provided of all the investigations carried out, and their findings, as well as including details of the various discussions that have taken place. Dentists need to be aware of the existence of heightened expectations in this group of patients and be cautious about accepting patients who have unrealistic 'cosmetic' expectations. Where possible, cosmetic or aesthetic dental treatment should be provided which is minimally destructive and, in the long-term, be in the 'best interests' of the patient. Important matters such as the gaining of informed consent and maintaining meticulous, contemporaneous dental records will also be emphasized. It is hoped that the article will provide clear definitions of some commonly used terms such as 'ethical marketing', 'ethics', and 'values', which are often used in association with the marketing, planning and undertaking of supposedly 'cosmetic' dental procedures. The important role of less invasive alternative treatment options will also be emphasized.

Despite this, instituting the correct diagnosis tests the skills of an oral medicine expert. Therefore, the same is all the more challenging for a general practitioner who may encounter these lesions without any significant experience. The importance of diagnosing such lesions cannot be understated, as they may represent a myriad of conditions ranging from seemingly innocuous benign pathologic processes to much more sinister ones, like oral malignancy; occasionally some of these lesions may manifest atypically. Such atypical presentations may cloud the diagnostic process. Here a case uncharacteristic of the condition it represented is reported with the aim of increasing awareness of the diagnosis of such lesions.","650":"Complicated crown-root fractures in permanent teeth present both patient-centred and restorative problems when treating the adolescent.

Current second- and third-generation LED light units have progressively replaced their halogen lamp predecessors because of their inherent advantages. The background to this, together with the clinical issues relating to light curing and the possible solutions, are outlined in the second part of this article. Finally, the innovative features of what may be seen as the first of a new fourth-generation of LED lights are described and guidance is given for the practitioner on what factors to consider when seeking to purchase a new LED light activation unit. Adequate curing in depth is fundamental to clinical success with any light-activated restoration. To achieve this goal predictably, an appropriate light source needs to be combined with materials knowledge, requisite clinical skills and attention to detail throughout the entire restoration process. As dentists increasingly use light-cured direct composites to restore large posterior restorations they need to appreciate the issues central to effective and efficient light curing and to know what to look for when seeking to purchase a new light-curing unit. ","669":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious, life-threatening disease and oral bacteria are implicated in 35-45% of cases. This has led to the development of guidelines recommending the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) prior to invasive dental procedures in patients at risk of IE. There is considerable controversy about the value of AP in preventing IE, resulting in guideline changes and different guidelines in different parts of the world. In March 2008, NICE recommended the complete cessation of AP prior to dental procedures in the UK. The effects of this controversial change were not entirely as anticipated and may provide important lessons about the role of AP in preventing IE. The debate over the value of providing antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in patients undergoing invasive dental procedures is of importance to dentists worldwide. The effect of the NICE guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis prescribing and incidence of infective endocarditis in the UK has contributed important new evidence to this ongoing debate.

Use of platelet-rich plasma provides the clinician with an autologous source of growth factors to accelerate healing. ","679":"Direct placement resin composite is revolutionizing the restoration of posterior teeth. Compared to amalgam, its use not only improves aesthetics but, more importantly, promotes a minimally invasive approach to cavity preparation. Despite the benefits, the use of composite to restore load-bearing surfaces of molar and premolar teeth is not yet universally applied. This may be due to individual practitioner concerns over unpredictability, time and the fact that procedures remain technique sensitive for many, particularly with regard to moisture control, placement and control of polymerization shrinkage stress. New materials, techniques and equipment are available that may help to overcome many of these concerns. This paper describes how such techniques may be employed in the management of a carious lesion on the occlusal surface of an upper molar. Direct posterior composite is the treatment of choice for the conservative restoration of primary carious lesions. ","680":"Sectional dentures are constructed in separate parts which join together intra-orally to create a single prosthesis. They are used to exploit undercuts around teeth, hard and soft tissues which require more than one path of insertion, and are usually of split pin or locking bolts design. By using two case studies, we aim to illustrate the provision of sectional dentures and to which situations their uses are best suited. A 30-year-old male was referred to the Department of Prosthetics at the Birmingham Dental Hospital for a replacement upper partial cobalt chrome denture of a Kennedy Class IV bounded saddle. The patient had a history of failed upper cobalt chrome removable partial dentures owing to loss of retention and poor stability over the previous 12 months. A 40-year-old female patient was referred by her GDP for restoration of a bounded saddle in the lower right quadrant with a history of intolerance to previous dentures. These two cases demonstrate the successful use of sectional dentures in the aesthetic zone. Although more technically demanding, they lie well within the scope of general practice and offer patients alternative solutions from dental implants and bridgework. These cases highlight the importance of the use of alternative prosthetic techniques which can be simple and achievable for all practitioners. Sectional dentures are a treatment modality for the edentulous space where the presence of one or more undercuts prevents restoration by more conventional techniques.

This legislation ensures a safe environment in which to work and receive treatment and requires that those involved in the radiographic process must be appropriately trained for the type of radiographic practice they perform. A list of the topics required is detailed in Schedule 2 of IR(ME)R 2000 and is paraphrased in Table 1, with the extent and amount of knowledge required depending on the type of radiographic practice undertaken. Virtually all dental practitioners undertake radiography as part of their clinical practice.

Dentists and their staff should be aware that after a stroke some people are unable to talk or have limited powers of expression. Comprehension might be impaired and people with aphasia may be unable to grasp some common language, such as appointment letters and patient information. ","684":"Whether deciduous teeth should be restored has caused controversy for at least 150 years and the argument rages on. Dental caries is a controllable process. The role of operative dentistry and restorations, as far as caries control is concerned, is to make cavitated, uncleansible lesions accessible to plaque control. However, deciduous teeth are exfoliated and perhaps non-operative treatments (plaque control, fluoride, diet) are all that are required to take cavitated teeth pain-free to exfoliation. Are such techniques child-friendly, obviating the need for anaesthesia or the use of handpieces? Alternatively, are they wanton neglect? This paper is written by a cariologist who never treated children, to present alternative managements and rehearse these arguments from a cariological perspective.

","694":"Oral cancer patients undergo life-altering curative treatment that consists of surgery or a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. This can severely alter the functional anatomy of the oral cavity and create a challenging environment for successful oral rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to rehabilitate these patients successfully. It is essential to have assessment by an oral rehabilitation specialist before treatment, especially where primary rehabilitation interventions are being considered. Following cancer treatment, patients may suffer from a range of difficulties, from dento-facial appearance, to chewing, speech and swallowing. This dysfunction often leads to psychosocial problems, such as reduced self esteem, social contact and quality of life. Conventional prosthodontics has a role to play in the management of these patients but osseointegrated implants (OII), can be required to overcome the anatomical and physiological barriers. OII can be used in an environment where there is poor soft tissue function or little bone support, and where there is a dry mouth.

Treatment options and guidance for managing patients who present with tooth surface loss. ","696":"The replacement of crowns and bridges is a common procedure for many dental practitioners. When correctly planned and executed, fixed prostheses will provide predictable function, aesthetics and value for money. However, when done poorly, they are more likely to fail prematurely and lead to irreversible damage to the teeth and supporting structures beneath. Sound diagnosis, assessment and technical skills are essential when dealing with failed or failing fixed restorations. These skills are essential for the 21st century dentist. This paper, with treated clinical examples, illustrates the areas of technical skill and clinical decisions needed for this type of work. It also provides advice on how the risk of premature failure can, in general, be further reduced. The article also confirms the very real risk in the UK of dento-legal problems when patients experience unexpected problems with their crowns and bridges. This paper outlines clinical implications of failed fixed prosthodontics to the dental surgeon. It also discusses factors that we can all use to predict and reduce the risk of premature restoration failure. Restoration design, clinical execution and patient factors are the most frequent reasons for premature problems.

They appraise evidence from trials focused on investigating clinical effects of dental material categories, such as conventional glass-ionomer cements (GIC) or resin-modified GIC. In contrast, the general dental practitioner is introduced to these categories of materials in the form of branded or private product labels that are marketed during dental conventions or through advertisements. Difficulties may arise in recognizing material categories that have been subjected to systematic reviews, because of the multitude of product labels on the current market. Thus, the value and relevance of published systematic review evidence concerning the material categories represented by these labels may remain obscure. Based on a systematic literature search, this article identifies glass-ionomer cement product labels used during clinical trials which, in turn, were subsequently reviewed in systematic review articles (published between 15 April 2009 and 14 April 2011). This article further clarifies how these product labels relate to the systematic review conclusions. The results show that the conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements that were used in most trials were marketed by GC and 3M ESPE, respectively. The conventional GICs used in most of the reviewed trials were Fuji III and Fuji IX, while Vitremer was the most commonly used resin-modified GIC. Evidence from the reviewed trials suggests that GIC provides beneficial effects for preventive and restorative dentistry. However, more trials of higher internal validity are needed in order to confirm (or disprove) these findings. Only GIC products of branded labels and none of private labels were identified, suggesting that private label GIC products have little or no research back-up. Dental products, such as glass-ionomers cements (GIC), can only be judged as effective when they are based on sufficient research back-up. Systematic reviews of clinical trials provide such back-up at the highest level. Thus clinicians must be able to identify GIC products for which reliable evidence from systematic reviews of clinical studies is available and know about what such evidence contains.

We present a case report on a lower right wisdom tooth dislodged into the right parapharyngeal space on its removal from the socket and the subsequent management of this rare complication. Though a rare complication, clinicians have to be aware that lower third molars can be dislodged into tissue spaces and the importance of prompt appropriate management.

They are broadly classified as horizontal and vertical root fractures. They may be clinically challenging cases to treat as, usually, treatment of such cases requires an interdisciplinary\/multidisciplinary approach for complete rehabilitation of teeth. For a successful outcome, it is imperative to arrive at an appropriate diagnosis and design a treatment plan accordingly as soon as possible.This review article discusses the various types of root fractures, their diagnosis and treatment, along with the factors affecting their healing and prognosis.

A commercially-available smooth orange juice drink was used as a positive control. Baseline pH and titratable acidity were measured by titrating each fruit smoothie with 0.5 mL increments of 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and measuring the pH following the addition of each increment, until pH 7 and pH 10 were reached. Each of the fruit smoothies investigated demonstrated a low baseline pH and had relatively high titratable acidity. Owing to both their low pH and high titratable acidity, it would be advisable to limit the consumption of such fruit smoothies to meal times.

He was seen in a general restorative clinic at Barts and the London NHS Trust. Clinical examination did not reveal any relevant abnormalities. A panoramic tomography, however, showed the presence of multiple supernumerary teeth, which were located in the maxillary right and left premolar and molar regions, and the mandibular left premolar region. The family's history was non-contributory. The patient was unaware of the supernumerary teeth and, as far as he knew, there were no other members of his family with a similar problem. A decision regarding the appropriate management of supernumerary teeth should be considered carefully since surgical removal of the teeth may cause damage to adjacent structures, including bone. In this respect, it is interesting and rare to find multiple supernumerary teeth in individuals with no other associated diseases or syndromes elucidated by clinical and historical enquiry. ","728":"The number of elderly people in the population is rising and there is an increasing trend for tooth preservation. Older patients are more likely to have complex medical histories and\/or physical disabilities. They are increasingly likely to retain their teeth, which could be heavily restored or broken down and root treatment may be challenging. In order to maintain teeth, a decision needs to be made as to whether or not to carry out endodontic treatment, which may be challenging in itself, and may also be associated with other age-related considerations. This paper considers endodontic issues related to the older patient, bearing in mind the plethora of considerations which may be relevant to root canal treatment. There are many benefits of retaining teeth, but there may be disadvantages.

This has been largely driven by a patient-orientated demand for the use of aesthetic restorative materials. It has occurred concomitantly with an improvement in the mechanical properties of available materials, and advances in our knowledge of resin bonding. Onlay restorations are advocated for a plethora of clinical applications. This paper considers the role of adhesive onlay restorations fabricated in resin composite in contemporary restorative practice, including the presentation of two case reports. This case report describes a minimally invasive, aesthetic solution to provide cuspal coverage by means of either a direct or indirect resin composite onlay restoration, respectively. ","731":"Anterior open bite has a multi-factorial aetiology comprising: genetically inherited skeletal pattern, soft tissue effect and digit-sucking habits. To formulate an appropriate treatment plan, accurate diagnosis is essential. Simple open bites may sometimes resolve completely during the transition from mixed to permanent dentition, if the digit-sucking habit is broken. More significant open bites, however, sometimes extending right back to the terminal molars, rarely resolve spontaneously and will often require complex orthodontic treatment, involving active molar intrusion or even major orthognathic surgery. Unfortunately, surgery has associated risks attached, including pain, swelling, bruising, altered nerve sensation and, occasionally, permanent anaesthesia, as well as involving significant costs, as with any major surgical procedure under general anaesthesia. The introduction of Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs) has expanded the possibilities of orthodontic treatment, beyond traditional limitations of tooth movement. Molar intrusion can be successfully carried out without the need for major surgical intervention, thus avoiding all the attendant risks and disadvantages. This paper provides an overview of anterior open bite and uses an illustrative case where open bite was successfully treated with a combination of fixed appliance therapy and TADs. Anterior open bite is commonly seen in general practice. A knowledge of the possible aetiological factors and their potential management should be understood by general dental practitioners. The increased popularity of TADS allows a new and less invasive approach to management of these cases.

Since patients with sickle cell disease are particularly vulnerable to the effects of periods of hypoxia, which may produce significant morbidity, and because of the additional practical challenges in sedating this group of patients, intravenous sedation should be undertaken in a specialist unit. The increasing prevalence of sickle cell disease highlights the importance of dentists practising in multi-cultural communities having an understanding of this condition and its implications on their clinical practice.

This article describes a protocol for the examination, assessment and treatment planning for a patient seeking a solution to an aesthetic concern. The technique of undertaking an intra-oral'mock-up' using resin composite as a diagnostic approach can be particularly helpful when planning for future prosthodontic rehabilitation. The latter can allow the operator and patient to visualize crudely what is aesthetically and functionally possible, given the constraints imposed by that patient. The patient has ultimately managed in a minimally invasive manner. It can be very tempting for a dental operator to impose his\/her concepts of the'artistic ideal' when planning for care in the smile zone. Such ideals are largely based on established universal aesthetic principles of tooth colour, size, shape, form, position, symmetry and proportion. However, beauty is a very subjective matter. It is essential for the operator to listen attentively to his\/her patient's concerns. Meticulous patient examination and assessment are absolutely critical factors in attempting to attain a successful outcome. The use of reversible, chairside intra-oral mock-up techniques can not only help with the transference of essential information to the dental technician when planning for restorative intervention in the smile zone, but can also allow the patient to gain an insight and indeed contribute his\/her views to the possible restorative endpoint, respectively.

Successful adhesive bonding is dependent upon appreciating the quality of the dental substrate, appropriate clinical handling of the material and patient, together with an appreciation of the chemistry of the adhesive. This paper outlines the current status of contemporary bonding, with particular emphasis on translating laboratory-based evidence into clinical practice. Using laboratory-based evidence, the ability of a bond to achieve a seal to enamel appears to be the best predictor of clinical performance.

Acute and chronic facial pain must be differentiated and it is widely accepted that chronic pain refers to pain of 3 months or greater duration. Differentiating the many causes of facial pain can be difficult for busy practitioners, but a logical approach can be beneficial and lead to more rapid diagnoses with effective management. Confirming a diagnosis involves a process of history-taking, clinical examination, appropriate investigations and, at times, response to various therapies. Although primary care clinicians would not be expected to diagnose rare pain conditions, such as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, they should be able to assess the presenting pain complaint to such an extent that, if required, an appropriate referral to secondary or tertiary care can be expedited. The underlying causes of pain of non-dental origin can be complex and management of pain often requires a multidisciplinary approach.

It is essential to distinguish between the three clinical types of ameloblastomas - the intra-osseous solid lesion, the unicystic type and the extra-osseous lesion, as they differ in their biological behaviour and rate of recurrence and therefore require different forms of treatment. The case presented here is of a 9-year-old boy who reported to the department with pain and swelling along the right side of the mandible of 3 months'duration. Previous histopathological examination of the lesion, performed at a local hospital, produced a picture consistent with unicystic ameloblastoma. The lesion was managed by enucleation and the patient has been followed up for the past 5 years. Radiographic and clinical examinations reveal signs of healing without recurrence.

An update for the general practitioner on the indications for bisphosphonate therapy and both risk assessment and prevalence of ONJ-BR is provided. Management philosophy within a local unit is illustrated through four brief case studies. It is not uncommon to encounter patients on bisphosphonate therapy in the dental practice environment; the vast majority of these will be on oral bisphosphonates as part of their management for osteoporosis. The risk of developing ONJ-BR is rare in these patients compared with those receiving treatment for skeletal complications associated with cancer, many of whom will be managed with IV bisphosphonates. Although rare, it is important to recognize the potential risk of ONJ-BR. Whilst most patients on oral bisphosphonates can be managed no differently from other patients, it should be appreciated that the relative risk of long-term cumulative exposure, comorbidity and other factors are still to be determined. Surgical intervention and extractions can place the patient at risk of ONJ-BR and vigilance is necessary to ensure that healing progresses satisfactorily. Early referral to the local hospital should be sought if there is cause for concern. Although the risk of ONJ-BR is low in non-oncological indications, it is important to be aware that it exists and to know how the risk may be minimized.

Another innovative concept is that of'chroma balance' which may be generally achieved through the use of more or less intensive dentine shades, different from the one which was originally chosen. From study of the behaviour of light in bodies, and especially in teeth and restorations, it may be possible to find the cause of the 'dark halo'effect, which relates to the optical property called the'destructive interference of the light' ","776":"Older people who remain reasonably well may wish to maintain or enhance their dental and oral appearance, preferably at minimal biologic and financial costs.

Bleaching addresses the discoloration, while direct composite bonding can improve the shape of worn, or otherwise unaesthetic, teeth without damaging the structure or health of the residual tooth tissue. This pragmatic treatment is well tolerated by older patients. The visual and functional improvements are greatly appreciated by this group, partly because of the non-destructive and affordable nature of the benefits.

This paper describes the potential advantages of the bonded amalgam technique. These benefits include decreased microleakage between the cavity wall and the restorative material. This, in turn, may decrease post-operative sensitivity, pulpal inflammation and the incidence of recurrent caries. Extra retention for the restoration may also be provided and the need for cavities to rely on traditional retention and resistance form may be decreased or even eliminated, thus conserving precious tooth tissue. If the restoration is bonded then flexure during function in teeth may be decreased and, in the case of teeth exhibiting a cracked cusp, this may alleviate or eliminate symptoms. Bonding may also provide support to weakened tooth tissue which otherwise would have to be removed, so rendering cavities more conservative, and may increase the fracture resistance of the tooth.

Gagging is most frequently experienced during impression making, but is also reported during the taking of radiographs, in the placement of restorations in posterior teeth and, in some individuals, the insertion of a finger for examination purposes. This paper describes some techniques that can easily be mastered by clinicians that may help both operator and patient avoid this unpleasant occurrence. Techniques such as acupressure, the adaptation of trays, or even the use of alternative impression materials and breathing techniques all have their place, and clinicians may have to try several of these, perhaps in conjunction, in order to assist their patients. A significant number of patients attend for dental treatment that require impressions, and for those with gagging problems it can be a horrendous experience. Being able to make the procedure less of an ordeal is better for all involved. ","796":"Toothwear is commonly observed in dentate older patients and may be physiological or pathological in nature. Toothwear can be caused by abrasion, attrition, erosion or a combination of aetiologies. Where treatment is required, a number of options exist, including the use of adhesive materials and fixed and removable prosthodontics. With patients retaining natural teeth into old age, physiological and pathological toothwear amongst dentate older patients is an increasingly common presentation. ","797":"A labial fraenectomy is indicated in various clinical situations and is performed to facilitate orthodontic closure of a maxillary midline diastema. In these clinical situations, timing of surgery during the phase of orthodontic treatment is important. Labial fraenectomy can be performed before, during or after the orthodontic closure of the maxillary midline diastema, depending on the individual case. It is important to understand how to perform the procedure efficiently and effectively. Success relies as much on accurate diagnosis of the fleshy, prominent or persistent fraenum as it does on meticulous technique to ensure its complete elimination. This article presents the indications for labial fraenectomy. The appropriate timing of the labial fraenectomy procedure to facilitate orthodontic treatment is discussed. A surgical technique to perform maxillary labial fraenectomy procedure in an effective and efficient manner is a useful addition to the clinician's armamentarium. ","798":"With the increasing use of ceramics in restorative dentistry, and trends to extend restoration longevity through the use of minimal interventive techniques, dental practitioners should be familiar with the factors that may influence the decision either to repair or replace fractured metal-ceramic and all-ceramic restorations and, also, the materials and techniques available to repair these restorations. This second of two papers addresses the possible modes of failure of ceramic restorations and outlines indications and techniques in this developing aspect of restoration repair in clinical practice. The repair of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic restorations is a reliable low-cost, low-risk technique that may be of value for the management of loss or fracture of porcelain from a crown or bridge in clinical practice.

It is suggested that the 'secret' of success in dental practice is to make patient (customer) satisfaction the primary focus. Not a very earth shattering or surprising'secret' perhaps! This is hardly a new idea, and not a concept restricted to dental practice. This principle applies to all businesses. This series of articles reviews evidence from across a broad spectrum of publications: from populist business publications through to refereed scientific papers, this'secret' seems to be confirmed. The evidence for which aspects of our service are most important in achieving patient satisfaction (and therefore success) is explored. Good oral health outcomes for patients are defined as the primary purpose of dental practice and, therefore, an essential dimension of success. The link between positive patient perceptions of general care and their own oral health to practice success is explored.","805":"Periodontal recessions can cause aesthetic and functional problems, especially in the anterior region or when combined with exposed crown margins. A combination of periodontal disease, recession with exposed root surface, hard-tissue defects and age emphasizes the need for treating these defects. If crown margins are exposed and surgical treatment is not possible, aesthetics and function can only be improved by replacement of the restoration. The restorative treatment option with a gingiva-shaded composite is especially valuable for dental fear patients or older patients with general or local risk factors, surgical contra-indications or Class III and IV recessions with questionable prognosis of surgery. The step-by-step-approach described in this article is an alternative, minimal-invasive treatment concept for cervical lesions in combination with all kinds of periodontal recessions, that is especially suitable for wedge-shaped defects next to exposed crown margins. With this treatment concept, the reader should be able to use gingiva-shaded composite for different indications, such as exposed root surfaces or crown margins in combination with recessions. ","806":"Oromandibular dystonia is a rare condition of hyperkinetic motor dysfunction in the orofacial area. It is a centrally mediated disorder of unknown aetiology and manifested by a sustained contraction of masticatory muscles, involving one or both lateral pterygoids, and pushing the mandible forward. The prognosis is poor and the treatment is symptomatic. This paper describes a case of a 38-year-old woman referred for a locked left TMJ who was diagnosed as having an oromandibular dystonia. A step-by-step diagnosis and treatment procedure is described. Knowledge of oromandibular dystonia may be valuable as rare medical diseases can be masked by common dental problems. ","807":"This paper outlines the features and presentation of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a psychological syndrome which results in patients seeking treatment for an imagined defect in appearance. The assessment of patients with suspected body dysmorphic disorder is outlined, as well as management strategies. Clinicians working in the field of aesthetic dentistry should be aware that some patients presenting for treatment may have body dysmorphic disorder. Aesthetic dental treatment for such patients is not beneficial and carries some risks. Advice for clinicians on assessment and management is outlined. ","808":"Benign familial neutropenia (BFN) is a condition where there is a decrease in circulating neutrophils in the blood and patients suffer from oral manifestations which include: persistant periodontal disease, recurrent neutropenic ulceration and candidal infections. This report discusses a family affected by BFN and the effects on their oral health. Benign familial neutropenia is a rare condition and this article aims to raise awareness among general dental practitioners so that prompt referral and management in secondary care can be arranged. ","809":"This article presents a contemporary overview of soft or compliant denture lining materials. It does not focus on denture bases, which are intrinsically flexible, and suggests some clinical options which readers might wish to consider. The aim of this article is to update clinicians on the types of compliant linings currently available and to advise on how some might be used. ","810":"Population projections predict an increasing number of dentate older people who will require assessment and treatment of periodontal disease. Studies show that healthy, older patients show no increased risk of periodontal disease progression compared to younger individuals, while periodontal treatment can be equally successful in the older age group. However, co-morbidity can impact negatively on both the periodontal tissues and the dentition. These effects range from a reduced ability to maintain adequate plaque control, to the use of drug and other therapies directly affecting the periodontal tissues and salivary flow. An individualized treatment plan is required for older patients, taking account of all factors impacting on the periodontal tissues. ","811":"The effects of fluoride are regularly discussed in newspapers. This paper reviews this coverage over a ten-year period and compares the content with contemporary scientific evidence. The reporting used in a sample of daily newspapers when the subject of fluoride and its effects were mentioned was analysed and factual statements within the articles were compared with contemporary scientific studies, to assess the accuracy of reporting. Practitioners may face questions from patients regarding the evidence base for the safety and efficacy of the use of fluoride in dentistry. ","812":"The presentation of patients with failing dental restorations that exhibit minor defects is a common clinical situation in everyday dental practice. The repair of such restorations, rather than replacement, is increasingly considered to be a viable alternative to the replacement of the defective restoration. This first of two papers considers indications and techniques for the repair of defective direct composite restorations. It is possible that some dental practitioners are unaware of the option of repair rather than replacement of composite restorations. This article provides an overview of contemporary knowledge and understanding of restoration repair in the clinical management of defective composite restorations. A sound understanding of the indications, benefits and techniques of direct composite restoration repair could allow the longevity of the existing restoration to be extended without unnecessarily sacrificing healthy tooth structure.

The timing of deciduous tooth loss impacts on many aspects of the developing occlusion. The aim of the article is both to describe this impact and also to set out guidelines which should assist the general dental practitioner in the decision of when to lose deciduous teeth. The timing of deciduous tooth loss is an important concept which, when outside the normal pattern, may have adverse or beneficial side-effects that general dental practitioners should fully understand. ","817":"Trauma to an immature tooth can result in pulpal devitalization and arrested apexogenesis, resulting in open apices; this is most common in anterior teeth of the permanent dentition. The attainment of an apical seal in such cases is challenging. The management of an open apex in a central incisor in a 16-year-old male patient is described in this report. The satisfactory result achieved suggests that mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) can be used successfully as a filling material in teeth with open apices. Preservation of anterior teeth following trauma is essential, especially in young patients. A good option is the use of mineral trioxide aggregate in the treatment of open apices. ","818":"Periodontal maintenance therapy is the most important stage of periodontal treatment, yet compliance is low. Overcoming the barriers associated with the low compliance involves a complex set of problems relating to the patient, the clinician and the interactions between them. It is therefore important to create a periodontal maintenance treatment programme which takes into consideration the needs of each individual patient. In addition, regional variations and differences in practice profiles are also factors to be accommodated in a maintenance programme. Good co-operation between the referring dentist and the specialist is required when recommendations are made to the patient regarding maintenance therapy. ","819":"A focus often exists in dental practice on the maintenance and management of the dentition and the periodontium, however, conditions of the oral mucosa and orofacial pain can cause significant problems for older patients. Oral mucosal conditions are more prevalent in older patients and many orofacial pain disorders, such as burning mouth syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia, are more common in patients over the age of 50 years. Although these conditions may not be routinely managed in general practice, identification of these patients in primary care and appropriate referral will lead to more prompt and effective treatment. Dental practitioners need to be able to identify what is considered to be within the normal physiological limits of the ageing oral tissue and hence what is abnormal and requires further investigation to facilitate appropriate referral. ","820":"The aim of this article was to carry out a prospective audit on a convenience sample of all new patients referred to the toothwear clinic at Cardiff University Dental Hospital to establish the prevalence of undiagnosed periapical pathology. The low prevalence value for undiagnosed periapical pathology in patients with advanced toothwear suggests that, for many patients, toothwear is a slow process which allows the defence mechanisms of the pulp to counteract the effects of wear. It also questions the necessity of taking routine radiographs of teeth with wear into dentine, in the absence of clinical symptoms. This would reduce the total radiation dose delivered to the patient and preserve valuable healthcare resources. ","821":"Water fluoridation schemes have been employed for over 50 years. Water fluoridation has been a source of continuous debate between those who advocate its use as a public health measure and those who oppose it. There have been no new fluoridation schemes in the U.K. for nearly 30 years owing to principally legislative, but also geographic, financial, and political reasons. However, in early 2008, the U.K. Secretary of State for Health promoted the use of water fluoridation schemes for areas in England with the highest rates of decay. This article, the third and final article of three, aims to discuss the arguments surrounding water fluoridation and its continued relevance as a public health measure. This article aims to provide an update for general practitioners for the background and the current status of the water fluoridation debate and to enable them to answer non-clinical questions raised by patients.

The impact of health on the quality of life has received more attention in recent years in both general and oral health. OHRQOL assessments are used in oral health research, surveys and studies evaluating the outcome of oral care. If researchers have no appropriate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measure in their own language, they have two options: to develop a new measure or to modify a measure that has previously been validated in another language which is known as a cross-cultural adaptation process. The aim of this study is to provide guidance on how to adapt an existing measure of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQOL) for a different culture. It is important that dental professionals should have sufficient knowledge about Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in order to make sure that providing the treatment focuses on the patient rather than the disease. In addition, information about a patient's OHRQOL will make decisions on treatment plans which are more likely to influence clinical outcomes.

It is often associated with other dental anomalies such as disturbances in eruption, peg lateral incisors and taurodontism. This case report describes a ten-year-old female with hypodontia and a very unusual conical-shaped mandibular right central incisor, which has not previously been reported in the literature. The case highlights the importance of prompt referral to an interdisciplinary team so joint decisions on management can ensure an optimal outcome with the corresponding improvement in quality of life. Hypodontia and other developmental dental disorders are common and their early recognition and prompt referral is important. ","831":"Dentists may find partial denture design difficult. This is often due to lack of educational experience. Removable partial dentures (RPDs) are one-off prosthodontic solutions that require proper assessment, planning and preparation, combined with effective design. This article revisits the principles of RPD design. One in six people in Britain have some form of RPD. Many of these are unworn. For future well-being of patients, improvement in RPD provision is essential. ","832":"Snoring and sleep apnoea are common. The demand for sleep medicine services has increased exponentially since the recognition of sleep apnoea as a disease in the 1960s. The involvement of dentists in the treatment of sleep apnoea has increased. This article provides an overview of the disorders and options for management. It is important that dentists are aware of the problem of sleep disorders and the potential they have to help in their management.

","835":"Caries is a ubiquitous, natural process occurring in the biofilm. The interaction of the biofilm with the dental tissues may result in a caries lesion, the reflection of the process being the consequence that can be seen. However, lesion formation and progression are not inevitable because the process in the biofilm can be controlled by plaque control, fluoride and a sensible diet. This paper summarizes caries control in note form and it questions how these measures are to be carried out under the current Unit of Dental Activity payment system used within the NHS Dental Services in England and Wales. Caries control is the non-operative management of the ubiquitous, natural process in the biofilm so that lesions do not form, or established lesions are arrested. This paper seeks to present these caries control measures in note form as checklists to aid the dental team.

The wearing of loupes is becoming an accepted norm amongst qualified practitioners and increasingly in the undergraduate population. However, further research is required before evidence-based recommendations can be made about their effectiveness in achieving the three principles. Compared to the medical literature, there is a paucity of studies on the use of loupes in dentistry. This article presents an overview of the well-documented (but under-researched) optical and ergonomic benefits of wearing loupes and highlights special circumstances where the use of loupes would be inadvisable. The article concludes with a review of the small number of studies on magnifying loupes specifically for restorative dentistry. The reader should consider the information in this article prior to the purchase of magnifying loupes. ","840":"The need for long-term retention to prevent post-treatment tooth movement is now widely accepted by orthodontists. This may be achieved with removable retainers or permanent bonded retainers. This article aims to provide simple guidance for the dentist on how to maintain and repair both removable and fixed retainers. The general dental practitioner is more likely to review patients over time and needs to be aware of the need for long-term retention and how to maintain and repair the retainers. ","841":"A dentigerous cyst was treated with enucleation and coronectomy of the associated tooth to minimize the risk of inferior alveolar nerve damage, resulting from direct surgical trauma or indirectly from intra-operative or post-operative jaw fracture. Radiographic monitoring over 33 months confirmed migration of the roots through healed bone and progressive obliteration of the residual pulp canal chamber. These observations are not associated with failure of the technique but are, in fact, commonly observed in successful cases of coronectomy. A brief discussion of the risks versus benefits of this treatment modality is presented with reference to the literature available. In selected cases, coronectomy with cyst enucleation as a one stage procedure may reduce the risk of perioperative nerve damage. ","842":"This article is concerned with implants that are being used for fixed crown and bridgework rather than removable prostheses. The huge increase in the provision of implants over the past two decades is set to continue. Most of the research is related to avoiding failures in implants. This research, in the main, has concentrated on the essential interface between the artificial implant and living bone: osseointegration. The other interface, which is worthy of our full attention, is the one between the implant-supported crown and the antagonist tooth: the occlusion. This article aims to provide the basis for guidelines for good occlusal practice in implantology. It will consider these under two headings: those which could be considered as basic occlusal principles; and those occlusal considerations that are specific to implants. ","843":"Although systemic diseases can occur at any age, they are more common in older patients. Accurate and detailed medical and drug histories are important in dental practice as many conditions and medications can influence oral health and dental care in patients. Not only can these conditions influence patient care in the surgery and oral hygiene at home, but access to dental services may also be adversely affected. The systemic diseases can impact upon oral care or can have oral manifestations. Many of the pharmacological interventions prescribed for chronic conditions can have multiple and diverse adverse effects on the oral environment.

During this time there has been great debate over the mode of action, the optimum method of delivery, and the potential risks associated with its use. This, the first of three papers, will provide a summary of the history of the use of fluoride, the mode of action, benefits and different methods of delivery. It will also discuss the potential risk of dental fluorosis. This article aims to provide a background for general practitioners for the appropriate use of fluorides in dentistry, enable them to understand the wider significance of fluoride in dentistry and to be able to answer non-clinical questions raised by patients. ","845":"This narrative review explores treatment planning options in restorative dentistry. The growth of dental implants, as an accessible and predictable treatment option, gives practitioners a useful tool for managing the missing tooth or teeth with a hopeless prognosis. Traditionally, endodontics and fixed prosthodontics have been used to restore teeth and spaces where the outlook for such treatment appears reasonable. Practitioners may, however, question the predictability and cost effectiveness of such an approach where, at times, it might appear that replacement of a compromised tooth with a dental implant could be a more predictable option. The evidence base for these treatment options is explored and discussed, and suggestions are made for future management strategies. A clear knowledge and understanding of the scientific literature for implants and endodontic treatment is necessary if practitioners are to make an evidence-based approach when treatment planning these modalities for their patients. This is particularly true in cases where there may appear to be a reasonable choice between the two of these.

As older patients retain their natural teeth for longer, the clinical picture consists of normal physiological age changes in combination with pathological and iatrogenic effects. With an ageing population retaining more of its natural teeth for longer, dental professionals should expect to observe oral age changes more frequently. ","857":"Peri-implant diseases are inflammatory conditions that affect the soft and hard supporting tissues around implant fixtures. Peri-implant mucositis usually responds to oral hygiene instructions, scaling and prophylaxis, but peri-implantitis, which involves bone resorption, has less predictable treatment outcomes following non-surgical management. Adjunctive treatment for decontaminating sites may include the use of antimicrobials and resistant cases may sometimes be managed with a surgical approach. As dental implant-retained prostheses become more popular the prevalence of peri-implant complications will also increase. Dental practitioners and care professionals should appreciate their potential roles in the management of these conditions. ","858":"This paper reviews the role of three-dimensional digital imaging in dentistry and its related specialties. Current methods of image capture of the dentition are described, along with the current status of CAD\/CAM-based restorative treatment. The advantages of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in comparison with conventional radiography are outlined in the fields of endodontics, periodontology, oral surgery and orthodontics. The integration of CBCT with state-of-the-art computer planning systems for implantology is described. The application of multi-modal imaging techniques in the management of orthognathic and cleft lip and palate patients is explained and potential future educational benefits are considered.

The inferior alveolar nerve can be damaged during many dental procedures, including administration of local anaesthetic, implant bed preparation and placement, endodontics, third molar surgery and other surgical interventions. Damage to sensory nerves can result in anaesthesia, paraesthesia, pain, or a combination of the three. Pain is common in inferior alveolar nerve injuries, resulting in significant functional problems. The significant disability associated with these nerve injuries may also result in increasing numbers of medico-legal claims. Many of these iatrogenic nerve injuries can be avoided with careful patient assessment and planning. Furthermore, if the injury occurs there are emerging strategies that may facilitate recovery. The emphasis of this review is on how we may prevent these injuries and facilitate resolution in the early post surgical phase. It is imperative that dental practitioners are aware of the significant disability associated with iatrogenic nerve injuries and have an awareness of risk factors relating to inferior alveolar nerve injury.

This technique results in the increase of the clinical crown height of teeth, which can consequently be advantageous in terms of improving retention and resistance, as well as aesthetics.The aim of this article is to demonstrate the uses of the diagnostic wax set-up and the subsequent production of surgical stents and templates to provide the patient with an initial intra-oral diagnostic mock-up for the process of obtaining consent, as well as acting as a useful guide for gingival and osseous recontouring in order to achieve a predictable, healthy and stable dento-gingival complex with pleasing aesthetics. The use of a well made diagnostic wax-up can provide valuable information to the dentist, laboratory, and patient which can be otherwise difficult to communicate. ","887":"Population demography is changing and the proportion of older people in society is increasing globally, particularly in western countries. Furthermore, as many more people survive into older age and retain their natural teeth so their risk of oral disease remains, or increases, bringing challenges such as root caries and periodontal diseases, together with the long-term effects of dental care. Despite their increased need, the uptake of dental care by older people is characteristically poor and unmet need may be high. Barriers to the uptake of care include a lack of perceived need, together with concerns about availability, cost and fear. This paper therefore outlines a series of actions for dental teams to take to minimize barriers and facilitate the uptake of dental care amongst older people. It draws on the findings of research conducted amongst older adults living in the community in a socially deprived inner city area as well as the wider literature. It is important for dental teams to reflect on the difficulties that older people face while trying to access dental care services and, where possible, to address them in order to facilitate dental attendance amongst this section of the population who have much to gain from high quality preventively orientated care. ","888":"Dento-alveolar trauma presents commonly in general dental practice, but may prove difficult to manage for those unfamiliar with it. Timely and well-informed intervention can significantly improve the clinical outcome for the patient. This article aims to inform the clinician on best current practice for the assessment and initial management of dental traumatic injuries, incorporating current international guidelines and practical arrangements for follow-up care. The dental trauma patient often presents to the general dental practitioner and the appropriate emergency management plays a vital role in relieving pain, protecting the dentino-pulpal complex, reducing displaced teeth and improving prognosis.

Dental professionals need to consider the evidence for the effectiveness of different interdental cleaning aids carefully when making recommendations to patients. ","890":"Poor oral health has been associated with a variety of systemic diseases. More recent evidence suggests that the extent and severity of periodontal disease and tooth loss may be associated with an increased risk of malignant disease. An association between poor oral health, smoking, increased alcohol consumption as a risk for oral cancer is well established. Associations between oral health and tooth loss with gastric, lung and pancreatic cancers are explored. Some of the associations need further evaluation before patients are warned about their periodontal health increasing the risk of malignant changes elsewhere in the body. The smoking factor may have a commonality linking oral health with an increased risk for malignant disease. This paper reviews the association between oral health (especially the extent and severity of periodontal disease and tooth loss) as a risk for certain malignancies.

Contemporary restorations (for example, dentine-bonded crowns or resin-retained bridges) often rely on bonding, and advances in dental materials science have resulted in simplified resin systems. Their ease of use and other favourable properties also offer advantages when used for more conventional restorations. Traditional luting cements remain commonplace and their benefits and shortcomings are discussed in terms of handling and clinical performance. Developments and trends in adhesive dentistry are explored. Luting cement selection and application is integral to the optimal performance of indirect restorations. ","896":"Metastatic deposits in the mandible are discussed and a case of leiomyosarcoma arising from a testicular primary is presented. The patient presented with symptoms typical of those that would present to a general dental practitioner. The various stages involved in the diagnosis and management of the condition are discussed. Intra-oral malignant secondary tumours may present to dentists with signs and symptoms similar to those of benign, cystic or infectious processes. Metastatic tumours in the oral cavity are uncommon, most commonly arising in the mandible. Owing to their relative infrequency, these tumours present a challenge in diagnosis and treatment. ","897":"A number of drug interactions that may potentially occur with local anaesthetic preparations are listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) and Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Many are theoretical or are associated with higher doses of local anaesthetic preparations than those used for dental procedures in primary care. Reports of serious interactions between medicines and local anaesthetic preparations occurring in dental practice are exceedingly rare. Practitioners can minimize the risk of interactions by using an aspirating syringe, which reduces the likelihood of the local anaesthetic being administered directly into a blood vessel. Adhering to the dosage recommendations in the product literature will also minimize the risk. This paper will explore the clinical significance of potential interactions between dental local anaesthetic preparations used in primary care and other medicines as listed in the BNF and SmPCs.These are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. A knowledge of potential drug interactions with local anaesthetic preparations is essential for clinicians. ","898":"This paper reviews the principles of the replica denture technique, including some of the techniques previously described. The failing of any previous technique to cater for specific support problems is brought to light and the remainder of the article is devoted to describing how the replica denture technique may be modified to treat patients more appropriately and, hopefully, result in better treatment outcomes. This article offers general dental practitioners a practical guide on how to adapt a useful denture replication technique to suit patients with denture-support problems. ","899":"Light activation units are standard items of equipment in dental practice. It is essential to understand the many factors which affect the polymerization of light-activated resin composite materials and the choice of a light curing unit. In this respect, the development of high-intensity halogen and light-emitting diode (LED) light curing units (LCUs), many with multiple curing modes, has revolutionized light curing techniques. This article reviews visible light activation unit design and development. Factors influencing the effective use of LCUs and polymerization of resin-based composite materials are discussed, as are the steps which should be taken to maintain the efficiency of units in clinical use. Many LCUs produce lower output intensities than stated by the manufacturer. Newer high power LEDs may present as much of a heat problem as high power quartz tungsten halogen lamps (QTHs).The manufacturer's data should be followed to ensure that the emission spectra of the unit is compatible with the photo-initiator in the resin-based composite material.

There is increasing evidence that periodontal intervention can reduce the prevalence of an adverse pregnancy outcome, improve glycaemic control in diabetics, reduce systemic markers of inflammation, lower cholesterol levels and improve vascular endothelial function. The magnitude of the impact of periodontal therapy on these modalities needs further quantification\/study. Despite such reservations, there are indications that any form of periodontal treatment may have outcomes that extend beyond improving life expectancy of the dentition.

Within the HSAN group there are five conditions described. This case report describes the management of a female with congenital insensitivity to pain up to her present age of six years. The aim of treatment was to prevent episodes of oro-facial trauma and self-mutilation injuries. The primary teeth were removed on eruption and further management of the permanent dentition has involved the use of soft occlusal guards together with behaviour management techniques, including an educational component.

Traditional treatment methods for these conditions include veneers and conventional bridges, which are invasive and unnecessarily destructive of remaining tooth tissue. The authors describe how, with the non-destructive use of bleaching, bonding and adhesive bridges, it is possible to achieve a reasonable aesthetic result in a practical way. Amelogenesis imperfecta and missing teeth are common and significant clinical problems. General dental practitioners and specialists should be aware of effective, but minimally destructive, methods of treatment.

The second paper in this series of two aims to cover the clinical and laboratory stages of immediate denture construction. It looks at the clinical techniques that can be used to facilitate the accurate construction of immediate dentures, as well as some of the problems that can compromise their final outcome. This paper covers the clinical and laboratory stages of immediate denture construction. ","911":"The aim of this second article in this series of two is to outline a variety of methods which may be used to compensate for variations in tooth shape and number using a combination of orthodontic and restorative approaches. It will also provide an overview of other areas of patient care which necessitate a multi-disciplinary orthodontic\/restorative approach. The article will highlight the importance of combined planning from the outset and the close relationship between the different specialties, which must be maintained throughout treatment. The methods of compensating for variations in tooth number and shape will often require contributions from both orthodontist and restorative dentist. It is important that both disciplines are involved in the assessment and treatment planning process so that they know what will be expected of them during the patient's care. Treatment planning in isolation may lead to care being delivered which is below the optimum standard which can be achieved. The orthodontist and restorative dentist are likely to liaise with the patient's general dental practitioner so that he\/she can provide the restorative treatment in some cases. Great improvements in aesthetics and function may be obtained using an interdisciplinary approach for patients who have variations in tooth number and shape. ","912":"","913":"","914":"","915":"","916":"Stress generation at tissue\/resin composite interfaces is one of the important reasons for failure of resin-based composite (RBC) restorations owing to the inherent property of polymerization shrinkage. Unrelieved stresses can weaken the bond between the tooth structure and the restoration, eventually producing a gap at the restoration margins. This can lead to postoperative sensitivity, secondary caries, fracture of the restorations, marginal deterioration and discoloration. As polymerization shrinkage cannot be eliminated completely, various techniques and protocols have been suggested in the manipulation of, and restorative procedures for, RBCs to minimize the shrinkage and associated stresses. Introduction of various newer monomer systems (siloranes) may also overcome this problem of shrinkage stress. This review emphasizes the various material science advances and techniques advocated that are currently available or under trial\/testing phase to deal with polymerization shrinkage in a clinical environment. Minimizing the shrinkage stresses in RBC restorations may lead to improvement in the success rate and survival of restorations. Thus, it is important for dental practitioners to be aware of various techniques and materials available to reduce these shrinkage stresses and be updated with the current knowledge available to deal with this issue. ","917":"Oral lesions commonly diagnosed in newborns and infants include Epstein's pearls, Bohn's nodules, dental lamina cysts and congenital epulis. Nevertheless, intriguing cases which have rarely been reported in the literature are encountered by clinicians. This paper reports a case of an unusual white lesion in a 10-month-old child which resolved spontaneously. However, histological examination proved it to be a foreign body. Infants tend to explore things with their mouths; hence they put anything they can hold into it to determine the size and texture. This case serves to illustrate that the unexpected can occur and that, in children, the differential diagnosis should include a foreign body. ","918":"Impacted third molars are a common reason for referral to the hospital dental service. Third molar impaction can be complicated by infection. We present two cases of osteomyelitis of the mandible developing secondary to pericoronitis of partially erupted lower third molars. One of the cases reported was recently diagnosed and treated while the other was diagnosed and treated 20 years ago. The most commonly reported pathology associated with impacted lower third molars is pericoronitis. Osteomyelitis of the mandible secondary to pericoronitis is rare. It is helpful if dental practitioners are able to distinguish between the cases of pericoronitis that need emergency referral to hospital and the cases that can be managed in practice and referred to an outpatient clinic. ","919":"Cleaning and shaping a root canal are two inseparable concepts of endodontics. Shaping facilitates the penetration of disinfecting solutions into the deepest regions of the root canal system, including those that cannot be reached by instruments. The Hero Shaper is a leading system in the European market, and the concept of the 'adapted Pitch' is of particular interest. Modifying the pitch of this instrument has made it possible to limit the screwing effect of the file in the canal considerably and to improve flexibility. In this paper, the guidelines for use of these instruments are described. Manufacturer's recommendations are presented and modified by the use of Hero Apical to achieve the fundamental principles of endodontics published by Herbert Schilder more than 30 years ago. The Hero Shaper system and the concept of 'adapted Pitch' may enhance the shaping of root canals prior to root filling.

Some of these changes, in particular the change in schedule of midazolam from Schedule 4 to Schedule 3 and the introduction of private controlled drug prescriptions, which are now mandatory for all private prescribers, have implications for dentists. This paper aims to outline the current regulations governing controlled drugs that are relevant to dentists and covers how to obtain, prescribe, store and dispose of them. Controlled drugs are the most highly regulated medicines and recent changes in the regulations governing them have implications for dentists in both private and NHS practice.

In this two-part series, the various principles for successfully providing patients with immediate dentures will be discussed. This first paper examines the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the treatment planning involved in providing immediate dentures. Although the provision of immediate dentures is common in dental practice, it is a treatment option which is not without problems. This article will show how careful planning, prior to treatment starting, can prevent unforeseen complications occurring. ","922":"The first article in this series of two aims to outline the assessment of patients for whom a combined orthodontic-restorative approach would be beneficial. In particular, it will concentrate on the assessment of patients who have hypodontia and tooth size discrepancies. The importance of the aesthetic assessment for these cases will be highlighted. Variations in tooth number and tooth size discrepancy often require a combined treatment planning approach from the orthodontist and restorative dentist. The referring general dental practitioner has a key role in recognizing that this approach may be required and highlighting this in the initial patient referral. It is likely in the more straightforward cases that the GDP will be providing the restorative treatment and so an increased understanding of these cases would be beneficial. In the second paper, treatment options will be presented. For patients who require a combined orthodontic\/restorative approach, it is important that orthodontic and restorative disciplines liaise closely in the assessment and treatment planning process so that optimal care may be planned.

The potential role of the dental team in assisting this process is now well recognized, but the degree to which this occurs in practice is uncertain. The UK National Health Service has devoted substantial resources to the development of stop-smoking services. This article describes how the contribution of dentists and dental care professionals fits with wider public health tobacco cessation and control measures. This article presents an update on the impact of tobacco use on health and outlines current evidence on treating tobacco use and dependence. It also highlights the role of the dental team in helping patients to stop smoking, in light of wider developments in the provision of stop-smoking services.

However, over 100,000 people die each year in the UK as a result of the effects of smoking; the most common form of tobacco use.Tobacco cessation is, moreover, a global issue with wide variation in tobacco usage, multiple determinants and numerous approaches to prevention. This article provides an overview of the trends in tobacco usage and control in the UK compared with other nations, to bring the process into context for primary dental practitioners. Guidance is also provided on appropriate smoking interventions in dental practice that support national health targets and population health. Within dentistry, clear links exist between tobacco and health (both general and oral). Oral health care professionals routinely come into contact with members of the public and can contribute to tobacco control programmes through a range of public health interventions.

This paper explores some of the consequences of tooth loss that may cause difficulties in tooth replacement, particularly if replacement is delayed for some time. An awareness of potential difficulties, particularly with posterior tooth replacement, will allow clinicians to make treatment decisions in the light of current evidence. ","931":"Patients diagnosed or being treated for malignant disease can neglect their dental care and be reluctant to undertake dental treatment. This article considers the dental problems that may arise in such patients and how they can be managed. Chemotherapy and its sequelae are the main challenges to the delivery of routine dental care. For such patients, it is important to liaise with their oncologists to obtain an up-to-date haematological profile and time frame for any future treatments. For all such patients, dental care may be neglected, but it is important that dental and oral health is maintained. This article reviews the possible impact that malignant disease and its treatment can have on the delivery of dental care. Chemotherapy-induced bone marrow depression is likely to have the most profound effect on routine dental treatment. ","932":"This article explores the available strategies for protection against erosive toothwear. As part of a preventive regime, the importance of dietary counselling is discussed. Risk factors that render patients susceptible to erosive toothwear need to be identified in early life, if possible, as it may improve their treatment outcome through the instigation of preventive measures. Practical advice and the importance of education regarding timing of toothbrushing following an acid challenge should be given to patients. Availability of fewer erosive beverages may prove acceptable alternatives for some patients, especially where poor compliance is an issue. Some patients may benefit from intra-oral appliances to improve and maintain delivery of fluoride. The importance of fluoride use and of products such as Pronamel\/Tooth Mousse aimed at preventing erosive tooth surface loss are discussed. Erosive toothwear is becoming an increasing problem for patients. Practical preventive measures that can be employed to reduce the amount of erosive toothwear are desirable.

The purpose of this paper is to present a case and review the literature with regard to the radiographic appearance. Although the radiographic appearance is variable, there are some features that are common to most cases, the most important feature being that of an ill-defined radiolucent lesion with scattered radio-opacities. Although these features are seen in other malignant diseases, these features should alert the clinician to the possibility of a chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas of the jaw are rare but important malignant lesions that require prompt diagnosis and treatment for improved outcomes.

Understanding the processes involved in behaviour change and how change may be sustained is essential to support patients to change their behaviour successfully. We review the concept of adherence, the oral health behaviours of interest to the dental team and how change around these behaviours is currently managed. Theoretical models of behaviour change are reviewed and their possible implications for every day practice described. This paper will help the dental team to understand the processes involved in behaviour change and support their patients to adopt and sustain positive oral health behaviours. ","942":"Dental Panoramic Tomography (DPT) is a widely used and valuable examination in dentistry. One area prone to artefacts and therefore misinterpretation is the anterior region of the mandible. This case study discusses a periapical radiolucency related to lower anterior teeth that is discovered to be a radiographic artefact. Possible causes of the artefact include a pronounced depression in the mental region of the mandible or superimposition of intervertebral spaces. Additional limitations of the DPT image include superimposition of radio-opaque structures, reduced image detail compared to intra-oral views and uneven magnification. These problems often make the DPT inappropriate for imaging the anterior mandible. Panoramic radiography is often unsuitable for radiographic examination of the anterior mandible.

In this article we provide an overview of the impact of the treatments of malignant diseases on the oral structures. Whilst some of the complications, such as oral mucositis and oral infection, are of short duration and respond once chemotherapy has been completed, other treatments have a prolonged effect. Of particular concern is the effect of bisphosphonates on bone turnover and the risk of osteonecrosis on the jaw and hormones affecting the periodontal tissues. These unwanted effects all impact upon the quality of life of many patients diagnosed with malignant disease.

This report describes how an impacted UR5, which was easily palpable and predicted to erupt spontaneously, caused extensive root resorption in the adjacent UR6. This case highlights the importance of a thorough assessment of the position of all impacted premolars, irrespective of whether they can be palpated or not. This is especially important when planning orthodontic extractions, where the use of up-to-date appropriate radiographs is essential. ","954":"Current tooth lightening systems use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide which releases hydrogen peroxide as the bleaching agent. In vitro and in vivo studies, mostly comparing different bleaching systems, have demonstrated the efficacy of vital and non-vital tooth bleaching. Bleaching treatments are affected by a number of factors including the actual cause of tooth discoloration. All in-surgery bleaching agents are chemically activated and, whilst better results are possible with lights, these are not essential. Shade change can be evaluated subjectively and may be observed after only a few nights with Night Guard Vital Bleaching (NGVB). Objective methods of shade evaluation are used in most randomized controlled trials. There are a number of methods used to bleach teeth but NGVB using 10% carbamide peroxide in trays produces the optimal result with the least side-effects. The'inside\/outside' bleaching technique using 10% carbamide peroxide is the most effective and safest method of bleaching non-vital teeth. Although more than 90% success has been reported, regression of the colour change is a common problem in vital and non-vital tooth bleaching and retreatment is necessary in many cases, usually after 1-3 years. The overwhelming evidence indicates that tooth bleaching is effective if supervised by a dentist. The clinician should be able to inform patients that both vital and non-vital tray bleaching using 10% carbamide peroxide can produce excellent results when supervised. However, shade regression is likely in 1-3 years.

Historically, this cyst has been known by several different names within the literature. It is usually asymptomatic but can present with buccal swelling, pain, paraesthesia and be associated with non-vital teeth. Radiographically, it has characteristic features that distinguish it from other lesions. The following is an overview of the literature, the experience of two centres over an eight-year period, and a discussion of the dental implications. Clinicians should be aware of this lesion and that unexplained radiolucent lesions of the jaws require referral.

The oceans of journals and research papers can be difficult to navigate. Gauging the quality of such publications and, more importantly, their clinical relevance may be challenging.This narrative review explores the nature and relevance of dental research to clinical dentistry and provides simple guidelines for critical appraisal of such research. In this respect, all dental clinical practice should be underpinned, where possible, with evidence that treatments carried out are contemporary and effective. A working knowledge of dental research and its relevance to clinical practice should allow practitioners to select best evidence to inform their clinical practice. ","965":"The Medicines Act 1968 governs who can supply medicines in the U.K. The Act allows dentists to issue any medicine directly to a patient. However, this only applies if patients are receiving private treatment. The current NHS terms of service do not allow dentists to supply any medicines, other than those for immediate use before the issue of a prescription, directly to a patient receiving NHS treatment. A prescription must be supplied for ongoing treatment. If a dentist issues medicines directly to a patient, they must be labelled as a dispensed medicine as directed by the Medicines Act 1968 and the Medicines and for Human Use Regulations (1994). Medicines are highly regulated and compliance with the law requires an understanding of the different laws governing medicines in relation to dentists.

In such cases, the placement of a long-term provisional restoration may be indicated.This paper describes the use of a recently-introduced, novel, resin-composite crown in such situations. A crown which is able to be used as a long-term provisional may be a useful clinical technique for situations where the prognosis of a tooth is uncertain, and\/or when the personal circumstances of the patient preclude a conventional indirect restoration.

The number of victims identified with the help of forensic odontology in various mass disasters in the world has been analysed and discussed. The result depicts the necessity of keeping proper dental records at institutional and individual level. Thus the use of forensic odontology in a series of mass disasters has been explored. The most common aspect of forensic odontology that a general practitioner is likely to encounter is the supply of ante-mortem records to aid in human identification. The need for proper dental record-keeping by general dental practitioners is highlighted by discussing the role of forensic odontology in some of the world's major mass disasters.

They can also be used as delivery vehicles for topical medicaments. This article describes their indications, contra-indications and construction. Dentists in primary and secondary care should be aware of the use and fabrication techniques of gingival veneers. ","981":"Bisphosphonates are increasingly being used in a number of bone conditions, including osteoporosis and metastatic cancer. As a consequence, the reported cases of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BONJ) have increased. BONJ remains rare in patients being treated for osteoporosis, but is commoner in cancer patients where the bisphosphonate doses are much higher and mode of delivery is intravenous. Recently, much more is known about classification and mode of action of the bisphosphonates. The potency of the various nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is dependent on a number of factors including bone binding, zeta potential and inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. There is current debate on why BONJ affects the jaw, particularly in relation to whether the jaw has high bone turnover or not. More is being learnt about the micro-organisms involved in the pathogenesis of BONJ and there is increasing evidence on the role of surgical treatment of this disabling condition. Dentists should be aware of the association of bisphosphonates and BONJ. This paper provides recent knowledge on bisphosphonate action, pathogenesis of BONJ and its treatment.

This paper summarizes the problems associated with polymerization contraction and examines methods used to overcome this, in particular, by the use of materials which have reduced percentage contraction when compared with traditional materials. Use of a material with reduced polymerization contraction should lead to simpler restoration placement. ","984":"In recent years, it has become clear that the neural mechanisms controlling chewing and swallowing emanate from centres in the brainstem. However, these activities may be modulated by conscious processes and by feedback from peripheral nerves.This review relates this knowledge to clinical dentistry and, in particular, to the possible relationship between craniomandibular dysfunctions and impaired control of the masticatory system. Dentists should understand the neuromuscular control of the masticatory apparatus as this can be relevant to the general health of patients as well as to craniomandibular disorders involving the jaw muscles and joints.

Here we report a case in which a 12-year-old female presented with an inverted impacted manibular premolar associated with a dentigerous cyst. The likely aetiology and management of this condition is discussed. This case highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of the rarer causes of apparent absence of teeth from the arch and the importance of taking radiographs prior to treatment planning. ","990":"This paper presents a case study for replacing a single maxillary central incisor with a single implant, in conjunction with grafting lost hard and soft tissue. Using staged protocols, the maturity and stability of the implant was ensured prior to finalizing the case. In this respect, it was originally planned that a minimum healing period of nine months would be observed, but in fact the patient did not return for one year. Taking time to stage phases of the case and observe any changes provides an opportunity to evaluate each phase before the next step is carried forward. By staging the challenges faced in this case, the author was able to progress to each subsequent step with added assurance. By the time the final restorations were fitted, the graft and tissues were stable. The time involved not only placed biology on the clinician's side, but also helped the patient to spread the cost. In modern aesthetic dentistry harmonious results can be relatively quickly achieved when the prerequisites for aesthetic success have already been met but, as this case demonstrates, human biology often requires more time and patience for augmented hard and soft tissues to heal and mature. ","991":"Courses that are part of a longer-term planned programme of continuing education are more likely to impact on the practice of dentists than short course interventions.This study assessed the impact of a part-time, five-year Master of Science (MSc) programme at the School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham, designed specifically for general dental practitioners. Perceptions were sought from all 22 dentists registered on the MSc at the time of the study. The study provides evidence that a well-targeted masters programme for primary care dentists can make a difference to participants' knowledge and confidence and, importantly, generate change in practice. Sustained continuing education programmes, such as the University of Birmingham Masters Degree targeting primary care dentists, can provide valued contact with other dentists, and enhance practitioners' clinical knowledge. ","992":"Calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumour (CEOT), also known as Pindborg tumour, is a rare, benign odontogenic neoplasm. A case of an intra-osseous CEOT in the maxilla is presented in which unilateral nasal obstruction and progressive difficulty in breathing were the first clinical symptoms. Dental practitioners might be the first clinicians to come across such tumours, during investigation of missing or non-erupted maxillary teeth, ie canines, and they should be alerted by any unilateral nasal obstruction symptoms. Diagnostic features and treatment options of the tumour are discussed in relation to its histological typing. This manuscript highlights the importance of accurate clinical and radiographic investigation for the dental practitioner when assessing missing maxillary teeth. ","993":"A cracked tooth is a common presentation in general dental practice. It may be difficult to diagnose, owing to the variations in the clinical presentation.The symptoms that result from a cracked tooth have given rise to the term Cracked Tooth Syndrome (CTS).This article reviews and discusses the clinical signs, symptoms and the management of CTS. An early diagnosis is important to relieve pain, restore function and improve the prognosis for the tooth. The prognosis can be unpredictable and this needs to be understood by patients before embarking on definitive treatment. Cracked tooth syndrome is a common occurrence in general dental practice and may be difficult to diagnose, especially as to the extent and direction of the crack. Awareness of cracked tooth syndrome is therefore important in providing the correct treatment and patient management. ","994":"The process of mastication involves movements of the tongue, lips and cheeks as well as the more obvious actions of the teeth and jaws. In recent years there have been significant advances in our knowledge of the relationships between these movements in human beings and of how the processes of mastication are related to the associated events of swallowing. In this, the first of two papers, we review the role of mastication in food processing and nutrition and the effect of tooth loss on masticatory performance.The paper also reviews new information on masticatory and swallowing functions in human beings eating naturally. The review relates this knowledge to clinical dentistry, notably to the relevance of a good dentition to the digestive process and practical considerations in the replacement of missing teeth. Dentists should understand the process of mastication because an adequate dentition can facilitate the general health and well-being of their patients.This understanding can also inform the clinical management of patients with a depleted dentition or otherwise impaired masticatory system.

Two new clinical signs are demonstrated. TMJ dislocation is of relevance to all dental professionals because it can occur in the dental chair and because dental professionals are often called upon to manage this condition. ","1000":"There has been an increase in the provision of implant-supported prostheses in patients unable to tolerate conventional dentures. Unfortunately, many patients are unable to benefit from this treatment option because of anatomical, medical or financial constraints. Magnet-retained overdentures represent a potential treatment option in many of these cases. This article describes the development, advantages, complications and clinical procedures associated with the provision of tooth-supported, magnet-retained overdentures. Conventional overdenture retention can be enhanced by the use of dental magnets. Clinical procedures are straightforward and magnets offer a number of advantages over other forms of precision attachment. ","1001":"Child sexual abuse (CSA) occurs in all communities, ethnic backgrounds, religions, cultures, social and economic classes, and is experienced by both males and females. The physical and psychological effects of CSA have significant effects on adult health outcomes. Parallels have been drawn between the physical and emotional environment of dental treatment and features of the CSA experience. Consequently, adult survivors of CSA can find it difficult to tolerate dental treatment, and may repeatedly cancel dental appointments or avoid dental treatment altogether. Awareness of patient characteristics in the dental setting that indicate past CSA include discomfort with body positioning, dislike of being touched, sense of loss of control, fear of judgement and sensitivity to perceived criticism, sensitivity to particular smells and sensitivity to having instruments in the mouth. Some aspects of the dental environment and dental treatment can act as 'triggers' that can take survivors of CSA back to the emotions associated with that event. An understanding of the fears and anxieties this can cause in the dental setting allows the dental team to help the individual cope with the dental experience, improving it for both the patient and the provider. The development of general strategies that foster establishing a positive rapport, sharing control and treating the individual as a partner in the healthcare relationship can cultivate a positive dental experience that can have far reaching effects. The prevalence of child sexual abuse (CSA) is surprisingly high, so adults who have experienced CSA can find it difficult to tolerate dental treatment, and may repeatedly cancel dental appointments or avoid dental treatment altogether.

This provides an unsatisfactory situation for restoring the remaining root as restorations will impinge on the biological width. Provided a root is long enough to support a post crown, then orthodontic extrusion to provide sufficient supra-gingival tooth tissue is a useful treatment option to consider. A review of the literature on orthodontic extrusion is considered in conjunction with a case report of the management of a young male who fractured a canine and lateral incisor whilst playing cricket. Trauma to upper anterior teeth is frequently seen in practice. One treatment option in the management of sub-crestal cervical root fractures is orthodontic extrusion, rather than removal of the tooth.

A 20-year follow-up is reported of a patient who was diagnosed with Paget's disease following the investigation of her initial oral complaint. Following surgical extraction of two teeth in her maxilla, the sockets have failed to heal, despite numerous attempted interventions. This case highlights both the cranio-maxillofacial and oral manifestations of Paget's disease of bone, its effects on surgical exodontia and the possible effects of bisphosphonate therapy. Paget's disease of bone does not manifest in the head and neck commonly but, when it does, there are significant implications for the dentist. Prevention and conservation of the patient's remaining teeth are paramount as the complications of extraction are significant.

Its relative simplicity, minimal invasiveness, predictability, efficacy and affordability make it an attractive treatment option. The commonly used methods for anchoring overdentures to implants utilize bars, studs and magnets. There is little evidence, however, to suggest that any one method is significantly superior to another. This paper reviews treatment options available to restore the edentulous mandible and also reports on a patient treated using the Locator system, which is a relatively new type of stud attachment. This case report describes a chairside technique using the Locator system to retain a complete lower denture. The Locator system provides the dental practitioner with a useful attachment option for patients requiring an implant-retained overdenture. ","1027":"Establishing the working length is an important step in endodontic treatment as inaccurate length determination may lead to failure. There is an ongoing debate regarding the extent of the apical limit of root canal preparation. This controversy is based upon different clinical opinions concerning the distance between the end point of the root canal preparation and the periodontal tissues. In this paper, we review the different schools of thought for working length determination, and how apex locators work and how they must be used for optimal accuracy. The reliability of these devices has been proven; the price is moderate and apex locators are now part of the basic armamentarium in the achievement of quality and predictable endodontic treatment. The technique of determining the working length from a single radiograph remains empirical, and apex locators should be considered an essential aid in establishing working length.

The preservation and regeneration of the periodontal ligament is the key to success of this treatment. A case involving the transplantation of a premolar tooth into the central incisor location in a child is presented to show the different stages of the process.

Mucogingival therapy may be required to prevent further recession, correct aesthetic problems, aid plaque control and reduce dentine hypersensitivity. There are several different mucogingival treatment approaches which usually involve the manipulation of the patient's tissues to augment the gingivae and cover the exposed root. This article reviews the management procedures that are indicated for the treatment of gingival recession. To make the dental practitioner aware of the different surgical modalities available for the treatment of gingival recession and improve his\/her ability to identify patients who might benefit from them. ","1080":"Toothwear is increasing in prevalence. Traditional treatment methods for moderate or advanced toothwear, such as indirect restorations and crown lengthening surgery, are invasive and destructive of remaining tissues. The 'Dahl technique' has been used to obtain space for anterior restorations and has been modified such that direct composite restorations are placed at increased occlusal vertical dimension. These restorations have proved durable and aesthetic, protect tooth structure and posterior occlusal contact is predictably re-established. The authors describe and compare two techniques using composite resin to treat localized anterior toothwear in a general practice setting. Toothwear is a significant clinical problem and general dental practitioners and specialists alike must be familiar with the available conservative treatment options. ","1081":"For some time dentists have successfully promoted the benefits of sugar-free medications. There are now over 180 sugar-free medicines manufactured and prescribed. Methadone, used in the rehabilitation of drug-users, is available as a sugar-free preparation; however, the sugar-based version is most often used. This article examines the content of methadone, explains some of the reasons for prescribing patterns and explores how a multi-disciplinary approach can be used to help methadone users with their rehabilitation and minimize risks to oral health. The wider public health and health policy implications of methadone use are discussed and the available literature reviewed. Dentists are most likely to encounter patients on methadone as a dental emergency and they need to be aware that methadone users are at greater risk of decay and erosion from methadone sugar syrup, as well as perhaps their lifestyle. For dental practitioners, addressing the oral health needs of methadone users can contribute to their general well-being. ","1082":"A 17-year-old male was referred to the maxillofacial department regarding a fractured mandible. Airway compromise was suspected as a result of neck swelling, stridor, haemoptysis and surgical emphysema. Severe laryngeal injuries were diagnosed, including a fractured hyoid. His treatment and outcomes are summarized, with discussion of aetiology, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of laryngeal injuries, including urgent airway management, if necessary. The risks and complications of delayed diagnosis and treatment are discussed, particularly if symptoms are delayed or the injury is masked by facial fractures. A high index of suspicion and thorough examination are emphasized in all head and neck trauma patients. Any dental professional may be the first to see a trauma victim. It is important to be aware of the risk of life-threatening laryngeal injuries which may be delayed in diagnosis, owing to later development of symptoms and signs or to more obvious injuries. ","1083":"Improvements in ultrasound (US) resolution have led to the application of this non-ionizing imaging modality in the diagnosis of soft tissue disorders affecting the head and neck region. Although operator experience is paramount in image interpretation, US has the advantage of being inexpensive, safe and widely available. Ultrasound is the first line imaging modality for suspected salivary gland tumours and is useful in evaluating superficial neck swellings, such as lymph node disease, soft tissue cysts and vascular malformations. Ultrasound also improves the success rate when used for guidance during fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). This paper aims to provide the general practitioner with an overview of the basic principles of image formation, the advantages and disadvantages of US, and an outline of its indications for conditions that might present to the dental practitioner. ","1084":"Resin-retained bridges (RRBs) have become an accepted part of the restorative dentist's armamentarium. Despite disadvantages, such as more frequent rates of debonding than conventionally-luted bridges, RRBs hold advantages such as their minimally invasive preparation and reduced cost, along with good patient acceptance. RRBs have traditionally been formed of a metal framework with porcelain coverage: most recently, fibre-reinforced RRBs (FRRRBs) have become available, using fibres to reinforce a laboratory composite material. They may also be formed intra-orally. This paper discusses the current status of indirectly-placed FRRRBs, their principal advantages being their improved aesthetics because they are tooth-coloured, and a principal disadvantage being a lack of long-term clinical research. In cases where the visibility of metal may compromise the appearance of a metal-based RRB, a fibre-reinforced, resin-retained bridge may provide a clinical solution.

This lesion was found to be an extensive intra-bony lesion with alveolar expansion and was initially associated with infection and mobile teeth. Treatment for this ranges from curettage to block excision. There is a significant recurrence rate for these lesions and long-term follow-up is advised. This case highlights that a high index of suspicion is needed for unusual pathology. ","1093":"Macrodontia is a relatively rare but cosmetically challenging dental anomaly with different aetiologies. Where surgical interventions are inappropriate, minimal restorative interventions may be indicated. A case is described of a teenager with macrodontic central incisors who was treated with indirect composite 'double veneers'. The aesthetic outcome was excellent without unnecessary loss of teeth. Knowledge of the use of indirect composite veneers provides another treatment option for aesthetic problems in the management of tooth anomalies, including macrodontia. ","1094":"Contemporary surgical techniques emphasize gentle tissue handling with a minimum of trauma. This in turn provides a predictable operative environment and promotes healing. A modern surgical armamentarium may be very different from that encountered a decade ago. This is clear from the greater availability of dental microsurgical instruments. Whilst the complexity of microsurgery may not be routinely necessary in general dental practice, many of the principles and equipment used may make standard surgical management easier and more predictable. A greater understanding of the evidence base behind periodontal surgery will allow us to improve flap design, closure and operative management. Also, the use of microsurgical techniques and equipment will improve the quality and outcomes of periodontal surgery in practice. ","1095":"Syphilis is now regarded by many as being of historical interest only in the aetiology of oral ulceration. Its manifestations are still often classified as the classical chancre, snail track ulcers and gumma. Recent literature suggests, however, that there has been a re-emergence of syphilitic ulcers and that these need not fall into the traditional categories. Atypical ulceration with no other apparent cause should prompt investigations for possible underlying infective causes, such as syphilis, because of the increased incidence of the disease. It is important that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion for syphilis when patients present with atypical oral lesions and syphilis serology should be part of the routine tests in this situation.

","1097":"Increasing numbers of older adults are retaining teeth into old age. Many of these patients refuse to wear removable partial dentures, and have a high prevalence of dental disease and heavily restored teeth. The shortened dental arch (SDA) concept is a potentially cost-effective way of managing older, partially dentate adults. However, case selection is critical and long term preservation of a functional dentition may not be possible in certain patients. This paper highlights the critical treatment planning issues and outlines treatment strategies aimed at avoiding occlusal instability in patients with shortened dental arches. Appropriate application of the shortened dental arch concept will provide satisfactory oral function in the long term for partially dentate adults. ","1098":"Traumatic injury to permanent central incisors is a common occurrence in childhood and adolescence. It is of paramount importance that expedient and appropriate care is provided to ensure an optimum short- and long-term outcome for injured teeth and, importantly, the patients themselves. Treatment planning should thus adopt a holistic approach, taking into account a number of patient- and dental-related factors. Multidisciplinary care, involving paediatric dentistry, orthodontics or oral and maxillofacial surgery may be indicated. Decisions should also be informed by a sound understanding of the exact nature and prognosis of the presenting dental injury. Poor primary management of dental trauma may have lifelong consequences for the young patient.

Fulminating infection in the head and neck may present as a rapidly progressive, potentially fatal condition characterized by extensive necrosis of the subcutaneous tissues. One form of such infection is necrotizing fasciitis. Although first described in 1793 by Pouteau, the term necrotizing fasciitis was first coined in 1952 by Wilson who noted that facial necrosis was the most consistent feature of this disease. When necrotizing fasciitis occurs in the head and neck region it is usually odontogenic in origin. This paper reviews the cases of four patients presenting with atypical fulminating dental infection who presented to the oral and maxillofacial department at Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital, London, resulting in cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. Aggressive management is critical for patient survival and time wasted is tissue lost. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of dental infections, especially in patients with altered immune status, is critical. There should be a high index of suspicion in patients with dental infections not responding to treatment and maxillary dental infections with sinus symptoms. ","1106":"Medical educators have identified the need for clinicians to become lifelong learners; a large part of the drive for this continuum of education is derived from the research that demonstrates that knowledge and\/or competence deteriorates with time following graduation and that this is caused by a failure to acquire new knowledge rather than a propensity to forget previously learned material. Clinicians therefore need to be trained to identify the relevant published literature and then to apply Critical Appraisal techniques to the articles acknowledged as being seminal to their professional development. Historically, Critical Appraisal has been inconsistently taught to both undergraduates and postgraduates. This short paper aims to give undergraduate students and practitioners a series of templates to use in order to evaluate scientific literature; it may be of use both within the wider aspect of dental practice and as a guide to answer questions within the context of educational assessment. ","1107":"Periodontal surgery comprises surgical intervention of the supporting tissues of the teeth. This ranges in complexity from simple exodontia to technically demanding periodontal plastic surgery and includes the management of periodontal diseases, implant placement and preparatory treatment for fixed and removable prostheses. Modern surgical management reflects both a move towards evidence-based practice and the introduction of improved techniques and armamentarium. General principles of surgical management hold true regardless of what procedure is being carried out. These principles form a sound basis for any practitioner contemplating surgical interventions for their patients. A sound understanding of first principles will simplify periodontal surgical management. Careful surgical preparation will render surgical procedures more predictable and reduce post-operative discomfort. ","1108":"Recent research from the North of England has focused attention on the effectiveness of routine conservation of carious deciduous teeth. This has led to a debate within the profession stimulated by the belief that falling levels of restorative care equate to a failure of clinical care. The results from two major clinical studies suggest that the majority of carious deciduous teeth exfoliate without the child attending his\/her dentist with pain and infection if left unrestored. In addition, it would appear that the conventional restoration of such teeth by general dental practitioners does not change the outcome. However, a study from Scotland suggests that untreated carious deciduous teeth increases the risk of sepsis, especially when many carious teeth are present. Further research is needed to help inform clinical decisions. This article addresses the central issue of the dental care of young children.

The popularity of camera mobile phones and compact cameras have been major factors in the resurgence in the popularity of general photography. So, how has this revival and technological advancement affected dental photography? Understanding the equipment, and how to use it successfully, is still important, but many of the advancements have made life very much easier for the dental practitioner wanting to embrace this visual medium. This article will keep practitioners updated on the equipment available, and make the choice of equipment easier.

To achieve the appearance of a natural tooth, the pontic tooth must have the correct emergence profile. This paper describes the use of electrosurgery for tissue removal and ridge recontouring. The soft tissues overlying the edentulous ridge can be sculpted prior to resin-bonded bridge placement to improve the emergence profile of the pontic and the bridge's cleansability. Hyperplastic palatal gingival tissues can be excised to maximize bridge retainer coverage over the cingulum area. Electrosurgery may be of value in improving the appearance and retention of a resin-retained bridge.

They are commonly drunk by 18-25 year-olds owing to their fruity flavours, but increasingly in the UK they are consumed by underage teenagers. A popular lemon-based vodka alcopop is presented as a possible causative factor of dental erosion in a 19-year-old female, who started drinking it regularly at the age of 15 for four years. She was subsequently treated preventively and conservatively in a National Health Service (NHS) dental practice, in North Wales, using freehand compomer and minimally prepared porcelain veneers. Frequent consumption of excessive amounts of extrinsic acids causes significant dental erosion. Alcopops, owing to their high citrus fruit contents and acidic pH, are known to cause erosion.

However, the question of the relevance of occlusion in both the aetiology and management of TMD has been somewhat clarified in recent years and this article attempts to summarize current thinking on this issue and also to provide practical guidance on the construction of stabilization splints. Various other forms of treatment are discussed and evidence is presented to help in judging their relevance. Bruxism is relatively common in patients with TMD and guidance relating to the management of this problem is also presented. Temporomandibular disorders are common, so knowledge of their treatment is of relevance to the primary care practitioner.

Studies have confirmed that considerable but varying amounts of new connective tissue attachment may form on teeth treated with these techniques. At present, careful case selection and meticulous surgical technique can regenerate the periodontium, although studies from the literature demonstrate a large variation in success rates. In the future, we can expect further developments from the field of tissue engineering to produce more predictable techniques that could allow us to regenerate lost periodontal tissues even more effectively.

","1132":"Many edentulous people can experience difficulty in carrying out functional activities when wearing complete dentures. This may be due to a number of factors, one of which is the ability to control the dentures effectively during mastication and speech. For this reason, it is critical when constructing complete dentures to incorporate features in their design which will aid stability in function. Usually, the challenges are greater in constructing a prosthesis to replace the missing mandibular teeth. It is recognized that the use of osseointegrated implants offers considerable advantages for people who have to wear complete dentures, and the contribution of implantology to the provision of stable complete dentures will be explored. However, many people will not have the opportunity to experience the benefits of this approach. Furthermore, for people who need to wear conventional dentures, age and other factors may impact on their ability to control the prostheses effectively during oral function. In this paper, the ways in which design features may impact on the stability of complete dentures will be discussed. This paper considers how complete dentures can be designed and constructed so that they are stable in oral function, and can be worn comfortably without causing damage to the intra-oral tissues.

This may range from slight feelings of unease during routine procedures, such as an injection or cavity preparation, to feelings of extreme anxiety long before treatment is happening. There is general agreement that anxiety constitutes a major problem for the dentist, and a barrier to optimal care for the patient, as one of the most significant consequences is avoidance of dental treatment. Common triggers include local anaesthetic injection and the dental drill. This paper uses the term anxiety to encompass both fear and anxiety and reviews current strategies for managing anxious people in the dental setting, with a focus on non-invasive operative techniques. Being able to recognize fear and anxiety in dental patients is an important part of overall patient management. Knowledge of various behaviour management techniques, and the use of less-invasive operative techniques, enable the clinician to treat a large proportion of anxious people and help them to cope with dental treatment in the primary care setting. Those who remain anxious and unable to cope in the dental setting may require pharmacological techniques, such as conscious sedation, to enable them to receive dental treatment. These techniques are not always readily available, require appropriate training, are more time consuming and costly. In extreme cases, general anaesthesia may be a last resort option.

This case report describes an incidental finding of spontaneous regression of bilateral dentigerous cysts associated with lower impacted third molars in a 30-year-old, fully dentate female. Together with three other similar reports, a few possible explanations are postulated and the understanding of natural history of dentigerous cysts is questioned. The discovery of a dentigerous cyst in a patient always warrants special attention. This article highlights the fact that surgical treatment is not the only solution for a dentigerous cyst and, in rare cases, conservative management can save the patient from having unnecessary surgery. ","1164":"While the practice of human identification is well established, validated and proven to be accurate, the practice of bitemark analysis is less well accepted. The principle of identifying an injury as a bitemark is complex and, depending on severity and anatomical location, highly subjective. Following the identification of an injury as a bitemark, the comparison of the pattern produced to a suspect's dentition is even more contentious and an area of great debate within contemporary odontological practice. Advanced techniques using digital overlays have been suggested, yet studies have shown that these can be inaccurate and there is no agreement as to the preferred method of comparison. However, the advent of DNA and its recovery from bitemarks has offered an objective method of bitemark analysis. Despite the strengths of DNA, the physical comparison of a suspect's dentition to bitemark injuries is still commonplace. The issues within bitemark analysis are discussed and illustrated with case examples. Dentists should be aware of where bitemarks are most commonly found, and of their significance in cases of children, the elderly and spousal abuse.

As a restorative dentist using this technique of crown lengthening, one needs to have an understanding of biological width, indications, technique, as well as some possible limitations. The authors aim to discuss these concepts in order that the restorative dentist can use crown lengthening as part of an overall treatment plan in a controlled and predictable manner, taking into account biological factors. Today's restorative dentist faces an apparent increase in patients exhibiting toothwear that may result in shortened teeth, making crowning these teeth problematic. In addition, it is evident that patients are becoming more aware of the importance of a pleasing smile. This article discusses crown lengthening as one way in which the restorative dentist can address both clinical demands. ","1167":"Periodontal disease can significantly impact on the appearance of the anterior teeth. Prior to any definitive treatment, stabilization of the periodontal condition is a requirement. Treatment options can range from the placement of simple restorations, through orthodontic realignment, to the extraction and replacement of hopeless teeth.

","1209":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered to be a minimally invasive treatment modality which shows great promise in premalignant and malignant conditions of the head and neck. This therapy can be applied before or after any of the conventional treatment modalities (ie surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy) and the treatment can be repeated as much as is needed at the same site. PDT uses photosensitizing drugs that are activated by exposure to light of a specific wavelength. Illumination of the suspected premalignant or malignant site by light at the activating wavelength results in cellular destruction by a non-free radical oxidative process. Most photosensitizers are administered systemically, although some can be applied topically in the treatment of skin cancer. Recent developments in photosensitizers and light delivery systems have substantially reduced treatment times and residual photosensitivity, while increasing the achievable depth of necrosis. Compared with standard approaches, PDT can achieve equivalent or greater efficacy in the treatment of premalignant and malignant lesions in the head and neck, with greatly reduced morbidity and disfigurement. The technique is simple, can commonly be carried out in outpatient clinics, and is highly acceptable to patients. It can be repeated to debulk large tumours progressively, and it can also be applied through interstitial light delivery to large solid tumours.

This case report illustrates an example where this occupation caused problems and required treatment. The case was managed with a modified Anterior Repositioning Splint (ARPS) that the patient wore while playing. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are common within the population. Certain factors can predispose or make one more susceptible. This case report highlights viola players who are predisposed to TMD. ","1259":"The paper discusses the reasons for using periodontal splints, together with advantages and disadvantages of their use. Different splinting techniques and criteria for selecting the most appropriate method are described. The need for care in planning treatment is emphasized. It is essential that, if the degree of attachment loss is such that splinting is likely to be needed, this is taken into account in the treatment planning at an early stage. Used correctly, periodontal splinting can greatly improve the comfort, prognosis and outcome for a patient with serious periodontal disease. But used incorrectly, splinting can cause further deterioration in periodontal health. ","1260":"The first article in this series discussed the minimal intervention approach to discoloured teeth, starting with dental bleaching. This second article goes on to explain the technique of microabrasion and the use of direct composite techniques. Microabrasion and composite can provide minimally invasive treatments for discoloured teeth. ","1261":"The aim of this article is to outline some of the factors practitioners should take into consideration when planning optimal smile aesthetics. The components of the smile that will be discussed include the smile arc, incisor\/gingival display, smile width, gingival aesthetics, tooth proportionality\/symmetry, contacts\/connectors\/embrasures and the dental midlines. A systematic evaluation of the components of the smile when planning treatment will help to improve smile aesthetics and produce greater patient and dentist satisfaction. ","1262":"Crown and bridgework has a finite life span and fails for a number of reasons. Removal is often by destructive means. There are a number of clinical circumstances, however, in which a conservative disassembly would aid the practitioner in completing restorative\/endodontic procedures. The aims of this paper are to provide a classification for crown and bridge removal systems; describe how a number of such systems work; and when and why they might be considered. Crown and bridge removal is a frequent occurrence for dentists. There are many situations in which salvaging extracoronal restorations may be more helpful than their destruction. ","1263":"Careful history-taking improves diagnosis of non-dental orofacial pain, a not uncommon group of conditions. Accurate diagnosis of conditions such as chronic idiopathic facial pain, temporomandibular disorders, burning mouth syndrome and trigeminal neuralgia is essential if inappropriate dental treatment is to be avoided. There are few investigations to help in the diagnostic process and many of these patients have other forms of chronic pain. All the conditions are best treated using a holistic approach. Drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, are often effective and surgery can be highly successfully in trigeminal neuralgia. Patient education is paramount. Although the majority of pain seen in general dental practice is dental in origin, chronic non-dental orofacial pain must be recognized as its management is entirely different.

The patient, a type II diabetic, had a history of thrombocytopaenia and, more recently, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Geographic tongue is a common oral medicine condition and the purpose of this paper is to highlight the fact that it can present ectopically on the oral mucosa. ","1268":"This case report describes a 9-year-old Caucasian girl who required comprehensive dental treatment under general anaesthesia but gave a history of Noonan's syndrome. The patient was extremely needle phobic. Because of the association between Noonan's syndrome and underlying coagulopathies, for which no previous investigations were evident, dental treatment had to be postponed pending further investigation. The patient was referred to a haematologist and underwent coagulation screening, which revealed the presence of von Willebrand's disease. The patient was prescribed Desmopressin to raise plasma levels of factor VIII: C and von Willebrand's factor (VWF) in order that dental treatment, including extractions, could be carried out under an in-patient general anaesthetic. Congenital heart defects and bleeding diatheses are regarded as a common association of Noonan's syndrome. Witt et al estimated that around one-third of the patients have an associated bleeding disorder, although a later report suggested that as many as 74% of the coagulation profiles could be abnormal. Most of the bleeding problems are reported to be mild, and resolve with age in some patients, but, clearly, they may cause problems during dental treatment, necessitating haematological investigations and a multidisciplinary approach. ","1269":"Fear of the dentist is a common phenomenon. There are many ways of dealing with anxious patients and this review aims to present the most common methods available to general dental practitioners. An ability to deal with anxious patients successfully is undoubtedly a practice builder. Anxious patients can be stressful to manage but they often become the most vocal advocates of dentists that they trust. ","1270":"There is an increasing move towards more minimally invasive techniques in restorative dentistry. This series of two articles discusses conservative techniques for the treatment of discoloured teeth. A step-wise approach to treatment is promoted to encourage the most conservative solution to achieve satisfactory aesthetics. The first of these two articles will describe the use of bleaching, whilst part two will go on to describe microabrasion and the use of direct composite resin. Discoloured teeth are a common dental problem. Bleaching provides a simple conservative solution in many cases. ","1271":"With advances in periodontal therapy, many sufferers from aggressive periodontitis are retaining their teeth after successful treatment. This presents the practitioner with aesthetic and restorative challenges in these relatively young patients. Lifelong motivation is essential to the supportive therapy for these patients, and the maintenance of good aesthetics, combined with biologically acceptable corrective therapy, may help maintain a high level of motivation. Any treatment provided must naturally be conducive to maintaining long-term dental and periodontal health. This paper aims to demonstrate options for dealing with the aesthetic challenges posed by a number of patients who have undergone initial cause-related therapy for aggressive periodontitis. Loss of gingival tissue, tooth positional changes and tooth loss present practitioners with challenges in relation to patient satisfaction with aesthetics following advanced periodontal breakdown. A range of techniques will be required, tailored to the consequences of periodontal attachment loss, in order to satisfy patient demands. ","1272":"This, the final paper in this three-part series, looks at how patients evaluate the dental care they receive and how this translates into either satisfaction, dissatisfaction or something in between. It explains how it might be possible to manage patient expectations so that patients are more likely to be satisfied with all aspects of the care provided and describes a framework for dentists and staff to use when trying to enhance patient experience in everyday dental practice. By better understanding the concept of 'patient satisfaction' dentists can develop strategies that take into account the way patients evaluate the quality of their own dental care. ","1273":"In this fourth and final paper on the management of patients with congenitally missing teeth, the use of dental implants is considered. This group of patients often provides unique challenges when implant reconstruction is considered. Often a multidisciplinary approach is required involving orthodontists, oral surgeons and restorative dentists. The use of dental implant systems is a rapidly developing area of dentistry and its implications on hypodontia are discussed. This paper identifies the problems associated with a congenital absence of teeth and addresses their management in relation to the use of implants. The use of dental implants in hypodontia patients should always be considered as a treatment option. These groups of patients, however, require careful planning, often of a multidisciplinary nature, so that the timing of the various treatment modalities is seamless. ","1274":"Hypertension is a medical problem that impacts on health worldwide. A number of different medications are used to treat hypertension. These drugs can affect the mouth and perioral structures and impact upon dental management. It is therefore important that dentists are aware of the side-effects and relevant drug interactions that occur in patients on antihypertensive medication. Dentists will encounter patients receiving antihypertensive therapy and should be aware of how these drugs impact upon dental treatment.

Patients with osteosarcoma of the jaws are likely to present to the general dental practitioner initially, however, as the condition is uncommon, many dentists may be unfamiliar with its early radiographic features.","1280":"The aim of this paper is to present scientific evidence for treatment mechanics with the pre-adjusted edgewise appliance. We have summarized findings from randomized and controlled clinical trials following a search of Medline and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register (CCTR) 1970-June 2005. Evidence was available to support our choice of archwires, use of canine lacebacks and method of space closure, thus providing the beginning of a scientific basis for our day-to-day management of fixed appliance mechanics.","1281":"This paper describes the value and use of quality of life measures to dental practice, how to assess oral health-related quality of life in dental practice and how to interpret what they mean when assessing patients'oral health needs and evaluating outcomes from dental care.","1282":"Restoration of spaces in hypodontia patients needs to take into account many factors including, the number of missing teeth, the distribution of space, the size of the teeth, and the age of the patient. This paper considers adhesive and conventional bridgework, as well as removal alternatives for the restoration of spaces. The various merits of each are discussed, together with treatment planning considerations for such cases.","1283":"Tooth loss can occur for a number of reasons and a variety of prosthetic tooth replacement solutions are available to the dental practitioner. This article discusses current approaches in the use of tissue engineering to replace teeth or repair dental tissues. These strategies will depend upon the manipulation of stem cells in the laboratory and, whilst much progress has recently been made, it is likely that successful human tooth regeneration is still some years ahead.","1284":"This paper reviews Minimally Invasive Dentistry (MID) from a day-to-day dentistry perspective, focusing mostly on cariology and restorative dentistry, even though it embraces many aspects of dentistry. The concept of MID supports a systematic respect for the original tissue, including diagnosis, risk assessment, preventive treatment, and minimal tissue removal upon restoration. The motivation for MID emerges from the fact that fillings are not permanent and that the main reasons for failure are secondary caries and filling fracture. To address these flaws, there is a need for economical re-routing so that practices can survive on maintaining dental health and not only by operative procedures.","1285":"","1286":"","1287":"Recurrent oral ulceration due to underlying iron-deficiency anaemia is already recognized. However, this case report describes a 78-year-old lady who developed severe ulceration of the tongue and floor of the mouth as a result of the treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia with ferrous sulphate tablets. Withdrawal of the ferrous sulphate tablets and replacement with ferrous fumarate syrup led to resolution of the lesion.","1288":"During the technical stages of dental treatment, a dental technician may only be able to unite a set of dental casts in a 'best-guess' relationship, unless they are either able to examine the patient themselves, or are given further information about the occlusal position chosen during the clinical procedure. The most common method for this is to use some form of occlusal record, which can be created from a variety of techniques and materials, such as either one of the dental waxes or one of the more recently introduced syringable materials. This paper describes a better technique for using dental wax to make occlusal records. The 'squashbite' technique has no place in clinical dentistry for those attempting to obtain accurate results.","1289":"Peripheral ameloblastoma is an uncommon pathological variant of the more usual intraosseous central ameloblastoma. It most typically presents as a localized soft tissue mass occurring in the tooth-bearing areas of the jaws and is often provisionally diagnosed as an epulis. In this paper, a 43-year-old male presented with a three-year history of a painful, slowly enlarging gingival swelling. There was no evidence of bony involvement on radiographs but it was revealed histologically to be a peripheral ameloblastoma. Treatment was by wide local excision, including a bony margin, and primary closure. Long-term follow-up is imperative owing to possible recurrence and malignant potential.","1290":"In patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD), the need for prior antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is well known to dentists, but not many dentists are aware of the associated haemorrhagic tendencies in such patients. Haemostatic abnormalities associated with CCHD are an important aspect that is often overlooked by both physicians and dentists. We briefly review the literature to highlight the importance of more elaborate haematological evaluation in patients with CCHD, prior to any oral surgical procedures.","1291":"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is an inherited disorder which results in enamel defects. The presentation of AI can vary depending on the type and severity of AI. The management of this condition is important for the patient, both functionally and aesthetically. This report describes the management of a young man who was referred to Birmingham Dental Hospital with AI. The patient's primary complaint was the appearance of his front teeth and the sensitivity he was experiencing from his worn molar teeth.","1292":"Double teeth in the permanent dentition have a reported incidence of 0.1% for Caucasian groups. Common associated problems include adverse aesthetics, caries, periodontal disease, and malocclusions. Management can be challenging, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Three cases are presented illustrating the variety of treatments available.","1293":"Two main types of particulate matter may be produced during routine dental procedures, namely aerosols and splatter. The principal difference between them is the size of the particles from which they are made. The behaviour of such particles in air and their possible health risks are complex. However, the use of high volume evacuation, pre-procedural mouthrinses and rubber dam are the most effective methods of reducing the unwanted risk of exposure.","1294":"This paper explores the way that patient participation has increased in dentistry in recent years and introduces the two concepts of 'quality of life' and 'patient satisfaction' and examines their relevance to everyday clinical dental practice.","1295":"Managing edentulous spaces in patients with congenitally missing teeth demands careful planning and, often, a multidisciplinary approach. Orthodontic tooth movement can be considered to close spaces as well as improve the distribution of available teeth. In this second paper, the advantages of a collaborative approach are discussed.","1296":"Teeth are organs that develop in the embryo via a series of interactions between oral epithelium and neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme of the early jaws. These interactions are initiated by the regional production of signalling molecules in the oral epithelium and the transfer of information to the underlying mesenchyme via homeobox gene transcription.

Early intervention incorporating growth modification allows the clinician to attempt mandibular growth restraint and promote the forward growth of the maxilla. At the optimal age for growth modification, rapid maxillary expansion (RME) and protraction headgear can be used to produce these beneficial changes. The following case report describes the management of an 8.5-year-old patient who underwent treatment using RME, protraction headgear and fixed appliances.","1303":"For patients diagnosed with oral cancer, treatment may involve surgery or radiotherapy alone, or a combination of the two. Where radiotherapy is the sole modality, the addition of chemotherapy may be beneficial, particularly with advanced tumours. If the treatment is surgery, this may involve extensive microsurgical reconstruction. Follow up of treated patients should be rigorous and, ideally, quality of life should be measured.","1304":"The management of patients with congenitally missing teeth can be a challenge and, in many cases, requires multidisciplinary care. In this four-part series, a contemporary approach to managing this group of patients is discussed. This first paper examines the terminology, epidemiology and restorative challenges that such patients can exhibit.","1305":"Root canal therapy is not always successful and an increasing number of patients are requesting retreatment to address intraradicular infection.

Clinical studies have been promising, however failures can occur, usually because of de-bonding of the post. Current research, aimed at identifying factors that could improve the adhesion of fibre posts, is described. Adhesively-retained fibre posts are becoming a popular choice for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth. Dental practitioners should be knowledgeable on the rationale behind these restorations, factors that can lead to failure, and ongoing developments. ","1309":"The intense pain of dental origin which patients suffer can be underestimated. This can lead them to self-harm or carry out self-treatment, sometimes with only the rudiments of how to achieve pain relief. A case is reported of a patient who attempted to relieve the intense pressure of an abscess arising in a maxillary cyst by using a home power drill. He drilled through the side of the tooth and drained the abscess but, unfortunately, fractured the drill. This was discovered at operation and meant the tooth had to be extracted. The patient had only received antibiotics prior to this for his abscess, with no drainage being undertaken. This case highlights the inappropriate use of antibiotics when drainage of an abscess is the correct treatment. It demonstrates the extreme measures some patients may take in order to relieve their symptoms by self-treating themselves physically, in addition to self-prescribed medication.

Dental practitioners should be familiar with their indications, contra-indications and side-effects.We present the case of a 28-year-old male who had been taking two NSAIDs concurrently for dental pain which resulted in an acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. General Dental Practitioners need to be aware of the possible life-threatening complications when prescribing NSAIDs. ","1312":"The strength of the evidence linking some common malocclusion traits (which are used as the basis for IOTN classification) with dental disease is reviewed. It is concluded that IOTN is not a reliable predictor of the potential impact of malocclusion on future dental health, and that alternative indices, which place greater emphasis on the aesthetic impairment and take account of patient perceptions, are more appropriate for assessing an individual's orthodontic treatment need. IOTN is likely to assume greater significance with the advent of the new GDS\/PDS regulations pertaining to orthodontics. However, all practitioners, including those who commission specialist services, should be aware of its limitations, especially in relation to the Dental Health Component.

Dentists may encounter and sometimes have to manage some of the complications of facial fractures or their treatment. ","1314":"Patients with xerostomia are presenting dental practitioners with challenges in caries control, long-term restoration and prosthodontic difficulties. In many cases, extraction may be the best option, but for younger, dentate patients, this may be inappropriate. This paper describes the management of a young partially dentate patient with severe xerostomia following irradiation of the salivary glands. Preventive and restorative management are discussed, together with treatment and healing of peri-radicular pathology. The case report demonstrates that long-term stabilization and management of caries and peri-radicular lesions are possible over a seven-year period for a patient with severe radiation caries. Many dental patients present with some degree of xerostomia due to age, side-effects of anti-hypertensive and psychotropic drugs and also as a side-effect of radiotherapy. General dental practitioners are ideally placed to monitor and provide early intervention for this highly caries-susceptible group of patients. With good patient motivation and professional support, tooth loss is not inevitable and this case report suggests strategies and demonstrates the clinical stages in the management of severe caries due to xerostomia. ","1315":"It is almost a decade since the recognition of the emergence of a new infectious disease termed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) caused by prions (PrPTSE), abnormal variants of a normal human cell surface protein (PrP). This disease has a number of similarities to other forms of CJD--lethal disorders characterized by a prolonged incubation period, and progressive mental deterioration. In relation to oral tissues, PrPTSE have been found in neural, gingival, pulpal, lingual, lymphoreticular and salivary gland tissue in animal models. In both sporadic and variant CJD, PrPTSE is detectable in the trigeminal ganglion and, in vCJD, in lymphoreticular tissues, but infectivity has not been tested in other human oral tissues. PrPTSE is much more resistant to the common methods of inactivation than conventional pathogens, and it adheres avidly to steel whilst retaining its infectivity. Particular attention must be paid to cleaning and sterilizing re-usable dental instruments. Single-use devices, such as endodontic files and matrix bands, must never be re-used. Advice on the reprocessing of dental instruments used on known CJD patients must be obtained from local infection control teams. Research into effective methods of prion inactivation appears promising, although further work on the applicability to general dental practice is required.

Exposure to a sensitizer in a hypersensitive person may initiate an allergic contact dermatitis\/stomatitis. This usually occurs after direct skin\/mucosa contact with the sensitizer. This paper reports the case of a colophony hypersensitive male who developed contact stomatitis after dental treatment with a colophony-containing product. Sensitizing colophony is present in Duraphat 2.26%F varnish, a fluoride varnish used all over the world. A case of hypersensitivity to Duraphat 2.26%F varnish is presented in a patient who, at the initial visit, indicated only an allergy to sticking plasters. ","1320":"The final section of this series examines both the evidence for the safety of external bleaching with hydrogen peroxide and related products and the legal position in the UK with regard to their sale and use in general dental practice. Potential side-effects are examined, including biological effects and dental effects, with a review of the current evidence. The EU Cosmetics and Medical Device Directive are both described and their impact on the provision of tooth bleaching in the UK is explained. The legal position in the UK renders the sale and supply of solutions containing &gt;0.1% peroxide illegal, and practitioners must be aware of the underlying legislation and the basis upon which a prosecution may be pursued. Clinicians considering using hydrogen peroxide products must be aware of the safety issues surrounding their use and be able to explain to patients the nature of the risk and also the likelihood of any given patient experiencing them. ","1321":"This, the second of three articles, highlights the management of facial fractures and the GDP's role in this. For patients who present to dental practice with facial fractures, it is important that the dentist is able to inform the patient of his\/her likely management in hospital.

However, the development of yttrium tetragonal zirconia polycrystals, and its adoption for use in dentistry by CAD CAM technology, may hold promise as a crown and bridge framework, this being considered suitable for single and multiple units. However, to date, no long-term clinical studies have been reported. This paper describes three cases in which zirconia frameworks were used in crowns and bridges. For the patient wishing to receive a non-metal crown or bridge, novel zirconia-based systems hold promise. ","1323":"Clinical dental records fulfil a variety of functions. Whilst there is no standard data set for dental records, it is essential that these are contemporaneous--that is, they are 'recorded at the time' A good written record should contain details of the patient's identification data, medical and dental history, clinical examination, diagnosis, treatment plan, reference to consent, and progress notes. This paper covers these aspects in detail, and provides information on how long records should be stored, and who may access clinical records.

The purpose of this paper is to describe overcoming failure of a transmandibular implant without removal and synchronous placement of endosseous dental implants in the interforaminal region, providing an implant-retained overdenture to the patient. Transmandibular implants are rarely used nowadays and management of a failed transmandibular implant is reported even less often. Where bone height is adequate, dental implants may be placed in the anterior mandible, even when the failed transmandibular implant is not completely removed.

We report four cases (two in patients and two in archived specimens) of bifid mandibular condyles with emphasis on their aetiopathogenesis and radiographic features. A case of bifid mandibular condyles in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis is reported which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first reported case in the literature. Anatomical variations, like bifid mandibular condyles, may mimic a fracture\/tumour. Therefore, knowledge and awareness about this entity is important for a general dental practitioner.

Known as 'direct-to-consumer' products there are two main systems available, one employing coated, cellulose strips and the other a paint-on gel. A further development is the production of dentifrices that contain active hydrogen peroxide, made possible by the use of dual chambered tubes. Each of the systems is described and demonstrated and an overview of the research supporting their safe, effective use is presented in each case. It is likely that our patients have access to these products and, hence, it is important that we are aware of their strengths and weaknesses.

For the dental practice to succeed, it is important to assess the needs and levels of satisfaction of the patients. The planning and execution of a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire survey is discussed, along with the quality assurance and marketing benefits that may accrue to the practice applying the lessons learnt from the survey. A well run survey will not only reveal levels of patient satisfaction with the practice care and service--a Quality Assurance exercise--but will also enable the practitioner to assess--and even influence--patients' awareness of the levels of care and service being delivered--a marketing benefit.

Following an excision biopsy of the lesion, the histopathology report revealed a mass of lymph nodes with granulomatous inflammation strongly suggestive of infective aetiology, most probably of mycobacterial (either tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)) origin. Cervical lymph node enlargement due to NTM remains a diagnostic challenge because of the inconsistent reliability of clinical and laboratory findings. We discuss the significance of caseating granulomatous inflammation in cervical lymphadenitis and provide a brief overview of tuberculosis and a comparison with NTM. Dental surgeons can play an important role in the diagnosis and early treatment of many systemic conditions and they should be aware of the signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, as this is now an increasingly common condition, particularly amongst the immigrant population. ","1342":"As dental health improves, with the concurrent drop in the provision of basic restorative care, patients are now asking their dentists to provide aesthetic treatments rather than the treatment of disease. Tooth bleaching is one such treatment that is frequently described in consumer magazines and television shows, driving consumer interest in this, apparently, benign therapy. This three-part series demonstrates the techniques that can be employed, within the dental practice or under the supervision of a clinician, those systems that can be bought by patients over the counter and, finally, a discussion of the biological effects of peroxide-containing solutions and the legal position on such products in the UK. In this section, we will describe the common methods by which teeth can be bleached, either by the clinician directly, or under his\/her supervision by the use of'at home' kits.

Although there is clear evidence of medical efficacy, there are increasing numbers of reports concerning bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws. This side-effect poses significant problems and is very difficult to treat. The aim of this article is to outline the proposed pathogenesis, incidence, presenting signs and symptoms, and risk factors. Also, suggestions are made as to the most appropriate measures for prevention and management of bisphosphonate-associated jaw osteonecrosis. General dental practitioners have a key role to play in identifying patients at risk of developing bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaws, preventing occurrence of the condition and initiating early specialist referral.

Implants may be placed immediately following tooth extraction or following a period of healing to allow resolution of residual infection or sufficient bone and soft tissue healing. Early restoration and loading of implants has to be carefully controlled to avoid increased failure and complications. Advantages and disadvantages of the various techniques are described. The clinician should adopt a treatment protocol that ensures a high success rate and a long-term functional and aesthetic implant restoration. Rapid treatment protocols can be considered when they do not compromise these goals, and the clinician is sufficiently experienced in their application.

The patient was referred to a cardiologist and submitted to head-up tilt testing, which evoked prolonged asystole, associated with loss of consciousness and mild generalized twitching, confirming a diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syncope. Before dental treatment could be completed, the patient was successfully treated with disopyramide and dual-chamber pacemaker implantation. Dentistry can predispose patients to fainting (syncope or vasovagal episode) owing to fear, pain, unusual sights and smells, anxiety, fatigue and fasting, so knowledge of extreme forms of this response are of relevance. ","1350":"This paper compares the erosive potential of standard Tropicana smooth orange juice with a new low acid orange juice. Three parameters are compared in the laboratory; pH, neutralizable acidity and the ability to erode enamel. The pH of the standard orange juice is 3.88 compared with the low acid orange juice which has a pH of 4.18. The neutralizable acidity of the low acid juice is lower (16.96 ml of 0.1 M NaOH) than the standard juice (28.46 ml of 0.1 M NaOH). The low acid orange juice produces less enamel erosion (2.49 microm) than the standard juice (5.23 pm). Ideally, these laboratory findings need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled clinical trial before this product could be recommended unreservedly for patients that are clinically susceptible to erosion. As dietary advice forms a cornerstone in the clinical management of erosion, the introduction of a commercially available low acid orange is most welcome. ","1351":"This paper sets out to discuss the treatment options available for the management of patients with agenesis of second premolars. These include: retention of the deciduous molar, extraction followed by space closure, extraction and utilization of the space for the correction of malocclusion and extraction followed by restoration of the edentulous space. Congenital absence of second premolars is a common clinical problem faced by practitioners. Dentists should be aware of the treatment options when managing such cases. ","1352":"Cleidocranial dysplasia is a rare congenital disorder of bone characterized by abnormalities of clavicle, skull and dentition. There are features which are pathognomic for this condition and diagnosis can usually be made early in life. This report presents a case that was diagnosed very late in life, with a resultant compromised dental state, and discusses current treatment modalities and the differential diagnosis with another condition with which this was mistaken. Delayed eruption of permanent teeth must be diagnosed and investigated early so that it can be managed appropriately. ","1353":"Orbital cellulitis is a rare but serious sequel of infection from a dental origin. Without prompt treatment, further spread of infection is likely to occur, resulting in loss of vision and possibly death. We report a case of orbital cellulitis secondary to infection originating in a recently endodontically-treated upper first molar tooth. The case was successfully treated by intravenous antibiotics. Odontogenic causes of orbital cellulitis and sinusitis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis. The importance of aggressive treatment of infections in maxillary teeth cannot be over emphasized. Correct diagnosis is vital to the success of therapy. ","1354":"Patients may present with a need for indirect restorations (crowns, inlays, etc), but have teeth with short clinical crown height. The management of problems presented by such teeth relates mainly to preventing loss of the restoration and the maintenance of the health of pulp in an already compromised tooth. Traditional techniques for increasing resistance form and retention, together with the option of surgical crown lengthening, will overcome problems associated with short crowns in many cases. However, these methods are not a universal solution. Contemporary techniques, utilizing adhesive dentistry, and the Dahl concept have an increasing place in the management of such cases. The Dahl concept and adhesive dentistry may supplement traditional techniques when providing and retaining indirect restorations. ","1355":"This paper presents an overview of three of the most commonly encountered 'superbugs; with a comment on the implications of each for the dental practitioner. The origins of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms lie in the acquisition of resistance genes and selection pressures, with their spread facilitated by inappropriate prescribing and inadequate infection control. Dentists should attempt to rationalize their antibiotic prescribing and ensure that they and other dental staff adhere to standard infection control procedures. Many dental practitioners will treat a wide range of patients in a variety of healthcare settings ranging from general practices to hospital in-patients. It is increasingly likely that they will either knowingly or unknowingly come into contact with people colonized or infected with drug-resistant micro-organisms.

Metastases to the head and neck are uncommon but should always be considered among the differential diagnoses of lesions. ","1359":"Dental teams are in an ideal position to help smokers stop smoking. In spite of this, smoking cessation interventions are not often incorporated as a routine part of dental care. Surveys have shown that most dentists believe that helping patients stop smoking is important, but they are reluctant to provide smoking cessation services for their patients. However, comparatively little research has been carried out to examine the views and activities of other members of the dental team, with respect to the provision of smoking cessation support as part of dental care.This paper describes a self-administered, questionnaire-based study to investigate attitudes and practices amongst staff in the Birmingham Personal Dental Service, with respect to helping patients to stop smoking. Dentists and their team members have an important role to play in smoking cessation.

This drug has received wide coverage in the press and media for its cosmetic advantages, especially in the facial region. The clinician may be aware of the many courses becoming available and aimed at dentists to start using it in the cosmetic context. This paper intends to provide a basic understanding of the many functional uses of the drug in the orofacial region that may be relevant to everyday practice. Awareness of the current medical, as opposed to purely cosmetic, uses of botulinum toxin in the orofacial region is desirable and this paper should inform clinicians and their patients with respect to this increasingly popular drug. ","1362":"Powered toothbrushes are a significant segment of the oral care market. Numerous clinical trials have compared the effectiveness of manual and powered toothbrushes for their effectiveness in improving oral health and the results are often conflicting. Recent Systematic Reviews by the Cochrane Oral Health Group have distilled this information and provided unbiased conclusions, namely that: powered toothbrushes with an oscillating rotating action are more effective than manual toothbrushes in reducing plaque and gingivitis; other types of powered toothbrushes produced less consistent reductions in plaque and gingivitis than manual brushes. Further studies are required to determine the relative effectiveness of manual and powered toothbrushes in improving the status of patients with periodontitis. This review provides the dental professional with an unbiased summary of current evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of manual and powered toothbrushes.

Whilst suffering from a bout of acute depression and anxiety, a 29-year-old female caused significant trauma to her anterior dentition with a pair of fabric scissors. The presentation and management of this case is described. Although tooth surface loss is a common clinical finding in many patient groups, practitioners should be aware of possible unusual aetiologies which may be involved. ","1364":"The traditional treatment of dental caries has been limited to bulk removal of the diseased tissue. Recently, disinfection rather than the removal of all the carious tissue has been advocated with the aim of more effective and conservative treatment. In endodontics, prognosis is dependent on the complete disinfection of the root canal system. Evidence exists that Photo-Activated Disinfection is more effective than traditional chemo-mechanical canal preparation. Photo-Activated Disinfection may also have a place in the treatment of other infective oral conditions, including periodontal disease. Removal or disruption of micro-organisms and their ecosystem is important in many branches of restorative dentistry. A novel disinfection system is now available which has the potential to improve treatment methods and prognoses.

There is no evidence that a more complex fabrication technique including face-bow registration results in a better clinical outcome. Balanced occlusion\/articulation is not necessary for successful complete denture function. Variations in materials and techniques appear to have only minor influence, if any, on the clinical end result. Psychosocial factors, especially a good relationship between dentist and patient, are more important than prosthodontic factors for a positive outcome. Creating a good relationship between the dentist and the patient is extremely important for a successful outcome of a complete denture treatment.

It is usually characterized by the presence of non-caseating, granulomatous, epithelioid tissue at the sites affected with involvement of lymphoid tissue. Sarcoidosis confined to lymph nodes, salivary glands and other tissue in the head and neck is uncommon and usually indicative of a more generalized systemic process. Within the differential diagnosis of isolated masses associated with the head and neck, sarcoidosis is indeed rare. We report a case of systemic sarcoidosis presenting as a small localized facial swelling. The report illustrates that other symptoms, albeit mild, may direct the clinician to a provisional diagnosis of generalized sarcoidosis. Within the differential diagnosis of isolated facial swellings, sarcoidosis is extremely uncommon. However, clinicians should consider the diagnosis, especially in the presence of other, albeit mild, symptoms.

Orthodontic treatment may not always be successful due to various factors. Some of these limiting factors are related to the practitioner, others to the patients and the orthodontic appliances used. These three sets of factors were covered in the first part of this article. This second part deals with the biologic limitations of orthodontic treatment.

To date, with the exception of the most surgically accessible stones found within the anterior ducts, there has been little treatment to offer patients except surgical removal of the gland, with the associated risks to the facial and trigeminal nerves. In the last 10 years, more conservative treatment modalities have been developed, opening up a range of treatment options which combine to provide an alternative management of these cases. This paper presents data from one unit in which lithotripsy, which is the destruction of stones (calculi) using shock waves, basket retrieval, a modified minor surgical technique, and balloon dilatation have been used to treat salivary gland obstruction successfully. Over 70% of stones can now be retrieved leaving a functioning gland. Salivary gland obstruction is a clinical problem presenting to the general dental practitioner, and requires an understanding of the range of treatment options available. ","1383":"This article describes a technique for improving the stability of mandibular complete dentures for patients who have a diminished mandibular neutral zone. The technique involves making an impression which is shaped by the patient's oral musculature, and which defines the shape and contour of the patient's neutral zone. A case report is presented in which the use of this technique is described. It is hoped that this article will increase the awareness of dental practitioners to the use of this technique. The neutral zone impression technique is a useful technique when providing mandibular complete dentures. Its use can overcome some of the denture stability difficulties caused in some patients by a more powerful oral musculature, or in patients who have poor or altered neuromuscular control.

There is incomplete knowledge about the effectiveness of various methods for selecting individuals who will benefit from bitewing examination. Available knowledge suggests, however, that our ability to identify correctly those who will benefit is limited. It may, therefore, be more effective to combine population- and individual-based selection criteria. For this purpose, four key ages and individual-based criteria between the key ages are suggested. The purpose of the presented selection criteria are to improve the dental practioner's effectiveness in selecting patients who will benefit from bitewing examination, thereby reducing the number of arbitrary and 'just in case' radiographs and the radiation dose.

The best results are obtained when the denture bases are well extended, especially in the upper arch. This is complicated when the patient experiences difficulty with the impression phase of treatment due to a hypersensitive gag reflex. Relative Analgesia (RA), also termed inhalational sedation, may be employed to facilitate the taking of dental impressions in patients with a hypersensitive gag reflex. Three patients, who had previous failed attempts to produce a satisfactory dental impression, have been used to illustrate the technique and outcome. It must be noted that the concentration of nitrous oxide required to produce suppression of the gag reflex will vary from patient to patient. This may be irrespective of size and weight; therefore each subject should be individually monitored. Relative analgesia (inhalational sedation) may be employed to facilitate the taking of dental impressions in patients with a hypersensitive gag reflex.

They can be used to assess bone loss and the pattern of loss as well as in the identification of other periodontally relevant features, such as overhanging restoration margins, calculus deposits and furcation lesions. Horizontal and vertical bitewings, panoramic radiographs and periapicals can be used for periodontal assessment. Referral (selection) criteria based on clinical signs can assist the decision of the radiographs to use. All exposures must be made in accordance with the Ionizing Radiation (Medical Examination) Regulations 2000 and each exposure justified. Following a clinical examination, optimum selection of radiographs can assist in the assessment of patients with periodontal diseases. ","1401":"Auto-transplantation can be used to replace missing anterior teeth following traumatic injuries. This technique has the advantage (over other forms of treatment) of maintaining alveolar bone height which allows orthodontic and further restorative intervention by way of implants later in life. Careful restorative management of transplanted teeth is vital to their long-term survival as inadequate maintenance post transplant may result in root resorption and eventual tooth loss. This paper describes the restorative management of two cases following transplantation. Dental practitioners should be aware of the option to auto-transplant teeth as part of an overall treatment plan and the subsequent interventions often required. ","1402":"As the prevalence of edentulousness has decreased, dentists can expect to treat increasing numbers of partially dentate patients. The number of adults who are edentate in the maxilla and partially dentate in the mandible is considerable, and present particular clinical challenges. A common finding is that of the flabby ridge, which affects retention and stability of the maxillary complete denture.

Various side-effects have been associated with the use of methadone. These include xerostomia, which can contribute to a high caries rate. The UK Regional Drug Misuse Database reported that around 118,500 drug users were receiving treatment from drug misuse agencies and GPs. The vast majority (87%) were receiving treatment from community specialist services. As many drug abusers have poor oral health, general dental practitioners are likely to encounter such individuals. It is essential therefore that dentists are aware of the potential difficulties that may be encountered when treating subjects receiving methadone. These problems may relate to previous drug abuse and to the effects of methadone therapy.","1409":"Long QT is a disorder of the heart's conduction system. It can be congenital or acquired. The acquired type is caused mainly by medications. The diagnosis of LQT depends on the clinical features, the family history, and the ECG findings. The clinical presentations range from dizziness to syncope and sudden death. The dentist should consult the cardiologist to avoid any complications that may put the LQTS patient at risk. Medications such as erythromycin and antifungals are contra-indicated and should not be prescribed. Local anaesthetics containing adrenaline and bupivacaine should be avoided. Stress can precipitate symptoms and lead to sudden death.","1410":"The causes of tooth discoloration are varied and complex but are usually classified as being either intrinsic, extrinsic or internalized in nature. Dietary chromogens and other external elements deposit on the tooth surface or within the pellicle layer either directly or indirectly to form extrinsic discoloration. Stains within the dentine or intrinsic discoloration often results from systemic or pulpal origin, while internalized stains are the result of extrinsic stains entering the dentine via tooth defects such as cracks on the tooth surface.","1411":"Alcohol use contributes to many health disorders and social problems which may affect both the individual and the community, and is a major risk factor for oral cancer and potentially malignant lesions - leukoplakia and erythroplakia. Counselling by doctors and dentists can increase users' motivation to stop alcohol use but is not often applied in a systematic or frequent manner to people presenting with potentially malignant oral lesions. This paper makes recommendations for interventions by health professionals to encourage and aid cessation of alcohol use as a part of prevention of oral cancer.","1412":"The provision of well-fitting, functional provisional restorations is important for a wide variety of reasons, including maintenance of the stability of inter- and intra-arch relationships and positional stability of prepared teeth, and the preservation of occlusal function of anterior provisional restorations by providing appropriate protrusive and lateral guidance. Provisional restorations should be of sufficient strength to resist the forces of occlusion and should be luted with a cement that will resist the forces of removal, yet allow easy removal at the fit appointment without leaving a residue on the prepared tooth.

There is now considerable evidence that many patients can safely be managed without stopping or altering their warfarin. This paper summarizes the evidence and provides guidance for the dentist on identifying which patients can be managed in primary care. Generally, such patients are those with a stable INR within the therapeutic range, between 2.0 and 4.0, undergoing simple extractions, scaling and minor surgical procedures, for whom local haemostatic measures are used, including packing with a haemostatic dressing, suturing and application of local pressure. Management advice is presented in the form of an algorithm providing additional information on postoperative care. Dental practitioners in primary care treat an increasing number of patients taking warfarin, so identification of patients who may be treated is of importance. ","1417":"This paper discusses the excavation of deep caries lesions, focusing on indirect pulp-capping and the stepwise excavation approach. The concept of a modified and less invasive stepwise excavation is presented, based on considerations of caries pathology. The aim of the first excavation is primarily to make a change within the cariogenic environment, and not to remove carious dentine close to the pulp because this risks an iatrogenic pulp exposure. Microbiological and clinical studies have shown that the number of bacteria decrease during stepwise excavation procedures, and that lesions clinically arrest. The active, soft-yellowish, demineralized dentine turns into a darker, harder and drier demineralized dentine, resembling a slowly progressing lesion, where the carious dentine is easier to remove at the final visit. The final excavation has two aims: (i) to verify that arrestation has taken place, ie a clinical control of the tooth reactions and (ii) to remove the slowly progressing but still slightly infected discoloured demineralized dentine, before carrying out the permanent and final restoration. Knowledge of guidelines for treatment of deep dentine caries may reduce the risk of pulpal exposure. ","1418":"Tobacco use contributes to many oral and general health disorders.While cigarette smoking is the most hazardous and prevalent form of tobacco use in the industrialized countries, consideration also needs to be given to non-cigarette use such as bidi smoking in India, reverse smoking by several rural populations and use of snuff and chewing tobacco. Health professionals should encourage and aid cessation of tobacco use as a part of prevention of oral and other cancers. ","1419":"A fundamental pre-requisite for the construction of satisfactory indirect restorations is the ability to record an accurate and detailed impression of the dental structures. Knowledge of the key properties of the available impression materials and their handling behaviour is necessary if they are to be used effectively. A variety of techniques can be employed in different situations, each of which can be highly successful, but only if attention is paid to the detail of their execution and the clinician is aware of their individual limitations and pitfalls. Where imperfections occur, an appreciation of how they have been caused, and the strategies to take to prevent them will lead to greater success in impression taking. Current materials exceed our needs in terms of accuracy and stability, and yet the impressions produced are frequently flawed. By realizing why faults occur, being aware of the range of techniques available and having an understanding of the behaviour of materials, clinicians can achieve the quality in their impressions that is possible and necessary to provide excellence in indirect restorations.

It results from biochemical defects which cause excessive activation of the complement cascade and result in deep swellings in the skin and alimentary tract, called angio-oedema. These swellings are painful rather than itchy and not associated with urticaria, which helps to differentiate angio-oedema from allergic reactions. Even mild trauma can give rise to swelling, which may be life-threatening in the oral region. Management of two cases, one hereditary and the other acquired angio-oedema, are reported to demonstrate the use of C1 esterase inhibitor prophylaxis. It is important that patients giving a history of angio-oedema are thoroughly investigated and, in discussion with the patient's medical team, appropriate prophylactic measures are taken to prevent swelling.

It therefore seems logical that preservation of coronal dentine is important to the survival of intra- and extra-coronal restorations. The clinical assessment of the amount of dentine needed for functional requirements and the strategic value of remaining tooth structure is currently based on clinical opinion. This paper discusses what recommendations have been published and proposes an index that may be useful in assessing the restorability of a tooth. An index used to assess the amount and contribution of remaining coronal dentine to resistance and retention form could be of value in treatment planning. ","1429":"Appropriately timed extraction of a carious first permanent molar can result in favourable mesial drift of the second permanent molar when space is not required for orthodontic treatment. However, when the second deciduous molar adjacent to the extracted tooth is not removed, distal drift of the unerupted second premolar may occur. This paper discusses three patients who had first permanent molars extracted without removal of the adjacent second deciduous molar, encouraging unfavourable distal drift of the second premolar in the first two cases. Timely extraction of the second deciduous molar in the third case should prevent this orthodontic problem. Treatment of gross caries in a first permanent molar requires assessment of the patient's orthodontic status prior to treatment planning. ","1430":"Oral cancer is among the ten most common cancers world-wide, and is especially seen in disadvantaged elderly males. Members of the dental profession have a duty to detect both potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. Early detection and prompt treatment offer the best hope to the patient with oral cancer, providing the best chance of a cure. As patient awareness regarding the danger of oral cancer increases, the demand for oral cancer 'screening' is also expected to increase significantly. The signs and symptoms of cancer often resemble less serious conditions more commonly found in the mouth and similarly presenting as a lump, red or white patch or ulcer. If any such lesion does not heal normally within 3 weeks, a malignancy or some other serious disorder must be excluded. A biopsy is indicated. Prompt referral to an appropriate specialist usually allows for the best management but, if this is not feasible, the dental practitioner should take the biopsy which should be sent to a specialist oral pathologist for histological evaluation. Early detection and prompt treatment offer the best hope to the patient with oral cancer, providing the best chance of a cure. As patient awareness regarding the danger of oral cancer increases, the demand for oral cancer'screening' is expected to increase significantly as well. ","1431":"Restorations which may be bonded to tooth substance hold advantages over traditionally-luted restorations, including reduced requirement for resistance and retention form. There is evidence that adhesive techniques are becoming increasingly used, but is their performance as good as more traditional restorations? This paper reviews the success rates of adhesively-luted indirect restorations, concluding that these require less tooth reduction than non-adhesive restorations, although performance in terms of debond\/loss of restoration may not always be as good as in traditional techniques. The use of adhesive techniques should result in less reduction of tooth substance and may be of value where retention is suboptimal. ","1432":"","1433":"Case reports form an invaluable source of learning and discussion material. The aim of this article is to provide some guidance to help authors who are thinking of submitting reports for future publication. Some common pitfalls are highlighted, as well as useful hints to increase the authors' chances of publication. Case reports often introduce readers to new clinical techniques and allow them so see how treatment can be made more efficient and effective. ","1434":"The profession now benefits from many different laser wavelengths that enable their use in nearly every dental specialty. This article will cover these wavelengths and their uses for soft and hard tissue procedures. There are many laser wavelengths available but their use within dentistry is quite tissue specific. It is hoped the reader will be able to decide which wavelength is best for a particular procedure. ","1435":"The developing role of the prosthodontist in the head and neck cancer team is discussed and a sequence of care given for patients who will require the restoration by prosthetic means of surgically created palatal defects. Various styles of definitive obturators are described. A knowledge of the care of patients with palatal defects is of value to GDPs and to members of the head and neck cancer team. ","1436":"Oral cancer is among the ten most common cancers world-wide, and is especially seen in disadvantaged older males. Cancer arises as a consequence of DNA mutations causing multiple molecular genetic events in many chromosomes and genes, leading to cell dysregulation. Tobacco and alcohol use are extremely important in oral mutagenesis. Environmental factors such as infective agents and genetic factors are implicated in a minority of patients. Dental staff can advise on lifestyle changes for the prevention of potentially malignant oral disease and thereby protect their patients, staff, colleagues, families and acquaintances, having the opportunity to make an impact on improving the survival rate and morbidity of oral cancer by detecting both potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. ","1437":"Luting materials play a central role in indirect dentistry. Active materials which bond to tooth and restoration may aid retention of restorations, while passive materials merely fill the gap between crown and tooth. The properties of currently available luting materials are discussed, with resin-modified glass ionomer and resin materials being found to exhibit optimum properties. However, resin luting materials have been technique sensitive to use, but the advent of self-adhesive resin luting materials has overcome most of the technique problems during placement of restorations. Resin materials are indicated for luting all-ceramic restorations. Correct choice of a luting material with optimum physical properties is central to success in indirect dentistry. ","1438":"","1439":"A 'double' tooth is an uncommon dental developmental anomaly that can occur in the deciduous and\/or permanent dentition. It is not always possible to differentiate clinically between fusion and gemination. Clinical and radiographic examination, as well as a histological assessment, can help to differentiate between fusion and gemination. A case of fusion in the deciduous dentition is presented to demonstrate the diagnostic differences but also, more importantly, to draw attention to the potential impact of 'double' teeth on the developing secondary dentition and its future management.","1440":"High tech dentistry now involves the routine use of lasers in general dental practice for various procedures once thought only possible with the conventional dental drill or scalpel. In 1990, the first dental laser, the dLase 300 (American Dental Lasers, Corpus Christi,TX 78405 USA), was introduced to the profession. There are now many different types of laser used in dentistry using a variety of wavelengths. Each laser wavelength is absorbed differently by soft and hard tissues and the efficiency of the laser has been determined by the ability of the tissue to absorb or reflect that wavelength. This and the following article hope to give a broad overview of dental lasers and their clinical uses. This article gives an overview of the relevant laser physics and highlights the laser-tissue interactions.","1441":"A case is presented of inflammatory external root resorption detected on radiographic examination. Conventional endodontic treatment, including calcium hydroxide dressing for two weeks and obturation of the root canal system using the vertical compaction of warm gutta-percha technique was a simple and effective treatment modality for arresting the resorptive process and maintaining the integrity of the patient dentition.","1442":"An outline is given of palato-pharyngeal function in the cleft palate patient and how it may be expected to vary from that of the non-cleft subject. The procedure of obturator moulding is described and the functioning of palatal training appliances and palatal supports explained.","1443":"Toothwear cases can vary dramatically in their presentation, with some displaying quite peculiar patterns. This case report outlines a patient's unusual eating habit that had led to a localized pattern of toothwear affecting his maxillary and mandibular central incisors. The patient had a habit of eating fresh chillies between his incisors after most evening meals; this was followed by immediate toothbrushing, which he had done for many years. This case illustrates that, not only is diet analysis important in identifying aetiological factors in toothwear cases, but also dietary habits.","1444":"Prevention and early detection are integral components of the Health Agenda and areas taking on increasing importance and emphasis. Members of the dental profession have an important role to play and, indeed, a duty to advise on the prevention of, not only oral diseases and notably oral cancer, but also on other potentially malignant conditions and their prevention. They are in a position to advise and help protect their patients, staff, colleagues, families and acquaintances. Apart from prevention, early detection and prompt referral for diagnosis offer the best hope to the patient with cancer, providing the best chance of a cure. The signs and symptoms of cancer often resemble less serious conditions and prompt referral to an appropriate specialist usually allows for the best management.","1445":"Conscious sedation for dental procedures is constantly developing. Midazolam remains the most widely used agent, although there has been encouraging research into patient-maintained sedation (PMS) with propofol. This article reviews the use of sedation in children, recent advances with propofol, and outlines current opinion on multiple drug sedation techniques. There is also a description of the current recommendations for training in the practice of conscious sedation.","1446":"Modern post preparation techniques reflect a change from what was once considered a prosthodontic procedure to one which marries endodontic principles with sound understanding of mechanical objectives.

A proportion of these are considered unsatisfactory for clinical use. The reason for these 'failures' is often poor operator technique, rather than an inherent problem of the material. With improved handling of the material and better clinical technique, failures can be avoided. This paper provides an overview of the use of alginate impression material in clinical dentistry.","1450":"A number of treatment approaches are available for the management of Class II malocclusion. Functional appliances are commonly used for the management of mandibular retrognathia in growing subjects. The twin block appliance is the most popular functional appliance in use within the United Kingdom. The aim of this article is to review the clinical management of the twin block appliance and to discuss some of the hard and soft tissue changes that accompany treatment with this appliance.","1451":"Tooth impaction is not uncommon among the population. Its management is important aesthetically and functionally to the patient. Treatment ranges from regular review, extraction of the primary tooth, surgical exposure of the impacted tooth, with or without orthodontic traction, auto-transplantation to its surgical removal. Any decision taken should be judged on individual merit.","1452":"Despite the fact that smoking cigarettes harms oral and systemic health, there is little current evidence of successful primary dental care involvement in smoking cessation. This paper aims to present the arguments for developing the role of primary dental care in smoking cessation and reviews the current literature on how this can be achieved in practice. It is argued that it is timely to incorporate this rapidly developing evidence base on what works in smoking cessation into primary dental care activity.","1453":"There are many infectious agents found within the oral cavity. Bacteria form an important group of micro-organisms found in both healthy and diseased mouths. The current article will discuss those bacteria resident within the mouth and review the oral diseases with which they are associated.","1454":"Indirect restorations can provide a conservative, functional and aesthetic method for managing a patient's dentition. These restorations, however, are only as good as the environment in which they are placed. Many restorations, though technically satisfactory, may fail because assessment and subsequent treatment planning has been unsatisfactory. This article presents a philosophy of case selection mindful of factors related to the patient, operator and oral environment. The wrong treatment, however skilfully executed, may invite failure.","1455":"","1456":"DwSIs are an NHS initiative.

The literature is sparse regarding cysts associated with primary incisor teeth, which is surprising given the frequency with which these teeth are traumatized. Most cases reported involve molar teeth associated with apical infection following on from caries. A case of a 3-year-old boy who developed a large radicular cyst associated with a previously traumatized upper primary incisor is reported.","1461":"The use of in-surgery bleaching techniques has increased recently within the profession following the introduction of various new systems. Many dentists and patients alike prefer the in-surgery procedures to lighten teeth as it takes the responsibility for the procedure firmly away from the patient to the dentist; a situation with which both sides may be more comfortable. This article will review various in-surgery or power bleaching procedures. In addition, it will detail the procedure involved and how and when to combine bleaching techniques.","1462":"A 38-year-old man was referred by his dental surgeon with a painful swelling in the right mandibular sulcus and an ipsilateral numb lip. Dental infection secondary to caries was initially diagnosed but biopsy revealed this to be a Burkitt's lymphoma. After intense chemotherapy, the patient is still in remission three years later. This case is a reminder that malignancy should always be high on a clinician's list of differential diagnoses of jaw swelling associated with neurological abnormalities and prompt referral is essential.","1463":"Dental anxiety is a widespread problem and has a significant impact on the provision of dental care for the general population. Anxiety leads to avoidance of dental treatment and increased stress for dental practitioners. Traditionally, dental anxiety has been managed using pharmacological techniques. This article reviews alternative treatment approaches, including psychological and complementary therapies which can be used in managing dental anxiety and facilitating dental treatment. Many of these approaches are currently being used within the dental profession. Others are gaining a wider acceptance as to their usage. Where available, the evidence of their efficacy will be reviewed.","1464":"Although accidental inhalation or ingestion episodes are very rare, the consequences can be very serious for the patient, so it is important when the total number of courses of dental treatment performed each year are considered. This article discusses the causes, likely sequelae and management strategies adopted following such incidents.","1465":"A pronounced gag reflex can be a severe limitation to a patient's ability to accept dental care and for a clinician's ability to provide it. It can compromise all aspects of dentistry from diagnostic procedures to active treatment and can be distressing for all concerned. Many 'management' techniques have been described.

There are many non-vital bleaching techniques available, all of which have one thing in common, usually a successful result in the procedure returning the discoloured tooth to its original colour and beyond that when required. This article will give an overview of various home bleaching techniques: materials and regimens used, bleaching procedure and treatment of side-effects. In addition, it will review various in-surgery and at home techniques used for bleaching non-vital teeth.","1470":"The social and psychological development of children from birth to adolescence is described using the framework of Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. This theory proposes that children's understanding of the world proceeds through four broad stages, with each stage demonstrating an increasingly sophisticated understanding of concepts and how they can be used. The relevance of this development for children's understanding of oral health, disease and dental care is discussed.","1471":"Some people have a pronounced gag reflex that can be a severe limitation to their ability to accept dental care and the clinician's ability to provide it. It can compromise all aspects of dentistry, from diagnostic procedures to active treatment and can be distressing for all concerned. Many techniques have been described that attempt to overcome the problem. Dentists will undoubtedly see patients with gagging problems and knowledge of a variety of management strategies is necessary to aid the delivery of dental care. This first paper looks at the background to gagging problems and their classification and categorization prior to clinical treatment. The second article will look at the clinical assessment of the patient presenting for dental treatment with a history of gagging problems. It will also review methods used to manage patients with gagging reflexes during dental treatment.","1472":"Developmentally absent permanent maxillary lateral incisors may be associated with several problems. The decision whether to open or to close the space should involve the patient\/parent, orthodontist and restorative dentist. To optimize function and aesthetics, space should be opened using fixed appliances to accommodate an appropriate prosthesis. Implant-retained crowns offer several advantages, although adhesive bridges are more appropriate in certain circumstances. Removable partial dentures may be necessary in some instances. Where space opening is not feasible, practical or desirable, any residual spacing can be closed using fixed appliances and the permanent maxillary canines modified to resemble lateral incisors.","1473":"This paper describes developments in the field of dental local anaesthesia.

The reasons for the extrusion and success of the treatment are discussed.","1479":"This case report describes the use of autotransplantation as part of an orthodontic treatment plan where there was early loss of an upper molar tooth secondary to irreversible pulpitis. An impacted lower third molar, which had symptoms of pericoronitis, was transplanted into the upper left second molar socket. Fixed orthodontic treatment, to correct the patient's initial complaint of crowding, was completed in 22 months. The transplanted tooth remained vital and functional throughout.","1480":"Cemento-ossifying fibroma is an uncommon, benign lesion, which can lead to swelling and deformity of the face. This report describes an uncommon presentation of this lesion with simple and effective measures to diagnose and treat it.","1481":"Bonding to dentine is an integral part of contemporary restorative dentistry, but early systems were not user-friendly. The introduction of new systems which have a reduced number of steps--the self-etch adhesives--could therefore be an advantage to clinicians, provided that they are as effective as previous adhesives. These new self-etch materials appear to form hybrid layers as did the previous generation of materials. However, there is a need for further clinical research on these new materials. Advantages of self-etch systems include, no need to etch and rinse, reduced post-operative sensitivity and low technique sensitivity. Disadvantages include, the inhibition of set of self- or dual-cure resin materials and the need to roughen untreated enamel surfaces prior to bonding.","1482":"Periodontal research over the last 40 years has been remarkably prolific. We now understand that severe periodontitis affects approximately 10-15% of the population (representing a large number of individuals in the UK) and gingivitis and mild periodontitis affect a majority of people. Microbiological research has identified some of the key pathogens that are implicated in periodontal disease. Plaque bacteria exist in biofilms, which have evolved to protect individual organisms within the subgingival bacterial community. For this reason, root surface instrumentation (RSI) remains the cornerstone of periodontal treatment, and is necessary to disrupt the subgingival biofilm mechanically and reduce the bacterial bioburden. Although bacteria are necessary for periodontal disease to occur, a susceptible host is also required. The immune-inflammatory response that develops in the gingival and periodontal tissues in response to the chronic presence of plaque bacteria results in destruction of structural components of the periodontium leading, ultimately, to the clinical signs of periodontitis. The nature of the host response is determined primarily by genetic factors and environmental and acquired factors such as smoking. The host response is essentially protective in nature, but both under-activity (hypo-responsiveness) and over-activity (hyper-responsiveness) of aspects of the host response can result in enhanced tissue destruction. The purpose of this paper is to review current thinking in periodontics with special reference to periodontal epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis.","1483":"","1484":"","1485":"Cannon's disease or white sponge naevus is a relatively rare genetically determined skin disorder. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait that displays a high degree of penetrance and expressivity.

Initial presentation of the tumour commonly simulates odontogenic infection. Dental surgeons should maintain a high degree of suspicion for early diagnosis of maxillary sinus tumours. Appropriate use of CT scans and surgical biopsy is essential in the management of such cases.","1487":"Tooth transposition is a rare dental anomaly which is characterized by an interchange in the position of two adjacent permanent teeth on the same side of the dental arch. Tooth transpositions occur less often in the mandibular arch than in the maxilla and with less variety. Early diagnosis and detection of a developing transposition is based on both clinical and radiographic examination. When detected early, interceptive treatment may resolve the developing problem. This paper discusses a patient who presented with a mandibular permanent lateral incisor-canine transposition.","1488":"Since the development of the ruby laser by Maiman in 1960, lasers have been widely employed in medicine for a number of years. The purpose of this paper is to summarize potential applications for lasers in dentistry, with special regard to periodontology. This article briefly describes clinical applications of lasers and laser safety. Particularly, the use of a diode laser seems to be promising, especially in already compromised transplant patients, who need to be treated with a technique where the operative and post-operative blood loss, post-operative discomfort and the recurrence of drug-induced gingival overgrowth need to be kept to a minimum or eliminated. Therefore, the use of lasers in periodontology may lead to an alteration in present clinical practice and help to establish the best management strategy because, by maintaining periodontal health, the life quality of patients can be improved.","1489":"The role of Professionals Complementary to Dentistry is increasing in importance as new ways of exploring dental service provision are considered. Skill-mix and team-building are not just buzzwords, but signify the new view of a multidisciplinary approach in healthcare. Since the Nuffield and DARG reports of the last decade urged consideration of manpower issues within dentistry, the ensuing change from often small, single-handed practice, to larger team approaches has resulted in significant changes in service delivery. It is unsurprising that the bewildered practitioner can become lost in the mire of proposed new regulations. Outlining the current developments in the expanding role of PCDs, this paper illustrates the dynamic nature of the changes.","1490":"Exfoliative cheilitis is an unsightly and uncommon, chronic superficial inflammatory disorder that affects the vermilion zone of the lips.

The article presents two case reports detailing effective use of the swing-lock concept in removable partial denture design and it is hoped that this article will increase the awareness of practitioners to the use of this prosthesis type when planning removable partial dentures.","1494":"","1495":"Psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are commonly encountered in patients presenting to dental practitioners. The symptoms at presentation may not always be straightforward and, if not suspected and specifically explored, can often be missed. If unrecognized and hence subsequently untreated, this can have numerous adverse consequences to the patient and the health service. Hence, it is important that dental practitioners are more aware of the varying presentations, assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in their patients. In this paper, we focus on description of the common psychiatric disorders and their assessment from a dental practitioner's perspective. There is clearly a need for greater collaboration between dental practitioners and psychiatrists.","1496":"This report describes the case of an Afro-Caribbean lady diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia, who presented with permanent mental nerve anaesthesia as a result of a sickle cell crisis during childbirth.","1497":"This paper describes the restoration of an endodontically treated upper first molar with a fibre-reinforced onlay indirect composite resin restoration. The clinical and radiographic examination confirmed that the tooth had suffered considerable loss of structure. Therefore, an indirect restoration was indicated. First, a core was built with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, followed by onlay preparation, mechanical\/chemical gingival retraction and impression with addition-cured silicone. After the laboratory phase, the onlay was tried in, followed by adhesive bonding and occlusal adjustment. It can be concluded that fibre-reinforced aesthetic indirect composite resin restoration represented, in the present clinical case, an aesthetic and conservative treatment option. However, the use of fibres should be more extensively studied to verify the real improvement in physical and mechanical properties.","1498":"Mentoring and Personal Development Plans (PDPs) are educational tools that have been piloted in postgraduate medical education in recent years. Along with another educational tool, performance appraisal, they have been introduced nationally as part of the recent General Medical Practitioner contract of April 2003. In the light of the compulsory Continuing Professional Development and Lifelong Learning Schemes introduced recently by the General Dental Council for all dentists, mentoring and PDPs will surely have important roles to play in postgraduate dental education in the future. This article reviews the roles that mentoring and PDPs have played in postgraduate education recently.","1499":"In 1992, Postlethwaite wrote an article for Dental Update entitled 'Advances in fixed appliance design and use'. In the subsequent years there have been, as in most dental specialties, huge advances in materials. These have resulted in improved efficiency, convenience and simplicity in using fixed appliance orthodontics. This article is intended to be an update in these advances over the last 10 years.","1500":"An Index of Oral Health (OHX) was developed by Burke and Wilson in the mid 90s. Use of the index involves assessing patient comfort and satisfaction in addition to the assessment of caries, periodontal disease, toothwear, mucosa, occlusion and dentures, where appropriate. On completion of this structured examination, the clinician arrives at an overall oral health index (OHX) for the patient, which is expressed as a fraction of the maximum achievable score. The index was modified by Denplan UK by amending the calculations to produce the Oral Health Score (OHS). The Reproducibility of the OHX and OHS was tested at Birmingham Dental Hospital and School during 2001 and 2002 and was found to be satisfactory. The dentists' opinions on the OHX and OHS were assessed by means of questionnaires. Most of the dentists felt that both were easy to use.","1501":"The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance has resulted from overuse and misuse of systemic antibiotics. It is appropriate therefore to review periodontal treatment strategies to determine whether systemic antibiotics have a role to play in the management of periodontitis. For the great majority of patients presenting with periodontal conditions, systemic antibiotics are not indicated. Instead, treatment should focus on mechanical disruption of plaque biofilms, plaque control and risk factor modification. Systemic antibiotics may be indicated in severe spreading infections, some aggressive forms of periodontitis, and necrotizing periodontal conditions. These conditions present infrequently in general practice, most will require referral to a periodontal specialist and the decision to use systemic antimicrobials as part of periodontal management is more appropriately taken within a specialist centre. Systemic antibiotics are not indicated in the vast majority of periodontal conditions encountered in general dental practice.","1502":"Toothwear may have a multifactorial aetiology but is often localized to the upper anterior teeth. This is normally accompanied by a loss of interocclusal space. This paper aims to outline the management of localized anterior toothwear. It discusses several options available to create space for anterior restoration, with particular reference to the use of the 'Dahl' technique. Dahl described a non-invasive technique to create increased interocclusal space. The increased space eliminates the need for further occlusal reduction during crown preparation which is ideal in the worn dentition. This paper illustrates and describes the clinical applications of Dahl's original technique.","1503":"","1504":"There is a shortage of research from dental practice. The aim of this article is to stimulate more interest in dental research. This is done by explaining the basic principles of doing research in a dental practice setting.

This clinical scenario classically relates to changes found in the mouth following use of a maxillary complete denture that has opposed natural mandibular anterior teeth. While this condition was first recognized over 30 years ago, the associated difficulties still pervade the practice of prosthetic dentistry today. The purpose of this article is to describe treatment of two patients who exhibited clinical features of this condition, and review some of the relevant literature on this condition.","1507":"A case of diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis (DSO) in the maxilla of a 25-year-old male is presented. His chief complaint was recurrent painless swelling in the maxillary right molar region over a 3-year-period. The periapical and panoramic radiographs of the right maxilla showed diffuse sclerotic areas. Computed tomography (CT) indicated a high density area in the right maxilla. Although the tentative diagnosis was fibrous dysplasia on the basis of history, clinical symptoms and radiologic examination, the biopsy results supported chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. The maxillary location and the painless course of the lesion in a male patient is a rare occurrence.","1508":"Dentigerous cysts develop from unerupted and impacted permanent teeth. Very rarely, supernumerary teeth are associated with dentigerous cysts and constitute about 5-6% of all dentigerous cysts. Although these cysts are not common in the first decade of life, regular thorough inspection of radiographs is of importance, as indicated by this case report. This case shows how an impacted supernumerary canine developed a dentigerous cyst, engulfing the whole of the maxillary antrum.","1509":"The resin-bonded bridge (RBB) is a predictable technique that has a useful place in modern day dentistry. Practitioners' main concerns, regarding this technique, are a lower survival rate when compared with conventional prostheses, and unpredictable aesthetics. Unfortunately, the minimal preparation and adhesive concepts used with RBBs complicates provisional cementation. Ideally, the RBB should be assessed as if it were the definitively bonded prosthesis. It is possible to achieve a good final aesthetic result as the grey shine-through of the metal wing can be eliminated by the use of opaque resin cements such as Panavia 21 OP. Ideally, the restoration should be assessed with an identical opaque try-in paste but, unfortunately, such a proprietary paste is not available. This paper describes the use of Dycal as a try-in paste for provisionally cementing a resin-bonded bridge and the benefits this offers.","1510":"Images of patients, x-rays, study models, and general views of the practice and staff were often left to the more experienced photographer. Digital imaging has rendered the majority of photography possible for the General Dental Practitioner. Difficult lighting conditions were often a problem in the past, but these can largely be overcome with the facilities built into the latest digital technology.","1511":"The surgical management of patients on anticoagulant therapy is often poorly understood in all fields of medicine (not just dentistry). Until now there has been no uniform approach to managing these patients and much of the advice routinely given by medical practitioners and haematologists has fallen behind the recent evidence. Many medical conditions from atrial fibrillation to prosthetic heart valves predispose patients to venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (Table 1). In order to prevent these complications, these patients are normally placed on an anticoagulant. By far the most common one in use is Warfarin, which is a derivative of 4 hydroxycoumarin.","1512":"","1513":"","1514":"This article is intended as an illustrated, step-by-step guide in the use of the pedicled buccal fat pad in the closure of oro-antral communications.

It explains the advantages and disadvantages such methods give the specialist in treating full arch orthodontic patients over standard techniques used in modern orthodontics. Three different types of implant used in full arch orthodontic treatment are described in detail; the mid palatal implant, the OnPlant and the mini screw. The methods used in placing the implants and the techniques employed to gain the anchorage required are highlighted.","1516":"Fluoride varnishes have been available for over 30 years but there may be clinicians and dental public health practitioners who are unaware of the true level of effectiveness they provide in caries control. Under the headings of effectiveness, ease of application and safety the available evidence is digested and summarized to inform the reader about the indications, method of use and alternative options for caries control.","1517":"Three devices used to measure the range of jaw movement were evaluated: the Willis bite gauge, a metal ruler and the Alma bite gauge.","1518":"'Occlusion' is presented within the concept of the articulatory system, and guidance is given on how to avoid unplanned occlusal changes. When and how to examine the occlusion is explained, and this is expanded to cover the needs of restoring a patient to the 're-organized approach'. In addition, the merits of the different types of occlusal records are discussed. In order to avoid a lengthy explanation of the terminology in the text, a glossary is appended; any term that is defined in the glossary is marked by an *.","1519":"Digital imaging is ideal for producing images in General Dental Practice. Many of the techniques used with conventional 35 mm equipment are still good practice, though there are many additional functions available with digital cameras, and many other tools available on the computer. Making best use of the functions and tools available will enable the GDP to produce images suitable for most uses. Taking close-up images in the mouth can be challenging. Through digital imaging the exercise is easier and ultimately more achievable.","1520":"This paper outlines the current knowledge about the interaction between various groups of drinks and tooth surface loss. It begins by examining how the erosive effects of drinks are assessed in the laboratory and clinically. It then surveys the current erosive effects of various groups of drinks, including carbonated drinks, mineral waters, alcopops, ciders, beers, wine and fruit teas.","1521":"","1522":"","1523":"Many older practitioners who wear spectacles with multifocal lenses for surgery work have been told that they cannot use flip-up magnifying telescopes with these owing to the difficulty of positioning them over the appropriate part of the lens and therefore must resort to normal bifocals. They thereby lose the advantages of clear vision at all distances which multifocals give. This article describes a way of overcoming this problem.","1524":"Xerostomia is becoming more frequently encountered, often in relation to the use of pharmacological agents. This paper describes the management of a patient with xerostomia, both in terms of her dry mucosa and the difficulties in constructing new dentures.","1525":"The number of studies investigating aspects of the Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach has increased in recent years. This tissue preservative treatment approach appears to be less painful and is, therefore, more patient-friendly than conventional caries treatments. The investigations so far have shown that the ART approach is effective for the management of single-surface cavities in both deciduous and permanent dentitions. There appears to be no difference in survival results between single-surface ART restorations and comparable amalgam restorations in the permanent dentition after three years. The surface wear of ART restorations using high-viscosity glass-ionomers after two years is low. ART sealants using high-viscosity glass-ionomers are retained longer than ART sealants using low-viscosity glass-ionomers after three years. It is concluded that the ART approach is beneficial in improving the oral health of many, not only in developing but also in more advanced countries.","1526":"Oral tonsils (ectopic oral tonsillar tissue) are rarely remarked upon. They may cause diagnostic confusion, especially when found in the floor of the mouth. We report here two cases of patients presenting because of oral tonsillar tissue, to remind colleagues of its occurrence and the need to consider the lesion in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue nodules of the oral cavity.","1527":"Implants have been used successfully for the rehabilitation of edentulous adults. However, their use in children is limited because of the special problems of implants relating to continuing growth and development. This, the first of two articles, provides a review of the use of osseointegrated implants in the context of facial growth, and the role of the orthodontist in the management of implant-supported prosthodontic structures. A second article will discuss the role of implants in orthodontics in providing what has been termed 'absolute anchorage'.","1528":"The models of reflective practice and experiential learning, described within this article, provide the dental practitioner and his\/her team with realistic methods by which they can improve their skills and working atmosphere, and also reduce occupational stress. The reflective dentist is one who engages his\/her team in a process of discussion regarding a variety of clinical situations, and who learns from both positive and negative clinical experience. This article offers a detailed analysis of reflective practice and experiential learning, and the ways in which application of these procedures can contribute significantly to the continuing professional development of dentists and dental teams.","1529":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest form of dementia, closely associated with age, but also with other causative factors. AD affects half a million people in the UK, and presents dentists with numerous behavioural and clinical challenges. The aetiology, diagnosis and medical treatment for persons with AD are discussed, together with communication strategies and issues related to families and care-givers. Realistic dental treatment planning for patients in early, moderate and late stage AD is considered in conjunction with relevant ethical issues. Dentists have the potential to improve markedly the quality of life for people with AD.","1530":"Clinical photography has been used in dental practices all over the world for many years, although it has generally been the keen amateur photographer or enthusiastic practitioner who undertook clinical photography, often with specialized equipment. Understanding the equipment, and how to use it successfully, have caused many hours of frustration, culminating in an anxious wait for the results to be returned (or lost) by the processors.","1531":"Many dental practitioners do not use adhesive bridges because of concerns over high failure rates. Techniques for these restorations should be based on the fundamental principles of bridge design which require rigid, accurately fitting frameworks and careful control of the occlusion. The abutments generally require little if any tooth preparation. Greater security will result from more extensive coverage of abutment teeth: the routine use of relative axial tooth movement is a predictable method for creating the space that this approach requires.","1532":"","1533":"","1534":"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an auto-immune disorder of neuromuscular transmission which results in weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscles. The defect in neuromuscular transmission is most commonly seen in the muscles of the eyes, face, neck and shoulders but, in some patients, the respiratory muscles are involved. Patients with this condition may present with problems that necessitate special consideration when managing their dental treatment. Patients who are only mildly affected by MG can be treated in general dental practice for routine care. There are no contra-indications to the use of local anaesthetic agents and the presence of a vasoconstrictor is desirable. More severely affected patients and those who are very anxious about dental treatment should be cared for within the hospital environment. In these patients, respiratory muscles may be affected and, as a result, a myasthenic crisis may arise which requires assisted ventilation and, in some cases, intubation. Those patients who are fearful of the dental environment are likely to be emotionally stressed during such times and this increases the risk of a myasthenic crisis; sedation techniques can be beneficial in this group of patients.","1535":"Oral vascular lesions are of clinical importance to the dental profession because they pose serious bleeding risks. A case report is presented here where a patient with a complex palatal vascular malformation was successfully treated with fixed appliances. The problems encountered during treatment are discussed.","1536":"Osteomas are benign tumours of bone. They are uncommon in the jaws and usually present because of facial asymmetry or trismus. Osteomas arising from the lingual aspect of the mandibular ramus are rare and asymptomatic, usually discovered on routine radiography. We present two cases, and discuss their aetiology, presentation and management.","1537":"Supra-erupted teeth often lead to occlusal instability that can result in a poor appearance and make subsequent restoration problematical. This case report discusses the options in the management of supra-erupted teeth and presents a novel approach. The use of a direct composite platform to intrude an upper premolar tooth using the Dahl concept is illustrated.","1538":"Although apparently simple and efficient to use, removable appliances are no longer the appliance of choice for comprehensive orthodontic treatment in the permanent dentition. Their mechanical properties result in simple tipping of teeth, therefore multiple simultaneous tooth movements with apical control are not possible. It is for these and other reasons that removable appliances are usually only indicated for specific interventions in the mixed dentition, and as an adjunct to more complex fixed appliance treatment. Removable appliances, once popular because of their case of use, are no longer seen as the appliance of choice. This article discusses the rationale behind this statement and indicates cases suitable for removable appliance treatment.","1539":"The discoloured, non-vital anterior tooth is a common aesthetic concern for many patients. It can have a profound effect on their self-esteem, interaction with others and employability. Discoloured non-vital teeth are frequently compromised owing to previous trauma, caries, endodontic therapy and failed restorations. Destructive invasive treatment options are likely to weaken the residual structure of the tooth. This can reduce the prognosis and challenge the long-term viability of the tooth, thereby initiating further prosthetic predicaments. This paper discusses modern approaches to the treatment of discoloured teeth. The importance of preventing and eliminating the potential for discoloration will be highlighted. The paper will include a detailed technical account on the application of the inside\/outside bleaching technique, with several clinical examples.","1540":"This study assesses, by means of a postal questionnaire, the numbers of general dental practitioners who use clinical photography, and the uses to which this is applied. The questionnaire was distributed to 1000 randomly selected GDPs in Great Britain. A response rate of 76% was achieved. Of the respondents, 36% used clinical photography, with 65% of those using an intra-oral 35 mm camera, 18% a digital camera and 12% an intra-oral digital video camera. Principal uses of clinical photography were patient instruction\/motivation (72%), medico-legal reasons (68%), treatment planning (63%), and liaison with laboratory (43%).","1541":"Diabetes is a common condition. Its incidence is increasing. It can lead to medical complications including visual impairment, neuropathies, renal and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes can have an adverse effect on oral health and healthcare. Conversely, poor oral health can have an adverse effect on blood glucose control. Repeated oral infections can indicate uncontrolled diabetes and lead to its diagnosis. Whereas hyperglycaemia may occur in untreated diabetes, hypoglycaemic episodes are not uncommon in well-controlled diabetes Type 2. The tight glycaemic control required to prevent its long-term complications can be destabilized by infection, anxiety or missed meals.","1542":"","1543":"","1544":"","1545":"","1546":"","1547":"This paper presents a case of an anterior mandibular bone defect (synonym: Stafne's bone cavity, static bone cyst, lingual mandibular salivary gland depression) mistaken for periapical pathology and referred for treatment.","1548":"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease affecting the musculo-skeletal connective tissue of the body with a strong predilection for the joints. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is commonly affected with rheumatoid arthritis in adults and children, but it is usually among the last joints to be affected. A case report is presented of a patient undergoing orthodontic treatment who developed unilateral condylar changes and whose serum was also positive for rheumatoid factor. The involvement of TMJ in several systemic disorders is a well established fact. When such disorders manifest in an atypical manner, it poses a diagnostic dilemma. This article aims to discuss various disorders causing condylar erosions.","1549":"The purpose of this paper is to enable general dental practitioners to understand how to compile an evidence-based portfolio for the MFGDP(UK) examination. The principles of evidence-based portfolios are outlined. There are six key skills that a candidate needs to understand in order to complete this portfolio.

Specific advice is given on each key skill in order to complete the Portfolio.","1550":"Basic information relating to eating disorders (EDs) will be presented. After first outlining incidence, mortality rates and diagnostic criteria, the actual experience of living with an ED will be explored. Finally, various casual theories will be discussed as well as treatment principles and strategies.","1551":"The assessment of orthodontic provision is important to determine if treatment was necessary and undertaken appropriately. The ICON objectively quantifies orthodontic treatment need, complexity and outcome and is a valuable occlusal index in the assessment effectiveness of orthodontic care. It is possible to develop cost-effectiveness models by analysing the costs and effectiveness of orthodontic treatment. Several methods are illustrated to compare the orthodontic provision of specialist orthodontists.","1552":"A macrodont permanent central incisor tooth with unusual root canal morphology became non-vital 18 months following trauma. Two root canals were initially identified and filled, but the patient continued to have symptoms and radiographic examination indicated apical periodontitis. Careful radiographic and clinical examination revealed a third root canal, which was subsequently treated, resulting in the resolution of symptoms and periapical healing.","1553":"This article explores the various treatment options available to replace missing teeth with a fixed prosthesis. It discusses the requirements for each treatment modality and its associated advantages and disadvantages.","1554":"Practitioners have many techniques available for the indirect restoration of anterior teeth. There is some confusion, however, as to what preparation technique is appropriate for each type of restoration, let alone which material to select for the production of the restoration. This article considers the different types of preparation recommended for veneers and resin-bonded, all-ceramic and porcelain fused to metal crowns and gives an indication when each technique may be used.","1555":"","1556":"","1557":"","1558":"","1559":"","1560":"This article describes a technique for treating anterior toothwear.

Retention can be achieved via studs, linked bar system or magnets. Success rates using the different retention mechanisms have been reported to be high. However, long-term prospective studies on implant-retained overdentures are limited. This paper reports on a patient who has successfully worn a mandibular implant-retained overdenture with magnets for 12 years.","1562":"Root canal retreatment is often the preferred method of treating a tooth in which root canal treatment has failed. Part two of this two-part article discusses the rationale for root canal retreatment and practical techniques and equipment that are available to practitioners.","1563":"This paper presents a case report of a patient who showed severe oral and skin manifestations of acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, followed by a discussion of the approach to its differential diagnosis and management in the context of the dental setting.","1564":"A mild Class II division 2 incisal relationship is often associated with a pleasing facial profile and aesthetically acceptable arrangement of the teeth. Severe cases, however, have the potential to cause trauma and a number of older patients present with extensive soft and hard tissue damage. Management options may range from simple preventive advice to complicated surgical orthodontics. Detailed assessment of the case is paramount in developing an appropriate treatment plan.","1565":"Presentation of treatment plan options to patients in general dental practice involves the collation of information and its presentation in a clear and uncluttered environment. Visual aids are of value, as are effective verbal and written communications with the patient. Fees should be discussed openly, as should guarantees for, and limitations of, proposed treatment.","1566":"This article reviews the ingredients of toothpastes and their role in providing medicinal and cosmetic benefits to the consumer.","1567":"","1568":"This paper reviews certain structural aspects of the periodontal ligament. These include collagen (type, crimping and fibril diameters), ground substance (functions), cells (fibroblast morphology, cell heterogenicity and distinguishing of cell phenotypes, cell kinetics, 'foetal' characteristics), nerves (presence of neuropeptides) and blood vessels (presence of fenestrations). Attention is drawn to recent advances in our understanding of the development of the periodontal ligament, especially cementum formation, and in the presence of bioactive molecules such as growth factors and cytokines.","1569":"Thirty years ago the author set out the logical sequence of dimensional changes that could occur in the impression materials of the 1970s. In the 21st Century, it appears that little has changed and that what the dental practitioner requires today is the same as it always was--a forgiving material that produces perfect impressions with a minimum of trauma to the patient, dentist and technician.","1570":"Root canal retreatment is often the preferred method of treating a tooth in which root canal treatment has failed. Part one of this two-part article discusses reasons for failure of root canal treatment, case assessment and treatment planning. Part two describes some of the practical techniques that are available to the practitioner and the rationale for root canal retreatment.","1571":"A case of oro-antral fistula associated with an apparent foreign body following antral packing for a zygomatic complex fracture 10 years previously is presented. This was treated by antral exploration, removal of the antral contents and repair of the fistula. The complications of antral packing for zygomatic and orbital floor fractures are reviewed and those situations where antral packing may be the treatment of choice are defined.","1572":"The first paper discussed the clinical features of patients with hypodontia. A range of treatment options were considered with examples given. In this second paper, the implant treatment option for patients is discussed in detail.","1573":"In Class III malocclusion, the overjet is reduced and may be reversed, with one or more incisor teeth in lingual crossbite. In the early mixed dentition, and in older patients with mild skeletal discrepancies, orthodontic treatment usually involves proclining the maxilliary anterior teeth into positive overjet. When the permanent dentition has established, orthodontic therapy is usually aimed at compensating for the underlying mild-moderate Class III skeletal discrepancy by proclining and retroclining the maxillary and mandibular incisors, respectively. In contrast, adolescent and non-growing patients with severe Class III skeletal discrepancies require a combination of orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct the underlying skeletal pattern. Adolescent patients with moderately severe skeletal discrepancies require careful treatment planning because they are often at the limits of orthodontic compensation, and further mandibular growth may prevent a stable Class I occlusion from being maintained with growth. In this situation, treatment should be limited to aligning the maxillary arch, accepting that orthognathic surgery will be required to correct the underlying Class III skeletal discrepancy when skeletal growth has been completed. This article will inform dental professionals about the aetiology, assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients with Class III malocclusions. Specifically, the types of orthodontic treatment that can be completed at the various stages of dental development and skeletal growth will be discussed.","1574":"In this paper, the current knowledge about Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) is presented. MIH is defined as hypomineralization of systemic origin of one to four permanent first molars frequently associated with affected incisors and these molars are related to major clinical problems in severe cases. At the moment, only limited data are available to describe the magnitude of the phenomenon. The prevalence of MIH in the different studies ranges from 3.6-25% and seems to differ in certain regions and birth cohorts. Several aetiological factors (for example, frequent childhood diseases) are mentioned as the cause of the defect. Children at risk should be monitored very carefully during the period of eruption of their first permanent molars. Treatment planning should consider the long-term prognosis of these teeth.","1575":"A new Specialty in dentistry, Family Dentistry, has been established to provide a structured, co-ordinated training for general dental practitioners who are the major oral health service providers.

In the second part, implant treatment options will be discussed in detail.","1581":"This paper describes the case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with an asymptomatic large unilateral dentigerous cyst related to an unerupted 6. It was marsupialized under general anaesthetic, and subsequently resolved rapidly. The pathogenesis and aetiology of dentigerous cysts is discussed, together with alternative treatment modalities. This paper illustrates that a conservative surgical approach to the management of a dentigerous cyst in a child can be very successful. By preserving the associated permanent tooth, marsupialization minimizes any disruption to future dental development.","1582":"The problem of toothwear appears to be increasing in both children and adults. Recent developments in bonding and aesthetic restorations have added to the dentist's armamentarium for restoring worn teeth. Bonded ceramic and composite restorations offer the possibility of conservative restoration of teeth already damaged by toothwear. Despite this, concern still remains regarding the durability and clinical performance of these restorations. This paper reviews the currently available techniques for providing tooth-coloured restorations in toothwear cases.","1583":"A 34-year-old female attended the orthodontic department and was concerned with a midline diastema in the lower arch.

Comparisons are made between dentistry and other business fields to show how the profession has moved in line with shifts in societal attitudes.","1592":"Preventive dentistry has had a major impact on the prevalence of dental caries and, to a lesser extent, periodontal disease since the 1970s. It should continue to have a positive effect on the oral health of the community in the future. The factors behind improvements seen in oral health are many and varied but include changes in public health policy, technology and commercial decisions made in the industrial sector. As oral health has improved, and tooth retention increased, the focus of preventive dentistry has widened to include all population groups, increasingly including older adults, and to include a wider range of disorders. The major issues relevant to preventive dentistry which have occurred over the last 30 years are discussed. The authors will speculate on the impact that the prevention of oral disease might have over the next 30 years.","1593":"Future needs and demands for oral healthcare will, it is suggested, largely determine the forum, function and size of the dental profession. With the coming of age of the dental team and the development of an ever-increasing range of new therapies, materials, procedures and devices, new organizational systems will be needed to support education and training and subsequent lifelong learning. It is concluded that it is time for the dental team and its regulation to move on.

This paper will describe the steps involved in carrying out an occlusal analysis and adjustment.","1606":"In the fourth article in this series the techniques for carrying out pulp therapy and stainless steel restoration in primary molars are discussed. Early pulp involvement in primary molars means that pulp therapy and the use of appropriate coronal restoration, such as stainless steel crowns, are indispensable if repetitive restoration of primary molars is to be avoided. These techniques themselves are not difficult to carry out once the child's co-operation is established and should be well within the capability of any dentist with an interest in the dental care of children.","1607":"","1608":"To assist submission of articles to Dental Update in the correct format and thereby speed up acceptance of your article, Dental Update offers these guidelines for preparing and submitting illustrations.","1609":"The use of teeth as overdenture abutments is a common form of treatment.

Patients sustaining an injury to either of these nerves must be managed correctly, and this requires a diagnosis of the injury type and regular monitoring of the recovery of sensation. Surgical intervention for a damaged inferior alveolar nerve is not usually indicated but may be undertaken: if the nerve is completely divided and the severed ends are misaligned; if a bony fragment has compressed the mandibular canal; or if the patient suffers from persistent neuropathic pain. In contrast, after injury to the lingual nerve, if sensory testing demonstrates no neural recovery within 3-4 months, exploration of the injury site and microsurgical repair of the damaged nerve is indicated.","1612":"One hundred and forty one, 27-gauge local anaesthetic needles were collected, each following a single injection of local anaesthetic using four commonly performed local anaesthetic injection techniques. The needles were examined for needle tip damage under the scanning electron microscope. Ten unused needles were used as controls. Bone was contacted in 75 (59%) instances and, of these, 73 (97.3%) showed needle tip deformity. Of the four techniques used, bone contact was commonest with the inferior alveolar nerve block, occurring in 88% of instances.","1613":"There are many materials that can be used for direct-placement cores.

This article reviews the present role of the CDS, examines the type of people who make up the workforce and considers what a career in community dental practice can offer to new or recent graduates. Specialization in community or special needs dentistry is not an option at the moment. However, a number of appropriate training opportunities leading to further qualifications are highlighted and are becoming more readily accessible.","1622":"Patients are referred to hospital for dento-alveolar surgical procedures requiring supplemental corticosteroid administration. However, it has been reported that medically compromised patients who require routine dental treatment are being referred unnecessarily. This article reports a retrospective study undertaken at a Regional Maxillofacial Unit over a 24-month period, which reveals the referral pattern and management of patients specifically referred for outpatient dental treatment with corticosteroid supplementation. The paper highlights the dilemma confronting practitioners when reviewing the literature on corticosteroid supplementation and the confusion that still exists in both the primary and secondary care settings as to which patients should be prescribed supplemental corticosteroids. A simplified guide is proposed for the clinical management of these patients.","1623":"Aesthetic problems in childhood and adolescence can have a significant effect on psychosocial development and interaction with peers. Abnormalities of shape, size, colour and structure of the whole or part of the anterior dentition of children can lead to such problems. This article outlines the most appropriate options for the clinical management of different aetiological categories of aesthetic problems, and develops a hierarchy of intervention that should be pursued in a logical order until a satisfactory cosmetic outcome is achieved. These techniques are readily available to most dental practitioners and there is no reason for a child to have to wait until late adolescence for treatment.","1624":"Restorative dentistry is constantly evolving as a result of innovative treatment solutions based on new materials, treatment techniques and technologies, with composite materials being a prime example. The advent of fibre reinforcement has further increased the potential uses of composites within restorative dentistry.

Reconstructive techniques for maxillofacial injuries have improved greatly since World War II; however, the basic principles for the initial, early and reconstructive phases of treatment have stood the test of time. This paper gives an overview of the management of ballistic injuries to the face and jaws.","1630":"The natural dentition can be of fundamental importance to the prognosis of a partial denture when the teeth are within the same arch as the prosthesis. However, when the natural teeth oppose the edentulous area, a number of problems can present. One such problem can be the decrease of space for standard denture components. Solutions to this problem may involve increasing the vertical dimension or reducing the crown height of the opposing natural dentition. Both of these methods have significant disadvantages and this article describes an alternative solution using a 'striking plate' constructed in cobalt chromium.","1631":"Involvement of oral tissues by sarcoidosis is uncommon. We present a case of sarcoidosis involving the gingivae of a 60-year-old woman. The patient presents with an 18-month history of localized areas of gingival redness and swelling. She also has a previous history of sarcoidosis.","1632":"Amalgam has been used to restore cavities in posterior teeth for over 100 years, but formulations used today are different from those used a century ago. Amalgam restorations have been blamed for a number of problems, such as cusp fracture and higher rates of secondary caries. This article discusses these issues, along with possible toxic effects, in the light of current literature.","1633":"The clinical appearances of white sponge naevus may mimic other oral white lesions, including premalignant leukoplakia but, unlike leukoplakia, white sponge naevus does not have malignant potential. This article presents a case of an irregular white lesion on the oral mucosa with findings suggestive of white sponge naevus.","1634":"Personal Development Portfolios are established tools used throughout education in order to document and record learning and development, and their value has been generally recognized in the wider field of medical practice. It is proposed that they are introduced into general dental practice along with the support of suitably trained facilitators who could mentor practitioners and offer advice on their continual professional development.","1635":"Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, studies have demonstrated declining morbidity and mortality rates among people with HIV. This is largely because antiretroviral combination therapy can suppress plasma HIV viral load below detectable limits and cause gradual elevation in CD4 cell counts, resulting in improved immune status for responsive patients who are compliant with therapy. These drugs, however, are not without side-effects, both general and oral, and this review draws attention to some of the interactions of the drugs used to treat HIV infection with drugs used in dentistry.","1636":"Anterior open bite has multiple aetiologies, but can be broadly described as being dental or skeletal in origin. Accurate differentiation is essential in determining the appropriate treatment plan: dental open bites may close spontaneously in the growing patient and are generally amenable to orthodontic treatment, whereas skeletal open bites frequently worsen with growth and usually require a combination of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. The incidence of post-treatment relapse is high, making these malocclusions a challenge to treat successfully.","1637":"This is the first in a series of articles on paediatric dentistry in the new millennium. The aim of the series is to present a structured approach to the management of children and the common dental problems that are encountered in paediatric patients. Starting with the philosophy of 'quality care', as presented in this article, the series is intended to update readers on modern approaches to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological behaviour management, restorative techniques and the management of common developmental defects that present in both primary and young permanent teeth. Finally, preventive approaches that are easy to administer in a general dental practice will be discussed.","1638":"In the first of these two articles, occlusal terminology, techniques for examining the occlusion, articulators and interocclusal records were discussed. Here the authors consider some of the practical applications.","1639":"Halitosis (oral malodour or breath odour) is a fairly common complaint. Halitosis is most often a consequence of oral bacterial activity, typically from anaerobes. Occasional causes include systemic disease, and some patients have a psychogenic background to the complaint. The management is outlined in this paper.","1640":"The presence of unerupted teeth in close proximity to adjacent teeth can cause root resorption. The third molars and mandibular premolars are the most frequent teeth to be impacted and the relationship between impacted teeth causing root resorption of adjacent teeth has been well documented, but it is surprising how few studies have analysed the incidence of root resorption in these cases. This paper discusses two patients who have undergone molar root resorption due to adjacent unerupted impacted teeth.","1641":"This review examines a number of non-pharmacological approaches to the management of dental anxiety and its manifestations among children and young people. The article concludes with recommendations regarding the use of non-pharmacological approaches.","1642":"Academic dentistry offers a rewarding and varied career in which the practice of dentistry can be combined with teaching and research.

This disease is thought to be initiated by abnormal prion proteins. This article reviews the different clinical manifestations of human prion diseases and provides some background information on the biological nature of this unique infectious agent. Prion proteins present a challenge to infection control because of their relative resistance to the conventional sterilization process. This article highlights the issues involved and discusses current guidelines for management of patients with human transmissible encephalopathies.","1644":"Increasing weight is being given to applying an evidence-based approach to clinical practice. There is evidence to support a range of preventive measures which the profession and patients can apply to maximize the control of caries and periodontal disease. This paper examines the strength of evidence to support the advice and procedures that may be used by dental professionals to provide an effective preventive programme of advice and procedures for patients of all ages. A hierarchy of evidence is used ranging from Cochrane Reviews at the top, observational studies in the middle, and opinion at the bottom. Whilst the evidence to support preventive advice and procedures in children and adolescents is relatively strong, few studies have been conducted in adults and the elderly.","1645":"","1646":"","1647":"","1648":"","1649":"","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"This is the first paper in a two-part series reviewing some of the relevant theoretical aspects of occlusion and describing its application in clinical practice.

This paper collates and summarizes the experiences of applicants from one dental school, to inform debate and assist in the continued evolution of the process of application for vocational training.","1654":"The distal extension base denture may be indicated in situations in which the edentulous area to be restored is without a terminal abutment tooth. There may be significant challenges in providing a prosthesis with sufficient support and retention to make it comfortable without damaging the intra-oral tissues. This can be a greater problem in the mandible as the denture-bearing area is usually much smaller than in the maxilla. This paper considers how distal extension removable prostheses can be designed to restore edentulous spaces.","1655":"The oral health of prison inmates in England has come under increased scrutiny with the arrival of joint responsibility between the Home Office and the NHS for prison healthcare. This brief study indicates very high levels of oral disease amongst a group of prisoners attending for treatment in an English prison. Further study of the oral health of prisoners seems timely, as does the exploration of effective oral health promotion for this group of people.","1656":"Where there is extensive stripping of the mentalis muscle from the mandible during vestibuloplasty procedures the chin tissues often become lax and droop, giving an unsightly ptotic defect. If this soft-tissue defect is combined with excessive chin tissue an excisional surgical procedure is required.

This article aims to provide a background to occlusal indices and provide general dental practitioners (GDPs) with an insight into the use of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN), which it is understood may be introduced into the General Dental Service in the future.","1658":"The main disadvantages of resin-based composites (RBCs) for use in load-bearing posterior restorations include the polymerization shrinkage following curing and inadequate wear resistance in service. These properties are largely influenced by the monomer system and research is currently being undertaken to decrease polymerization shrinkage and improve resin wear characteristics in an attempt to increase RBC restoration longevity. The scope of the current review will identify the development of resin-based restoratives, indicating the reported advantages and disadvantages of resin types routinely used in dental practice today and review the most recent advancements in resin technology.","1659":"The delivery of oral hygiene advice is a crucial component of the management of patients susceptible to periodontal disease. However, the complexity of the issues surrounding such advice is frequently underestimated. It is not simply a question of manual dexterity; many factors influence compliance and motivation, including lifestyle, beliefs, attitude and understanding, and such factors need to be taken into account in order to effect permanent change in a patient's habits. This article reviews these issues and examines oral hygiene techniques and methods of assessment.","1660":"","1661":"This, the fifth and final article in the series, addresses the diagnoses and treatment of problems which may arise following provision of removable partial dentures (RPDs). These include difficulties seating the denture, pain and discomfort, looseness and functional problems.","1662":"This article reports the case of a patient presenting with dental erosion as a result of asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The management of this patient is discussed, in particular the use of proton pump inhibitors. The advantages and disadvantages of the use of medication are discussed, especially in the light of the symptoms of GORD, which developed after taking omeprazole.","1663":"Different types of splints have been used to stabilize traumatized teeth in children. Some of these splints have compromised healing of the teeth and associated dental tissues. This article considers the ideal properties for a splint and describes a method of splinting traumatized teeth in children that meets most of the requirements of an ideal splint.","1664":"Lasers have been used for hard tissue cutting in dentistry for a number of years. The quality of the cavity preparation and the surface finish achievable is variable and is dependent on operating wavelength. The collateral damage, which may be produced at differing wavelengths, is quite marked. Lasers in current form are now able to remove tissue in bulk at a similar rate to conventional methods such as bur and turbine handpiece. Some lasers may, however, provide precision cutting, which may be developed further in the future. Alternative uses of laser light are potentially more beneficial in the shorter term. The use of diode lasers as a means of activating a photosensitizer to carry out photo-activated disinfection appears to be beneficial.","1665":"In periodontal treatment the importance of self-performed plaque control is frequently acknowledged but often underestimated. This article reviews the evidence relating to the effects of good oral hygiene on both the initiation and progression of gingivitis and periodontitis, and on treatment outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that an optimal level of supragingival plaque control can have profound effects on the subgingival microflora and this, together with evidence indicating that root surface microbial contaminants are superficially located within the biofilm, has significant therapeutic implications.","1666":"","1667":"This article reports a project that was undertaken to determine current UK dental hospital policy with regard to the management of patients taking therapeutic doses of corticosteroids receiving dental treatment under local anaesthesia. There is variation in the medical management of this patient group, and whether practice should be standardized by means of a national policy document warrants consideration.","1668":"This paper discusses the past, present and possible future classification of periodontal diseases. It outlines the reasons for using a classification system from a clinical perspective and provides a critical appraisal of the latest classification. The major changes introduced in the 1999 system are discussed alongside the rationale behind the recommended nomenclature.","1669":"There is a wide range of careers available for the recently qualified dentist, and graduates need to know what the choices are and how a particular career pathway may be best accessed. Additional qualifications are often necessary; new graduates also need to be aware of the most useful postgraduate qualifications for their chosen path. Many young dentists would benefit from careers advice and should talk to colleagues working in the field in which they are interested.","1670":"The medical and dental aspects of management for patients diagnosed with snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea are well documented. However, guidance for treatment by the general dental practitioner is lacking. This article reviews aspects of appliance provision and presents the use of a silicone material in an attempt to improve the longevity of a recognized prosthesis.","1671":"The speed at which advances are being made in science has catapulted nanotechnology from its theoretical foundations straight into the real world. There are now many examples of commercially available products demonstrating that, in given situations, the technology really does work and that its scope for further application is wide. Healthcare, along with society as a whole, is facing a major revolution in the wake of ongoing technological developments in the field of nanotechnology. Dentistry as an individual healthcare discipline is not exempt, having already been targeted directly with novel 'nano-materials' at the same time as indirectly enjoying the benefits of nano-related advances in the electronics industry through the ongoing computerization of the modern practice. This article examines current practical applications of nanotechnology alongside proposed applications in the future and aims to demonstrate that, as well as a good deal of science fiction, there is some tangible science fact emerging from this novel multi-disciplinary science.","1672":null,"1673":"","1674":"","1675":"","1676":"","1677":"","1678":"In this paper, the author reviews the scope, and probable future impact, of information technology in dentistry.","1679":"Dental extractions or minor oral surgery in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for cancer in the head and neck carry the risk of one of the most serious and devastating complications of head and neck radiotherapy, that of osteoradionecrosis (ORN). A totally unified approach to dental extractions following radiotherapy is lacking. The role of the general dental practitioner in management of patients following radiotherapy is crucial. Contrary to clinical impression, the risk of ORN does not decrease with time. When contemplating exodontia or minor oral surgery in the irradiated patient, special consideration should be given to issues such as radiotherapy history, surgical assessment, surgical procedure and the role of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen.","1680":"Orthodontic treatment carries with it the risks of tissue damage, treatment failure and an increased predisposition to dental disorders. The dentist must be aware of these risks in order to help the patient make a fully informed choice whether to proceed with orthodontic treatment. This paper outlines the potential hazards and suggests how they may be avoided or minimized.","1681":"This paper describes an evidence-based clinical procedure that is suitable for the removal of fractured metal post fragments using ultrasonic vibration in general dental practice, particularly when non-resin-based cements have been used. Fragments of posts cemented with resin-based cements are likely to be extremely difficult to remove. The use of non-resin-based cements is recommended for luting posts, as fragment or total post removal is much easier with these materials.","1682":"Rapid prototyping is a technique for the production of solid objects from computer models. The variety of rapid prototyping devices and materials that can be processed is increasing all the time. In this paper, the authors examine the potential for the application of current devices to general dental practice and speculate on developments that could make this technique an attractive prospect within the dental surgery.","1683":"Removable partial dentures (RPDs) should not be made for patients unless they are necessary. Most partial dentures have the potential to cause some damage to the teeth and supporting tissues, however well they are designed and constructed; the criteria for selecting such devices were described in a previous article. In general there is merit in, wherever possible, reducing tissue coverage as much as possible when RPDs are being planned. This article, the third in a series on the prescription of RPDs, discusses the design principles involved.","1684":"This paper describes the examination, diagnosis and treatment of a rapidly enlarging tongue mass presenting in a healthy 12-year-old girl. This mass caused distress to both the patient and her parents and diagnostic uncertainty for her general medical and dental practitioners. The lesion was in fact caused by an orthodontic quadhelix appliance and responded to simple treatment.","1685":"The implant-retained fixed prosthesis has been advocated as an effective restoration offering significant benefits over conventional prosthetics. The success of treatment depends on careful pre-surgical planning and prosthesis design. This paper outlines some common complications encountered during the planning, fabrication and maintenance of both large and small fixed prostheses and suggests how these complications can be minimized.","1686":"Dental anxiety is a problem for many adults and children and for many patients anxiety acts as a barrier to treatment: avoidance of treatment, irregular attendance or attendance for emergency treatment only being typical ways of dealing with the problem. For the dental team a patient's anxiety poses major management problems, as an anxious patient may require more time for treatment, is very likely to miss appointments and may have raised pain thresholds. A major cause of stress for clinicians is the management of anxiety in their patients.","1687":"Lichen planus is a relatively common, often clinically distinctive, mucocutaneous condition with an uncertain aetiology. One variant of lichen planus is the so-called 'lichenoid drug eruption'. In contrast to idiopathic lichen planus, lichenoid drug eruptions, where practicable, may be managed by substitution of the offending drug. The dental clinician is in a prime position to identify these lesions and liaise with medical colleagues regarding their management. This article reviews oral lichenoid drug eruptions, emphasizing those aspects of relevance to the general dental practitioner.","1688":"The time at which orthodontic treatment should be started remains a matter of conjecture. Anomalies of dental development and functional problems tend to be addressed in the mixed dentition, while definitive treatment tends to be delayed until the late mixed dentition to maximize growth potential and patient compliance. However, some clinicians advocate starting treatment earlier in certain types of malocclusion. In this article, the current concepts of early treatment, both physiological and psychological, will be explored and the relevant indications and contraindications discussed.","1689":"Magnets are a popular method of attaching removable prostheses to either retained roots or osseointegrated implants. This paper reviews the development of magnets in dentistry and describes the different types of magnetic attachments that are available. The clinical applications of magnets in prosthetic dentistry are illustrated and future technological advancements indicated. Whilst different magnetic materials that mirrored the developing technology have been used, the main drawback to their use is the potential of corrosion of the magnetic material in the mouth. However, newly emerging technologies may provide a solution to this problem, allowing the continued use of magnets in prosthetic dentistry.","1690":"This, the second article in a series on the prescription of removable partial dentures, will deal with the issue of primary impression and primary casts for partial dentures. The principles of definitive impressions and master cast planning will be described.","1691":"The clinical presentation of root resorption varies between patients, and occasionally may be a coincidental finding on routine radiographs. Clinical symptoms may be absent but, if present, usually indicate the presence of pulpal disease. The treatment options are determined by the type, site and extent of the resorptive lesion: in some cases, especially where there is external resorption, extraction may be the only option. This article presents a case in which a misdiagnosis of root resorption was made on the basis of persistent clinical symptoms and a diagnostic radiographic finding.","1692":"The aetiological factors related to many dental anomalies are still uncertain. Clinical descriptive terms may be useful in communications. This paper describes a previously unreported case of dental anomaly exhibited as bilateral double teeth associated with a talon cusp. The clinical variants related to crown numbers and forms are also discussed.","1693":"The loss or fracture of porcelain from a crown or bridge may be viewed by patients as a dental problem in need of urgent repair. Resin-based and silica coating materials are available that demonstrate good bond strengths to metal and porcelain in the laboratory. This paper describes two cases in which a recently introduced silica coating system was used for repairing fractured metal-ceramic restorations. However, no long-term studies on the success of these materials in repairing fractured porcelain are available.","1694":"The use of topical desensitizing agents and the placement of superficial restorations at cervical margins are part of a conventional treatment plan for hypersensitive teeth. This case report describes a dental-phobic patient who employed a rather peculiar 'do-it-yourself' approach to alleviate the problems of hypersensitivity, by covering her teeth with a mixture of candle wax and 'household' glue.","1695":"Initially used to drill cavities in teeth, ultrasonic instrumentation may now be employed for descaling tooth surfaces, root canal preparation and in apical surgery. The probe tips used to perform these procedures are available in a variety of designs to enable easier access to different areas of the mouth. This article reviews the technology behind some of the present dental ultrasonic instruments and suggests ways in which that technology could be advanced.","1696":"In the first paper of this short series the principles involved in drug interactions and the influence of polypharmacy on dental local anaesthesia and sedation were discussed. This second paper will concentrate on interactions with analgesics and antimicrobials prescribed in dental practice.","1697":"This is the first article in a series on the prescription of removable partial dentures.

This is a report of a clinical audit that studied the periodontal assessment carried out at a large general dental practice in Shropshire, England. This audit was conducted over a 3-month period, analysing 700 patients for each audit cycle. A new protocol for periodontal assessment using the guidelines of the British Society of Periodontology was introduced. The results demonstrate a marked improvement in assessing the periodontal condition of patients in this general dental practice.","1702":"This referral policy and parameters of care document was commissioned by the Council of the British Society of Periodontology to provide guidance for practitioners, given the changing environment of primary and secondary care dentistry in the UK. These changes included the provision of the so-called 'high street' specialists in various mono-specialties and engendered a new paradigm of openness and information giving from the profession outwards. This was in turn necessitated by both dento-legal requirements and an increasing demand from the public for the provision of more advanced periodontal care. The promotion of periodontal therapy is both public and practitioner based, and by promoting periodontology to the general practitioner there is an inevitable knock-on effect to the patient base. Thus, in October 2000, these guidelines for referring from primary to secondary care were published so that GDPs could be given some indications of good referral practice, based upon the well-known tenets of the Basic Periodontal Examination (BPE). In addition, a number of succinct and relevant parameters of care were proposed, highlighting the need for the practitioner to not only examine the periodontium but also to make a diagnosis and effect a treatment plan and defined therapeutic goals using evidence based procedures.","1703":"Dental practice in the Northern Territory of Australia has to overcome a number of logistical problems related to the vast area and the low population density. The population is largely of Aboriginal origin and has significant medical problems including problems relating to dentistry. This article describes the present system for provision of dental care in this area, along with the authors' experience of a scheme involving co-ordinated care trials aimed at improving the health of the population.","1704":"Air abrasion, a pseudo-mechanical, non-rotary method of cutting and removing dental hard tissue, was originally conceived in 1945. After promising early clinical developments, the advent of the air turbine handpiece and burs resulted in the loss of this early technology to mainstream dentistry. However, recent advances in adhesive dentistry have called for changes to concepts in cavity design and preparation, and air abrasion has once again come to the forefront of clinical operative dentistry. This review explains the mode of action of the current units and discusses some of the clinical uses of this technique as well as potential pitfalls.","1705":"This paper heralds a new initiative to improve the rate of implementation of new and existing technologies within dental practice. The rationale behind the establishment of the Technology Transfer Network in Dentistry is described and the aims and intentions of the network are laid out. The relevance of the network to practising clinicians, scientists and manufacturers is described.","1706":"There has been much interest in the development of adhesive dentistry over recent years. Greater understanding of materials and bonding methods have improved the clinical predictability of restorations. Resin-bonded cast metal restorations can now provide a genuine alternative to conventional fixed restorations for both premolar and molar teeth. This paper illustrates the clinical application of such restorations.","1707":"This series of two papers considers the effects of drug interactions in dentistry. In this first paper, the principles of drug interactions will be described. In addition, interactions with drugs used in local anaesthesia and sedation will be discussed. The second paper will concentrate on interactions with analgesics and antimicrobials prescribed in dental practice.","1708":"This is the final paper of a four part series on the management of worn dentition.

Applying this direct technique in selected cases can simplify treatment planning and result in an acceptable restoration with pleasing aesthetics.","1714":"Anterior crossbite is a commonly encountered problem that is traditionally managed with removable appliances. This paper demonstrates some of the advantages of using fixed appliances to correct these malocclusions. In this case, treatment was completed more rapidly than would have occurred with conventional techniques.","1715":"Dental unit water lines harbour considerable amounts of bacteria, derived from the biofilm on their inner surfaces, and the continuous reservoir of bacteria carries the potential to infect patients and dental workers alike. This article reviews the different methods of control and provides recent recommendations for ensuring that water of satisfactory quality is delivered to the patient.","1716":"Extensively damaged teeth frequently require placement of a core before preparation to receive an indirect restoration. Dentine pins have traditionally been used to enhance retention and resistance form when coronal dentine is significantly reduced; however, pins are invasive and may produce pulpal or periodontal problems. Cavity design features such as grooves, boxes or retentive pits may be better alternatives. The choice of the core material may also influence the outcome although reliable research data are scarce. Large cores should be considered to have a structural role in supporting the final restoration.","1717":"Multiple sclerosis is a complex neurological condition affecting sensory and motor nerve transmission. Its progression and symptoms are unpredictable and vary from person to person as well as over time. Common early symptoms include visual disturbances, facial pain or trigeminal neuralgia and paraesthesia or numbness of feet, legs, hands and arms. These, plus symptoms of spasticity, spasms, tremor, fatigue, depression and progressive disability, impact on the individual's ability to maintain oral health, cope with dental treatment and access dental services. Also, many of the medications used in the symptomatic management of the condition have the potential to cause dry mouth and associated oral disease. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, and treatment focuses on prevention of disability and maintenance of quality of life. Increasingly a multi-disciplinary team approach is used where the individual, if appropriate his\/her carer, and the specialist nurse are key figures. The dental team plays an essential role in ensuring that oral health impacts positively on general health.","1718":"In the management of localized posterior occlusal toothwear, care must be taken not only in determining whether the worn teeth are restorable, but also the desirable occlusal scheme. Assessments of the periodontal, endodontic, and coronal tooth tissues, and the occlusal relationship are necessary for a comprehensive treatment plan for worn posterior teeth.","1719":"This article describes a pilot trial to determine whether the transmission of digitized clinical records of potential orthodontic cases supported by access to video and data conferencing may help to reduce the current high level of inappropriate referrals to consultant orthodontists in the UK.","1720":"Many methodologies are used during the testing of dental materials, although different tests are suitable for different materials and clinical situations. This paper discusses factors relevant to the choice of a dental material, and suggests questions that a practitioner would find helpful to ask a dental sales representative, such as ease of use, effect on the environment and the relevance of fluoride release.","1721":"A questionnaire-based study was undertaken to ascertain if patient preferences were being met in clinical practice by investigating patients' past experience of venepuncture and patient and operator preference for venepuncture site. Patients and operators expressed a preference for either the dorsum of the hand or the antecubital fossa as sites of venous access. Patients who expressed a preference for the dorsum of the hand were more likely to have received venepuncture in their chosen site, although the likelihood of venepuncture failure is higher in the dorsum of the hand than in the antecubital fossa.","1722":"This article reviews the causes of the crowding that commonly occurs, particularly in the lower arch, after eruption of the second permanent molars. Factors discussed include mesially directed forces, in treated and untreated subjects, distally directed forces, occlusal changes, direction of eruption, tooth morphology, periodontal forces, and degenerative connective tissue changes.","1723":"The sequence of factors that mediate pulp inflammation and necrosis are unclear, and controversy surrounds the effects of different pulp capping materials on exposed pulps. Clinicians have few quantitative studies that rank the in vivo pulp capping effects of commonly used restorative materials.","1724":"This article presents the case of a 46-year-old vegetarian who had a painful dry socket in the left third molar areas. Since the patient's general appraisal was anaemic, investigations for haematological status, folic acid and vitamin B12 were performed.

The seizures can take a variety of forms. Both the condition and its medical management can affect oral health. Prevention of oral disease and carefully planned dental treatment are essential to the well-being of people with epilepsy.","1731":"Confusion surrounds the pivotal role played by the remaining dentine thickness in a cavity in determining pulpal injury and repair response outcomes after restorative treatment. The multifactorial nature of the injury repair response requires that attention is focused on the most important factors, including remaining dentine thickness, to harness the natural regenerative properties of the pulp and to avoid postoperative treatment complications.","1732":"Sinus tracts of dental origin opening on the skin can be a diagnostic challenge. A delay in correctly diagnosing these lesions can result in ineffective and inappropriate treatment; however, if recognized early, the sinus tract usually resolves after appropriate endodontic therapy or extraction. We report a case of a cutaneous sinus tract secondary to a periapical abscess of the mandibular first molar tooth. The case was successfully treated by extraction and the sinus tract healed.","1733":"In this, the first of a four-part series on the restorative management of the worn dentition, the aetiological factors, diagnosis of toothwear and preventive measures are summarized. Later papers will deal with the management of localized anterior and posterior toothwear, the use of 'Dahl type' appliances as an effective means for the restorations and the various treatment options for the management of the dentition showing generalized wear.

This molecule is also important in relation to the mechanisms associated with inflammation and wound healing. The application of exogenous hyaluronan and hyaluronan-based biomaterials has been successful in manipulating and accelerating the wound healing process in a number of medical disciplines, as evident in ophthalmology, dermatology and rheumatology. It is conceivable that hyaluronan administration to periodontal sites could achieve comparable beneficial effects in periodontal healing and surgery, hence aiding treatment of periodontal disease.","1738":"Patients with acoustic neuromas commonly present with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus and unsteadiness. An uncommon initial feature is involvement of the trigeminal nerve. The unusual feature in the case reported here was orofacial paraesthesia, which preceded hearing loss by 3-4 years. Diagnosis was made following a referral by the patient's dentist.","1739":"Deep overbite is frequently seen in the adult dentition. Although the condition is usually asymptomatic, certain factors may lead to the development of deep traumatic overbite, and in partially dentate patients loss of posterior occlusal support may be a contributory factor. Several treatment modalities, including orthodontics, orthognathic surgery and prosthodontics have been used but, as some adult patients with this problem are unwilling to avail themselves of treatment involving either orthodontics or orthognathic surgery, a restorative approach using a combination of fixed and removable restorations may provide a satisfactory solution. This paper details a case report on the restorative management of a partially dentate adult patient with a deep traumatic overbite.","1740":"The exciting treatment possibilities arising from tissue engineering approaches are still some years away from involvement in dentistry. Meanwhile, it is important to optimize conventional treatments, although precise information on pulp responses to cavity preparation and restoration variables are limited. Odontoblast survival, pulp inflammation, and tertiary dentine area are used as measures of pulp injury and repair.","1741":"This, the second paper in a short series on gingival recession, discusses the various modalities of treatment for gingival recession and the indications for treatment. Special consideration is given to the surgical treatment techniques. Factors affecting the outcome of treatment and success rates of the treatment options are also discussed.","1742":"Professionals Complementary to Dentistry (PCDs) have varying roles within the dental team, from chairside assisting to the actual provision of clinical treatment. These tasks are closely proscribed at present, but this may change in the future. The modernization of dentistry, the introduction of registration for PCDs, the introduction of workforce development confederations responsible for funding and commissioning training of dentists and PCDs, and a workforce review looking at the whole dental team will all impact upon the working lives of dentists and their teams. These current changes represent an opportunity to improve the functioning and composition of the dental team, which should not be missed.","1743":"","1744":"","1745":"","1746":"The Dentistry Modernization Steering Group was set up to monitor, evaluate and facilitate progress in the implementation of the Government's strategy for the dental services. Information Technology was an important part of this remit and the report of its IT Task Group is summarized here.","1747":"Trismus is a problem commonly encountered by the dental practitioner. It has a number of potential causes, and its treatment will depend on the cause. This article discusses the primary causes of this condition and the various treatments available.","1748":"Most dental treatment, in most countries, is carried out in general dental practice. There is therefore a potential wealth of research material, although clinical evaluations have generally been carried out on hospital-based patients. Many types of research, such as clinical evaluations and assessments of new materials, may be appropriate to dental practice. Principal problems are that dental practices are established to treat patients efficiently and to provide an income for the staff of the practice. Time spent on research therefore cannot be used for patient treatment, so there are cost implications. Critics of practice-based research have commented on the lack of calibration of operative diagnoses and other variables; however, this variability is the stuff of dental practice, the real-world situation. Many of the difficulties in carrying out research in dental practice may be overcome. For the enlightened, it may be possible to turn observations based on the volume of treatment carried out in practice into robust, clinically related and relevant research projects based in the real world of dental practice.","1749":"Dental pain occurring whilst abroad may present the patient with a difficult decision: to try and bear it with self-medication until he\/she returns home or to seek professional help. This case report outlines a Korean girl's attempt at self-treatment, which resulted in not one but two fragments of a sewing needle wedging between her teeth, the second fracturing as she tried to dislodge the first. Her self-treatment exacerbated her problem and resulted in the need for surgical access to the site to retrieve the broken fragments. The case also illustrates the use of parallax radiography in determining the position of the fragments.","1750":"The 'dynias' are a group of chronic focal pain syndromes with a predilection for the orocervical and urogenital regions. This is a case report of stomatodynia (burning mouth syndrome) and vulvodynia coexisting in a middle-aged woman. The dynias are an enigma in terms of aetiology, which is multifactorial, making clinical investigations difficult and often requiring liaison with other specialties.","1751":"Coping with a hypersensitive gag reflex can be a cause for concern for both the patient and the operator. This report describes a case of blood phobia directed solely towards the oral cavity, linked with the inability to tolerate dentures due to a hypersensitive gag reflex. Management by hypnotherapy using a systematic desensitization technique allowed for extraction of teeth and permanent elimination of the gagging problem.","1752":"This is the first in a series of four papers aimed at understanding human pulpal responses to tissue injury, cavity preparation and restorative events. This article provides an insight into the exquisite regenerative potential of the dentine-pulp complex which underpins the success of restorative dentistry.","1753":"Gingival recession affects a large proportion of the adult population. This paper discusses the aetiology and mechanisms behind the formation of gingival recession, and considers the relevance of gingival recession to both orthodontics and restorative dentistry. It is followed by a second paper on the management of gingival recession.","1754":"","1755":"","1756":"Trauma to the permanent dentition, particularly the maxillary incisors, is common. Prompt and appropriate management can significantly improve the prognosis for many of these dentoalveolar injuries. Unfortunately, much of this trauma is left untreated. This paper discusses the management of children who present with intruded permanent incisors.","1757":"This article is intended to inform general dental practitioners about the background to clinical governance, how it came about and how the government has introduced it into the NHS. Because clinical governance is new in general dental practice, how it eventually becomes incorporated is still debatable, but this article attempts to describe ways in which practitioners can use it to their advantage. It explains how a cultural change is needed in dental practice to embrace these issues of quality and that issues of clinical governance have become a General Dental Service 'Terms of Service' requirement for all practitioners.","1758":"The advances in dental ceramic materials and systems continue to be related to improvements in strength, fitting accuracy and aimed towards avoidance of the use of metal substructures both in posterior and anterior teeth. Many of the changes seen within the last few years have been associated with modifications to, and improvements of, existing techniques. These are considered in this paper, and ceramic post systems are also reviewed.","1759":"In this electronic age there is a general move towards keeping digital records, and many trades and professions now use digital images exclusively. In this article, the advantages (and occasional disadvantages) of the use of digital photography, digital radiography and the latest development--digital study models--in orthodontics are discussed.","1760":"A wide variety of materials have been used for the restoration of primary teeth. Resin-modified glass ionomers and the more recently introduced viscous glass ionomers have been developed from conventional glass ionomer materials in an attempt to overcome the suboptimal properties of conventional glass ionomers. These materials would appear to have the necessary physical characteristics for restorations in load-bearing situations in primary teeth, as have the resin-based compomer materials, which now have well documented success rates in a number of studies. The first of these two articles described 'traditional' restorative materials, including amalgam and conventional glass ionomer, for the restoration of primary teeth. This paper describes materials derived from traditional glass ionomers in an attempt to overcome the suboptimal properties of conventional glass ionomers and resin-based materials such as compomer.","1761":"The previous paper explored the meaning of ethics, especially its relationship to dentistry. Here, we examine a practical application for solving ethical problems. Together, the two articles should provide dentists with a core of relevant knowledge about ethics and a ready guide to the daily relevance of ethics.","1762":"Orthodontic treatment appears to be in ever-increasing demand, but the number of specialists is insufficient to meet the current need. This article considers the role of the extended practitioner training scheme in the present climate of uncertainty surrounding orthodontics in the general dental services in the UK, particularly for the general dental practitioner.","1763":"In this paper, two patients are described who presented with trigeminal neuralgia which turned out to be an early symptom of multiple sclerosis. General dental practitioners need to be aware of the possible causes for atypical facial pain, especially in patients under 40 years.","1764":"The technique of using directly applied resin composite is increasingly being chosen to restore worn anterior teeth. This paper describes the use of a vacuum-formed matrix ('suck-down') to shape the directly applied resin composite, avoiding demanding freehand build-ups.","1765":"Osteomyelitis of the jaws is uncommon but can be a complication of extraction or exposure of teeth in patients who are immunosuppressed or have undergone radiotherapy to the head and neck region. We report a case of osteomyelitis in a patient who has osteopetrosis. The initial clinical presentation was that of an infected retained root, secondary to denture trauma to the supporting tissues. Radiological interpretation was difficult owing to the increased bone density and surgical exploration revealed only a dense region of necrotic bone.","1766":"This paper discusses the use of resin-bonded bridges as predictable restorations in general dental practice. The importance and relevance of case selection is stressed. Efforts have been made to discuss ideal design features, creation of interocclusal space and the need to carry out any tooth preparations. In addition, the clinical stages involved are outlined and a brief comparison with conventional bridges and implant-retained prostheses made.","1767":"The 2 x 4 appliance comprises bonds on the maxillary incisors, bands on the first permanent maxillary molars and a continuous archwire. The appliance is used in the early mixed dentition for treatment of both anterior crossbites and alignment of ectopic incisors. Four cases using this appliance are presented. This appliance offers many advantages over alternative techniques as it provides complete control of anterior tooth position, is extremely well tolerated, requires no adjustment by the patient and allows accurate and rapid positioning of the teeth.","1768":"Setting teeth for complete dentures is traditionally done away from the clinic in the dental laboratory. This has unwittingly given the impression that arranging tooth position is a mechanical process in which the clinician has little say. Many technicians are given few instructions, but a detailed prescription is crucial to the success of the denture. This article describes those considerations the dentist should address in communicating with the laboratory technician. A 'denture space' impression technique is described to assist the dentist in the correct prescription for posterior teeth placement.","1769":"This paper demonstrates how the treatment of primary dentition may present the clinician with increased difficulties compared with the preparation and placement of restorations in adult dentition. Established dental materials (dental amalgam and conventional glass ionomer cements) and less well established alternative materials (copper cements) are reviewed. The use of amalgam to restore primary dentition is the subject of concern amongst the dental profession in terms of lack of adhesion and potential toxicity concerns, while the low tensile strength of traditional glass ionomer cements make them less suitable for the restoration of primary dentition.","1770":"","1771":"The ability to use natural teeth on a denture can yield the most natural and pleasing results, helping a patient to adapt quickly to wearing dentures. A number of workers have demonstrated their success with this technique. This case study shows another example of how favourable the results can be.","1772":"Down's syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality and is characterized by certain physical, mental and medical features. A number of these features, such as learning disability, cardiac anomalies and an altered immune system, can have a profound effect on oral health and the delivery of oral care. In turn, this can affect social acceptability and quality of life. The optimum potential of the person with Down's syndrome is achieved via a multidisciplinary approach that involves the members of the dental team from an early stage.","1773":"Toothbrushing with toothpaste is the most widely used method of home dental care for the populations of the Western world. The traditional role of toothpaste is primarily cosmetic, in aiding the cleaning of teeth and producing fresh breath. Today, however, formulations contain ingredients which may also help oral health by way of reducing dental plaque and improving gingival\/periodontal health. This article provides a short review on the usefulness of these chemicals when used primarily in toothpastes.","1774":"The contribution of the oral care industry to the reduction in dental caries extends beyond the provision of safe and clinically proven products containing fluoride. The industry has contributed to the scientific base that underpins the use of fluoride, delineated factors that influence the clinical performance of toothpaste, raised the public's awareness of dental health and provided funding to support both undergraduate and postgraduate students in clinical training and basic research.","1775":"Oral candidoses are frequently encountered in the practice of dentistry. Although most oral candidoses are symptomless, the can indicate the presence of an underlying systemic disease, and the persistence of oral candidosis following appropriate conventional management may be one of the first signs of undiagnosed immunosuppression. The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is the most commonly isolated species from oral candidal lesions; however, the non-albicans Candida spp. are also implicated in the aetiology of oral candidoses. The effective management of oral candidosis is dependent on an accurate diagnosis, identification and elimination of any predisposing factors (where possible), and the prescription of either topical or systemic antifungal agents. Oral candidosis may have significant implications for the general health of immunosuppressed patients, particularly when caused by the non-albicans spp. and, in cases of severe immunosuppression, systemic candidosis can be life-threatening. This article outlines the clinical presentation and appropriate management for the commonly presenting oral candidal conditions.","1776":"With the development of clinical techniques that require high levels of manual dexterity and involve fine detail, there is increasing interest in the use of magnification for dental procedures. This article considers the potential benefits of magnification, the different methods by which it can be obtained and, finally, presents some caveats to its use.","1777":"The prevalence of tooth surface loss has increased in recent years. The essence of management is an effective preventive regime; however, in many instances restoration may also be necessary. A number of strategies is available for creating sufficient space to enable restoration and several techniques for restoration known. This article reviews the significance of the vertical dimension of occlusion and describes the restorative management of a patient affected by severe tooth wear.","1778":"With the increasing provision of orthodontic care in this country, certain practitioners have raised concerns regarding the use of elective extractions and retraction mechanics, especially the effects on the facial profile and the TMJ. The non-extraction versus extraction debate spans the history of orthodontics, and the concepts of facial attractiveness are subject to change as fashions change. Within the realms of evidence-based practice, there is little or no evidence to suggest that the philosophies and mechanics of contemporary orthodontics, in the vast majority of cases, cause damage to the profile or are directly linked to the development of TMJ dysfunction.","1779":"The prime aim of this series of six articles has been to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This final article considers what may go wrong following completion of root canal treatment, whether orthograde retreatment is possible and how it may be achieved, and if or when periradicular surgery may be indicated.","1780":"Aesthetic awareness of dental patients has produced a growing demand for posterior tooth-coloured restorations. This has led to the development of posterior composite resins and, more recently, posterior all-ceramic restorations. In the last decade, modern technological advances have allowed the production of stronger ceramics and better luting techniques, which have led to the use of all-ceramic restorations in posterior sites. The preparation guidelines for posterior ceramic restorations outlined in this paper emphasize rounded internal line angles and a chamfer or rounded shoulder finish-line.","1781":"Patients with cardiac murmurs may have a predisposition to infective endocarditis, and the dental practitioner must be aware of this potential problem. This article reviews cardiac murmurs and how they are investigated by physicians to assess their significance. Practical advice is offered concerning the need to refer patients with a suspected heart murmur. The emergency and elective dental management of patients with heart murmurs is included, together with recommended regimens for antibiotic prophylaxis.","1782":"The market for whitening toothpastes in the UK is burgeoning at present, but little has been published about the modes of action or efficacy of such pastes. Much is known about how the individual ingredients work, but toothpaste formulations are complex and there is potential for interaction. Studies have been undertaken to compare the efficacy of various test products, but these have used different types of trial design and consequently direct comparisons are difficult, not least because there are several ways of measuring 'whiteness', and there is no consensus of opinion between workers in this field as to the best way to record it.","1783":"Regenerative techniques have been clinically available for over a decade, although success in promoting new bone, cementum and connective tissue attachment has been limited. New understanding of the tissues involved in regeneration, and of the materials used to promote regeneration, have led to new advances. This is the second of two articles discussing new regenerative technologies with respect to their rationale and potential for periodontal regeneration. This article focuses on growth factors, and in particular bone morphogenetic proteins.","1784":"","1785":"","1786":"","1787":"Profound neuro-disability due to severe brain damage affects approximately 1200 people per year in the UK. Approximately half of these patients exhibit exaggerated or abnormal oral reflexes. Biting, bruxism and ruminating movements may result in dental or soft tissue trauma, with severe lip or tongue lacerations. This paper describes 10 patients referred to the dental department at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability with lip bites and\/or severe bruxism, during a 12-month period. Management options include: monitoring the lesion; smoothing teeth; providing a bite raising appliance; or extracting teeth. This paper discusses the difficulty in management of lip trauma in this group of patients and emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach.","1788":"Regenerative techniques have been clinically available for over a decade, but with limited success in promoting new bone, cementum and connective tissue attachment. New understanding of the tissues involved in regeneration and of the materials used to promote regeneration have led to new advances. This is the first of two articles that discusses new regenerative technologies with respect to their rationale and potential for periodontal regeneration and focuses on root conditioning, bone grafts and bone substitutes, and guided tissue regeneration.","1789":"This paper considers two new elevator and dental forceps techniques for the atraumatic removal of teeth to avoid a surgical procedure where possible. The techniques described should be applicable in relatively well defined but commonly occurring situations. The two techniques involve the unconventional use of conventional dental extraction forceps, with the aim of facilitating removal of the retained roots of certain teeth: the first for incisors, canines and premolars and the second for lower first molars. The term 'surgical forceps technique's is tentatively put forward as a description of these hybrid procedures.","1790":"Toothbrushing is a widely practiced oral healthcare habit which, in conjunction with fluoride toothpaste, can help to prevent dental caries and periodontal disease. The effectiveness of toothbrushing is dependent on many different factors including frequency and duration of brushing, rinsing habits and brush type. Knowledge of how these factors influence effectiveness will allow the dental professional to give appropriate advice.","1791":"The 1991 census of England and Wales estimated that the minority ethnic population was almost 2.95 million, or 6% of the total population of the UK. The aim of this paper is broadly to describe the oral health status and trends among minority ethnic groups to enable a clearer formulation of strategies to improve their oral health.","1792":"This paper presents a case study of a recreational runner who unwittingly has caused severe damage to her dentition through her lifestyle and dietary habits. It should serve as a reminder to all dental practitioners that dental problems occur even in patients who seem to be following a healthy lifestyle.","1793":"The aim of this series of six articles is to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This article first considers the possible reasons for persisting symptoms following preparation of the root canals. It then reviews the many and varied methods of obturating the prepared root canal system that are available to the general dental practitioner. By considering the objectives of their treatment, and their own level of expertise, readers may decide that one or more new techniques may benefit their practice.","1794":"The bleaching of teeth has encountered some legislative problems over the past few years but it is now possible to use both vital and non-vital bleaching techniques in the UK. Hydrogen peroxide has a long history of use and would appear to be safe to use to change the appearance of discoloured teeth. It is conservative of tooth tissue and may delay the need for more invasive veneers and crowns. This article describes some of the methods of bleaching using hydrogen peroxide that are currently available.","1795":"","1796":"","1797":"","1798":"This short series of two papers will examine the relationship between ethics and dentistry. The first paper explores the meaning of ethics; the second will provide a catalogue of primary sources for dental practitioners who wish to read further in order to gain a core of knowledge about dental ethics.","1799":"Bullying is endemic among schoolchildren, and the effects can be devastating and long lasting. The persistently bullied child appears to represent a certain psychological type, with poorly developed social skills and a submissive nature. Physical appearance does appear to play a role, which includes facial and dental appearance, although these tend not to be primary factors. Teasing related to dental appearance appears to be particularly hurtful. There is little evidence of a marked increase in self-esteem following orthodontic treatment in children, but in adults following treatment there is an improvement of body concept. The long-term psychological benefits of orthodontic treatment are difficult to measure but there is an increasing awareness of malocclusion with age.","1800":"Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder that displays considerable clinical heterogeneity. This case describes a 12-year-old girl who presented with a localized form of the disease. The consequences were a severe and progressive localized gingival recession affecting two maxillary incisors, a localized lip defect and scarring of the forehead. The case illustrates the difficulties in diagnosis and management of young patients with localized scleroderma.","1801":"This article discusses the use of speech recognition software by means of reviewing two leading packages. Both programs require considerable training before they can be used effectively, but are then able to convert continuous speech into text with varying degrees of success.","1802":"The minimal-preparation, resin-retained adhesive bridge may be considered to be an ideal choice of fixed prosthesis to replace a single missing tooth, especially in the anterior maxillary region. The technique is well documented, enjoys a high success rate, and with suitable case selection generally employs a conservative preparation. Other advantages include reduced cost compared with conventional bridges and simplified laboratory and clinical procedures. Its limitations are principally due to occlusal factors, or the presence of unsuitable abutment teeth--for example, those that are extensively restored. Another traditional contraindication is the presence of diastemas, which may limit the potential aesthetic gains. This paper presents a series of case reports which describe an altered technique in order to maintain anterior spacing.","1803":"Facing a civil claim for negligence or prosecution for breach of Health and Safety law is something that any sensible clinician wishes to avoid. This review discusses the main areas of risk in clinical practice and how such risks can be minimized when acting as a clinician and as an employer. Although orthodontic examples are used to highlight particular points, this paper is also relevant to general dental practice.","1804":"","1805":"","1806":"This case study describes the management of Callum, an anxious 7-year-old boy with extensive caries. Callum's dental care was carried out in a general dental practice in the North of England under the terms of the National Health Service. A preventive programme was carried out in conjunction with the restorative philosophy according to guidelines published by the Dental Practice Board in 1997.","1807":"Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is an iatrogenic clinical condition, which affects a proportion of patients medicated for conditions such as hypertension, epilepsy and the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Clinical manifestation can vary in severity from minor problems to complete coverage of the standing teeth. Drifting of teeth can also occur, producing further aesthetic and functional problems for the patient. This report documents a case of a renal transplant patient in whom drifting of the upper incisor teeth spontaneously resolved following surgical reduction of the overgrown gingivae. Clinical issues relating to the management of gingival overgrowth are also discussed.","1808":"In order to access the Internet it is necessary to open an account with an Internet Service Provider.

Each article starts with a brief scenario about the hypothetical patient and his\/her clinical problems. As well as the clinical problem, each case also raises ethical, legal or psychological problems. All of these issues are discussed and possible management strategies and treatment options investigated.","1810":"Successful restoration of posterior teeth with resin-based restorative materials requires the clinician to be aware of the factors influencing success. These include correct patient and cavity selection, correct choice of material, identifying a matrix system that will achieve a tight contact, and correct placement methods. A means of avoiding stress due to polymerization shrinkage should also be used.","1811":"Occlusal caries now accounts for most of the lesions in children aged 8-15 years. This paper presents a ranked visual scoring system for occlusal caries diagnosis. It relates the clinical appearance of the lesion to its activity, the level of infection of the dentine and the histopathology. The appropriate management for each score is suggested.","1812":"","1813":"","1814":"Pain is a complex and variable phenomenon that can be influenced by many factors. The neural pathways serving pain are not passive conduits, but are part of a dynamic system which can result in different levels of pain resulting from similar injuries under different circumstances. The passage of signals in these pathways may be inhibited or enhanced at almost any level, from the peripheral sensory receptors to the higher centres of the brain. This review will describe recent developments in our understanding of these mechanisms and how this knowledge may be used in controlling pain.","1815":null,"1816":"Mary' is the third of a series of four articles that aims to look at some of the problems patients may present with when they visit their dentist.

In order to make the case relevant, a single patient is tracked through her orthodontic treatment, surgery and final outcome.","1818":"For many years metals, whether cast or prefabricated, have been exclusively used to construct posts as foundations for indirect restorations. Developments in composite and ceramic materials have resulted in the introduction of metal-free post systems as alternatives. This article provides an overview of the systems currently available, gives guidance on their use, and discusses some of the principles underlying the clinical performance of posts.","1819":"This article describes the procedure for conducting a workshop for a vocational training group, using six clinical case scenarios harvested from the vocational training group's own experience. During the session, the main group (which includes trainers) breaks up into smaller groups to discuss the management of each case, then a spokesperson presents the management solutions back to the re-assembled larger group: further interaction and discussion then takes place. This article discusses six typical case scenarios from a recent workshop. The case scenario workshop is an exciting way to encourage discussion and interaction with all parties involved.","1820":"A case is presented of a 25-year-old man with a submerged lower second deciduous molar and an impacted lower second premolar. Treatment was complicated by the relationship of the teeth to the inferior dental nerve, which necessitated extensive bone removal and mental nerve transposition to remove the submerged and impacted teeth. Early recognition and treatment of the submerging tooth might have prevented the need for such extensive surgery and morbidity at a later date.","1821":"During the mixed-dentition stage of dental development, dentists may encounter patients with first permanent molars considered to have a poor long-term prognosis. In this situation, extraction of the tooth and space closure or use of the extraction space for future orthodontic treatment should be considered. The aim of this article is to give guidelines about treatment planning for patients who have first molars with a poor prognosis during the mixed-dentition stage.","1822":"This article reviews aspects of the probable mechanisms used by erbium dental lasers for cutting dentine and enamel, describes key issues of the risk of temperature elevation and speed of cutting relative to conventional techniques and looks at issues concerned with the safety of lasers.","1823":"Jacqueline's is the second of a series of four articles that aims to look at some of the problems patients may present with when they visit their dentist.

All of these issues are discussed and possible management strategies and treatment options described.","1824":"The application of multi-surfaced posterior tooth-coloured restorations is an exercise in risk tolerance when dentine occupies the bulk of the tooth substrate. Success with posterior tooth-coloured restorations is dependent on interfacial integrity. Although the literature is full of guidelines on producing aesthetically pleasing restorations, most practising clinicians appreciate that clinical success involves more than aesthetics: success is strongly dependent on operative competence. This article describes a number of innovative clinical techniques and discusses the probationary status of current adhesive options and the need for excellence in all phases of these demanding restorative sequences.","1825":"Many of the periodontal diseases affecting children and adolescents can be successfully managed in general dental practice. The decision to treat the young patient in the practice setting or to refer to a periodontal specialist will depend on the complexity of treatment, patient factors and the expertise of the practitioner. Treatment should be provided in three phases: the initial cause-related phase is aimed at controlling microbial plaque; the corrective phase is intended to restore function and aesthetics; supportive periodontal therapy is aimed at preventing recurrence and progression of periodontal disease. Even in cases requiring specialist referral, the dental team in general practice has a key role in the initial and supportive phases of therapy.","1826":"","1827":"","1828":"","1829":"Multiple myeloma is a disease characterized by monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells, the most differentiated stage of B-cells. Primary manifestation of multiple myeloma in the jawbones is rare. In the case reported here, a 29-year-old woman who presented with a right mandibular swelling after extraction of a mobile painful tooth turned out to have multiple myeloma. Current diagnostic criteria and management strategies of the disease are discussed.","1830":"This article describes the problems of snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea, together with an outline of treatment options. The Glasgow approach, whereby patients are investigated at a sleep clinic and a custom-made mandibular advancement device is made in semi-soft material, is also described. We have demonstrated the acceptability and effectiveness of a simple appliance in patients with varying dental states, some with simple snoring and some with mild to moderate sleep apnoea. Our experience relates to around 260 patients, extending over a period of 4 years with good success. The simple intraoral device is recommended as a first line of approach for patients with problem snoring.","1831":"This paper reviews the assessment of success and failure following endodontic treatment and highlights the fact that many referrals for specialist management of endodontic failure do not take into consideration established guidelines in this important area.","1832":"'Emma' is the first of a series of four articles that aims to look at some of the problems patients may present with when they visit their dentist. Each article starts with a brief scenario about the hypothetical patient and his\/her clinical problems.

All of these issues are discussed and possible management strategies and treatment options described.","1833":"The implant-retained overdenture has been advocated as an effective method of restoring the edentulous patient with an appliance that offers significant benefits over conventional prosthetics. However, the success and survival of such appliances have been shown to vary considerably, depending on which jaw is treated: implants supporting overdentures in the maxilla have a significantly higher failure rate. The restoration also requires considerable maintenance, which is both time consuming and costly. The purpose of this paper is to look at common restorative complications and maintenance problems following the placement of dental implants to support an overdenture. A number of implant systems have been reviewed and the results of the authors' clinical experiences with referred and their own cases are reported.","1834":"A number of periodontal diseases, some forms of which can be aggressive, can affect children and adolescents. Plaque is the key aetiological agent but local and systemic factors that can modify the response of the periodontal tissues to plaque may be identified from the history and during examination of the child or adolescent. Periodontal screening should be an integral part of the dental examination of younger individuals. It can be used in conjunction with the history and examination to reach a diagnosis, which then forms the basis for future management.","1835":"","1836":"A 7-year-old girl in the mixed dentition phase presented with abnormal morphology of the upper right central incisor. The diagnosis was a dens evaginatus, an anomaly of odontogenesis of unknown aetiology. This article describes the management of this anomaly and discusses the importance of maintaining space in the developing dentition. The aetiology and natural history of dens evaginatus are also considered.","1837":"The properties of dentine and pulp are closely related and from a functional standpoint these tissues are often referred to as the dentine-pulp complex. In recent years there has been considerable progress in our understanding of the physiology of the dentine-pulp complex. This review describes some of the advances that are relevant to clinical dentistry, including dentine permeability, dentine bonding, dentine sensitivity, the properties of pulpal nerves and blood vessels and the reactions of the dentine-pulp complex to operative dental procedures.","1838":"Occlusal splints are one form of treatment in the management of patients with a temporomandibular disorder. Appliances are often used in conjunction with other forms of treatment such as physiotherapy or medication. A variety of splints is described in the literature and the dentist must ensure that the splint prescribed is of a design that has a proven success rate for the specific diagnosis. General principles that apply to the provision of all splints are outlined in this paper.","1839":"The use of focus groups has become common in many spheres of research, including dental research. This article provides an update on the history of focus groups, defines focus groups in the context of academic research and highlights their possible uses. Practical advice is provided on the conduct of focus groups and ethical considerations are discussed.","1840":"Viral infections of the oral mucosa and perioral region are commonly encountered in the practice of dentistry. The accurate and timely diagnosis of such infections, coupled with the institution of appropriate treatment, can often permit quick resolution of the condition with minimal discomfort and anxiety for the patient (and carers) and prevent the spread of infection to others, especially immunocompromised individuals. This article outlines the clinical presentation and appropriate management of common viral infections of the oral mucosa and perioral region.","1841":"Iatrogenic root perforation is a procedural error that complicates treatment and can lead to loss of the tooth. A number of new instruments and techniques have been introduced into endodontic practice over the last few years to address this problem. The recent addition of the operating microscope to improve the field of vision has provided the operator with the benefit of magnification and enhanced illumination. Although there are few studies evaluating objectively the use of the operating microscope, its clinical application demonstrates the possibility of achieving more precise endodontic practice. The use of the operating microscope in the non-surgical management of a mid-root perforation is reported in this paper.","1842":"The single-tooth implant has found widespread support within the field of implant dentistry, with numerous studies reporting high success rates that surpass those recorded for splinted implant bridgework. Improvements in implant design, range of prosthetic components and restorative materials have made it possible to achieve optimal functional and cosmetic results. Coupled with an appropriate approach to treatment planning and patient assessment, use of the single-tooth implant may be considered a highly predictable treatment solution.","1843":"","1844":"","1845":"","1846":"","1847":"","1848":"","1849":"","1850":"","1851":"Class III malocclusions affect approximately 3% of Caucasians. Treatment options include; growth modification, dental camouflage and, once growth has ceased, orthognathic surgery. Originally, Class III malocclusions were thought to arise primarily from an overdevelopment of the mandible, but it is now known that maxillary retrusion contributes in up to 60% of cases. Maxillary retrusion is best treated with a combination of protraction headgear and rapid maxillary expansion, preferably before the age of 9 years. This article provides an overview of the management of skeletal Class III cases using protraction headgear with particular guidance for the general dental practitioner on when and how to treat.","1852":"Rhinoliths are calcified masses found within the nasal cavity. They are an uncommon finding and usually present to ENT surgeons. This article presents two cases where rhinoliths have been recognized in the dental setting, and discusses their management and treatment.","1853":"Dietary behaviours of minority ethnic groups vary considerably, not only between groups but also within communities and families. The aim of this article is to consider the information on diet and eating habits of members of minority ethnic groups, especially with regard to sugar consumption.","1854":"Salivary gland inclusions in the mandible are relatively uncommon. If defects occur they are generally unilateral, although bilateral cases have been reported. This article describes an unusual case in which the dental panoramic tomogram revealed three radiolucent areas in the mandible. The diagnosis of the two posterior radiolucencies was confirmed as Stafne's bone cavities but a definite diagnosis for the parasymphyseal lesion remained elusive, even after surgery. However, Stafne's bone cavities are known to occur in this region and this diagnosis remains the most probable.","1855":"The prime aim of this series is to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This article reviews the development of today's endodontic techniques and suggests alternative methods of obtaining a clean and shaped canal, in keeping with the varying requirements of practitioners of differing backgrounds and abilities, while keeping in mind the established aims and objectives of endodontic treatment.","1856":"Existing bonding systems permit effective bonding to enamel or dentine. Bonding to dentine is mainly achieved through the hybridization of dentine with resin. However, despite their success, the 'three-bottle' systems do have drawbacks--the large number of steps involved may be confusing and prone to errors of application, as well as being time consuming. Recently developed systems have significantly reduced the number of steps and the total treatment time, but deliver a reliable outcome.","1857":"","1858":"","1859":"","1860":"Traditional approaches to crown preparation for replacement crowns or teeth with short clinical crowns are often overly destructive of tooth tissue. Adhesive cements or composites combined with dentine bonding agents provide the clinician with some flexibility in treatment planning and should be considered when more destructive techniques would otherwise be necessary.","1861":"The causes of tooth surface loss are multi-factorial and hence can be difficult to eradicate. This paper identifies the problems that may be anticipated during the long-term management of patients where tooth surface loss has been treated using removable appliances, where the number of teeth is often reduced. Wear and tear are inevitable and patients should therefore be made fully aware of the possibility of the gradual deterioration and failure of restorative work. Treatments should be planned, which would enable the dentist to recover the situation, with minimal inconvenience to the patient.","1862":"The aim of this paper is to provide a guide for general dental practitioners who may need to prescribe medication to Muslim patients, particularly during the month of Ramadan. An understanding and appreciation of the patient's religious background will aid treatment compliance and allow dentists to provide a culturally sensitive service for their Muslim patients. Drug therapy compliance is important, but it is likely to be poor among Muslim patients during the month of Ramadan, when fasting and religious practices may cause problems. The authors provide guidelines on good clinical practice and prescribing regimens for general dental practitioners treating Muslim patients, particularly during Ramadan.","1863":"This paper considers the role of fibres in the reinforcement of composite materials, and the significance of the form the fibre takes and the material from which it is made. The current dental applications of fibre reinforcement, including dental cements and splints, fibres made into structures for use in composites, denture bases and the contemporary use of fibres in fixed partial dentures, are reviewed. Their role in biomedical implants is surveyed and their future forecast.","1864":"The prime aim of this series of articles is to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This, the third article, offers guidance and hints to ease the use of rubber dam, which should be mandatory for root canal therapy. It also considers the shape, position and extent of access cavities. The access cavity can make all the difference in success or failure of endodontic treatment.","1865":"Allergies to materials routinely used in dentistry are becoming more prevalent. The hydrophilic resin 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate is a common constituent of systems designed to bond resin-based restorative materials to dentine. It has been considered to have a high sensitizing potential, although dental patient-related allergies to the resin appear to be rare. This report presents details of a patient who has such an allergy, which, it is suspected, manifested as an intra-oral lichenoid reaction to the closely approximating anterior restorations.","1866":"Osteogenic distraction is a method of increasing bone length, and was developed by orthopaedic surgeons. It is now being used in the craniofacial region. This paper outlines some of the suggested uses: mandibular distraction can be used to correct hypoplasia and asymmetry in both children and adults; maxillary distraction can bring the midface forward, and holds potential for people with cleft lip and palate; augmentation of alveolar ridges and regeneration of mandibular tissue following tumour resection show considerable promise. The complex spatial dimensions of the craniofacial bones present considerable challenges for this developing technique.","1867":"","1868":"","1869":"","1870":"","1871":"Over the last two decades little progress appears to have been made in reducing the incidence and number of deaths associated with oral cancer. The most recently available Scottish data indicate a steady rise in both incidence of, and mortality rates from, tongue and 'mouth' cancer, supporting previous observations of a steady rise in the incidence of oral cancer since the mid 1970s. Very little improvement in 5-year survival rates for oral cancer has been observed in England and Wales and, over the last 30 years, survival rates in Scotland have actually declined. Although many dentists are committed to examining the mouth for oral cancer, the majority still feel uncomfortable with involvement in patient education. Clearly scope exists for dental practitioners to improve patient awareness of both oral cancer itself and the risk factors associated with the disease. Dental teams should be aware of the opportunities within dental practice to contribute to preventive initiatives--such as smoking cessation.","1872":"Over recent years the dental profession has shifted towards practising preventive dentistry and adopting more conservative and tooth-preserving procedures. Such progression is considered to be a response to the decline in the level of dental caries and advances in materials science. This shift in caries management will no doubt continue over the coming decades, based on rational clinical and scientific principles. Chemomechanical caries removal involves the application of a solution that selectively softens the carious dentine, thus facilitating its removal. This limits the removal of sound tooth structure, the cutting of open dentinal tubules, pulpal irritation and pain compared with conventional mechanical methods.","1873":"This paper describes the examination, diagnosis and treatment of a swelling that appeared in the floor of the mouth of a healthy 15-year-old girl. A sialith (stone) is not the first thing one considers when dealing with oral swellings in childhood but it does occur. Theories for its formation are described, as are the radiographic and clinical details of the case.","1874":"The aim of this paper is to highlight issues that may affect dental treatment and care of Muslim patients when they are fasting during Ramadan. Recommendations are provided on how to provide culturally sensitive oral health care for this community. By taking into account the beliefs and wishes of the individual, dentists will provide a service that is acceptable and appropriate to both the Muslim community and individual Muslims.","1875":"The aim of this series of six articles is to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This second article considers the accurate diagnosis of endodontic lesions, which frequently present as emergencies requiring prompt, rapid and efficient attention. The paper then presents the treatment normally indicated once a correct and accurate diagnosis has been made.","1876":"The content of treatment records is irrelevant if it cannot be understood. This is a report of a clinical audit project that aimed to assess the readability of records, and set standards to be maintained throughout the practice for handwriting and use of abbreviations.","1877":"This article discusses the effects of sex steroid hormones, glucocorticoids and insulin deficiency on periodontal tissues, and the possible consequences on periodontal disease progression. The androgens and oestrogens have predominantly anabolic functions in stimulating matrix synthesis, which is applicable to periodontal repair and medication-induced gingival overgrowth. Oestrogen and progesterone can contribute to pregnancy gingivitis; long-term use of hormonal contraceptives can accelerate progression of periodontal disease. Higher levels of circulating cortisol, associated with stress, can influence the onset of acute necrotic ulcerative gingivitis. Gingivitis and periodontal disease are reported to be more prevalent in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (periodontal disease, particularly in older, less well controlled subjects) than in non-diabetic individuals.","1878":"Conventionally, custom trays have been made in the laboratory on casts constructed from preliminary impressions. A spaced tray made in this way allows a uniform thickness of impression material of approximately 2 mm which is said to enhance the accuracy of the impression-taking procedure. A technique is described to fulfill this criterion without the need for a primary impression, by constructing a spaced putty custom tray inside the mouth.","1879":"It has long been known that fissure sealants are an important part of the prevention and control of dental caries in pits and fissures. However, their usage is still sporadic and generally not related to evidence-based guidelines. Caries prevalence has changed since sealants were introduced and this has significant implications for the criteria on which to select patients who would most benefit from their usage. The clinical technique for successful fissure sealant application is very moisture and operator sensitive. However, there is accumulating evidence that use of fissure sealants can be extended, given suitable investigation, to the early carious lesion as a 'preventive resin restoration'.","1880":"","1881":"This report describes the clinical presentation of three cases of vertical root fractures in adult patients where an initial diagnosis of localized periodontitis had been considered. Loss of the affected tooth occurred in all of these patients. The effects of endodontic therapy and the provision of post-retained restorations are considered in relation to their potential effect of weakening the root and predisposing the tooth to vertical fracture. The last case presents an unrestored molar tooth with a complete vertical root fracture.","1882":"Many types of cement are available for post cementation, each with advantages and disadvantages. For posts with adequate mechanical retention, zinc phosphate is a good choice for patients for whom fluoride release is not considered essential. Posts with compromised mechanical retention benefit from use of a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, which also releases fluoride. Composite resin cements should be reserved for rare cases where mechanical retention is so compromised that use of a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement provides inadequate retention. Great care is required when using composite resin cements to ensure optimum performance and avoid the creation of difficult-to-remove excess cement. Clinicians should be aware that posts cemented with resin-modified glass ionomer or composite resin cements may be difficult or impossible to remove if access to the root canal system is subsequently required.","1883":"This paper discusses the common problems involved in developing transcultural oral health promotional materials, and describes the best ways to avoid them. Translation errors and poor illustrations are by far the most frequently encountered problems followed by cultural incompatibility, inadequate information, and text and layout mistakes.","1884":"Acromegaly is an uncommon condition, with an annual incidence in the UK of three per million. The gradual onset of the clinical features mean that often friends and relatives are unaware of the underlying pathology. In view of the morbidity, and indeed mortality, arising from undiagnosed cases, general dental practitioners and other healthcare workers should routinely take note of systemic as well as intra-oral changes occurring in their patients when seen on review. The association of paraesthesia, anaesthesia and pain with acromegaly is well documented. However, there appear to be few reports linking acromegaly with orofacial pain or dysaesthesia. This paper describes two such cases.","1885":"The aim of this series of six articles is to improve the quality of endodontic treatment in general dental practice by considering what is currently being taught in dental schools. This first article considers the rationale behind endodontic treatment, what we are aiming to achieve and why. It looks at the dental and medico-legal issues which dictate the standards of our practice, and sets out the programme for the series.","1886":"Resin-based composite (RBC) materials are composed of principal and diluent monomers, fillers, coupling agents and other components. These materials have been developed in recent years to produce packable and flowable materials, and materials which may release ions under specific conditions and which may contain fibres. Materials which are organic-inorganic copolymers have also become available. Long term clinical trial data are not available for the most recently introduced materials.","1887":"Accidental injuries when handling sharp or rotating instruments can allow inoculation of a dental team member by the patient's blood or saliva. The risk of transmission of HIV from occupational exposure among dental workers is low and to date no occupational exposure has resulted in HIV transmission. However, hepatitis B and C have a high morbidity and mortality and are more infectious than HIV. This paper demonstrates how occupational exposures to blood and saliva could be managed in general dental practice and outlines the legal responsibilities of a dentist in the management of these exposures.","1888":"","1889":"The ADEE site serves as a portal to other educational sites around the world. The address can be book-marked and used as a focus to explore and use the Web in a constructive way without becoming overwhelmed with the large amount of information that is present. There are, of course, many other sites that act as a resource and contain links to other web pages. This site is simple to use, contains links to web pages that are of high quality and will prove useful to people wishing to update their current knowledge.","1890":"There are usually two orthodontic options in dealing with the peg-lateral. First, the lateral incisor can be extracted and the resultant space closed. However, this will often give a narrow unaesthetic smile. The canine is too yellow and the gingival margin is too high. The second, preferred, option is often to open the space mesial and distal to the peg-lateral and create a proper space for a normal-sized lateral incisor. The restorative dentist has to build up the peg-lateral to simulate a normal-sized lateral incisor.","1891":"This article is in two parts. The first describes recent advances in our understanding of the biology of oral cancer and the potential to utilize this new information to make better predictions about outcome and devise new treatments. The second part describes the clinical presentation and the development of a new generation of ultra-sensitive diagnostics to identify occult tumour and precancer, to investigate why cancer may recur.","1892":"This paper describes the electronic whiteboard, and discusses its potential as a clinical communication tool and its possible use in dental education.","1893":"A 46-year-old Asian man presented with hair growing from the anterior floor of his mouth. The diagnosis of this lesion was an oral choristoma of a 'follicular' variety. A choristoma is defined as an overgrowth of normal tissue at an abnormal site. Only one other case of this particular lesion has been reported to date. This article proposes mechanisms as to the aetiology of this lesion, and its inclusion in the classification of oral choristomas.","1894":"Take two dentists, whose practices are about as different as they could possibly be, who both have a healthy respect for root caries. Our paper will start by describing these two practices and then review the literature to show what is known about the management of root caries. The paper ends by returning to the two dentists, who describe how the research reviewed in the literature may affect their work.","1895":"This paper, with the aid of clinical examples, highlights some of the common occlusal problems that can be associated with maxillary anterior single-unit implant-supported restorations. The authors stress the importance of thorough pre-operative planning to identify any likely occlusal problems. This allows patients to be fully informed of the impact of any necessary clinical compromise and of the need for and nature of modifications to the natural dentition.","1896":"","1897":"","1898":"","1899":"","1900":"","1901":"Most patients with thrombophilia are asymptomatic. A case is presented here of a young woman with protein S deficiency, one of the thrombophilias, who required dental extraction. Protein S deficiency predisposes a very small number of those affected to life-threatening thromboses and emboli, for which they are required to take lifelong prophylactic anticoagulation. This report emphasizes the need to liaise closely with haematology departments when deciding whether heparinization is required for patients already taking warfarin. The role of low-molecular-weight heparins is highlighted, a brief review of thrombophilia is given and the management of patients who are taking warfarin and need dental surgery is discussed.","1902":"","1903":"The Chinese, a 'silent minority', are the most scattered, but neglected, community in the UK. Most dentists will have at least a few Chinese people in their community. This paper describes the health beliefs, dental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of the Chinese. Implications for general dental practitioners are discussed.","1904":"This article describes the clinical presentations of oral cancer, and the development of a new generation of ultra-sensitive diagnostics to identify occult tumour and precancer, despite seemingly adequate treatment.","1905":"Splinting periodontally involved teeth is a technique that has been in use for centuries. This article gives a brief history and review of the literature concerning periodontal splinting and outlines the rationale and indications for the correct application of periodontal splinting in modern dental practice. The common types of splint and clinical techniques involved are described, addressing some of the clinical problems.","1906":"In modern dentistry the primary aim when excavating carious dentine is to eradicate only the highly infected, irreversibly demineralized and denatured biomass in order to allow effective restoration of the cavity, restoration of the surface anatomy of the tooth and to prevent disease progression. However, the boundary between this superficial zone of dentine requiring excavation and the deeper, affected but repairable tissue is not always obvious either in the clinic or in the research laboratory. The inherent subjectivity in detecting this excavation boundary can result in clinically significant differences in the quality and quantity of dentine removed by different operators and makes the in vitro comparison of newer excavation techniques more difficult. This article discusses the rationale behind carious dentine excavation and the criteria available to the dentist, both clinical and laboratory, to help identify the dentine requiring removal.","1907":"The loss of anterior teeth can be psychologically and socially damaging to the patient the trauma of which can be minimized by immediate replacement of the teeth, preferably using a fixed prosthesis. This paper describes the immediate replacement of a lateral incisor using a fibre-reinforced composite with the natural tooth as the pontic. The abutment teeth can be conserved with minimal or no preparation, thus keeping the technique reversible, and can be completed at the chairside thereby avoiding laboratory costs. It can be used as an interim measure or as a definitive prosthesis. The advantages of this technique over other methods are also discussed.","1908":"","1909":"","1910":"","1911":"","1912":"Hypnosis is a valuable technique in patient management. With appropriate training, general dental practitioners can widen the treatment options they can offer to patients, especially those who are dentally anxious. This article provides a brief theoretical and historical overview, and a review of the literature pertaining to the clinical uses of hypnosis in dentistry.","1913":"A significant number of patients complain of discoloured teeth. The enamel microabrasion technique described in this article is a simple conservative method for improving the appearance of discoloured enamel.","1914":"This paper demonstrates how oral midazolam can be employed as an alternative method of behaviour management to general anaesthesia for the dental treatment of people with learning disabilities. A range of treatments, from scaling to root canal therapy, can be carried out successfully using the sedation technique outlined. The advantages of sedation include reduced morbidity and mortality. Treatment outcomes are also likely to be improved as root canal therapy and periodontal care can be carried out over a number of visits rather than a single treatment session under general anaesthesia. Oral sedation with midazolam should improve the scope of dental treatment available to patients with disabilities.","1915":"An 18-year-old male presented with symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. A panoramic radiograph revealed slight erosion of the condylar heads, and an incidental finding of multilocular radiolucencies in the zygomatic processes of the right and left temporal bones. CT scans were undertaken to exclude any sinister cause. The radiolucencies were shown to be extensive bilateral pneumatization of the temporal bones. Conservative management relieved the symptoms of TMJ dysfunction.","1916":"","1917":"Tooth substance loss, an increasing problem, may result from erosion, abrasion and attrition, often with more than one of these acting together. Investigation requires a detailed history and examination. The aim of treatment may be prevention of further damage in less affected cases. The treatment of severe tooth substance loss may be complex, especially in view of the reduced amounts of tooth substance which may be available and the need to find space because of the compensatory over-eruption of worn teeth.","1918":"As both humans and fungi are eukaryotic organisms, antifungal agents affect their cellular metabolism. Thus, a relatively few antifungals with minimal toxicity and side-effects are available compared with a plethora of antibacterials. These agents currently prescribed in dentistry belong to two major groups, the polyenes (nystatin and amphotericin B) and the azoles (imidazoles and triazoles). A newly recognized phenomenon known as the post-antifungal effect implies that antifungals, even at sub-therapeutic concentrations, may suppress the virulent attributes of yeasts, especially intra-orally where topical drug levels fluctuate dramatically during dosing intervals.","1919":"","1920":"","1921":"","1922":"Earlier diagnosis of oral cancer should lead to an improvement in prognosis. This, the second part of a two-part overview, is concerned with the various cellular markers available for diagnosis of oral cancer. Traditionally diagnosis has relied upon the histomorphological interpretation of a tissue section following biopsy. The application of advances in various laboratory techniques for the identification of different cellular markers is briefly reviewed. In addition, although it is currently only a research tool, the potential role of oral exfoliative cytology in screening is considered.","1923":"The General Dental Council guidelines regarding the use of general anaesthesia in general practice have changed; inhalation sedation with nitrous oxide has been shown as a safe alternative to general anaesthesia for many patients and is a technique particularly suited to the practice environment.","1924":"The successful management of labially unerupted maxillary central incisors requires a coordinated surgical, orthodontic and general practitioner approach. The key to achieving maximal eruption of these teeth is their surgical exposure, central to which is the philosophy that the surgeon must provide a functional width of attached gingiva on the labial surface. This case describes the incorporation of palatal mucosa into an apically repositioned flap, resulting in the successful establishment of an attached gingival margin, where routine flap design would have seriously compromised the eventual outcome.","1925":"The dental surgeon can play an important role in the early referral of malignancy of the maxillary sinus, and should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of disease of the paranasal sinuses. Here we report a case of a 71-year-old male patient diagnosed with high-grade B-cell lymphoma of the maxillary sinus that was initially thought to be an odontogenic infection. We discuss the signs and symptoms of lymphomas and malignancy of the maxillary sinus.","1926":"As the reliability of dentine bonding agents has improved, the clinical uses of these systems has increased and now include the bonding of directly and indirectly constructed restorations, amalgam bonding and treatment of dentinal sensitivity. Areas of potential use which require further evaluation include pulp capping and the attachment of fractured tooth fragments.","1927":"The ART technique was introduced in the early 1990s. It involves the removal of carious tooth tissue with hand instruments followed by restoration with an adhesive material (glass-ionomer cement). Local anaesthetic is not always required for treatment and the technique has helped to bridge the gap in the provision of treatment to rural communities, senior citizens and dental phobic patients. This article looks at the development of the technique, its performance and potential areas of application.","1928":"The advent of the human immunodeficiency virus and the increasing prevalence of immunocompromised individuals in the community have resulted in a resurgence of opportunistic infections, including oral candidoses. Despite the availability of a number of effective antimycotics for the management of oral candidoses, therapeutic failure is not uncommon. Further, the presence of many clinical variants of oral candidosis, both new and old, may confound the unwary clinician and complicate its management. These problems have been partly circumvented by the introduction of the triazole group of antimycotics, which initially appeared to be highly effective. However, an alarming increase in organisms resistant to triazoles has been reported recently. In this paper we provide an overview of clinical variants of oral candidosis. A second paper will discuss recent advances in the usage of antimycotics in the management of this condition.","1929":"","1930":"The incidence of oral cancer appears to be on the increase, with patients presenting at an earlier age. An overview of the prevention of this important condition is given in this article, and diagnostic markers will be discussed in a later presentation. Greater awareness of the aetiological agents involved in the development of oral cancer, and their avoidance, should help reduce the number of cases. General dental practitioners have an important role to play in advising patients on healthier lifestyles (primary prevention), the detection of potentially malignant disease before it becomes malignant (secondary prevention) and screening for field changes in patients with a history of oral cancer. The role of chemoprevention (defined here as tertiary prevention) is also considered.","1931":"The achievement of a reliable bond to dentine has been more difficult than bonding to enamel, due principally to the anatomy of the dentine substrate. The mechanisms of bonding are now much better understood than a decade ago and clinically-viable bond strengths to dentine are now achieved with many dentine bonding systems.","1932":"A study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of an information leaflet with a multimedia program in informing potential implant patients attending a dental hospital. The results show that both methods of presenting information are effective in informing patients; however, where the information to be presented is visual in nature, a multimedia presentation can have a more positive short-term effect than an equivalent leaflet.","1933":"Reports of clinical presentations of diver's mouth syndrome and prevalence of at least one of its symptoms in many successive Joint Service (JS) diving expeditions prompted the author (who is an advanced diving instructor and an Armed Forces dental surgeon and has been present on, or organized, at least six JS diving expeditions in regions from cold temperate to tropical) to construct customized diving mouthpieces and investigate their effectiveness during intensive use in the field.","1934":"This article is a brief guide to economic evaluation and dentistry. It outlines the most common methods such as cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefit analysis; discusses how and when they should be used; gives some dental examples; and outlines important issues that need to be borne in mind when interpreting them. It also corrects one or two common misunderstandings about economic evaluation.","1935":"Parkinson's disease is a relatively common, progressive, neurological disorder. Its key features of resting tremor, bradykinesia, akinesia, restricted mobility and postural instability militate against independence for daily living, mobility, good nutrition and oral health. The successful management of the disease requires a multi-disciplinary approach in which the dietician, speech therapist, nurse and dental staff are pivotal members of the care team.","1936":"","1937":"","1938":"","1939":"","1940":"","1941":"The application of proper infection control procedures helps to protect practitioners, patients and the community. The goal is to minimize the spread of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms and to remove and\/or kill organisms that have contaminated objects and surfaces. Dental practitioners are aided in this process by the generation of rules, guidelines and recommendations by regulatory agencies and professional organizations. Ideally, each office\/clinic would generate and maintain a written set of infection control procedures.","1942":"By far the most common causes of lumps in the neck are swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy is infection in the area of drainage (virtually anywhere in the head and neck). Most frequent of all is an enlarged jugulodigastric (tonsillar) lymph node, inflamed secondary to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes may also be a manifestation of systemic infection (e.g. HIV\/AIDS), or related to malignant disease in the drainage area (e.g. carcinoma) or elsewhere (e.g. leukaemia or lymphoma). These and less common causes are discussed in this, the last article in this series.","1943":"The single-tooth implant restoration appears to be an ideal method of replacing missing natural teeth in a healthy dentition. Most follow-up studies report a high success rate. The restoration is seen by many clinicians as a relatively straightforward technique easily adapted to general dental practice and popular with patients, although it is not without complications. The purpose of this paper is to look at common problems following the placement of root-formed endosseous dental implants. A number of implant systems are reviewed and the results of the authors' clinical experiences reported.","1944":"Over the years patients' attitudes towards maintaining a functional and aesthetic masticatory apparatus have improved, and their expectations of delivery of care by the dental professional have risen. With the advance of new techniques and materials, the periodontist can now offer an ever-expanding range of treatments in the management of molar teeth with periodontal disease. This paper considers such treatment in relation to the levels of disease present and within the overall context of adult restorative dental healthcare.","1945":"Experience is presented of the treatment of 100 patients for routine dentistry in general dental practice under propofol (Diprivan) sedation, delivered by continuous infusion. The infusion rates were set manually according to patients' responses. There were no differences in dental treatment or propofol requirements according to gender. Propofol requirements in some cases exceeded the upper limit of the recommended dose ranges and reasons why this may have occurred are discussed. A most useful feature of propofol sedation was the associated rapid recovery, with no patients needing to remain in the surgery for the purposes of recovery. The technique met with patients' approval, as all responses returned indicated a willingness to undergo the same type of sedation in future. Propofol sedation is not appropriate for the single operator\/sedationist.","1946":"This article discusses halitosis, and disorders of taste, orofacial movement or sensation.","1947":"A case is presented of a young boy with cleidocranial dysplasia, whose multiple supernumerary teeth prevented the eruption of most of his permanent teeth. His maxillary incisor teeth failed to erupt following removal of anterior supernumerary elements and orthodontic traction. Lack of abutment teeth and a difficult maxillary base made prosthetic treatment almost impossible. A horseshoe acrylic denture retained by milled crowns bonded to the deciduous canines and a maxillary first molar proved a very successful restoration. The problems of treating this group of patients are discussed.","1948":"This paper addresses the important issue of patient motivation. Research indicates that non-compliance is a major problem for healthcare professionals, with between a third and a half of all patients failing to comply with recommended healthcare instructions. The paper outlines some of the misconceptions associated with motivation and discusses six factors, together with some brief additional factors, which it is hoped will contribute to a deeper understanding of the subject and the improved dental health of patients.","1949":"Hemisection may be a valuable form of treatment for molar teeth when one root is considered unrestorable. However, following hemisection the clinician may encounter difficulty in restoring the remaining tooth fragment, which may not possess adequate bulk for the placement of a post. This case report describes an adhesive technique in which a ceramic crown is bonded intraradicularly to the hemisectioned root.","1950":"A case of intracoronal resorption in a recently erupted mandibular canine in an 11-year-old girl is presented. Possible aetiology and approaches to treatment of such lesions are discussed.","1951":"Facial attractiveness is now recognized as being important in situations as diverse as education, relationships and employment. An individual's facial appearance is one of their most obvious characteristics and facial disfigurements are judged to be among the least desirable 'handicaps'. A face which deviates from the norm becomes a stigma. This paper looks at the complex area of facial appearance and its importance in the field of dentistry. The relationship between facial attractiveness and varying forms of dental and surgical intervention are discussed, as well as some of the problems which may be encountered during treatment.","1952":"With the demand for orthodontic treatment increasing, it is inevitable that the practitioner will see a significant number of patients with previously traumatized teeth who require orthodontic treatment. The possible risks and guidelines for the management of these teeth during active tooth movements are discussed. The use of orthodontic appliances in the management of incisors traumatized during active orthodontic treatment is also discussed.","1953":"Most dental practitioners now routinely wear gloves while treating patients. The most commonly used types of gloves contain latex. Latex is also present in other personal protective equipment, such as masks, eyewear and clinic gowns. Increased use of such items, unfortunately, has been linked to adverse skin and mucous membrane reactions. Latex proteins and chemicals associated with the material's production have been implicated. Exposure to such chemicals has also resulted in allergic responses in dental patients. There is a strong movement in the USA to limit exposure to latex in healthcare environments, including dentistry. The aim of this article is to describe past, present and future efforts to create low-latex or latex-free environments.","1954":"Orofacial pain, the main reason why many patients seek dental advice, usually has a local cause--primarily the sequelae of dental caries--but a wide range of diseases, particularly neurological, psychogenic and vascular disorders, can cause orofacial pain. This article will discuss disorders that can present with pain and the neurological, psychogenic and vascular causes of orofacial pain. The first article in this series made several general observations on diagnosis and treatment which should be borne in mind in relation to the material presented here.","1955":"Temporomandibular disorder pain dysfunction syndrome (TDPDS) is the most common cause of facial pain after toothache. The symptoms are varied but are likely to affect the choice, intake and enjoyment of food. This has not been previously investigated. In this paper a preliminary study of 35 patients attending a department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at a general hospital is presented. Thirty-one subjects reported that eating was a problem; 15 prepared food differently and 24 considered that their choice of food was limited. Four of the five foods most often reported to be difficult to eat are valuable in the diet: meat (22), apples (20), bread (13), toast (7) and toffees (6). Twenty-three subjects reported eating a softer diet. Most (25) reported pain when eating. Such circumstances make it harder for TDPDS sufferers to meet current nutritional guidelines, especially, perhaps, for some to achieve an adequate intake of iron.","1956":"Domiciliary dental care is an important and growing area of treatment provision. However, adequate training is required in order to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to perform such care. This article draws attention to the likely increase in demand for domiciliary dental care services and the reasons for it; and highlights the issues and skills involved for dentists, hygienists and their teams in providing domiciliary dental care in order to facilitate quality of care and safe practice.","1957":"It is sometimes necessary to construct temporary covers on labial veneer preparations. A modification of an existing technique for making temporary veneers is described that employs the advantages of transparent registration material.","1958":"Intentional replantation has been practised for many years as a treatment modality for pulpless teeth. Although the success ratio for intentional replantation is far below that for routine or surgical endodontics, one should consider this procedure as an alternative to tooth extraction. Two cases of mandibular second molars which were treated with intentional replantation and retrograde fillings are reported in this article. At the 5-year recall visit, the radiographs showed no evidence of pathological changes.","1959":"Oral cancer continues to be a serious problem in the UK and it is well known that prevention and early recognition of potentially malignant lesions will provide the best prognosis. This article discusses recent changes in the nomenclature of lesions and current concepts in diagnosis and management.","1960":"A vaccine against dental caries, for so long a subject of purely academic research, is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials and could be available commercially within 5 to 6 years. The approach, which is safe, effective, and provides long-term protection for up to a year, is based on a topical application and does not require any injections. The development of this vaccine has been made possible by recent advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering. Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects has been the use of green plants to produce the vaccine. This article describes a topical vaccine against Streptococcus mutans, which is the main cause of dental caries.","1961":"Certain lesions are exclusively or typically found in specific sites. This article discusses in detail conditions that occur mostly on the palate or gingivae.","1962":"The government has recently changed its policy on dental registration. There is now a requirement to attend a dentist within 15 months of the previous appointment or dental registration will lapse. The authors of this article undertook a survey of the patients attending for dental treatment at the accident and emergency department of their hospital to ascertain whether inappropriate attendance was due to ignorance about general dental services. Of the 501 respondents 14% had not seen their general dental practitioner within the last 15 months and were therefore no longer registered--only 21% realized that they had to keep regular appointments or dental registration would lapse. A proportion (30%) had tried to contact the dentist outside normal working hours; 27% of these were unhappy with the outcome. Telephone calls were unanswered in 38% of those expressing dissatisfaction and 45% subsequently attended hospital for treatment.","1963":"Hypodontia is the congenital absence of one or more teeth because of agenesis. The most commonly missing teeth are the third molars, the maxillary lateral incisors and the second premolars. Cases are presented of three patients with a missing mandibular incisor.","1964":"The management of submerged deciduous teeth can present a dilemma for general practitioner and specialist alike. These teeth are often extracted to avoid potential problems. The recent literature, mainly publications in specialist journals of paediatric dentistry and orthodontics, suggests that a conservative approach is often preferable, particularly when the permanent successor is present. The purpose of this article is to review the aetiology, diagnosis and potential consequences of submerging deciduous molars; a second paper will discuss the treatment options available.","1965":"Some patients suffer from conditions that make holding toothbrushes difficult, if not impossible. This article describes a quick, simple and flexible method of adapting toothbrush handles to allow patients the best possible chance of performing adequate oral care.","1966":"Enamel hypoplasia is a common condition that may present a severe aesthetic problem. Although the teeth affected may not be particularly susceptible to caries, patients may request cosmetic improvement. Adhesive techniques may be useful in such situations. This paper discusses the management of a patient with enamel hypoplasia using a combination of adhesive systems including enamel- and dentine-bonded veneers, dentine-bonded crowns, a cantilever resin-retained bridge, bonded amalgam restorations and chairside tin plating. Where adhesion was contraindicated, conventionally retained crowns were used.","1967":"Fear of dental treatment constitutes one of the major obstacles to receiving dental treatment, in both the UK and the USA. Treatment for such fear can be pharmacological or psychological, or a combination of both. In this article the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of dental fear will be described and the treatment methods compared.","1968":"This article discusses coloured lesions of the orofacial region.","1969":"Cystic change can occur in association with partially and unerupted lower third molars. This case report describes an inflammatory paradental cyst which developed over a relatively short period of time and presented with acute symptoms.","1970":"Sinus on the chin can be the result of a chronic apical abscess due to pulp necrosis of a mandibular anterior tooth. The tooth is usually asymptomatic, and a dental cause is therefore not apparent to the patient or the unsuspecting clinician. Not infrequently, the patient may seek treatment from a dermatologist or general surgeon instead of a dentist. Excision and repair of the fistula may be carried out with subsequent breakdown because the dental pathology is not removed. This paper reports the presence of median mental sinus of dental origin in twins. One case healed following root canal therapy while the other required both root canal therapy and surgery to eliminate the infection.","1971":"Tetracycline staining of teeth during tooth development is well documented. We report here the rarer condition of tetracycline staining of adult teeth. This occurrence appears to involve enamel surface demineralization\/remineralization and can produce staining clinically indistinguishable from that occurring during tooth development.","1972":"The rehabilitation of fractured teeth may create problems for both patient and clinician. This paper updates the reader on the many factors that have been implicated in the aetiology of fractures, so highlighting a preventive rather than curative perspective to clinical dentistry.","1973":"The need to record clinical images, for use in documenting treatments, patient education, patient contracting, referral letters and sharing information with colleagues, is increasing. This article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of 35 mm and digital photography.","1974":"This article seeks to aid the busy dentist by providing a basic guide to treating fractured and traumatized primary teeth and soft tissues. Simple guidelines for a step-by-step approach to the efficient care of traumatized primary teeth are given.","1975":"Certain lesions are exclusively or typically found in specific sites; these are discussed in this and the next two articles in this series.","1976":"The creation of a natural-looking ceramic crown which blends harmoniously with the surrounding dentition is not merely a matter of recording a shade. The subtleties of colour, translucency, discrete staining, texture, lustre and shape are all essential features. Accurate shade taking and correct tooth preparation are all necessary elements but are of little value if the information cannot be precisely communicated to the technician.","1977":"Functional appliances are frequently used in the treatment of Class II division 1 malocclusions, either in isolation or, more commonly, before a course of fixed appliance therapy. Extensive speculation and investigation into the precise mode of action of these appliances has recently focused on their growth-restraining effect on the maxilla, their growth-enhancing effect on the mandible and dentoalveolar and soft tissue effects. The different types of functional appliances are described in this article, with emphasis placed on practitioners adopting a component approach to design. A checklist is provided to aid identification of the more common problems occurring during treatment.","1978":"Methods of exposing impacted teeth in order to bring them into the line of the arch include gingivectomy, the apically repositioned flap and closed eruption techniques. These procedures aim to facilitate the eruption of the impacted tooth with a minimum of disruption or damage to the tooth itself or adjacent structures. The aim of this paper is to discuss the various surgical methods of exposing impacted teeth and to help to identify where the use of the apically repositioned flap is indicated. Clinical examples are presented and a surgical method for carrying out this procedure recommended.","1979":"The conservation of teeth can involve the many facets of restorative dentistry in an attempt to retain both functional and aesthetic demands. This case report chronicles the management of a patient presenting with several traumatized teeth, which progressed through orthograde endodontics, periodontal crown-lengthening procedures, crown placement, surgical endodontics with attempted guided tissue regeneration, to eventual tooth extraction and replacement with osseointegrated implants.","1980":"The adverse consequences of smoking on both general and oral health are well recognized. It is now accepted that brief advice from a healthcare professional is an effective aid to stopping smoking and recently interest has focused on the role of the dental team in this area. This paper provides an update on current concepts of how smokers give up and makes practical suggestions as to how smoking may be discussed in the dental clinic.","1981":"This article discusses the more common conditions presenting with orofacial lumps or swellings. The first article in this series presented several general observations on diagnosis and treatment which should be borne in mind in relation to this article.","1982":"A case is presented of root resorption of the lower right first permanent molar caused by a supernumerary premolar tooth. The first permanent molar was subsequently extracted.","1983":"Currently two-thirds of European countries employ orthodontic auxiliaries and the UK is therefore unusual in not permitting their use. There is support from the orthodontic specialty for the concept of delegating routine intra-oral tasks to auxiliary personnel. The following describes a pilot project undertaken to determine the possible training structure for orthodontic auxiliaries. The modular course, which took place over a period of 4 weeks, is described and the results and implications are discussed.","1984":"An increasing number of patients with complete dentures are requesting improvements in the aesthetics of their dentures. This paper considers methods of improving aesthetics, using the information available from the existing complete dentures, pre-extraction records and resin stains.","1985":"Periodontal disease result from mixed bacterial infections, in which both host resistance barriers and bacterial interactions are important. Approximately ten bacterial species are strongly implicated with various forms of periodontal disease, although species that cannot yet be cultivated are likely also to be relevant. New technologies have shown that pathogenic bacterial species are present in defined complexes within subgingival plaque, thus identifying specific targets for therapeutic intervention. In light of increasing antibiotic resistance amongst oral bacteria, new strategies for control of periodontal bacterial complexes must be developed that inhibit the bacterial factors necessary for colonization and destruction of host tissues.","1986":"This paper describes the influence of the misuse of drugs on dental treatment and the effects of drugs of abuse on the orodental structures.","1987":"Certain lesions exclusively or typically affect the salivary glands; these are discussed in this article.","1988":"The previous article in this series dealt with the aetiology, diagnosis and potential consequences of submerging deciduous teeth. This paper will discuss the appropriate treatment options. The management is highly dependent on whether the permanent successor is present or absent. The degree of submergence and the age of the patient are also important factors for consideration.","1989":"Neurological complications following the administration of a local anaesthetic can be alarming. By reading reports of such incidents, dentists who find themselves in similar situations will be able to reassure their patients and act accordingly. The authors have reviewed the literature for those neurological complications that have been reported and offer an explanation of their aetiology. Examples of complications covered are facial nerve palsy, transient amaurosis, post-injection paraesthesia, Horner's syndrome, transient paralysis of combined cranial nerves III, IV and VI, sudden unilateral deafness and abducens nerve palsy. A thorough knowledge of the relevant anatomy pertinent to the various injections used in dental surgery is essential and is highlighted in the text.","1990":"The periodontal tissues and the pulp-dentine complex form an intimate continuum through which pathological changes of either one may lead to infection of the other, and whose management can be fraught with diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The purpose of this review paper is to explain the nature of that relationship and to provide pointers which may assist in the diagnostic process and thus enable appropriate management from the outset. Traditional classifications of lesions affecting the periodontal-endodontic complex have caused confusion by attempting to form diagnoses which indicate the putative primary source of infection. We would suggest that the origin of the infection is irrelevant to the management process, and that what is important is whether either, or indeed both, of the tissues are viable or not. Successful therapy will only result from the establishment of an accurate diagnosis, and forming such a diagnosis requires a methodical multi-staged approach.","1991":"Diabetes mellitus produces many complex changes in the lives of those affected. Elevated blood glucose levels, which may occur in the absence of symptoms, lead to late complications from tissue damage. There is an increased susceptibility to infection, poor wound healing and periodontal disease. Furthermore, chronic oral infection itself may contribute to raised blood glucose levels and hence to the later complications of diabetes. Acute infection in the oral cavity needs specific and aggressive management, just as in the acutely infected diabetic foot. The dental team may not have made a significant contribution to the shared management of the person with diabetes in the past; however, recent findings suggests that the dental team may contribute greatly to the shared care of diabetes with the diabetic team itself, and regular liaison is strongly recommended.","1992":"White lesions usually contain an increased amount of keratin. Some are rare congenital conditions, such as white sponge naevus and dyskeratosis congenita, unlikely to be seen in general dental practice. Inflammatory causes include candidosis and hairy leukoplakia, both now common in HIV disease. Non-infective causes include the common lesion of lichen planus, and the less common condition lupus erythematosus. Neoplastic and possibly preneoplastic causes include carcinoma, keratoses and leukoplakia. This article discusses the more common causes of oral white lesions. The first article in this series presented several general observations on diagnosis and treatment which should be borne in mind in relation to this article.","1993":"In this paper orthodontic treatment involving extraction of a lower incisor is described. This has traditionally been regarded as a compromise as loss of a lower incisor renders it impossible to achieve true ideal occlusion. However, with careful case selection, treatment planning and visualization of the post-treatment occlusion, excellent functional and aesthetic results can be achieved. The various factors that govern the decision to treat certain malocclusions in this way are discussed and a clinical case is presented to demonstrate this type of treatment.","1994":"Practitioners often become demoralized and demotivated with regard to promoting the oral health of their patients as, so often, their efforts appear to be fruitless. This paper examines the published evidence and draws on behavioural theory in order to help practitioners understand what help and support they can offer their patients in order to improve oral health.","1995":"This paper reports three cases in which young children were treated successfully using inhalational sedation instead of general anaesthesia.","1996":"There is increasing demand from adult patients for orthodontic treatment, either purely for aesthetics, to improve aesthetics or function following previous disease, or to facilitate the stabilization, restoration or replacement of teeth. Orthodontics may have a major role in the rehabilitation of patients suffering the effects of advanced periodontal disease, but there are a number of important factors to be considered in the management of such patients if the optimal outcome is to be obtained. This paper summarizes important aspects of treatment and the potential complications and how to avoid them.","1997":"A 36-item questionnaire was used to investigate the stress perceived by students at Manchester Dental School to potential stressors, grouped under the headings of living accommodation, personal factors, educational environment, academic work and clinical factors. The stressors producing the highest ratings for perceived stress varied throughout the course but high values were allocated to examinations, fear of failing the course or year, shorter and fewer holidays than other university students and--for clinical students--approachability of staff and completing the required quantity and variety of work within a limited time. Female students experienced greater stress than their male counterparts. Since high levels of perceived stress can reduce student performance, dental schools should consider courses in stress management.","1998":"Radiographs, due to their ability to pass through materials differentially, are used in dental practice to obtain information that is not available by other means. Recognition of the presence of a variation from normal is the first step to accurate interpretation of abnormalities. This article presents an outline of a method for examining radiographs in order to recognize that an abnormality is present, and to learn from the visual information some of the characteristics of the abnormality. A number of clinical examples are used to illustrate the conclusions that we can draw from the radiographic changes.","1999":"This paper reviews the prevalence and possible changes in prevalence of periodontal disease from epidemiological investigations carried out within the previous two decades. Although many older studies used unreliable indices, there is some evidence that clinically significant periodontitis is now restricted to between 15 and 20% of the population with certain groups, such as smokers and diabetics, at particular risk. The outlook for general dental practice in the future is also considered. As elderly people will form a greater proportion of the future population, and are more likely to remain dentate, more periodontal treatment may be required. To identify individuals and communities at risk, high-quality periodontal epidemiological information is of more importance than ever before.","2000":"The increasingly ageing population, advances in medical and surgical sciences, and the advent of new diseases such as infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have highlighted the importance of orofacial diseases. This article begins a new series on current thinking in the areas of orofacial medicine most relevant to the dental care team.","2001":"This final article in the series on computing for dental practitioners examines multimedia and the Internet. Multimedia is one area where the greatest advances have been made in recent years; almost all PCs marketed today have multimedia capabilities and more and more software is being written with multimedia attributes.","2002":"This article reviews some of the rapid developments in dental materials that have occurred during the last 25 years, especially adhesive, biocompatible and aesthetic materials. Some innovative research developments, which have exciting possibilities for future dental treatment, are outlined.","2003":"Haematological disease in his\/her patients is of particular relevance to the dental surgeon; the diagnostic signs and symptoms may be manifest in the mouth, and patients with haematological disorders must be managed carefully. This paper, the second in a series on recognizing and caring for medically compromised children, provides a simple classification of the haematological diseases affecting children that a dental practitioner is likely to encounter. In it, the diagnostic features, including oral manifestations, of these disorders are described and current 'best practice' in the management of both general and oral signs and symptoms is discussed. The implications of the general management of haematological disease to dentistry are also discussed.","2004":"This paper describes the history and current status of specialization within dental practice in the UK.","2005":"Burnout, a distinct psychological construct that has a number of features which separate it from occupational stress, is strongly associated with the emotional effects of providing patient- or client-centred services. Depression may be a consequence of prolonged experience of burnout. Recent findings suggest that burnout has features of maladaptive coping in the short term but is, paradoxically, protective in the longer term. Dentists are prone to burnout due to the nature of their work but may be able to prevent it if they can recognize the burnout process and take regular holiday breaks. Burnout is assumed to have an adverse influence on patient care, although no dental studies, as yet, have tackled the issue.","2006":"This paper examines the importance of caries risk assessment, identifies relevant risk factors, including clinical evidence, which has been considered to be the best predictor of caries risk.","2007":"Obstructive sleep apnoea is a potentially life-threatening breathing disorder characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep, with cessation of breathing. Patients are at risk of severe cardiovascular and respiratory complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia and the overall quality of life for sufferers and their families may be reduced. This article gives an overview of the aetiology (including pathophysiology), clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. The role dentistry can play in contemporary management of the disorder will be discussed in a second article.","2008":"In spite of the general decline in dental caries, as illustrated in national surveys of children's health and by BASCD surveys, considerable unmet need remains. If good oral health is to be ensured for all sections of the UK community, the issues discussed in this article must be addressed.","2009":"This article reviews current thinking on the rational use of fluoride for the safe and effective prevention of dental caries, so that benefits may be maximized and risks minimized.","2010":"Change in dental practice has been complemented by perhaps even more profound change in dental education at all levels. Not only has the structure been transformed but the underlying philosophy has shifted to an emphasis on lifelong learning as the only strategy for professional survival in the world of exponential knowledge growth and shifting values.","2011":"A questionnaire was sent out to members of the British Orthodontic Society in an attempt to establish how myofunctional appliances are currently used in the UK and to attempt to explain the differences between provider groups. This article reports the findings of this survey and that, of all the appliances currently available, British orthodontists prefer to use the Twin Block appliance. Furthermore, most of the sample questioned felt that the laboratory cost of many myofunctional appliances meant their provision under the General Dental Service was not practical.","2012":"Burning mouth syndrome is a fairly common condition. Contrary to popular belief, its management is successful in about 70% of cases--provided a structured protocol based on scientific evidence is adopted. Specialist advice must be sought in some cases, but many patients can be successfully treated in the primary care environment.","2013":"A 16-year-old male patient presented with ankyloglossia accompanied by a complaint of forceful spurting of saliva from the mouth and a unilateral swelling in the submandibular region. Following surgical relief of the ankyloglossia, the spurting of saliva had virtually ceased and the submandibular swelling disappeared without recurrence.","2014":"This article, the fourth in a series, discusses the uses of spreadsheets and databases in the dental practice.","2015":"Clinical success with resin-based bonding systems depends upon meticulous attention to detail at each stage of the bonding process. Cavity margins placed in enamel wherever possible and etched for at least 15 to 30 seconds will ensure a reliable peripheral seal. Dentine conditioning should be brief--a maximum of 15 seconds for surface demineralization only. Diffusion of primers into the full extent of dentinal demineralization is enhanced by application of multiple coats. Any solvent or moisture remaining on a primed dentine surface will prevent adaptation of bonding resin, resulting in non-attachment. Adhesive bonding resin provides a valuable elastic intermediate layer for absorption of stresses of polymerization shrinkage--but it should be of uniform thickness and not air-thinned. Incremental insertion of resin composite will reduce polymerization stresses and ensure a fully cured restoration.","2016":"The origin of stress in adhesive resin composite restorations is attributed to restrained shrinkage during polymerization and is dependent on the configuration of the restoration. Moreover, non-homogeneous deformations during functional loading can damage the interface as well as the coherence of the material. Damage from these stresses can be reduced by application of an elastic lining at the adhesive interfaces and by slowing the initial conversion by two-step light initiation of the resin. The various factors that mediate flow and compliance are discussed.","2017":"During the next decade we are likely to see the greatest changes in the way in which dentistry is delivered than at any point since the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948. The move in the primary-care sector from a mainly NHS service to a mixed economy, the emergence of more practices operated by bodies corporate and the possibility of high-street specialists will all impact on every aspect of professional life. For those trying to plan a career or looking to change pathways it can be difficult to identify which pathway to follow. The purpose of this article is to explore the possible routes for career development.","2018":"This article discusses the various infective causes of mouth ulcers.","2019":"The unsurpassed aesthetic and biocompatible qualities of ceramic materials still provide the stimulus to seek to overcome their limitations. Much of the materials research since the mid 1960s has been directed towards producing stronger, reinforced restorations with improved marginal accuracy and, although a new wave of ceramic products appeared in the 1980s, most of the materials currently available are developments derived from ideas established more than 20 years ago. This paper outlines some interesting aspects of recent developments and considers the present state of the art with respect to both materials and techniques.","2020":"The introduction of mixed dentition bone grafting of alveolar clefts means that the alveolar process can be fully restored, permitting adjacent teeth to migrate or be orthodontically moved into the grafted bone. Thus a complete dental arch can be obtained without prosthodontics in the great majority of patients. In addition, oral-nasal fistulae are closed, mucosal recesses eliminated (facilitating oral hygiene) and the long-term periodontal health of the teeth adjacent to the former cleft is improved. Alveolar bone grafting with subsequent orthodontic treatment, together with advances in dental materials, have contributed substantially to the care of patients with alveolar clefts, reducing the need for prosthodontic procedures and allowing completion of the dental treatment at an earlier age.","2021":"This third article in the series discusses mouth ulceration in relation to blood dyscrasias, gastrointestinal disorders, skin and connective tissue disease.","2022":"The use of vibration enables the clinician to use high-viscosity luting agents when seating composite inlays and allows quick and efficient placement of the inlay. The film of composite luting agent is achieved in a much shorter time and with lower loads by ultrasonic vibration than using manual methods. In order to achieve a thin lute, the vibrations of the ultrasonic scaler must be directed perpendicular to the surface of the inlay.","2023":"This is the fourth and final part of a series on recognizing and caring for medically compromised children. In this article, an outline of appropriate dental management for children with other more commonly encountered chronic medical conditions is given, together with a description of the disorders and their significance in dentistry. This group includes children with physically handicapping conditions and children with learning difficulties, as well as those who are medically compromised.","2024":"The success of a dental practice, in terms of both finance and job satisfaction, depends on effective communication with our patients. This paper highlights the key aspects of communication theory which we should include in our day-to-day practising lives.","2025":"The purpose of this paper is to review the principles and practicalities of antibiotic prophylaxis in medically compromised patients who require restorative dentistry. Guidelines for the management of patients who are susceptible to infection are given. The importance of oral health and the rational use of both local and systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis is described.","2026":"Mouth ulcers are one of the most common oral complaints. The term ulcer is used usually where there is damage to both epithelium and lamina propria, and a crater, sometimes made more obvious clinically by swelling caused by oedema or proliferation in the surrounding tissue. The term erosion is usually used where the damage is somewhat more superficial. Most ulcers\/erosions are due to local causes such as trauma or burns. Some are caused by aphthae or malignant neoplasms, and a few have aetiology in obvious systemic disease. Ulcers of local cause, drugs, aphthous ulcers, Behcet's syndrome and malignant ulcers are discussed in this article. The next two articles discuss the ulcers due to systemic disease including disorders of the blood, gastrointestinal disorders, skin diseases, connective tissue disease and infective diseases.","2027":"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a potentially life-threatening breathing disorder characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep, with cessation for breathing. Patients with OSA are at risk of severe cardiovascular and respiratory complications secondary to recurrent hypoxia and hypercapnia in addition to an overall reduced quality of life for sufferers and their families. An overview of the aetiology including pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms and diagnosis was presented in the first article in this series. In this article the management of OSA is presented, with particular emphasis on the role of dentistry in contemporary management.","2028":"Oral manifestations of gastro-intestinal disease are commonly under-diagnosed. This paper is the third in the series entitled 'Recognizing and Caring for the Medically Compromised Child' and seeks to facilitate the process of diagnosis and management of disorders affecting the gastro-intestinal tract in terms of both oral and gut signs and symptoms. This paper concludes with a section devoted to the recognition of HIV disease in paediatric patients, both orally and generally, and its implications for management within the dental surgery.","2029":"A major presenting complaint in dental practice is of sensitive teeth. In order to manage the problem well, a correct diagnosis is essential. Whilst it is true that 'common things occur commonly', one should consider all possible causes of pain in taking a history and examining the patient. This paper summarizes how to identify the potential causes of such a complaint.","2030":"An increase in the life expectancy of medically compromised patients has resulted in greater numbers of these individuals within our ageing population. As dental surgeons are increasingly expected to provide care for such patients, the likelihood of a medical emergency occurring within the dental surgery may increase. This article reviews the more common emergency drugs that a dentist may have to administer in the event of a medical emergency. The indications, mode of action, method of administration and dose of each agent are discussed.","2031":"The importance of observation, and perception, based upon an appropriate level of knowledge, is introduced in this article as the basis for examining dental radiographs. Normal anatomical features are displayed in radiographs as relative radiolucencies or radiopacities, their precise appearance varying with the technique used and exposure factors. This article addresses some of the points related to initial examination of radiographs, and the influence on the image of a variety of anatomical features. The author presents a logical approach to examining radiographs and illustrates the key anatomical features in the region of the jaws.","2032":"Three cases of dilacerated incisors and congenitally displaced incisors are reported. Dilaceration of central incisors occurs following trauma to the deciduous dentition. Generally these teeth are so severely malformed that they have to be extracted. Congenital displacement of the central incisors is an idiopathic condition with a generally favourable prognosis for orthodontic alignment.","2033":"This article examines the specialist software that is commercially available to assist the running of a dental practice. Generically termed 'practice management systems' (PMSs), these programs are designed to help perform many of the clerical, administrative and accounting tasks traditionally carried out manually, in a shorter time and with greater accuracy. PMSs have benefited considerably from advances in computer technology, particularly the increased speed of processors and graphic displays, to the point that they have become a viable alternative to an appointments diary and clinical records.","2034":"This paper describes important disorders of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and the management of dental treatment for patients with these diseases.","2035":"Dental caries is a process in which the enamel, and later the dentine, is demineralized by acids produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates. The main indicator bacteria in this process are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. This article discusses how monitoring of patients' salivary levels of these organisms can help in prevention and treatment of caries in different patient populations.","2036":"In this paper a case is made for the use of principles and techniques of economic evaluation to aid the planning of oral health services. The reader is taken through a case study, which highlights not only the importance of economic principles but also the challenges involved in carrying out economic evaluations in dentistry. These challenges need to be faced if oral health services are to be planned in a way that is of maximum benefit to the community.","2037":"The MFDS is a new examination designed and administered by the Royal Surgical Colleges of England, Scotland and Ireland. It can be taken after GPT and will be a pre-requisite to the commencement of specialist training.","2038":"Scuba diving is becoming more and more popular and dentists are increasingly likely to encounter patients with diving-related problems. Protruded mandibular positions and the biting forces exercised on the anterior occlusion during diving can cause pain and dysfunction, particularly where a predisposing factor such as bruxism exists. In this article, two cases are reported of patients with diving-exacerbated pain dysfunction syndrome, which improved following the construction of custom-made mouthpieces which distributed the forces more evenly. Laboratory procedures are described for construction of a custom-made scuba regulator mouthpiece that allows more comfortable diving.","2039":"Dentifrices have a role to play in the prevention of certain oral diseases, such as dental caries and gingivitis. The use of fluoridated dentifrices has had a dramatic effect on the caries rate in the western world over the last 30 years, and antibacterial, desensitizing and anticalculus dentifrice formulations have recently been developed. This paper provides a brief overview of the dentifrices currently available.","2040":"The three computer applications most widely used on personal computers are word processors, spreadsheets and databases. A word processor is essentially a program designed to create, print and store documents and letters. Microsoft Word and Lotus WordPro are examples. The term spreadsheet is used to describe a type of program that is designed to undertake financial, mathematical and even statistical calculations on rows and columns of numeric data. A spreadsheet program is useful for maintaining practice accounts, calculating simple statistics and trying out 'what if' scenarios on numerical data. A database is analogous to a card index system, and is used to store information in a format that facilitates rapid retrieval of data using a multitude of search methods. Many databases are capable of processing this information to generate data summaries, reports and charts based on the search criteria. In this article the basic features of word processing packages are described. Spreadsheets and databases will be discussed in a later paper.","2041":"This article discusses the treatment of a bulimic patient with severe tooth substance loss. The patient was provided with dentine-bonded crowns in view of the need for only minimal tooth preparation, their potential for good aesthetics and good patient acceptance. The crowns have performed satisfactorily in clinical service for 4 years.","2042":"As mentioned in the preceding articles, the widespread appearance of antimicrobial resistance has become a major threat to the effective treatment of infectious disease. However, does this have any relevance to the dental profession? This article relates current knowledge to everyday dental practice.","2043":"This clinical paper discusses the problem of managing established erosion in the young patient. For a significant number of these patients it is not possible to establish conclusively the erosive source. Intermediate composite restorations, in addition to the use of normal preventive measures, can be used to protect eroded teeth from further damage. The main goal of such restorations is to protect the viability of the worst-affected teeth until such time as the aetiological factors can be identified and controlled. They can also improve overall aesthetics and create interocclusal space.","2044":null,"2045":"Malignant melanoma is rapidly increasing in incidence. The primary lesion is frequently seen in the head and neck and general dental practitioners thus have the opportunity to identify suspicious lesions at an early stage. This article gives an overview of the pathology and clinical features of melanoma.","2046":"In this final part of the series the reasons for providing high-quality restorations for the young patient are considered. For such treatment to be successful it must be underpinned by effective management of the child's behaviour. Appropriate techniques and materials for a range of commonly encountered situations are discussed, with particular emphasis on the restoration of carious teeth.","2047":"This three-part series will provide an update on the modes of action of currently available antibiotics, review the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and discuss the impact of antibiotic resistance on prescribing for oral infections.","2048":"The purpose of this series of six articles is to introduce the interested general dental practitioner to computers and computing, to remove much of the mystery surrounding computers and to explain the technology in straightforward terms. The first two articles will concentrate on the basic principles; later papers will discuss the most commonly used software, practice management systems and multimedia.","2049":"The authors of this article consider that the swing-lock partial denture has a useful place in contemporary clinical dental practice and offers many advantages compared with conventional removable partial dentures in terms of retention and stability, especially in the extremely compromised dentitions. Here they describe the concept of the swing-lock removable partial denture, together with the indications, contraindications, technical and clinical considerations.","2050":"Endotracheal intubation is widely used in anaesthesia. Although it offers many advantages to the anaesthetic management of patients, this procedure carries the possibility that damage to the teeth may result. Dental damage in fact accounts for one-third of all medicolegal claims against anaesthetists and, although this problem has been widely discussed in anaesthetic circles, few dental articles have addressed the problem.","2051":"Oral rehabilitation is commonly difficult in cases of ectodermal dysplasia because the affected individuals are quite young when they are evaluated for treatment. Most affected children require extensive dental treatment in order to restore their appearance and help them develop a positive self-image. This article reviews the dental management of the disorder, including its psychosocial aspects and timing of different modalities.","2052":"The provision of high-quality dental care for children presents a challenge for the general dental practitioner. The aim must be to ensure that young patients reach adulthood with optimal dental health. This series of three articles takes an overview of good practice in the provision of dental care for children, with emphasis on disease prevention, early diagnosis of dental disease and deformity and appropriate treatment measures. This first paper discusses preventive measures and highlights the need to apply them, particularly for patients at high risk of dental disease or with special needs in relation to dentistry.","2053":"Eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa is a chronic ulcerative lesion which may mimic oral cancer clinically and is occasionally misdiagnosed. This article reports on two patients who presented with such lesions and discusses their diagnosis and subsequent management.","2054":"This article describes treatment options for a teenager with a class II division 2 malocclusion complicated by unerupted and palatally displaced upper canines. The opinions of British orthodontists, as obtained through the CASES project, are summarized and the patient's actual treatment is discussed.","2055":"The management of toothwear encompasses a broader approach than the active treatment of the problem, taking in as it does both passive and active interventions. This paper gives guidelines on how to assess and broadly manage toothwear rather than specific examples of treatment.","2056":"The dentist who undertakes to carry out fixed bridgework or crowns will be faced with the fracture of a number of these restorations. Repair of such fractures may provide a faster, less traumatic and less expensive form of treatment than replacement of the restoration. Alternative methods of repair of metal\/ceramic crowns and bridges are suggested, but further work is required to evaluate the long-term success of these repairs and, if required, to develop reliable methods of repair of metal\/ceramic restorations.","2057":"This is the second in a series which takes a broad view of dental care for the young patient. The first article discussed priorities and disease prevention; this article goes on to look at the contribution made to the provision of high-quality dental care by early diagnosis of dental disease and deformity. Methods of facilitating early diagnosis are also discussed.","2058":"This article describes treatment options for an adult with a severe Class II division 1 malocclusion. The opinions of British orthodontists, as obtained through the CASES project, are summarized and the patient's actual treatment is discussed.","2059":"In the management of dental caries preventive treatment must always go hand in hand with operative care. This paper looks at the rationale behind operative treatment and gives some guidelines on when to choose restorative intervention.","2060":"The use of radiographs to assist in diagnosis and treatment in dentistry relies upon the acquisition of good-quality images. A number of stages involved in this acquisition, and various regulations and guidelines, must be taken into account when selecting equipment, accessories, exposure factors and processing facilities. Each of these areas influence the quality of the image and its potential diagnostic yield. This article reviews the current recommendations that influence the production of a dental radiograph, as a foundation to assessment of the acquired image.","2061":"","2062":"Modern manufacture and materials have made needle breakage rare, but not impossible. Retrieval of the needle fragment may be helped by various localizing techniques. The authors outline and discuss these techniques, and describe the successful removal of a fractured needle from the pterygomandibular space.","2063":"The ideal restorative material should enable restoration of teeth that have either suffered trauma or have been prepared during the removal of caries to their original function and appearance. At the same time a seal should develop between the material and the tooth to prevent bacteria-laden fluids from permeating the dentine and reaching the pulp. Few, if any, of the available materials fulfil these requirements. This, the second of a short series, considers the status of indirect restorative materials as the millennium approaches. In this review indirect restorative materials are regarded as those which call not only upon the dexterity and judgement of the dental practitioner, but also upon the skills of the dental technician and techniques of construction that are suitable for use only in a laboratory. Included in this group are the dental casting and bonding alloys, dental ceramics and those resin composites that are shaped, cured and finished in the laboratory.","2064":"","2065":"A skeletal class II malocclusion can be dealt with in a number of ways. The preferred option is to use orthodontic treatment and growth modification if at all possible, but in cases where this is not possible the problem might be camouflaged or treated by surgery. In the case reported here the options are fully discussed and the opinions of the orthodontists expressed in the CASES project made clear. The actual treatment undertaken is also described.","2066":"A worn dentition is a frequent clinical finding and presents two major challenges to the dental team. The first challenge is to ascertain the cause of the toothwear, the second is its management. This paper aims to present an overview of aetiologies associated with toothwear.","2067":"When implants are used to anchor an intra-oral prosthesis, the resulting dentition should not only function well but also be aesthetically pleasing. Both aspects must therefore be carefully considered in the assessment of each case. Optimal aesthetics can be achieved only if a number of criteria, of which the amount and quality of bone present in a potential implant site are most important, are fulfilled. Collapse of the labial cortical plate is common, occurring two to three years after extraction. It can result in palatal placement of implant fixtures, leading to a poor crown emergence profile. Insertion of an implant fixture after initial socket healing but before resorption has occurred will maintain the labial contour. This technique is being used with increasing success.","2068":"This article summarizes what to do in the event of an emergency outside the dental surgery. It gives a simple and easy to follow guide to preserving life at the roadside when only minimal equipment is available. The fundamental principles of resuscitation will enable the practitioner to save a life in a situation when it is easy to forget the basic techniques in sheer panic. The training of the dental practitioner is an advantage in these uncommon but difficult situations when literally seconds count.","2069":"Some patients are anxious about routine dental treatment; others, who may be able to cope with uncomplicated treatment, are worried by more unpleasant procedures such as minor oral surgery. Management approaches to anxiety vary according to its severity, the age of the patient, the degree of cooperation and the patient's medical history. Psychological approaches have been widely used and range from informal and common-sense methods to formal relaxation training and hypnosis. These techniques are safe, free from adverse effects and give the patient a sense of control. An increasing number of patients are managed with conscious sedation techniques in combination with local anaesthesia and the more severely anxious and uncooperative may require treatment under general anaesthesia. As patient awareness of the risk of anaesthesia and the availability of sedation have increased, so the popularity of conscious sedation for dentistry has increased.","2070":"Impacted permanent molars have been widely reported; however, the phenomenon of 'kissing molars' or 'rosette formation' is not well reported. This may occur in isolation, or in addition to other features. This case report highlights the necessity for dental professionals to be vigilant for dental anomalies, which can be signs of various medical conditions and which may require further investigation.","2071":"Facial swelling caused by a periapical abscess is commonly encountered by dental practitioners. It requires prompt treatment, usually by removal of the infective foci and administration of appropriate antibiotics. However, diagnosis can be difficult, and may be complicated by the presence of retained deciduous teeth. This case report demonstrates a diagnostic dilemma and highlights the importance of looking beyond the obvious.","2072":"A case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as a precipitating factor in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is presented. As the dentist may well be the first to see this syndrome, it is appropriate to highlight the condition and this particular organism as an infective cause.","2073":"Five questions are posed regarding the treatment of a patient with hypodontia. The treatment options are discussed, and the actual treatment carried out demonstrated. The treatment preferences of British Orthodontists, elicited through the CASES project, are also included.","2074":"The strength of bonds of resin-composite materials to dentine using dentine bonding systems have improved greatly within the past five years. It may therefore be possible to attempt repair of a fractured incisor tooth if the patient retrieves the fractured fragment and attends for treatment. Little long-term data on the effectiveness of this treatment is available but, as materials improve, this approach to treatment of fractured incisor teeth should increasingly be considered.","2075":"This paper describes the acute and chronic causes of short clinical crowns and their management. Fracture or trauma are common causes of acute failures whilst toothwear is the most common cause for chronic causes. There are many methods of restoring teeth using conventional indirect techniques, which may alter the existing occlusal vertical dimension (such as orthodontic Dahl appliances), or conserving the vertical dimension by increasing the length of the teeth. These methods are described and illustrated to assist the practitioner choose the most appropriate restoration.","2076":"This article describes treatment options for a teenager with a mild, although aesthetically unpleasing, malocclusion. The opinions of British orthodontists, as obtained through the CASES project, are summarized and the patient's actual treatment is discussed.","2077":"Oral candidosis is common, particularly in elderly patients who wear dentures. Many of these patients also have systemic diseases, including conditions for which they have to take oral anticoagulants, most commonly warfarin. Although the effect of parenterally administered miconazole on anticoagulant control is well known, the fact that small amounts of topically applied miconazole oral gel can have a similar effect is poorly recognized.","2078":"Successful treatment using implants involves careful consideration of fixture placement and prosthesis design if the biomechanical conditions are to be optimized. These parameters may be related to the implant\/tissue interface at the individual fixture level, and thence to the relationship between the components of a prosthesis. The influence of the nature and magnitude of occlusal forces can also be significant and should be carefully assessed before placement.","2079":"Surgical emphysema is an uncommon complication of dental treatment despite the frequent use of air-driven handpieces and high-speed water-cooled equipment in dental practice. As a consequence it may either go unrecognized or be misdiagnosed. Although most cases resolve spontaneously, some patients require emergency intervention. This article outlines the condition and its management and describes two cases that arose during routine dental treatment.","2080":"The prevalence of dental fluorosis appears to be on the increase. Although in its mild form the condition is not considered to be of cosmetic significance, the more severe forms can cause great psychological distress to the affected individual. This article discusses the prevalence and mechanisms of dental fluorosis, and the aesthetic management of severe fluorosis in the young patient.","2081":"The ideal restorative material should enable teeth which have suffered trauma or have been damaged during the removal of caries, to be restored to their original function and appearance. At the same time a seal should develop between the material and the tooth such that bacteria-laden fluids cannot permeate the dentine and reach the pulp. Few, if any, of the materials currently available fulfil these requirements. This short series will consider the current status of each.","2082":"This is the first of six simulated case reports accompanying the questionnaire detailed in the article 'How to Do It: Making Clinical Audit Work' found earlier in this issue. You will find comprehensive discussion of the problem of making a decision about the early treatment of Class III malocclusion.","2083":"The orthodontic Audit Working Party of the Faculty of Dental Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons of England, in collaboration with the Centre for Medical Education, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee developed an audit project entitled 'Clinical Audit: Scenarios for Evaluation and Study'. The aim of the project was to contribute to the construction of clinical guidelines for orthodontists. This article, the first of a short series, describes the background to and general results of the study. Further articles will study individual aspects of the project.","2084":"Over the last ten years there has been a significant increase in the range and type of edentulous defects that can be treated using osseointegrated implants. Encouraged by the long-term success of implant reconstructions in the edentulous mandible and maxilla, and the availability of novel implant attachments, clinicians will now undertake more elaborate treatment involving the partially edentate and those with localized or generalized tissue deficiencies. This clinical trend places increasing demands on the predictability, complexity and accuracy of the surgical procedure necessary to allow a successful prosthetic reconstruction. This is especially so when potential implant sites lie in areas of high aesthetic or functional requirements.","2085":"The purpose of this article is to review current information on the role of smoking in destructive periodontal disease and in increasing the likelihood of failure of endosseous dental implants. Practical recommendations are made on the role of the dental health professional in everyday dealings with patients who smoke.","2086":"There are a number of occasions when a soft denture base will be of much more benefit to an edentulous patient than a conventional rigid prosthesis. This article discusses three such cases.","2087":"This case reports the surgical management of an impacted lower second molar. It also highlights other treatment options available when orthodontic treatment is contraindicated.","2088":"This paper considers the adverse effects that a patient may suffer as a result of anticipating an injection of dental local anaesthetic. Although most of these are extremely rare (a testimony to good technique), the dental practitioner should be aware of the possibility of their occurrence and of ways to deal with them.","2089":"This paper concerns the management of an adult patient with a caries problem. Once a dentist has decided the patient is at high risk to dental decay, involvement of the patient in the management of the problem is essential because it is the patient who will control caries, not the dentist. It is essential to determine why the patient is at risk so that risk factors may be modified appropriately. All members of the dental team have a role to play.","2090":"Successful implant surgery largely depends on good planning and meticulous technique. The former requires an appreciation of the restorative requirements and visualization of the desired end result. This may be easier for the clinician who is delivering both aspects of treatment, but in other circumstances requires close collaboration between prosthodontist and surgeon. This paper focuses on the surgical techniques involved in implant surgery, because successful osseointegration is achievable only with careful surgical preparation.","2091":"A case is presented of a patient whose lip became entrapped onto his orthodontic bracket following a blow to his face during a contact sport. The entrapped mucosa had to be released surgically.","2092":"The provision of dental treatment under both local anaesthesia and sedation has an excellent safety record. However, problems that either complicate treatment or lead to medical emergencies can arise. This paper considers the prevention of foreseeable problems and the treatment of unforeseeable emergencies in the dental surgery.","2093":"Prevention of infection can be a minefield of uncertainty. There is little consensus of opinion on the objective criteria for diagnosing wound infection, and experts disagree on whether antibiotics should be routinely provided as prophylaxis in dental surgery. This article sets out the arguments for and against the prophylactic use of antibiotics in dental procedures.","2094":"","2095":"During the last 10 years the initial concept of osseointegrated implant dentistry as essentially treatment of the heavily resorbed edentulous mandible in older patients has expanded to encompass almost every combination of prosthetic problem. Many factors must be taken into account when planning treatment to ensure a flexible approach which is necessary given the uncertainty in predicting the outcome of difficult cases. The complex, and therefore inherently costly, nature of implant dentistry will inevitably lead the patient to have very high expectations of treatment. It is extremely important for the operator to determine these expectations at an early stage, and if there is any doubt about being able to satisfy them then he or she may be wiser not to proceed (as in all other areas of dentistry, skillful case selection is the key to success). In any event, the patient must be fully appraised of the complications, the potential risks and the benefits of treatment so that they can proceed on the basis of informed consent.","2096":"Although administration of local anaesthesia in dentistry is generally both safe and effective, problems do occur. This article summarizes the types of problem the dental practitioner may encounter, in the hope that increased awareness will decrease the incidence.","2097":"Heavily restored teeth which become pulpally involved are now often root canal treated rather than extracted. While this is laudable it has a significant impact on the practice of endodontics today. The curved calcified canal can prove very difficult to prepare to its natural shape by conventional techniques and there is always the likelihood of iatrogenic damage. To compensate for this many clinicians tend to under-prepare these canals, perhaps leaving them inadequately cleaned and certainly remarkably difficult to fill to length. The purpose of this article is to outline the stages of and the rationale behind a hand instrumentation preparation method which uses the balanced force method of movement of files from canal entrance to apical constriction. In the authors' experience this technique has gone a long way towards solving the problem of cleaning and shaping the fine curved canal. With some practice, but no extra expense, the technique described will not only speed up canal preparation but will also make it more predictable.","2098":"Ectodermal dysplasia can result in a number of oral problems. As the condition is usually diagnosed in childhood, multidisciplinary specialist dental care at an early age may minimize the long-term dental complications. This article describes the restorative management of an adult patient suffering from ectodermal dysplasia for whom such support was not available, resulting in the provision of complex and highly invasive restorative treatment in adult life to provide a functional and aesthetically acceptable dentition. The various treatment options that were considered are discussed together with the details of the treatment provided.","2099":"Knowledge-based systems (KBS), otherwise and formerly known as 'expert systems', are computer programs that contain a representation of knowledge that can be used to solve problems normally requiring human intelligence. This article discusses the contributions such systems can make to medicine and dentistry, indicates the range of existing dental KBSs and gives reasons why removable partial denture (RPD) design has attracted so much attention in this respect. A description is also given of the 'RaPiD' system for designing RPDs at the chairside.","2100":"It is not always easy to discover the aetiology of malocclusion: only in about 5% of cases is a cause clearly identifiable. In this article, the various genetic, environmental and physical factors that may contribute to malocclusion are discussed.","2101":"The rapid growth in our understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal disease has led to a change in therapeutic emphasis, supplementing traditional, non-specific, mechanical plaque control with a more focused targeting of pathogenic organisms. New topical preparations provide high antimicrobial doses at diseased sites without the systemic antibiotic loading which is now, in itself, a cause of concern due to the increasing tendency of micro-organisms to become resistant to antimicrobial agents. This article reviews the current methods of delivering antimicrobial agents to the gingival crevice and evaluates their roles in practical periodontal therapy.","2102":"In order to achieve safe and predictable results with oral implant therapy, the clinician has to rely on the scientific documentation when choosing a particular implant system. This review condenses the relevant clinical documentation on currently used endosseous oral implant systems and may help in the process of choosing an implant system.","2103":"Research into improving local anaesthetic agents and methods of delivering them in dental practice has been very slow. This article describes some of the progress that is being made in these areas.","2104":"In this, the second part of a presentation on the emergency treatment of an acute temporomandibular disorder, we will address the problems of joint sounds, open and closed locking and psychological considerations. The management of pain and muscle spasm was considered in the previous paper.","2105":"The term 'hidden caries' is used to describe a carious lesion seen in dentine on a bitewing radiograph where clinically the occlusal enamel appears sound or only minimally demineralized. The relative rise in the number of clinically sound occlusal surfaces over the past two decades could be a reason why hidden caries has come into sharper focus for practitioners and researchers. Dentists, routinely examining children who are clinically caries-free, may be shocked to discover a large lesion on a radiograph that they have apparently missed clinically. This underlines the importance of careful examination of the radiograph. It is important that the practitioner appreciates the possibility of hidden caries, and the value of the radiograph in its diagnosis.","2106":"","2107":"The purpose of this short series of articles is to provide guidance in the management of patients who present with an acute temporomandibular disorder. This article is the first of two, highlighting the role of the general dental practitioner in the primary care of acute temporomandibular disorders.","2108":"The ability to take radiographs of good diagnostic quality is an essential prerequisite for successful root canal therapy. However, the operator also has a responsibility to limit the radiation dose to the patient. This article reviews the radiography required for root canal treatment with these criteria in mind.","2109":"Missing teeth, whether, congenitally absent or lost through trauma or caries may lead to reduced friction, poor aesthetics or distress to the patient. A variety of methods have therefore been developed to replace the missing dentition with bridgework or dentures. The method chosen for replacement should be tailored towards the individual patient as far as possible. In this article, the first in a series, the author provides guidelines as to how this should be done.","2110":"A number of dedicated electronic dental analgesia (EDA) systems have become available in recent years. In this study the attitudes of operators and patients were investigated by means of a post-treatment questionnaire, to the use of a new system for providing surface anaesthesia before administration of local anaesthesia. Levels of effectiveness were rated as similar to those of surface anaesthesia by the dental evaluators, who found the EDA system more time consuming. They felt that the EDA system reduced the discomfort of injections in only 26% of cases. Sixty per cent of the respondent patients who had previously experienced surface anaesthesia thought the EDA system controlled injection discomfort, and 64% stated that they would request the system in future.","2111":"The position of the anterior teeth and skeletal base relationship establish many of our facial characteristics, yet these same tooth positions can result in a range of dental problems that are often specific for a particular incisal relationship. Excessive loss of tooth tissue on various surfaces may result in trauma to the soft tissue and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. A range of treatment options may be required and can often be conveniently classified by the form of incisal relationship.","2112":"This article reviews the transplantation of maxillary canines: indications, contraindications, surgical technique, and success rates. A successful case is illustrated.","2113":"","2114":"This paper presents a case of HIV-associated fulminating herpes zoster infection (HZI) that culminated in right mandibular necrosis and tooth exfoliation. The occurrence of such infection in immunosuppression and the impending clinical features are briefly reviewed and discussed.","2115":"","2116":"Patients will often visit their general dental practitioner when experiencing problems with orthodontic appliances, even if they were referred to a specialist for treatment. Reassurance may be all that is necessary, but simple intervention may allow the treatment to continue with a minimum of interruption. This article is an overview of the common orthodontic appliance problems that may be encountered and provides practical advice on how to deal with them.","2117":"Frequent dental check-ups correlate with good dental health. However, many non-attenders see no need to attend a dentist until they have a problem that needs attention. Dental attendance may be stimulated by highlighting to the patient the reasons for future dental checks, persisting with recall messages and tailoring the recall method to individual patients.","2118":"Implant-stabilized overdentures can be used successfully to restore the edentulous mouth, and there are many good reasons why this treatment should be selected in preference to using fixed dentures. However, as with any treatment, there must be a strong commitment to after care if the overdenture is to remain successful. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using implants to stabilize overdentures, examines their success rates and discusses the extent of after care.","2119":"Since the introduction in 1989 of a home tooth-bleaching technique, the practice has become widespread in the USA. Safety concerns led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to temporarily ban sales in 1991 but the ban was later lifted, and the American Dental Association (ADA) now issues guidelines for safety and efficacy. Early information on safety of home bleaching products was often skewed because they were being compared out of context with those designed to be used only in the dental office. The early studies also failed to put the risks into perspective with the risks from other routine dental procedures. The risks are minimized with the systems supplied by dentists because he or she is able to diagnose any problems or special needs, to plan appropriate treatment and to fabricate, fit and adjust the prosthesis used to apply the material. A wide variety of disfigurements may now be treated successfully at home using preparations supplied by the dental practitioner.","2120":"The triangle of health (physical, psychological and social) allows the dental health professional to appreciate the importance of the holistic view of health. The three dimensions of health are as applicable to the health and well-being of the dental health professional as they are to the patients they treat. Parallels between physical, psychological and social determinants of oral health for the patient are related to those for the health of the dental team members. Through an awareness of such matters dental health professionals can promote health for their patients and themselves.","2121":"Successful treatment of periodontal disease depends upon the extent of disease, susceptibility of the individual to disease, and the motivation and expectations of the patient. The dental surgeon must balance these factors with the practical and financial constraints of treatment. Many dental practitioners find it extremely difficult to decide on a particular course of treatment: this article will help those in doubt to choose the treatment appropriate to their individual patients.","2122":"The previous article in this series dealt with the selection of patients who would benefit from referral to a consultant orthodontist. It is equally important to access consultant services in a manner which allows the referral to be processed efficiently. This paper discusses factors related to the actual mechanism of referral.","2123":"Patients may present with localized anterior toothwear, complaining of poor appearance or sensitivity, or both. Restoration of these teeth continues to cause problems, especially if interocclusal space has been lost. Conventional treatment to satisfy the patient's aesthetic and functional demands is time consuming and requires careful maintenance. This paper describes the use of chairside composite resin restorations in the treatment of localized anterior toothwear. Interoccusal space is provided by placing the restorations at an increased vertical dimension of occlusion. It enables the presenting complaint to be resolved while restoring structure, function and appearance.","2124":"Patients with leukaemia can exhibit signs or complain of symptoms in the oral cavity and oropharynx; indeed, these may be the initial presenting complaints of the disease. Septicaemia is common in patients undergoing treatment, and has been reported as having an oral cause in up to 50% of cases. This article reports four patients presenting to dental practitioners with leukaemia, and discusses the management of dental problems in patients with the disease.","2125":"The triangle of health is based upon a holistic view of health and is composed of physical, psychological and social dimensions. It is by an acknowledgement of these various aspects of health that restorative treatment and preventive plans can best be negotiated with patients and tailored to their physical, psychological and social needs.","2126":"This, the fourth paper in a series of uses of sedation in general dental practice, reviews the use of sedative techniques for patients who have medical conditions which will affect their ability to co-operate with dental treatment or which may be aggravated by the stress of treatment. Advice is given on a range of other conditions which may present as incidental findings when the patient's medical history is being taken.","2127":"Resection of oral carcinoma can cause serious problems with speech, mastication and swallowing. Several methods of reconstruction of the defects caused by tumour resection are available to the modern oral and maxillofacial\/head and neck surgeon, some of which are more effective and aesthetically pleasing than others. This article discusses the methods available, their advantages and disadvantages, and gives guidelines on the circumstances in which each is ideally used.","2128":"","2129":"This article describes how sedation can help to overcome some of the problems associated with the use of local anaesthesia for dentistry. It also reviews those problems where sedation is not the appropriate choice, and gives guidance on distinguishing the appropriate from the inappropriate, along with suggestions for how such cases might be managed.","2130":"The first article of this series described the problems of restoring posterior teeth with direct-placement composite. This second article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the composite inlay technique and examines the clinical provision of these restorations.","2131":"Reports of the success of treatment using endosseous implants vary, and claims about the usefulness of some implant systems are supported by little hard data. The authors of this report followed the progress of patients who had been implanted with the ITI Bonefit implant system over a period of 5 years. They present the results of their study and give recommendations on how general dental practitioners (GDPs) should be trained to use such implants.","2132":"General dental practitioners and community dental officers may need to consider several factors when referring patients to the consultant orthodontic service. In Birmingham, a local professional group incorporating representatives from both primary care and secondary care (consultant) services have drawn up a set of formal referral guidelines. The purpose of the exercise was to encourage the most appropriate use of the consultant service so that its resources could be directed towards those in greatest need. In this paper, the factors which determine the patients requiring referral are discussed; a second article will deal with the actual process of referral.","2133":"Gutta percha is the most widely used material in root canal obturation because of its relative inertness, lack of toxicity and biocompatibility. The most common method of obturation using gutta percha is lateral condensation, which has several disadvantages. The use of thermoplasticized gutta percha obviates many of the problems of this technique, but is still not commonly used. This article assesses the systems available for obturating root canals using thermoplasticized gutta percha.","2134":"","2135":"Amelogenesis imperfecta is a rare developmental abnormality of enamel, the main clinical problems of which are extensive loss of tooth tissue, poor aesthetics and tooth sensitivity. Management often involves complex and long-term treatment but is usually successful if patients are well motivated. This case report outlines the management of a teenager with amelogenesis imperfecta (hypocalcified type) who had requested a dental clearance at an early age.","2136":"","2137":"This article presents a case of gingival squamous cell carcinoma in a patient who was HIV positive but who had no history of pan chewing, smoking, alcohol consumption or nutritional deficiency. Investigations also revealed the presence of superimposed pseudomembranous candidiasis. The case reported reveals that squamous cell carcinoma of the gingiva may occur as an oral manifestation of AIDS.","2138":"When considering the aetiology of malocclusion in general, factors are often cited as having a genetic basis or an environmental basis. An individual malocclusion is likely to be a result of the variable effects of multiple environmental influences, upon an equally variable genetic predisposition. One of the most tangible 'environmental' factors is that of sucking habits involving digits or dummies. This review considers the nature of these habits, their effects on the developing dentition and methods used to combat the problem.","2139":"Pyogenic granuloma is a common reactive lesion seen in the third decade of life, generally between 1 and 2 cm in size. It may be confused clinically with malignancy. It is treated by surgical excision, and recurrence is rare.","2140":"Composite restorative materials were introduced to the dental profession in the early 1960s and quickly became the principal anterior restorative material. Following improvements in composite technology, these materials were also developed as aesthetic posterior materials but were initially hampered by problems of poor wear resistance. In this, the first of two articles on the uses of composite replacement materials, the development of composite resins are discussed and the problems of using direct-placement composite to restore posterior teeth are examined in detail. The second article will review the use of the composite inlay technique.","2141":"Dysmorphophobia is a syndrome in which a person of normal appearance becomes obsessed with an aspect of their appearance which they feel is noticeably defective, and for which they constantly seek treatment. This case report describes the successful management of a young woman with dysmorphophobia using a multidisciplinary approach.","2142":"The use of adhesive bridges is becoming more popular as designs are refined and more effective agents are developed for cementation. However, the fitting of such bridges is very technique-sensitive; an ill-fitting bridge will cause discomfort and difficulty with oral hygiene. It is important that practitioners take the problems illustrated in this case report into account when fitting adhesive bridges.","2143":"The best method for retreating a tooth that has already undergone root treatment will depend on the root filling technique and material used; a combination of retreatment techniques may be required. The correct method, combined with the required equipment, skill and experience, are necessary to produce a high standard of retreatment and a successful result. In part 1 of this article, the indications and case selection for root canal retreatment were discussed; this article will now discuss the methods of retreatment available.","2144":"Supernumerary teeth may be found in both the primary and permanent dentition, although they are more common in the permanent dentition. Presence of a fourth molar is rare, and such a tooth is almost invariably impacted. Dental practitioners should be aware of the possibility of encountering this rare supernumerary, its diagnosis and treatment. The authors of this article conducted a survey of patients in Montreal, looking specifically at the prevalence, aetiology, diagnosis, pathology and treatment of fourth molars. Their findings are reported here, and compared with data from the literature over the past 15 years.","2145":"Gingival overgrowth is a well-known side-effect of nifedipine therapy. The altered gingival architecture can be disfiguring, aesthetically displeasing and cause discomfort during mastication. Traditional treatment is based on surgical resection of the overgrown tissue followed by maintenance therapy aimed at achieving a high standard of plaque control. This case report describes the non-surgical management of a patient presenting with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth. Establishment and maintenance of a considerably improved standard of plaque control led to complete resolution of the overgrowth without recurrence, even though the medication dose was increased. The possible pathogenesis of nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth is considered and the all-important role of plaque control emphasized.","2146":"This case reports an unusual finding of fly larvae infesting the maxillary hard and soft tissues (myiasis) following a chronic suppurating infection of dental origin in an Afro-Caribbean male. It also highlights the future therapeutic uses of such organisms in general medical, and possibly even dental, surgery.","2147":"Since it was first described in 1955, direct bonding of orthodontic attachments to the teeth has become routine in fixed appliance therapy. The technique used is deceptively simple: meticulous attention to detail and a thorough understanding of the factors involved are needed to ensure a successful outcome.","2148":"The safety of local anaesthetic agents is high but adverse reactions do occur. A common mistake among practitioners is misdiagnosing an adverse reaction to local anaesthesia as a hypersensitivity reaction. Some prospective dental patients are unable to undergo routine dental treatment because they have been mislabelled as allergic to local anaesthetics. This case report illustrates the need for practitioners to be sure of the signs and symptoms of potential adverse reactions and their appropriate management.","2149":"A case is reported of a patient who presented with severe buccal segment crowding, poor oral hygiene and a reluctance to wear orthodontic appliances. The premolar alignment was improved by extracting four second permanent molars.","2150":"Direct image acquisition of intra-oral images using digital, filmless, techniques has been possible only since the late 1980s, although indirect methods have been available since the late 1970s. The techniques possible so far have had a number of limitations, making them cumbersome to use. A new system, the Digora system, has recently been developed in Finland, which overcomes many of these shortcomings. The principles and uses of this system are described here.","2151":"Dental anomalies are well documented in patients with cleft palate, although reports of intranasal teeth in these patients are extremely rare. This paper discusses the case of a rhinolith associated with tooth-like structures in a patient with a treated cleft palate.","2152":"A case is presented of external cervical resorption detected on routine 6-monthly examination. Following root canal therapy orthodontic extrusion and pericision, the tooth was restored using a radicular retained post and core supporting a porcelain bonded to gold full coverage crown.","2153":"Conventional root canal treatment, despite having a reportedly high success rate may not invariably lead to the desired healing response in clinical practice because of shortcomings in the treatment. This is the first of two articles on this subject, and will cover indications and case selection for root canal retreatment. Part 2 will discuss methods of retreatment.","2154":"A sub-regional audit showed a high rate of referral of acute dentoalveolar infections as emergencies. In Torbay Hospital alone, 21 patients required admission following such referrals in a period of 3 months. A questionnaire was therefore sent out to all general medical and general dental practitioners in the area covered by Torbay Hospital in order to survey their choice of antibiotics in the initial management of acute dentoalveolar infections. The results showed that the prescribing patterns of general medical practitioners differed significantly from those of general dental practitioners and that practitioners were reluctant to prescribe metronidazole as a first choice, even in patients allergic to penicillin. The authors conclude that awareness about the use of antibiotics, particularly among general dental practitioners, needs to be increased.","2155":"","2156":"Over the past 10 years molecular biological techniques have been developed as aids to clinical diagnosis. The use of these techniques in diagnosis of infectious diseases is likely to increase greatly, and the clinician should be aware of their uses and limitations. The aim of this article is to give a background insight into some of the current techniques used in the microbiological investigations and the diagnosis of oral disease.","2157":"","2158":"Objective assessments of clinical teaching are difficult; in oral surgery students must acquire a wide range of clinical and operative skills before qualifying as independent dental practitioners. A student log book system was introduced in Manchester University to monitor student progress and assess the efficacy of clinical instruction in oral and maxillofacial surgery following the introduction of the new 5-year BDS curriculum. Initial appraisal of third- and fourth year students undertaking 10-week clinical attachments revealed generally high levels of attendance (greater than 80%), and reasonable clinical experience (over 80% of students acquiring regular experience of dentoalveolar surgery and extractions). However, individual variation in both attendance and achievement was wide, and a persistent 8% of students did not appear to gain any practical experience. Students achieving less than the average course performance marks were thus easily identified and measures initiated to identify and correct their difficulties. Log book assessment also facilitated effective audit of teaching staff, clinical sessions and overall course delivery. The use of student log books to record clinical performance is recommended as a versatile aid to clinical teaching practice.","2159":"The purpose of this article is to consider the challenges that arise in replacing complete dentures. The use of conventional techniques incorporating successful features of the existing dentures appropriate to general practice will be discussed and the problems peculiar to the replacement of implant-retained overdentures considered.","2160":"Anterior crossbite, a permanent upper central or lateral incisor occluding lingually to an opposing tooth, can have serious dental health implications if left untreated. It usually becomes evident in the early mixed dentition, and all general dental practitioners should be aware of the condition and know how to manage it in order to prevent the possibly serious consequences.","2161":"This article highlights current knowledge of the epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus and reviews current information on the risk of transmission of the virus during dental health care.","2162":"The first of these two papers described the mechanisms causing gastro-oesophageal reflux. This paper illustrates the effect of regurgitation erosion on teeth and how to arrange investigations and to interpret the results.","2163":"An interesting example of a gingival cartilaginous choristoma is reported. The term choristoma, because of its histological structure, applies to a tumour-like mass of normal cells in an abnormal location.","2164":"During dental radiographic procedures, faults may occur which result in radiographs of poor diagnostic quality. The faults of positioning and alignment invariably mean that the radiograph has to be retaken and the patient exposed once more to radiation. Other possible faults, such as over-exposure, over-development, under-development or under-exposure, although the positioning is correct, can be very frustrating: the image on the radiograph may be too dark or too light to be of any diagnostic quality. There are ways of lightening and darkening radiographs. Many of these methods have been lost from textbooks and lectures on dental radiography. This article attempts to remedy this loss.","2165":"Medical problems can affect the type and timing of dental treatment in children and also the methods of pain control used. In this paper, conditions which influence the choice of anaesthesia and the performance of nonsurgical and surgical dentistry are discussed, as are conditions which affect dental development.","2166":"","2167":"Glass ionomer cements were first developed in the early 1970s in an attempt to combine the advantages of silicates and polycarboxylate cements. The two key features of this group of materials are their ability to bond chemically to enamel and dentine and their fluoride-releasing properties. This article reviews the clinical applications of glass ionomers in young patients and in particular to evaluate their use in prevention, bonding and restorations.","2168":"Complete dentures need to be replaced at suitable intervals-either because of changes in the denture-bearing tissues, usually due to alveolar resorption, or because of general deterioration of the existing dentures. The purpose of this and the following article is to consider the challenges that arise in replacing complete dentures. The rationale for using techniques in which features of existing dentures can be employed in the construction of replacement complete dentures will be discussed, together with methods suitable for clinical practice. In the first part diagnosis and treatment planning will be considered and a variety of copying techniques reviewed. The limitations of these techniques will be discussed and alternative treatment strategies will be considered.","2169":"The human periodontal diseases are a complex group of disorders that span the entire length of the human life cycle. They are infective in nature, but are mediated by host parasite interactions that are influenced not only by the nature of the pathogens present but also by a variety of underlying immunological and connective tissue anomalies. Thus, on occasion they may reflect systemic disorders that have previously been undiagnosed. As such abnormalities frequently present in childhood or adolescence, knowledge of the potential implications of this broad group of diseases is important. This paper reviews the current classification of childhood periodontal disease and outlines the clinical presentation and management of the more common disorders.","2170":"Most people have at some time experienced the symptoms of heartburn associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux. Fortunately, these symptoms are usually short-lived and require no treatment, but in some patients severe and prolonged reflux of gastric juice into the mouth can cause dental erosion. This paper, the first in a two-part series, describes the aetiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux and associated problems that may be encountered.","2171":"Facial trauma in children with immature incisor teeth often results in the complete avulsion of a maxillary permanent incisor because the root is only partially formed and the alveolar bone is still elastic. These teeth may be replanted: the long-term prognosis for replanted incisors has greatly improved because of improvements in our clinical knowledge following the pioneering and painstaking research work of Andreasen and his colleagues.","2172":"","2173":"Advances in treatment protocols over the past 20 years have resulted in much improved survival rates for children with cancer. As more children survive, the emphasis has moved from \"saving children at all costs' to saving children \"at least cost to the child' and protocols are continually reviewed with this in mind. As more dental practitioners are likely to encounter children who have survived malignant disease, this paper looks at the long-term effects of treatment modalities on the dentoalveolar complex.","2174":"Sedation should be considered as a useful part of the general dental practitioner's armamentarium and as an important alternative to general anaesthesia in selected cases. In this, one of a series of articles on the uses of sedation in various circumstances, the management of the gagging patient is discussed. The many factors involved in the aetiology of the hyperactive gag response are reviewed and measures for dealing with it suggested.","2175":"","2176":"","2177":"This is the first in a series of articles on the uses of sedation in general dental practice. This paper reviews current recommendations for the practice of sedation, and the importance of patient assessment as a part of treatment. The dental and psychosocial indications, as well as medical contraindications, for sedation are discussed. Future articles will expand on other areas where sedation may be a useful tool in the general dental practitioner's armamentarium. It is hoped that these articles will encourage all practitioners to consider a wider use of sedative techniques in dentistry.","2178":"Dental students are encouraged to undertake elective study overseas to increase their clinical experience with diseases that are uncommon in the UK. India has a high incidence of oral cancer and precancer and is an ideal destination for students interested in the study of malignant oral disease. This article reports the findings of a student on elective study to India.","2179":"Periodontal diseases are a group of related inflammatory disorders, initiated by dental plaque and causing destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. Although the inflammatory response is a fundamental defence mechanism against bacterial infection, its persistence over a long period of time may extensively damage the periodontal tissues: cementum, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and dentogingival tissues. These disorders, despite recent improvements in oral health are still a major cause of tooth loss in patients over 35 years of age.","2180":"","2181":"","2182":"","2183":"","2184":"","2185":"","2186":"Papers describing the dental applications of lasers have appeared in the dental literature for more than 30 years but there have been few comprehensive reviews. In this, the first of a two-part series, the author describes the earliest dental uses of lasers, the heightened interest which followed the appearance of the Nd:YAG laser in 1987 and the use of lasers in dentistry on hard and soft tissue. Part 2 will deal with the use of lasers in diagnosis, treatment and dental research.","2187":"The dental practitioner who has to examine a child who has suffered dental trauma also has to manage the parents, who are often as upset as the patient. This paper, the first in a short series of management of various types of dental trauma, presents the steps necessary to formulate a treatment plan for such patients in a logical, step-by-step sequence.","2188":"One of the largest ethnic minorities in the UK, and especially London, is people of Chinese descent. A dental practitioner treating these people may encounter restorations that have been performed by traditional practitioners in their country of origin. These restorations are likely to be very different from anything else a practitioner in the UK will have come across, and in order to treat these patients it is important to have an understanding of how and why the restorations were made.","2189":"This case report describes a disfiguring hypoplastic maxillary right central incisor in a 20-year-old man. The maxillary primary central had been traumatized in a fall, which had resulted in its intrusion with subsequent episodes of pain and swelling around the tooth. The tooth had been extracted several years later. When the permanent central incisor erupted, it was grossly hypoplastic. The possible causes of this defect are discussed.","2190":"Dry mouth is a relatively common problem, often neglected by patients and dentists alike. This article reviews the symptoms, causes and treatment of xerostomia and provides guidelines for recognizing the condition at an early stage.","2191":"","2192":"","2193":"","2194":"Failure of eruption of incisors can cause problems in the adult dentition. Early diagnosis is vital, and a number of options are available for treatment. This article sets out guidelines for general dental practitioners managing such teeth.","2195":"The most common form of oral surgery is extraction of impacted third molars. The patient may suffer a period of impaired food intake before extraction because of the discomfort caused by the impacted tooth. This may compound poor intake for other reasons, for example poverty. After surgery, the patient undergoes several days of pain and swelling, which delays a return to normal eating. The relationship between surgery for impacted third molars and diet has not been documented, nor is dietary advice routinely offered. The aim of this study was to describe the diet of patients before and after extraction of third molars. Patients recorded everything they ate for 7 days before and after surgery. These records were converted into estimates of nutrient intake. A substantial fall in energy intake occurred which had not been corrected even a week after surgery. The nutritional implications of this are not yet clear. Practitioners are strongly advised to warn patients of the likelihood of serious disturbance to their lifestyle and to offer them simple dietary advice.","2196":"A bizarre and unexplained localized osteomyelitis was discovered in the mandible of an otherwise apparently healthy 36-year-old man. This strange oral manifestation was followed 2 years later by a diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which indicated full-blown AIDS. Could osteomyelitis of the mandible be an alarming oral manifestation of AIDS before the disease is manifested in other ways?","2197":"The proliferation of information sources (printed and electronic) at a time of rapid advances in computer technology is impacting on libraries and information centres. Although methods of storing, accessing, retrieving and disseminating information are changing, libraries and librarians are central to the information exchange.","2198":"Although dentures are cosmetic, as well as functional appliances, they can sometimes cause various oral conditions or life-threatening hazards to patients. A case is presented here of an unusual complication of a partial lower denture.","2199":"The resin-modified (light-cured) glass-ionomer cements are a relatively recent introduction to restorative dentistry, especially in their restorative form. In Part 1 of this review, the physical and biological properties of these materials were discussed. In this second paper their clinical applications and handling will be addressed.","2200":"Impaction of the upper permanent canine is almost as common as impaction of the third molar. The likelihood of being able to align one of these teeth with the rest of the dentition depends on a number of factors, and several treatment options are available.","2201":"Dental practitioners often have to treat cases of toothwear, which may be caused by a number of factors including dietary erosion, physical attrition and abrasion due to friction against a foreign body. The authors encountered a young patient with a very unusual cause of toothwear, details of which are reported here.","2202":"The resin-modified (light-cured) glassionomer cements were developed as hybrids of the conventional glass-ionomer materials to overcome some of their disadvantages. These new materials will be reviewed in two parts. This first article deals with their physical and biological properties. Part 2 will cover their clinical applications and handling.","2203":"Mouth care forms an integral part of palliative care for hospice patients with advanced cancer. Oral disease is common in these patients and dental surgeons and their staff will be involved increasingly in the multidisciplinary care essential to effective palliative medicine. This article describes some of the more common problems the dental practitioner caring for these patients is likely to encounter and summarizes appropriate treatments, based on an approach that has been evolved in a Scottish hospice over the last 2 years.","2204":"This article describes a mucous retention cyst of the soft palate associated with an over-extended complete maxillary denture. The clinical and anatomical relevance of the fovea palatinae are discussed with respect to the posterior palatal seal and post-dam positioning.","2205":"Implant-supported single-tooth crowns are suitable alternative restorations to partial dentures and bridges. A number of systems have been developed to create a good aesthetic result without the display of the standard titanium abutment traditionally used in restorations with complete fixed prostheses supported by titanium endosseous implants. This paper reviews two such systems.","2206":"Intentional replantation (IR) involves the extraction, extra-oral endodontic treatment and replantation of a tooth. Its use dates back over 1000 years, but it is rarely considered by the modern dental practitioner. This paper describes the treatment of a patient using this technique, and discusses its relative advantages and disadvantages.","2207":"The use of resin-bonded onlays as a means of cuspal coverage is described with reference to two clinical cases. One distinct feature of this technique is the minimal tooth preparation required compared with that needed for a conventional crown or onlay. Conservation of the already compromised tooth tissue is thus achieved.","2208":"A thorough knowledge of applied anatomy is essential for the success of surgical techniques: the operator uses this knowledge by taking advantage of recognized structures to aid a procedure or to avoid complications. Of all the facial bones, the mandible is the largest and toughest, and exploitation of its anatomy has lead to the development of better techniques for diagnosis and treatment. This article describes how this has come about.","2209":"Malignant melanoma arises from melanocytes, dendritic cells of neural crest origin. Melanocytes occur within the basal layers of the epidermis, mucous membranes, retina and uveal structures of the eye and the meninges. Rarely, they may also occur in the bladder, adrenal medulla and ovaries. These melanomas metastasise widely and metastases in the oral mucosa have been seen in about 3% of patients with cutaneous melanoma, and can complicate the healing of extraction sites. This paper presents a case of malignant melanoma of the mandible.","2210":"Obstructive sleep apnoea is a well recognized clinical problem. This paper presents a case in which a joint orthodontic and surgical approach was used to diagnose and treat a patient suffering from this condition.

This article will focus on the management of NCTL.","2215":"Awareness is growing among dental practitioners of the hazards of blood-borne pathogens, especially since the advent of HIV infection and AIDS. This awareness has promoted fundamental changes in the practice of dentistry. There is no reason, as long as infection control procedures are followed carefully, that otherwise well HIV-positive individuals should not be treated routinely in a standard clinical environment.","2216":"","2217":"Supernumerary teeth, which usually appear in small numbers and are easily dealt with, may affect the permanent dentition if not removed. In this paper the case of multiple supernumerary teeth in the presence of a complete dentition is reported.","2218":"Although hand instrumentation is considered the most acceptable method of preparing root canals, sonic instruments may be useful additions to the endodontic armamentarium. Sonic instrumentation may be incorporated as an adjunct to traditional techniques for shaping the root canal. The use of such instruments may assist the practitioner during root canal treatment in general practice.","2219":"This is the second of a short series of articles detailing the steps that a general dental practitioner should take in order to produce an effective treatment plan for each patient. In this article the various aspects of managing the patient and the examination are discussed.","2220":"On qualification, many graduates have little idea of the finances involved in running a practice and this is a subject which will be dealt with in depth on Vocational Training courses. It is extremely important that the newly qualified learn the basis on which private fees may be calculated.","2221":"As practitioners have increased their knowledge and skills in the art of saving teeth, periradicular surgery has increased in importance. This article, the second in a short series, considers how the practitioner should incorporate the many advances in endodontic surgical techniques and materials into their practice in order to ensure more predictable results.","2222":"This paper reports three cases where permanent incisor teeth had been displaced following trauma. Owing to the circumstances at presentation the cases were not treated according to the usual recommendations. However, the final outcome in each case was excellent. These observations indicate that a prospective clinical trial is needed.","2223":"Non-carious cervical tooth loss is not always attributable to a single causative factor, as evidenced by the numerous terminologies used. In this, the first of two articles, the aetiology and prevalence of non-carious tooth loss are discussed. Guidelines are suggested as to how it may be diagnosed, prevented and monitored. A further article will cover the restorative management.","2224":"","2225":"It is generally accepted that non-surgical endodontic therapy eliminates periapical inflammation or infection and allows teeth to be restored that previously might have been extracted. However, failure does occur in a small percentage of cases. When confronted with such cases the clinician should be prepared to initiate alternative procedures, including surgery, to enhance the rate of success. This, the first of two articles, describes refinements in endodontic surgical techniques and introduces the research that has been used to develop new materials and devices.","2226":"Careful treatment planning is vital if examination and treatment of even the most routine cases is to proceed smoothly. This is the first of a short series of articles in which the authors detail the steps that a general dental practitioner should take in order to produce an effective treatment plan for each patient. In this, the first paper, the steps necessary to accurately record the information required in formulation of the plan are outlined. A second article will deal with matters concerning patient management and the examination.","2227":"Missing anterior teeth are commonly replaced immediately with partial dentures, but this may cause embarrassing problems and a poor aesthetic appearance. This paper describes a technique for replacing anterior teeth using the natural tooth as a pontic with a resin-bonded cast metal framework. The main advantage of this technique is that a fixed restoration is provided on the same day as the tooth is removed, providing a major psychological benefit to the patient and maintaining the aesthetics. The short-term results are promising- and recent advances in adhesive dentistry mean that the long-term result should be equally as good.","2228":"It has been claimed that glass-ionomer cements possess properties that could make them the \"ideal' restorative material. In the light of current disquiet about the safety of dental amalgam, are glass-ionomer cements likely to become the replacement materials of choice?","2229":"This article reports a case of a maxillary second premolar which on presentation was partially erupted, and which resisted attempts at orthodontic extrusion. The crown of the tooth was eventually restored using an adhesive composite onlay technique. The patient subsequently complained of pain and the root of the tooth showed radiographic evidence of resorption. The root of the extracted tooth had a vital pulp but massive external resorption was evident, with repair with bone-like material.","2230":"Generalized idiopathic apical root resorption is an unusual finding, especially in adolescents. This report describes a case in which the root resorption was an incidental finding in a patient referred for orthodontic treatment after suffering trauma to a central incisor. It emphasizes the need for adequate clinical and radiological examination before undertaking active orthodontic treatment.","2231":"Paraesthesia and anaesthesia of the mental nerve may result from a variety of pathological conditions, and in persistent cases of orofacial sensory disturbance thorough clinical assessment, including CT scanning, is vital to exclude underlying systemic or neoplastic disease. This paper presents three patients with right mental nerve dysfunction, and reviews the aetiology of mental nerve paraesthesia and anaesthesia.","2232":"","2233":"","2234":"","2235":"","2236":"","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"Treating anxious children is a challenge that many dentists face. Not only do anxious children find it difficult to cope with dental treatment but dentists also find it difficult to cope with anxious children. This article is intended to simplify the management of anxious children in general dental practice. Behavioural management, the coordination of the whole dental team, treatment planning and the use of inhalation sedation will be discussed.","2240":"It is well documented that surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar may damage the inferior alveolar nerve. Assessing the likelihood of injury depends to a great extent on preoperative radiographic examination, to determine the proximity of the tooth to the nerve. If the nerve and tooth are closely related the roots should be divided and removed separately. In the case reported here, elective sagittal splitting of the mandible was used to gain access to an impacted lower third molar, which was intimately involved with the inferior alveolar nerve.","2241":"The number of dental computer-aided design\/computer-aided manufacture (CAD\/CAM) systems commercially available is growing. These systems range in complexity and application, from manual copy milling of inlays to full computer-controlled systems with a complex library of tooth forms enabling the automated production of crowns and bridges. All CAD\/CAM systems permit the production of restorations at the chairside and, at least in theory, eliminate potential inaccuracies associated with the traditional, multistage production of indirect restorations. Their use also minimizes cross-infection. However, the capital costs of these systems are great and a high throughput of restorations is required in order to achieve financial viability. Long-term clinical studies are required before a final judgement may be made of the use of these relatively new systems.","2242":"Replacement of missing teeth with fixed bridgework often involves producing full crown retainers on teeth on both sides of an edentulous space. Unfortunately, this approach can result in the destruction of much healthy tooth tissue, and the clinician must balance the benefits of replacing missing teeth with the amount of tooth preparation required. Current thinking in restorative dentistry places the preservation of tooth tissue at a premium, and most practitioners are happy to use techniques that embrace this philosophy. Because of this, cantilever bridges have an increasing role in dental practice, where the replacement for a missing tooth or teeth has one or more abutments on only one side of the edentulous space, being unsupported at the other. Cantilever bridges fall into several types, depending on the number of abutments and types of retainers. This article describes the various cantilever bridge designs, considers the biomechanics of these restorations, and provides guidelines for their clinical use.","2243":"The study reported here was undertaken to ascertain the efficiency and adequacy of the Emergency Dental Services in Birmingham. Even after the inception of the new contract in 1990, too many registered patients appeared to be attending the Birmingham hospitals or contacting their doctors for dental treatment which could and should have been provided by their own dentist. Overall, the results showed that the service provided by Birmingham dentists before 10.30 p.m. is more than adequate, and that most dentists are acting in accordance with the FHSA guidelines relating to the new contract.","2244":"","2245":"There is no single management strategy for dealing with open bites, which vary greatly in presentation and severity. The general dental practitioner is recommended to assess treatment need on whether the open bite is a problem to the patient: if it is not, then no remedial treatment may be required. To aid the practitioner in the often difficult decision-making process, in this paper the possible causes of open bite malocclusion are reviewed, together with the methods currently available for treatment of this condition and the uncertainties inherent in the prognosis. The need for treatment is also discussed, to assist the general dental practitioner in deciding as to whether referral is necessary.","2246":"Dental radiographs are required for monitoring many aspects of the dental care of children. This article reviews the current guidelines for taking dental radiographs of children, with particular reference to diagnosing caries, monitoring growth and development and managing trauma. There are a number of practical difficulties in taking radiographs of this age group, which are also discussed. The use of selection criteria to assist the clinician in choosing the optimal radiograph examination is recommended.","2247":"The effect of removal of the first premolar on the facial profile is controversial, and some orthodontists prefer to extract the second permanent molar as an alternative. However, this procedure is not widely practised in spite of the many advantages claimed for it. The arguments for and against the technique are described here. Practising orthodontists should take all these arguments into account when planning treatment.","2248":"Several types of developmental anomaly of the teeth have been identified. In this article the authors describe three patients who presented with impacted teeth in the maxillary sinuses.","2249":"Destructive periodontal disease is found in a significant number of adult patients. At present there is no reliable method of determining the presence of active periodontal disease, other than retrospectively. Tests are being developed that rely on various markers of periodontal disease activity but all of those produced to date have limitations. It is to be hoped that reliable tests that can be used at the chairside will help the general dental practitioner to combat periodontal disease before it progresses too far.","2250":"","2251":"A group of Maltese dental surgeons and final-year dental students from the Department of Dental Surgery, University of Malta, recently returned from a 2-week stay in Korce, Albania.

In this paper a model is described to help our understanding of the processes of communication between dentist and patient. This model, together with evidence from empirical research, is used to advise general dental practitioners on how to improve their communication skills.","2254":"Continuing from a previous paper, the authors outline methods that dental practitioners should use in making decisions in clinical practice. Using the analysis techniques described in both articles the dentist will be able to focus on key issues in the decision-making process and, perhaps as importantly, ignore issues that are peripheral. This article demonstrates a method (decision analysis) in which the practitioner can incorporate this information into the process of deciding which dental treatment to offer.","2255":"One of the most prevalent infectious diseases that dental practitioners have to treat is periodontal disease. Antimicrobial and antibiotic agents have been developed that can be applied topically with no deleterious side-effects and reaching greater concentrations at the disease site than such agents given systemically. Used in conjunction with the mechanical debridement of deep pockets of disease, these agents appear to enhance the effectiveness of treatment. This approach is likely to feature more and more in the routine management of periodontal disease.","2256":"As a result of people keeping their teeth longer, modern dentists are encountering more partially dentate patients and difficult restorative problems. It is possible to solve some of the problems caused by the unusual angulations and undercutting when the remaining teeth of partially dentate patients start to drift by using the hinge clasp. The authors describe the types of device available and outline the advantages (and disadvantages) of its use.","2257":"An anxious patient may experience an uncontrollable increase in ventilatory effort, far in excess of the body's metabolic needs, to such a degree that profound changes are induced in the cardiovascular and neurological systems. This abnormal drive to breathe rapidly leads to a reduction in the tension of carbon dioxide in alveolar gas and arterial blood and to mild alkalosis. The outward expression of these disturbances can be alarming for both patient and dentist, but for the physiologist searching for underlying mechanisms it is intriguing. The cursory coverage of this subject in some textbooks and lecture courses is regrettable when one considers that hyperventilation is not uncommon in a dental patient. This article examines the causes, signs, symptoms and management of acute hyperventilation.","2258":"","2259":"Non-accidental injury (NAI) to children is quite common. Many of the injuries are manifest in the head, particularly the face and dental tissues, and the dentist, whether in practice, community or hospital based, is therefore well placed to identify early signs of child abuse. It is a dentist's duty to become familiar with the types of injury suggestive of NAI, and the course of action they should take if a suspected case occurs.","2260":"This paper reports a case of limited mandibular movement caused by the rare condition of bilateral coronoid hyperplasia. Dental surgeons should be aware of the possibility of this condition when encountering patients with movement problems in the mandible.","2261":"A necessary step in attempting to frame a rational decision about managing dental disease is to evaluate the clinical outcomes. This article discusses how the patient's view of the worth or value of a dental health state can be quantified, how this can contribute to the development of the Quality Adjusted Tooth Year (QATY) as a dental variation of the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) known in medicine, and how the dental practitioner can use this technique to decide which treatment is best for a particular patient.","2262":"This article describes clinical details concerning the use of a single-arch straightwire appliance in the mandibular arch and continues from a previous article in the Jan\/Feb issue.","2263":"Many patients attend their dentist for advice, and often treatment, for tooth wear. Poor appearance and inadequate function are the most common presenting complaints but occasionally treatment is needed for acute or chronic pain or sensitivity. Although patients often prefer a fixed replacement for the missing tooth structure this is not always possible or appropriate. This article presents the practical aspects of managing patients with advanced tooth wear using removable partial dentures.","2264":"","2265":"The management of severe lack of teeth in the dental arch presents the clinician with a number of difficulties. In this paper, the second in a series on hypodontia, the problems are outlined and suggestions made as how best to overcome them.","2266":"This paper reports on a form of stomatitis and glossitis associated with extremely prominent circumvalate papillae in two patients who consumed excessive amounts of mint-flavoured sweets.","2267":"Supernumerary teeth are relatively common in the general population and appear to be more likely to occur in patients with a family history of such teeth. It is important that these teeth are identified and in some cases removed before undertaking orthodontic treatment. This article describes two patients who presented with supernumeraries, and their treatment.","2268":"The aetiology and pathogenesis of non-carious loss of tooth tissue are not fully understood, especially with respect to the cervical area of teeth. In this article the authors describe the current state of knowledge and emphasize the practitioner's duty to become aware of the pathogenesis of these lesions.","2269":"Sufferers of cerebral palsy often have difficulty in chewing, speaking and swallowing because of the involuntary muscle spasms caused by their condition. This problem also makes it very difficult or even impossible for them to wear complete mandibular dentures. This article describes a cerebral palsy sufferer who was successfully fitted with a complete lower denture stabilized by osseointegrated implants. It may be possible to apply the techniques used for people with similar problems.","2270":"The straightwire appliance, by the refinements of its design, has revolutionized fixed-appliance orthodontics. Treatment is facilitated by the use of many preformed components and the use of unsightly and troublesome auxiliary springs is largely removed. However, the straightwire appliance is a precision instrument and must be used precisely, or the results of treatment will be seriously compromised. This is the first of two articles, in which the design principles and clinical management of the straightwire appliance (in one dental arch only) will be considered.","2271":"This is the second of two articles to examine the periodontal considerations necessary in restorative dentistry. In it, the authors look closely at the considerations specific to fixed and removable prosthodontics.","2272":"Recent advances in restorative and surgical materials and techniques have increased the treatment options available for patients who are missing an anterior tooth. The factors influencing the management of such patients and the orthodontic implications of these treatment options are discussed in this paper.","2273":"A posterior crossbite may pose long-term risk through causing associated displacement in the mandibular path of closure. In this paper the authors review the current opinions on treatment of such a problem.","2274":"Restorative dentistry may be defined as the branch of dentistry that deals with the restoration or replacement of lost tooth structure, teeth or oral tissues. The practice of restorative dentistry has a reciprocal relationship with the maintenance of periodontal health. Untreated periodontal disease will compromise the success of restorative dentistry, and poor restorative treatment may have adverse effects on the periodontium by increasing accumulation of plaque and inducing changes in the composition of the plaque flora. Excessive occlusal stress and direct physical injury to the gingiva produced by the various dental procedures may also affect periodontal health. This is the first of two articles to look in depth at the periodontal considerations necessary in restorative dentistry, and covers the factors important in operative dentistry. The second article, which will be published in a later issue, will look at the situation with regard to prosthodontics.","2275":"Health Board General Managers have overall responsibility for the efficiency, effectiveness and economy of the management of dental services within their area. In Scotland, six health boards cover islands with a total population of over 80,000. This article looks at the island areas in Scotland which have unique difficulties.","2276":"Our self-perceptions are all influenced to some extent by the media. The increase in sales of diet plans immediately after Christmas only serves to highlight the fact that many people (consciously or subconsciously) are aware of the effect that advertisements have on our lives. The weight of most people is controlled by a combination of diet and homoeostatic control and remains relatively constant, but weight loss has a more profound and sinister effect for others. Unexplained dental erosion can occasionally be found during dental examinations and, despite careful questioning, a definitive diagnosis may prove elusive. In these patients, once the more common causes of dental erosion have been eliminated, the eating disorders should be considered. In this paper, the effects of psychological conditions affecting the diet on the dentition will be discussed.","2277":"","2278":"The following case report demonstrates the tissue changes that may occur when sodium hypochlorite, an irrigant used for debridement of the root canal system, is inadvertently injected into periapical tissues.","2279":"The preschool years extend from birth up to the age of 4 years and represent the time of most rapid growth and development. During this period the child progresses from the edentulous state to having a fully erupted and functional primary dentition. Also during the preschool years important stages in development of underlying permanent teeth occur. Good management of the preschool child is an excellent practice builder: it leads to a motivated patient, happy to undergo any treatment necessary, and encourages confidence and improves the attitudes to oral health of other members of the family.","2280":"Oral lichen planus is occasionally associated with chronic active hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis. This paper describes a patient who presented with oral lichen planus and proved to have chronic active hepatitis, evidently related to hepatitis B virus infection. Oral lichen planus appears occasionally to be associated with systemic infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viruses, particularly in patients from southern Europe.","2281":"Dental surgeons, who are entitled to prescribe drugs to their patients, have a duty to be conversant with the rapid changes occurring in pharmacology and to inform their patients about the proper use of the medicines they are given. This article outlines the sources of information on drugs that are available to dental practitioners, especially the Dental Practitioners' Formulary.","2282":"To ensure that root canal treatment is successful the clinician must accurately determine the working length of the root canal. Traditionally this has been determined using radiography, but electronic apex locators are increasingly being used. This article describes the locators available, the principles behind their use and gives guidelines on how and where to use them.","2283":"The pit and fissure sealants that are commercially available today are designed to prevent plaque, bacteria and carbohydrates from entering the fissures and causing caries. This article will concentrate on contemporary diagnostic problems and indications for fissure sealing. Brief mention will be made of innovations in materials and techniques.","2284":"The first three articles of this series have emphasized the importance of careful treatment planning in conventional fixed bridgework. In this, the fourth article, attention to detail continues to be the theme. The clinical procedures for fixed bridgework (tooth preparation, temporization, impression taking and occlusal registration) will be discussed.","2285":"","2286":"A 63-year-old Caucasian man presented to his general dental practitioner with a spontaneously exfoliated lower central incisor and hair growing from the socket. Examination revealed a hair-filled sinus from the skin of the median aspect of his chin to the socket of the exfoliated tooth. This was confirmed histopathologically following excision biopsy.","2287":"As all dental practitioners are aware, patients suffering from dental pain often self-medicate with over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics in order to alleviate their symptoms: indeed, some patients seem to view the use of these drugs as a means of avoiding the need for dental attendance altogether. The use (and abuse) of such medication is entirely under the control of the patient. The study reported in this article shows which commonly available analgesics are chosen by patients and how effective they are considered to be. The authors also assess the overall pattern of analgesic self-medication, and discuss the problem of over-consumption.","2288":"The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) and Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index have been developed to assess need and outcome of orthodontic treatment. In this paper the authors evaluate the occlusal change and orthodontic treatment need of 100 consecutively started courses of orthodontic treatment at least 1 year after all retention measures had ceased using these indices.","2289":"This is the second in a two-part series on oral cancer. Part 1 focused on the surgical aspects of treatment and morbidity associated with oral cancer. In this article aspects of prosthodontic management of patients with maxillary tumours are considered, with emphasis on promoting optimal rehabilitation.","2290":"The human race has had to endure infections for as long as it has been on earth, and has developed efficient natural defence mechanisms to combat them. Modern medicine aims to augment these natural mechanisms, to help speed up resolution of infection and decrease morbidity and mortality.","2291":"","2292":"","2293":"Much attention has been focused recently on barriers to dental care, particularly for patients with disabilities, from the perspective of the patient and the dental team. Treatment of patients with haemorrhagic disorders may cause a certain amount of anxiety in dental staff. The authors of this paper aim to reduce this anxiety by clarifying confusion between the haemorrhagic disorders and making recommendations concerning the dental care of such patients.","2294":"Necrotizing sialometaplasia, a benign self-limiting disease of minor salivary glands, may be confused both clinically and histologically with squamous cell carcinoma or a minor salivary gland neoplasm. Its sinister appearance has lead to misdiagnosis and some patients have undergone extensive surgery unnecessarily. This paper describes the salient features of necrotizing sialometaplasia and discusses the management of a patient with the condition.","2295":"The management of impacted third molars, particularly the indications for their removal, is judged against a constantly changing climate of professional opinion, public attitudes to treatment and the funding of healthcare. These changes highlight the practitioner's dilemma: to remove an impacted wisdom tooth or to leave well alone? This article discusses the indications for and risks of wisdom tooth removal, and suggests guidelines for dealing with the dilemma.","2296":"The first two articles in this series dealt with patient assessment and selection for bridgework and the available options in conventional bridgework design. Having decided to provide a conventional bridge for a patient, the practitioner must plan ahead so that the clinical execution of the bridge proceeds smoothly and successfully. Time taken to plan ahead carefully will always benefit both patient and operator.","2297":"Discoloration of the oral mucosa may cause embarrassment to sufferers. In this case report, the author describes a simple, versatile and relatively non-invasive technique for treating unsightly racial pigmentation of the oral mucosa.","2298":"This is the first of two articles concerning the surgical and prosthodontic rehabilitation of patients who have undergone surgery for cancer of the mouth. This article discusses the morbidity associated with treatment and its effect on quality of life. The second article will consider aspects of the prosthodontic rehabilitation particularly with regard to obturator construction following maxillectomy.","2299":"A system has been designed to maximize the clinical experience that dental students receive in the discipline of conservative dentistry. Data on each operative procedure to be carried out for each patient under a student's care is entered into a customized computer database and each student is given a printout of this information every 4 months. Students feel that this system prospectively identifies areas of treatment in which they may lack experience and provides opportunities to review and amend any inaccurate information. This paper explains how the system was set up and administered.","2300":"","2301":"The number of people receiving organ transplants has dramatically increased over the last decade. It is now likely that a dental surgeon will come across patients who have undergone transplantation. This paper considers the particular problems that these patients are likely to present their general dental practitioners.","2302":"Successful crown and bridgework relies heavily upon the precise use of temporary restorations. It is the importance of this stage in crown and bridgework, perhaps more than any other, that is so often underestimated. This article reviews the materials currently available for temporary restorations and assesses the various methods of construction.","2303":"Most patients who have lost teeth prefer a fixed prosthesis to a removable prosthesis. In this, the second article in the series, we consider the principles of design that are applicable to conventional fixed bridgework and which will enable the clinician to select the prosthesis most appropriate for a partially dentate patient.","2304":"The long-term use of sugar-containing medicines has long been considered a cause of dental caries in children. Several studies have examined the role of prescription medicines in dental decay, but what about those that can be bought over the counter and that are used infrequently? In this paper practitioners are advised on how to encourage parents to use sugar-free medicines for the sake of their children's teeth.","2305":"Before a dental practitioner examines a patient he or she must obtain the patient's consent to do so, and before undertaking any form of complex or expensive treatment the patient's consent must be in writing. Failure to do this could leave the practitioner open to prosecution for assault, and liable for damages in a civil court.","2306":"The provision of emergency care by dental practitioners in the Manchester area was assessed by a postal questionnaire. A 54.8% response rate was obtained. The average number of emergency patients treated by respondents per working day was 3.2; the practitioners seeing these patients principally by 'double booking' appointments. One-third of the respondents claimed to provide specific slots for treating dental emergencies, which could be related to the amount of NHS work undertaken. Out-of-hours emergencies were delegated to a third party by 46.3% of practitioners who replied to the questionnaire.","2307":"","2308":"The elderly population (people of 65 years and older), especially the compromised elderly, places an overwhelming demand on the health care system in the USA. Dentists must provide services to all segments of the elderly population, but the compromised elderly are labelled as 'poor' candidates for dental treatment because they are unlikely to cooperate, find it difficult to get to the dental surgery, or cannot pay for professional services. The authors of this paper have developed guidelines for on-site patient management using a team approach and a low-cost, portable treatment system for providing removable prosthodontic services using ligh-cured denture resin. The system is cost-effective, reduces chairside time and requires minimal patient cooperation but does not compromise the quality of care. Treatment can be provided in non-traditional settings with family members and support staff on-hand. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated by its use in hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and private residences.","2309":"The authors set up a study to investigate the levels of stress experienced by dental students and the students' perceptions of the sources of stress. Levels of stress among students were found to be high, particularly during the first 2 years of dental school. Sources of stress included the practice of conservative dental surgery, dealing with administration and dealing with clinical demonstrators.","2310":"This article reviews the aetiology and clinical features of the increasingly common problem of localized loss of anterior tooth tissue in the young adult. The management of the problem is highlighted, with emphasis placed on preservation of the tooth structure and the use of modern materials and techniques.","2311":"Failure to achieve good patient management will result in poor patient co-operation and potential failure of treatment. In this article, ways of establishing and maintaining good communication between the dental team and the patient are discussed.","2312":"Bowling green related injuries are rare. In this case study, the author describes a lucky escape from extensive facial injury for a young man.","2313":"Orthodontic indices have been used for many years to assess the severity of a patient's malocclusion and hence determine the need for treatment. Two indices--the Index of Orthodontics Treatment Need (IOTN) and the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index--have recently been developed. The use of indices is likely to become more widespread in the future so that more uniformity is achieved in assessing need for treatment and its success. This article describes how the two indices are applied.","2314":"","2315":"","2316":"During the last two decades notable advances have been made in the management of periodontal diseases. A better understanding of the basic biological principles of periodontal wound healing has provided a sound foundation for placing greater emphasis on conservative treatment regimes, including non-surgical treatments, less radical surgical techniques and the use of guided regenerative procedures to restore connective tissue attachment lost during disease progression. The consequence of these advances is that, even in cases of severely advanced periodontitis, careful planning and execution of treatment ensures that the disease does not continue to progress and the integrity of the dentition is maintained.","2317":"The brown bear is one of the most persecuted animals in the world. In Greece, Turkey, Pakistan and India they are used as dancing spectacles by gypsies. The mother is killed so that the cubs can be captured at a very early age and subjected to training that involves extreme cruelty: starvation, beatings and red-hot metal plates, as well as rings and chains through their noses and lips, are used to make the animals stand on their hind feet and mimic a dance routine so that their handlers can collect money in the streets. The author describes the treatment of the first bears to benefit from the facilities at the new Bear Protection Centre set up by Arcturos.","2318":"Over the past decade there have been many developments in the field of adhesive bridgework, a conservative treatment option for the patient with intact and unrestored abutment teeth. However, many situations still exist where resin bond retained bridges are unsuitable and more conventional techniques are called for. Although adhesive bridges are potentially less damaging to tooth structure, conventional bridgework has greater implications in terms of damage to abutment teeth and surrounding tissues. It is important to execute a carefully devised treatment plan skillfully if problems are to be avoided. This paper, the first in a series of 5 articles offering biologically based, practical guidelines to the dental surgeon, discusses how patients should be selected for these procedures.","2319":"Tooth wear is becoming more common in both adults and children. The triad of attrition, abrasion and erosion has been known for many years, but the contribution of erosion (irreversible loss of dental hard tissue due to a chemical process not involving bacteria, or the loss of tooth surface not directly associated with mechanical or traumatic factors or caries) to excessive loss of tooth tissue is now being emphasized. The authors of this paper examine the problem and suggest ways of overcoming it.","2320":"Our understanding of the types of hepatitis described previously as non-A, non-B hepatitis has been revolutionized by the discovery of two new viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis E virus. HCV is transmitted parenterally, and poses a potential occupational hazard to health care workers, including dental staff. No vaccine is currently available, and it is important that an assessment of infection risk is made available to clinicians.","2321":"The relatively new technique of obturation using Thermafil endodontic obturators is claimed by the manufacturers to use gutta percha of a more linear structure than conventional gutta percha, and so provide a seal at least equal to laterally condensed material. In this article the authors describe the practical use of this widely marketed technique. Studies which have so far evaluated this technique are reviewed and its advantages and shortcomings discussed.","2322":"It is fairly common for a dental surgeon to come across patients with foreign bodies in the nasal cavity. In this paper we report an unusual case of a nose stud retainer clip being displaced into the nasal cavity by trauma, and its discovery on radiographs taken to assess dental injuries. We also present a review of the literature since 1982, and assess the possible sequelae to nasal foreign bodies.","2323":"Computer-based teaching has been used in the Department of Child Dental Health of the University of Bristol Dental School for almost 10 years to provide students with additional practice in the assessment of malocclusion and the planning of orthodontic treatment. In this article, the authors describe a study of the usefulness of computer-based learning packages for general practitioners and offer guidelines for others wishing to set up such a scheme.","2324":"The pulp capping materials currently available do not adhere to dentine but cover it and therefore extensive removal of tooth tissue is necessary to expose sufficient dentine for the adhesives used to secure the restoration (the adhesives do not adhere to the capping material). The authors describe how two new pulp capping materials have been developed, which combine the properties required for pulp capping with an ability to adhere to dentine.","2325":"Restoring the maxillary arch by using a suprastructure retained by a Konus crown means that the patient can remove the crown for oral hygiene. This construction enables large embrasure spaces to be avoided without compromising phonetics, that is, without adversely affecting the patient's speech. It also enables the dental surgeon to monitor the tooth and implant abutments and the soft tissues around them. In this article we demonstrate successful restoration of the maxillary arch by the use of Konus crowns on a combination of implants and natural teeth.","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"Many people requesting new complete dentures will have worn dentures (often the same set) successfully for many years. These people are experienced in wearing dentures of a particular shape and size and are familiar with the polished surface shape, the position of the teeth, the base extension and the vertical dimension of occlusion. By maintaining, or slightly modifying these aspects to overcome faults that have developed, patients should find it easier to accept and learn to use their new dentures.","2333":"Ectodermal dysplasia syndromes are extremely rare. Hypohydrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) is classically an X-linked recessive condition affecting males, although a clinically identical autosomal recessive form of this condition has been described. The patient described in this article is female, who was initially thought to be a manifesting carrier for X-linked HED. However, the pedigree and examination of other family members suggest that she has the rarer autosomal recessive form. The patient is also edentulous and requires complete dentures, a concept regarded by many as a novelty in young children.","2334":"Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and usually occurs in the head and neck region. Most basal cell carcinomas grow slowly and behave in a relatively benign, nonaggressive fashion, but a proportion of them grow rapidly and infiltrate the structures beneath the skin. The dental surgeon may well come across this tumour and is in an ideal situation to recognize it. The aim of this article is to describe the clinical features of this common skin tumour and to provide a differential diagnosis. Early recognition of a basal cell carcinoma by the dental practitioner means that the patient can be referred for a specialist opinion and the tumour treated while it is still small.","2335":"Using the Scanora radiography unit, most radiographic examinations in the dento-maxillofacial region can be rapidly performed to produce exceptionally high quality images. The Scanora unit uses the principles of narrow beam radiography and spiral tomography. Starting with a panoramic overview as a scout image, a large number of dental and maxillofacial imaging procedures and projections can be selected, all of which are computer controlled and automatically executed. The authors provide examples from their experience with over 10,000 patients and more than 30,000 examinations.","2336":"The preparation for a porcelain veneer may leave the patient with an unsightly and sensitive tooth. Nevertheless, tooth preparation may be necessary to provide space for a veneer with the desired ceramic shade and opacity. The author describes a technique for the construction of a provisional veneer restoration.","2337":"Although a fixed appliance may ultimately be required to correct a malocclusion, the author gives examples of how the use of a removable appliance initially could simplify the treatment. A removable appliance enables the benefits of growth and development that are occurring in young patients to be enlisted in the treatment, and thereby reduces the overall treatment time.","2338":"Much routine dento-alveolar surgery can be performed comfortably under local anaesthesia. If this is not possible, and the patient's health permits, day-case general anaesthesia is a suitable alternative, thus reserving valuable inpatient facilities for patients who require more major surgical procedures or for medically compromised patients. Although anaesthetic techniques are becoming increasingly effective, improvement in postoperative pain relief has been less than satisfactory. The misconception that pain is an inevitable consequence of surgery and the difficulty in measuring pain have impeded progress in postoperative pain control. Despite these limitations, pain-free oral surgery is a real prospect for most patients, and the aim of this article is to highlight those factors which contribute to its achievement.","2339":"Early diagnosis of the developmental anomaly hemifacial microsomia is essential for the optimal management of affected patients. However, for a number of reasons this condition is often difficult to recognize. This article discusses the diagnostic problems and gives relevant points for the clinical assessment of facial asymmetry.","2340":"","2341":"It is possible, often years after provision of a satisfactory denture, that an abutment tooth or restoration may fracture requiring a crown to be constructed. Ideally this should be fabricated incorporating the design features required and a new partial denture made. However, resources such as time and finance may preclude this. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique whereby a crown can be made to an existing partial denture.","2342":"There are no clear recommendations for prescribing antibiotics to patients taking warfarin. The risks of enhancing the anticoagulant properties of warfarin when it is taken concurrently with an antibiotic are seldom discussed. This article attempts to address this problem and to alert dentists to the risks of prescribing antibiotics to patients taking warfarin. A regimen is recommended for patients taking warfarin who require antibiotic dental treatment.","2343":"","2344":"The need for continuing education in orthodontics is recognised by many practitioners and the demand for post-graduate courses is high. The limitations of such courses, particularly the short technique type, are recognised and within the West Midlands the value of a longer term clinical attachment has been emphasised. The West Midlands has a well established orthodontic consultant service with fifteen NHS and one honorary consultant; the specialist practitioner service is small by national standards. All of the orthodontic consultants have long supported the clinical assistant post as a valuable vehicle for practitioners' continuing education. Building on the example given by the consultants in the four Thames Regions, a structured, centralised academic programme has been developed to enhance the clinical training given during these two year posts.","2345":"","2346":"Adhesive bridgework is now an accepted alternative to conventional bridgework especially in teeth with minimal tooth substance loss and where occlusal forces are not excessive. Several designs have been described and these can be divided into bridges with perforated or non-perforated retainers. The perforated design was described by Rochette while the non-perforated design was pioneered by Livaditis and Thompson and became popularly known as the \"Maryland bridge\". It is now common practice to simply sandblast non-precious alloy retainers which are then bonded with specific chemically active adhesives.","2347":"A widely held belief among British dentists is that dentists in other European Countries (EC) fare better financially than their British counterparts. This belief prompted this comparative study of dentistry in the EC. Part 1 deals with disease levels and manpower considerations. Part 2 will deal with the financing of dental care in EC countries.","2348":"","2349":"Clinical Audit is rapidly becoming an integral part of dental practice and in the hospital service much of it is now computer based. In this article the author describes his experiences of implementing audit, which may be of help to dental practitioners who wish to start effective audit schemes of their own.","2350":"The use of crown lengthening surgery as an adjunct to restorative therapy was first suggested by Rosen and Gitnick. This technique is designed to increase the clinical crown heights of teeth requiring restoration following extensive wear through attrition, abrasion and erosion. This loss of tooth tissue and resulting clinical crown height may be localized to a few teeth or affect the entire dentition. This clinical problem is reflected by the increasing number of reports of treatment of the worn dentition.","2351":"","2352":"Internal root resorption is classically described as resulting from long standing chronic inflammation in the pulp. The resorption may be transient, where lacunae present within the canal walls, or progressive, where the odontoblasts are destroyed and no predentine can be laid down. The diagnosis of this process and its subsequent treatment is described in this series of eight patients with internal root resorption.","2353":"","2354":"","2355":"","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"Dentists frequently fail to provide dental technicians with the design information necessary for the construction of removable partial dentures. The computerization of dental practices and the development of appropriate knowledge-based systems could provide a powerful tool for improving this aspect of dental care. This article describes one such system currently under development which is an example of the kind of additional facility that will become available for those practices with the necessary hardware.","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"A training scheme for general dental practitioners (GDPs), based on that recommended by the British Orthodontic Standards Working Party, has been set up within Northern Ireland. It has been developed to encourage and support interested GDPs to diagnose and treat suitable patients orthodontically within their own practice, to widen the scope of their orthodontic expertise and to increase experience through clinical attachments to consultant units, backed up by theoretical and practical sessions. The aim of the scheme was to heighten interest, identify suitable patients and to increase the accuracy of referral for advice and treatment elsewhere. It is hoped that this framework may be of interest and value to those in other centres, who may be considering ways and means of making orthodontic treatment more available. By following this pattern, it is hoped that in due course, this integrated approach of clinical attachment and theoretical module may progress towards the setting up of a national network, adequately funded by the Department of Health.","2366":"","2367":"Accurate judgement of size, depth and angle is required in the practice of restorative dentistry. Most assessments are made simply by visual examination, and these judgements are therefore often subjective; the limitation of visual perception renders such judgements inaccurate and subject to variation. The use of standardized objects to allow size or angle judgement by direct comparison improves accuracy, and their routine use may improve the quality of restorative treatment.","2368":"","2369":"Wear of the surface of the teeth is a natural consequence of ageing, but various conditions can render it pathological. In this article the authors describe two strategies for obtaining sensitive, personal information from patients who may be reluctant to disclose such details to a stranger.","2370":"The rapid increase in the use of porcelain veneers is a result of the demand for a minimally invasive, colour and contour stable restoration. However, such restorations are not equally successful in all patients. This article describes the careful treatment planning and patient selection necessary to avoid problems and to ensure that the best result is achieved with porcelain veneers.","2371":"This is the first paper in a series which will deal with exodontia and minor oral surgery for child patients. This first article is concerned with medical conditions that influence the management of children; subsequent papers will consider methods of pain control and surgical techniques for young patients. The final article will give an account of our experience in the provision of exodontia and minor oral surgery for children under local anaesthesia and relative analgesia. Suggestions for further reading will be provided with the final paper.","2372":"The superior cementation strengths of the adhesive resin cements can now be used in the dental surgery for posts, crowns and bridges and for intra-oral repairs to fractured porcelain fused to metal crowns or bridges, thanks to the availability of miniature sandblasters and portable tin-platers. The author describes the techniques involved.","2373":"Wegener's granulomatosis is a disease involving renal, lung and vascular tissue, but patients also present to the general dental practitioner with intra-oral manifestations. This case study describes the early onset, progression and treatment of the presenting intra-oral manifestations and the periodontal and endodontic implications of Wegener's granulomatosis.","2374":"PTFE is widely used in industry and commercial products, but is not widely used in dentistry. This paper describes some clinical applications of thin non-rigid unsintered PTFE tape which is inert, sterilizable by heat, non-stick, an effective barrier to moisture and chemicals, and is opaque.","2375":"Comparatively little has been published regarding the recently developed (and rapidly developing) digital imaging dental radiographic system known as radiovisiography (RVG).

If a patient or parent enquires about how orthodontic treatment might affect their child's playing, what advice could you give them?","2380":"Compared with composite resin restorative materials, which have evolved considerably since their introduction over two decades ago, the development of resin-based luting materials has been slow. Only with the introduction of restorative techniques such as resin-bonded bridgework, porcelain veneers, and composite resin or ceramic inlays, have resin-based luting materials gained importance.","2381":"Products for lightening teeth are appearing on the market with ever-increasing frequency. Heavy advertising, coupled with heightened public awareness and expectations of an aesthetically pleasing smile, have resulted in increased patient demand for treatment to improve all types of tooth discoloration. Although it is the role of the dental profession to provide the services demanded by the consumer, it is also our duty to be discerning and to re-assess continually the techniques we use, for both efficacy and safety. To do this, long-term follow up of clinical techniques is essential. This paper contains the clinical results of teeth treated over 4.5 years using the hydrochloric acid\/pumice microabrasion technique to remove enamel opacities and pigmentation. The subject under discussion is that of enamel discoloration: intrinsic staining with its origins in dentine, such as that caused by the ingestion of tetracycline antibiotics during odontogenesis, is not amenable to this form of surface treatment.","2382":"This is the second of two articles discussing the minor oral surgery\/orthodontic interface. The vital role played by the general dental practitioner in monitoring the normal development of the occlusion and the early diagnosis of the local causes of malocclusion was emphasized in the first article.

This case study describes its use in a patient with a complete anterior overbite together with severe tilting of some of the maxillary molar teeth. Early tooth loss, which had not been restored, was probably a significant aetiological factor in the patient's condition.","2384":"The number of patients seeking orthodontic treatment has increased over the last decade. A proportion of these patients present with minor irregularities due to the so-called 'local causes' of malocclusion, many of which require surgical treatment. Some general dental practitioners have taken up the challenge of correcting these causes and the resulting malocclusion themselves; however, all practitioners must be aware of the treatment options available and the surgical and orthodontic considerations to be taken into account. This will allow informed discussion with patients. In this, the first of two papers, the management of ectopically positioned teeth is discussed.","2385":"With a conventional preparation marginal microleakage is often observed at the cervical margin of porcelain laminate veneers. The leakage seems to be associated with the presence of cracks in the adjacent enamel layer. Removing the defective enamel by bevelling the cervical margin prior to cementation appears to be effective in controlling the microleakage. A modified veneer preparation which incorporates this additional short bevel is described in this paper.","2386":"While subgingival scaling and root planing are effective at removing plaque, the use of periodic subgingival irrigation with a antimicrobial solution could be a useful adjunct. This paper initially discusses the management of inflammatory periodontal diseases in general, covering current mechanical therapy and chemical antimicrobials, before describing pulsed oral irrigation in more detail.","2387":"The principles of treatment in patients with cleft lip and palate have recently been outlined in Dental Update.

This paper reviews the research and outlines a management system which transfers readily to clinical practice.","2405":"A case is reported where cutaneous irritation by orthodontic headgear was followed by a localized exacerbation of atopic eczema. It is suggested that care should be exercised when considering fitting such an appliance in an individual who suffers from atopic eczema.","2406":"The centuries-old belief that stressed individuals are more susceptible to disease has gained scientific respectability in recent years. A new interdisciplinary science, psychoneuroimmunology (or as it is now more appropriately named, psychoneuroendocrinimmunology) has been born and, judging from the number of articles appearing annually, is thriving. In essence, stressors activate the neuroendocrine axis, which in turn influences the immune system. This is a bidirectional process, since chemicals are released by activated immunological cells which alter the functioning of the endocrine and autocrine nervous systems and influence our behaviour. This article examines these interactions.","2407":"Working closely together in a general dental practice can cause many stresses and inter-personal problems. Results are presented of discussions with groups of dental practitioners, their hygienists and dental surgery assistants, indicating stressors and complaints most common in each group.","2408":"A technique is described which utilizes a light-cured periodontal dressing (Barricaid) in conjunction with the surgical exposure of palatally displaced maxillary canines.

Orthodontic treatment has also become more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing for patients. This is the second of two papers which are intended to provide an update on fixed appliance design and use, so patients can be informed of relevant advances before they are referred to a specialist for orthodontic advice. Part 1 discussed the development in brackets and archwires. Part 2 will now cover recent advances in ligatures and elastomeric ties, intraoral auxiliaries, adhesives, products to assist oral hygiene and prevention during fixed appliance treatment, and new methods of debonding.","2417":"Despite, or perhaps because of, its antiquity the lost wax casting process which we use in dentistry still produces the most accurate and durable restorations in our armamentarium. Although high-gold content alloys still act as the benchmark of quality, fit, and durability in the aggressive conditions of the mouth, their inherent cost, high density and low modulus have stimulated a search for alternatives. This has ranged widely through the metallurgical world and across the periodic table of the elements. As a result dental alloys for casting into inlays, crowns and bridges (with or without facings of dental porcelain) have become incredibly complex. This article will explain some of the reasons behind the developments.","2418":"Electrosurgery techniques have been used in dentistry as an aid to soft tissue management for nearly 60 years. However, it was not until the late 1960s that the principles of electrosurgery were understood and improved equipment became available.

Since then, both the spectrum of disease for which anticoagulation is recommended and the range of anticoagulants has widened. In addition to treatment with conventional anticoagulant drugs, many patients nowadays have an additional bleeding defect due to the therapeutic use of daily low-dose aspirin therapy, either alone or in combination with other drugs. The aim of this report is to highlight some of the important aspects of anticoagulant therapy and its relevance to dental treatment.","2437":"There have been many advances in orthodontic and restorative procedures. These can be combined to provide a very powerful tool in providing the optimum results. This article describes when a combined approach would be appropriate and discusses how the various problems are overcome.","2438":"Chronic periodontitis results in the destruction of the collagen fibre attachment to cementum, apical migration of the epithelial attachment, contamination of the exposed root surface by plaque and loss of alveolar bone. Regeneration can be defined as the restitution of lost tissues to a state which existed before destruction. As such, it is an ultimate and ideal goal and in most circumstances is currently beyond our capabilities. However, research in periodontology over the last 10 years or so has made considerable advances and is perhaps unique in proposing a new and fundamental treatment modality--guided tissue regeneration.","2439":"","2440":"Fusion of the permanent molars is a relatively uncommon dental anomaly.

The exception is the 'pregnancy epulis', where excision should only be considered if there is incomplete regression following childbirth.","2512":"Dentists and other members of the dental team are well placed to advise mothers of young babies about protecting their children's dental health, and there is general agreement that sugar is the \"arch criminal of dental caries\". However, sugars are present in a surprising range of foods, and it can be difficult to plan a diet to avoid them. This article reports on the sugar content of baby foods and drinks, and makes some policy recommendations.","2513":"In some areas, Asian communities constitute a sizeable proportion of the population around a general dental practice, yet some have never been to a dentist in the whole of their lives. A significant number of others fail to visit a dentist regularly. This two-part article aims to clarify some of the issues relating to dental care of minority groups, with particular reference to Asian communities. An outline is given of some general and dental health issues which are of particular significance to dental practitioners, as they strive to provide continuous care to the whole population. Part 1 identifies dental health problems characteristic of British Asians, Part 2 will examine some of the barriers to care.","2514":"Caries of the primary incisors is a common problem that can be arrested if recognized early enough. However, the arrested decay is unsightly. Celluloid 'strip' crown forms, used with composite resin, now allow the restoration of even the most badly decayed primary incisors. The authors describe this quick and efficient technique.","2515":"Normal haemostasis depends on a balance between coagulation and fibrinolytic processes. Because of this concept of balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis, drugs which retard or inhibit the breakdown of fibrin encourage haemostasis. Such drugs are used in patients undergoing dental extractions and as prophylactic agents to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Blood clotting factors produced by genetic engineering are now becoming available and these offer exciting prospects for the management of patients with bleeding disorders.","2516":"In order to achieve the greatest clinical benefit from the use of fluoride, we must understand its mechanism of action, so that fluoride can be given at the right time, by the best route, at the optimum dosage and in the most suitable form. The first article in this two-part series reviewed the scientific rationale behind the use of fluoride. Part 2 now illustrates fluoride therapy in practical terms, by examining nine clinical cases.","2517":"The latest generation of dentine adhesives appear to show improved bonding to dentine than did their predecessors. Therefore, in clinical situations where there is little enamel, and instead large areas of dentine to bond to, or in situations where there are smaller areas of 'critical' dentine, dentine bonding agents may be of value in optimizing the use of a wide range of composite materials. This article reviews the mode of action of dentine adhesives, and details the clinical technique for some applications.","2518":"If unusual injuries to the teeth are present, these should serve as a warning to practitioners that further investigations may be necessary. In the case reported here an undisplaced fracture of the jaw in a young child was only revealed by radiographic investigation.","2519":"Survival analysis is a versatile statistical tool that has been used in dentistry to evaluate such diverse subjects as the longevity of restorations, the natural history of caries and caries risk. It is hoped that this article will help readers to understand better such studies and make their own interpretation of the results, and even to carry out similar evaluations among their own patients.","2520":"An impacted lower third molar can sometimes be uprighted orthodontically to provide a functional tooth. Many such cases can be managed by the interested GDP, although more complex mechanics are probably best left to the specialist. This article reviews the indications for treatment, and describes appropriate techniques.","2521":"Composite and porcelain veneers offer a conservative method of masking discolouration of the teeth of younger patients. Composite veneers are the less destructive of tooth tissue, but also the less durable. This two-part article reviews the use of veneers in treating the adolescent patient. Part 1 described the clinical procedure for veneering with composites. Part 2 now gives a guide to porcelain veneer technique, and then draws some overall conclusions.","2522":"In order to achieve the greatest clinical benefit from the use of fluoride, we must understand its mechanism of action, so that fluoride can be given at the right time, by the best route, at the optimum dosage and in the most suitable form. The first article in this two-part series reviews the scientific rationale behind the use of fluoride. Part 2 will illustrate fluoride therapy in practical terms, by examining eight clinical cases.","2523":"Early recognition and action are essential elements in the management of amelogenesis imperfecta. The authors describe how a combination of prompt clinical action and preventive care were used to minimize the chances of decay and wear to the permanent dentition of a young patient suffering from this condition.","2524":"","2525":"It can be argued that all functional appliances are basically similar, using a family of common component parts. The components incorporated into a design should be chosen rationally, after consideration of the particular malocclusion to be treated. This article therefore explains functional appliances in terms of their components. It aims to give a greater understanding of the principles involved, and thus aid the practitioner in prescribing the most appropriate design for a particular clinical situation.","2526":"Wedges, when correctly selected and applied, can make an important contribution to the initial quality and the longevity of some restorations, and can greatly facilittae a number of clinical procedures. The authors outline the important role of interproximal wedges in restorative dentistry, and, in an historical perspective, describe how the principles elucidated when wedges were first employed in restorative dentistry more than 150 years ago are still applicable today.","2527":"The life of a GDP is stressful, and the reasons why dentists may experience stress in their chosen profession are many and varied. This article discusses the causes of stress, and outlines some strategies for coping with it.","2528":"Composite and porcelain veneers offer a conservative method of masking discolouration of the teeth of younger patients. Composite veneers are the less destructive of tooth tissue, but also the less durable. This two-part article reviews the use of veneers in treating the adolescent patient. Part 1 examines indications for treatment and gives a step-by-step guide to the clinical procedure for veneering with composite. Next month, Part 2 will cover porcelain veneers and draw some overall conclusions.","2529":"","2530":"","2531":"","2532":"","2533":"","2534":"","2535":"","2536":"Patients who are physically disabled often face immense problems coping with the simple tasks of everyday life. These problems are particularly acute in those patients who have lost the use of their hands or have only restricted hand use. Their ability to work, study or to participate in leisure activities may be severely impaired. This article describes how the dentist may be able to mitigate the effects of restricted hand use by constructing a variety of tools and gadgets designed to help some of these patients lead a more normal life and reduce their reliance on others.","2537":"The authors report a case of a young patient with conical midline supernumerary teeth. In cases where such supernumeraries are likely to erupt, early surgical intervention, often necessitating the administration of a general anaesthetic, should be avoided if possible. Extraction under local anaesthesia on eruption was preferred for this patient, and resulted in the normal eruption of the permanent central incisors.","2538":"The high prevalence of anomalies of number or form of teeth supports the principle that the developing dentition should be screened radiographically at least once. However, there is considerable controversy, as to when and how to screen, and increasing concern about risks from unnecessary radiation. This study presents a case of late discovery of supplemental premolars in a 14-year-old boy. Screening would have detected the supplementary teeth earlier; however, management of the patient would not have been significantly affected.","2539":"For the best possible report to be made, it is necessary for the appropriate specimen to be taken and transported in the appropriate manner, and then correctly processed. In the second of a four-part series aiming to 'demystify' the subject of pathology, the author critically evaluates biopsy techniques. The next two articles in this series will look in some detail at the pathologist's report and special laboratory investigations.","2540":"One of the most difficult clinical tasks a practitioner may have to undertake is the removal of fractured instruments or other foreign bodies which have become tightly wedged within the root canal. The procedure for removal will vary depending on the nature of the foreign body. In this article the authors provide a step-by-step guide to the necessary techniques.","2541":"It is increasingly recognized that the provision of dental care should not be seen in isolation from the psychological make-up and social background of the patient. The General Dental Council has recently approved the report of its Working Party giving guidance on the teaching of the behavioural sciences (psychology and sociology) in the dental curriculum. One of the members of the Working Party was Professor Keith Millar. In this five-part series edited by Professor Millar we will cover the practical application of behavioural science in dentistry, covering communication with patients, ways to change your patients' behaviour, the management of anxious adult and child patients, and stress in dentistry. This first article offers some advice on coping with the nervous child.","2542":"No single regime has proved to be totally successful in reducing the pain and swelling that frequently follow extraction of wisdom teeth. In this review the author examines the regimes that are currently used, assesses the evidence for their efficacy, and makes some practical recommendations.","2543":"Although many hospital-based specialists will be involved in the management of cleft lip and palate patients, the GDP plays a key role in the preservation of the dentition with its supporting alveolar bone. Without this, the ideal treatment objectives of improved aesthetics, good speech, good function and positive self-image of the patient cannot be achieved.","2544":"","2545":"This report describes a conservative and preventive approach to the treatment of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl who presented with a severely compromised dentition. Clinical management was complicated by the fact that the patient had a ventricular septal defect that would require prophylactic antibiotic cover for any extractions.","2546":"With an ageing population, and greater government emphasis on \"Care in the Community\", domiciliary visiting may become an increasingly important part of the GDP's repertoire. Domiciliary visits take the dentist out of the controlled surgery setting, and require careful preparation and some social adeptness if the clinical objectives are to be achieved. In this article the author discusses the issues and offers some practical advice.","2547":"From time to time the general dental practitioner may become involved in forensic cases, when he or she will need to be aware of the general principles involved and the increasing variety of modern techniques available. This two-part article reviews those principles and techniques. In Part 1 the principal procedures used in identifying bodies were discussed. Part 2 now reviews the role of the forensic dentist with respect to non-accidental injury to children, analysis of bite marks, and archaeological investigations.","2548":"Pathology is a discipline that is often approached with some reserve by nonpathologists. In this four-part series the author aims to 'demystify' the subject. The objective of this first article is to improve understanding of the purposes, limitations and methodology of pathology. In essence the role of the diagnostic histopathologist is to help the clinician help the patient. If, in the request for help, the clinician states clearly why a histological examination is required and gives a relevant history, the pathologist finds it much easier to return a useful report. The subsequent three articles in this series will look in some detail at biopsy techniques, the pathologist's report and special laboratory investigations.","2549":"Both amalgam and composite have limitations as core materials. Cermet cements, with their ease of preparation and placement, cariostatic effect, and adhesion to tooth substance, have some advantages over both of these commonly used materials. This article reviews the suitability of glass-ionomer\/cermets for use in building up cores on posterior teeth, and provides a guide to the clinical technique.","2550":"Society is becoming more litigious, and dentistry has not been exempt. However, by following correct and prudent professional procedures at all times, dentists may sensibly expect to avoid serious litigation. In the first of an irregular series on dento-legal topics, Bernard Smith reviews the thorny subject of negligence in dentistry, and gives advice on both how to prevent and how to respond to accusations. Other articles in the series will look at particular legal problems in the dental specialties.","2551":"A case is reported of actinomyces being isolated histologically from an enlarged dental follicle surrounding a partially erupted, impacted third molar. This allowed prophylactic therapy to prevent the possible development of cervicofacial actinomycosis.","2552":"","2553":"This article presents the results of a patient questionnaire on response to minor oral surgery carried out under local anaesthetic and intravenous sedation. The predominantly favourable response of the respondents leads the author to suggest the use of IV sedation as a means of reducing patient anxiety, and so increasing dental attendance.","2554":"It has been common practice for many years to use retained roots to provide support and stability for partial or full dentures. The retention of such overdentures is greatly enhanced if the remaining roots are modified and restored with posts and root-face attachments. The final article in this series on root canal retained restorations classifies and describes some of the root-face attachments currently available, and also describes a number of prefabricated post systems with integral overdenture attachments. Guidelines for clinical and laboratory procedures are given.","2555":"Plaque is generally accepted as the prime agent in the aetiology of gingivitis and caries. However, it has been estimated that the oral microbial load must be reduced by some 99.9% in order to produce a significant effect on plaque formation--and mechanical tooth cleaning alone is unlikely to achieve this. Considerable effort has therefore been put into researching chemical means of controlling plaque. In the final article of this eight-part series, the author reviews the efficacy and modes of action of the chemical agents currently available.","2556":"Occlusal splints\/night guards can be an effective, inexpensive and reversible treatment for a wide range of dental problems. The author describes their clinical uses, discusses some of the rationales that have been given for these uses, and outlines the designs that have the widest clinical application.","2557":"From time to time the general dental practitioner may become involved in forensic cases, when he or she will need to be aware of the general principles involved and the increasing variety of modern techniques available. This two-part article reviews those principles and techniques. In Part 1 procedures used in identifying bodies are discussed. Part 2 will concentrate on non-accidental injury to children and analysis of bite marks, and discuss archaeological investigations.","2558":"","2559":"","2560":"","2561":"","2562":"","2563":"","2564":"","2565":"","2566":"","2567":"","2568":"","2569":"","2570":"","2571":"The newer glass\/cermet cements possess improved physical properties compared with the original glass-ionomers. The author proposes taking advantage of these improved properties, in a novel use for cermets, in the temporary splinting of traumatized teeth.","2572":"A 14-year-old patient suffering from congenital absence of almost her entire permanent dentition was referred by her GDP. Management of the case required an integrated orthodontic and restorative approach. The authors describe how the imaginative use of a combination of relatively simple techniques achieved a greatly improved dental appearance for the patient.","2573":"The cause of delayed eruption is usually obvious and treatable (as with lack of space or impeding supernumerary teeth). However, in some cases there is no obvious cause. Treatment of these cases might be easier if we fully understood the mechanism of eruption itself. Unfortunately, the precise process of generating the eruptive force for teeth has not yet been fully elucidated. Various hypotheses have been put forward. In this article the author reviews current theories, and describes some of the experimental difficulties in testing them.","2574":"There is a paucity of thorough research on society's reaction to dentofacial anomalies, or to other forms of facial disfigurement. The author reviews the studies of the social effects of dental appearance that do exist, and then reports some results of his own researches into reaction to facial disfigurement. It appears from these studies that facial disfigurement (including dentofacial anomalies) can indeed be a cause of social disadvantage.","2575":"The most commonly discussed methods of caries control are use of fluoride, fissure sealing and toothbrushing. In fact, dietary control can be more effective than any of these. Studies have shown that if there is no sugar in the diet, then caries can be virtually eliminated. This article reviews the evidence, and offers guidance for the GDP giving dietary advice.","2576":"Inhalation sedation can be a remarkably safe and effective method of managing patients' anxiety. In the first part of this two-part article the author reviewed the principles of the procedure. In Part 2 he gives a detailed practical guide to the technique, incorporating the subtle changes that have been developed over the last ten years. In particular, current recommendations on patient assessment are described, and the clinical assessment of patients undergoing sedation is emphasized. The modern recommendations for monitoring are given, with emphasis placed on the need for clinical monitoring by both the dental surgeon and the dental surgery assistant. The need to exercise caution at all stages of administration of the technique is reiterated.","2577":"The first article in this series reviews general considerations relating to the use of root canal retained restorations. The authors discuss factors affecting retention, the arguments for cast versus wrought posts, reinforcement of the tooth, and treatment planning. Clinical procedures for constructing custom-made cast posts and cores, using direct and indirect techniques, are also described. The three subsequent articles will deal with threaded and unthreaded prefabricated post-and-core systems, and root-face attachments for the retention of complete and partial overdentures.","2578":"","2579":"This report describes the replacement of both upper canine teeth in a young woman patient by means of resin-bonded bridges. While essentially simple, this case demonstrates the importance of careful assessment and planning to achieve the best potential for long-term success.","2580":"Modern materials offer great promise in the aesthetic restoration of teeth. However, their performance in practice may not fulfil this promise. This is often because of inadequate understanding of the scientific principles behind the new materials, leading to misuse. In Part 1 of this article the author reviewed some of the physical properties of composites, and explained both their proper use and their limitations. In Part 2 he looks at dentine adhesives and glass-ionomer cements.","2581":"Mottling of teeth can have significant psychological impact on patients--particularly on adolescents, who may be subjected to much unkind teasing. A number of procedures have been suggested for removal of mottling and stains. The authors describe a simple and quick technique using a paste of hydrochloric acid and pumice, and on the basis of their clinical and laboratory experience suggest it as a treatment of first choice.","2582":"Britain, along with many other developed countries, has experienced a dramatic decline in prevalence of dental caries. This has been attributed to the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes, which has done much to improve children's dental health. Studies indicate that fluoridation of water supplies would confer an additional benefit to dental public health, while other fluoride vehicles (mouthrinses, topical gels and varnishes, tablets and drops) are valuable in preventing caries in high-risk patients. The authors review the issues involved.","2583":"In recent years manufacturers have responded to an increase in endodontic treatments by developing a number of new products. New techniques have also been introduced. In this two-part article the author critically reviews these developments. In Part 1 he looked at diagnosis of endodontic problems and at root canal preparation techniques. In Part 2 he now examines file designs together with techniques for root canal obturation.","2584":"Inhalation sedation with low-to-moderate concentrations of nitrous oxide in oxygen has a remarkable safety record--in over 45 years of use there has not been any mortality or serious morbidity recorded. It is not surprising therefore that the use of the technique is increasing steadily, as it has been shown to be an effective method of managing patients' anxiety. In this two-part article the author explains the procedure. In Part 1 he reviews the principles of relative analgesia: describing the characteristics of the different planes of sedation, the mechanism of uptake and elimination of nitrous oxide, and the need for scavenging. In Part 2 he will give a detailed practical guide to the modern technique, incorporating the subtle changes that have been developed over the last ten years.","2585":"In recent years manufacturers have responded to an increase in endodontic treatments by developing a number of new products.

In Part 1 he looks at diagnosis of endodontic problems and outlines root canal preparation techniques. In Part 2 he will examine file designs and techniques for root canal obturation.","2586":"Many adolescent patients go through phases where oral hygiene and caries control lapse. In this case a young patient presented with a severely compromised mouth. Treatment was complicated by his belonging to a travelling family, and the fact that he was also undergoing orthodontic therapy. This study describes how suitable behaviour management techniques were used to motivate him to achieve control of caries and periodontal disease, and allow the orthodontic treatment to proceed.","2587":"The prevention of disfigurement from loss of or damage to a permanent incisor must be the aim in any caring society. The authors review the options for prevention of trauma, and conclude that the dentist can be of most practical assistance in two ways: by early reduction of pronounced overjets where appropriate, and especially by provision of well-fitting mouthguards for use in sports. The article continues with a critical appraisal of commercial forms of mouthguard, and gives a step-by-step guide to constructing a custom-made mouthguard.","2588":"Internal bleaching can be a simple, economic and effective method for improving the appearance of discoloured non-vital teeth. The authors give a step-by-step guide to the 'walking bleach' technique, and describe how to avoid the most common potential complications of bleaching.","2589":"Modern materials offer great promise in the aesthetic restoration of teeth. However, their performance in practice may not fulfil this promise. This is often because of inadequate understanding of the scientific principles behind the new materials, leading to misuse. In this two-part article the author reviews some of the physical properties of the new materials, and explains both their proper use and their limitations. Part 1 examines the composites, Part 2 will look at dentine adhesives and glass-ionomers.","2590":"Crown loss is a frequent problem, and it is often compounded, particularly in the elderly, by fracture of the underlying natural core. Reconstructing the core in either amalgam or composite resin can have disadvantages. This article suggests a method for constructing replacement cores at one visit using glass-ionomer cements.","2591":"The previous articles in this series have reviewed the particular problems characteristic of the ageing dentition. The increase in the elderly population, together with the undoubted significant reduction in juvenile and adult caries, has led many to question the continued appropriateness of the current nature and level of dental provision. Some authorities have suggested that the needs of the increasing number of elderly patients will still ensure full dental employment, albeit with an emphasis on different forms of treatment. In this concluding article of the series Aubrey Sheiham gives his view.","2592":"Modern orthognathic surgical procedures allow correction of bony disproportion in almost any part of the face, but are limited in the fine tuning of tooth position and occlusion. However, carefully planned combined surgical and orthodontic treatment can produce dental and skeletal results of a high standard. If a GDP is presented with a malocclusion beyond the scope of normal orthodontic treatment, then referral to an oral surgery\/orthodontic clinic is indicated. This article provides an overview of what the team on such a clinic can achieve.","2593":"Oral cancer is a serious disease with a poor prognosis, particularly with the all-too-frequent late presentation. Dental practitioners have an important role to play in prevention of the disease. They can contribute both in primary prevention, by educating their patients about risk factors, and in secondary prevention, by early diagnosis and referral. In this article the author discusses the issues involved.","2594":"Glass-ionomer cements have unique and varied properties: they are tough, translucent, biologically inert, resistant to degradation in the mouth, adhesive to tooth structure and they inhibit caries. In a number of ways they are probably the one substance available today that most approaches the ideal restorative material. In Part 1 of this two-part article the authors reviewed the physical and clinical properties of glass-ionomer cements, here they go on to describe their use in practical and sometimes novel restorative procedures.","2595":"","2596":"","2597":"","2598":"","2599":"","2600":"Proper planning of a course of treatment for the older patient will form the basis of success. Treatment planning is a stringent test of clinical acumen: requiring consideration of what the patient desires, what the patient can tolerate and what can be achieved. In this article the authors outline the principles of treatment planning for the ageing patient.","2601":"In this series of three articles the authors describe some of the principles and practice of osseointegrated implants. Part 1 gave a detailed description of the surgical techniques to establish osseointegrated implants (with special reference to the Branemark system), guidance on patient selection and treatment planning. Part 2 described prosthetic rehabilitation using osseointegrated implant fixtures. This article concludes the series by presenting a number of case studies.","2602":"The authors report two cases of white sponge naevus in the same family, where the condition had clearly been inherited by the daughter from her mother. The positive family history aided correct diagnosis of this entirely benign lesion.","2603":"The authors describe a case in which an elderly patient, who had previously been treated for trigeminal neuralgia, developed a subsequent fracture of the mandible at the site of a further trigger point. This presented difficulty in management of the case, and the necessary treatment is reviewed.","2604":"Craniofacial pain can be one of the more intractable problems that presents to the GDP. One management route can be referral to a specialist pain relief unit, where the facilities and expertise will be available for diagnosis, counselling, drug management and invasive therapy. In this article the authors describe the results achieved at one such unit, over a one-year period, for a group of 34 craniofacial pain sufferers. At the end of the year 30 patients reported total or partial relief from their pain.","2605":"","2606":"Dramatic progress over the past ten years in adhesive composite and glass ionomer materials has made possible innovative, minimal cavity designs. These designs, by conserving tooth tissue, maximize the strength of the remaining structure and facilitate the aesthetic preservation of the patient's own dentition. The author gives a critical review of some of the new techniques that have been proposed.","2607":"A Joint Working Group of the WHO and FDI was formed in 1981 to investigate the dramatic decrease in caries in children and young people that had been observed in a number of industrialized countries in the 1970s. The results of this investigation are reported in this series of three articles. Parts 1 and 2 described the assembly and analysis of all available data on the decrease, and identified the widespread availability of fluoride toothpaste as the most probable cause. Inevitably in developed countries with declining caries incidence there will be a decreased need for dental services, and hence a change in the need for dental personnel. This third article will examine the likely effects on staffing needs and outline a suggested methodology for manpower planning. The lack of adequate data makes prediction a precarious procedure, and this review indicates the urgent need for regular dental health monitoring and better manpower planning in all countries.","2608":"In this series of three articles the authors describe some of the principles and practice of osseointegrated implants. Part 1 gave a detailed description of the surgical techniques required to establish osseointegrated implant fixtures (with special reference to the Branemark system), and gave guidance on patient selection and treatment planning. Part 2 now considers prosthetic rehabilitation techniques with osseointegrated implants for complete dentures, complete overdentures, partial bridges, and single tooth replacement cases. Part 3 will conclude the series by presenting a number of case studies.","2609":"Consumption of low pH drinks has been steadily increasing, resulting in a number of instances of dental erosion. Such cases can easily be mistaken for attrition, abrasion or development abnormality, delaying proper treatment. In the example reported here the authors describe how differential diagnosis and dietary analysis were used to identify erosion as the cause of enamel loss, and the subsequent successful management of the case.","2610":"A case of a 55-year-old man with an unusually large asymptomatic stone (3.5 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm) lying in the Wharton's duct is presented.","2611":"The treatment of the elderly edentulous patient offers a challenge to the practitioner. The provision of complete dentures for this group of people may be difficult and time consuming, and success is not always attainable. It is important to recognize that any changes made to existing prostheses should be made gradually, in order to allow the patient to adapt.","2612":"","2613":"As more people keep their teeth later in life, more and more patients in the future will still be partially dentate at an age when, previously, the edentulous state was the norm. The overdenture has a part to play in restorative dentistry for these patients. It can be a relatively simple, inexpensive prosthesis; but, like so many other aspects of dentistry, will provide long-term success only if the patient and the mouth have been assessed with care and a rigorous after-care programme instituted.","2614":"A Joint Working Group of the WHO and FDI was formed in 1981 to investigate the dramatic decrease in caries in children and young people that had been observed in a number of industrialized countries in the 1970s. The results of this investigation are reported in this series of three articles. Part 1 described the assembly and analysis of all available data from 20 selected countries. Nine developed countries showed substantial++ reductions in caries. The most probable reasons for these reductions will be examined here. These included: widespread exposure to fluoride in the form of fluoridated water, fluoride supplements and fluoridated toothpaste; the provision of preventive dental health services; increased dental awareness through organized education programmes; and ready access to dental services. Comparison with Japan, which has not experienced a similar reduction in caries, indicates that the single most important factor was the availability of fluoride toothpaste. The possible effects on dental manpower needs of a declining caries incidence will be discussed in Part 3.","2615":"The natural mechanisms of eruption, mesial migration, soft tissue pressure and occlusal forces can be used by the dentist to treat malocclusion in the growing child. The author describes how planned extractions of deciduous and permanent teeth can be employed to resolve crowding, promote spontaneous alignment, and avoid centreline displacement.","2616":"In this series of three articles the authors describe some of the principles and practice of osseointegrated implants. Part 1 gives a detailed description of the surgical techniques required to establish osseointegrated implant fixtures (with special reference to the Branemark system). The article then gives guidance on patient selection and treatment planning. Part 2 will go on to consider prosthetic rehabilitation using osseointegrated implant fixtures. Part 3 will conclude the series by presenting a number of case studies.","2617":"The success of most forms of dental treatment is dependent on the wise choice and good manipulation of materials. A vast range of new products has become available, leading to types of treatment that were not dreamed of a generation ago. This paper reviews those products and procedures.","2618":"Practitioners should always consider the possibility of an odontoma when the eruption of teeth is delayed. The authors report an example of compound odontoma associated with delayed eruption of incisor teeth, and describe the surgical and orthodontic management of the case.","2619":"Self-inflicted tooth modification other than ritual mutilation practised in some countries is a rare occurrence. The author reports a case of aggravated loss of tooth structure where a patient has contributed to loss of tooth structure by the novel method of adjusting his natural teeth with a 'knife'. Subsequent management of the case is discussed.","2620":"This is the second of two articles concerning the practical techniques involved in reconstruction of the worn dentition. Part 1 discussed approaches to managing occlusion, and practical techniques for restoring worn anterior teeth. This second article will describe the procedures involved when both anterior and posterior teeth are worn, and then give a guide to the management of the short clinical crown.","2621":"A Joint Working Group of the WHO and FDI was formed in 1981 to investigate the dramatic decrease in caries in children and young people that had been observed in a number of industrialized countries in the 1970s. The results of this investigation are reported in this series of 3 articles. Part 1 describes the assembly and analysis of all available data on oral health, sugar consumption, fluoride availability and other preventive programmes from 20 selected countries. These data showed that nine developed countries had achieved substantial reductions in caries (25-60%) in 5- and 12-year-old children. The most probable reasons will be examined in Part 2, where it will be concluded that the single most important factor was the availability of fluoride toothpaste. The possible effects on dental manpower needs of a declining caries incidence will be discussed in Part 3.","2622":"","2623":"Recent advances in therapy mean that prompt diagnosis of AIDS can prolong the life of those infected. Hairy leukoplakia is a new clinical entity that is one of the early signs of HIV seropositivity, and the GDP is well placed to recognize this lesion and refer patients on for treatment. In this second article in the twice-yearly Aids Commentary series the author describes how to diagnose this new condition, and the treatments that are available.","2624":"The preventive resin restoration has become an accepted dental procedure, but, more recently, glass ionomer has been suggested as a material suitable for this technique. The advantages of glass ionomers, such as bonding to enamel and dentine, and fluoride release, are considerable, but the disadvantages, such as poor wear resistance, may make them unsuitable for restorations in occlusal contact. The author discusses the use of glass ionomer cements in the treatment of initial carious lesions.","2625":"In response to interest from readers the authors provide an update of their 1986 papers on coping with medical emergencies in dental practice. In particular they review drug regimes and the technique of cricothyroidostomy.","2626":"This is the first of two articles concerning the practical techniques involved in reconstruction of the worn dentition. The authors describe some of the procedures available and assess the appropriateness of 'conformative' versus 'reorganized' approaches to the occlusion.

OC preparations containing estrogen and progestogen inhibit ovulation by an action on the hypothalamus.  Progestogen also produces local effects on the endometrium, cervical mucus and possibly uterine tubes.  A number of drugs commonly used by dentists reduce OC effectiveness.  Pregnancies have been reported among OC users taking ampicillin and tetracycline, which are suspected to interfere with the enterohepatic recirculation of steroids or enzyme induction.  Phenoxymethylpenicillin should also be used with caution.  Breakthrough bleeding and pregnancy have been associated with chlordiazepoxide.  Antihistamines and carbamazepine may also reduce OC effectiveness.  OCs may increase sensitivity to pethidine and reduce serum cholinesterase levels.  5% of the dental patients in Great Britain may be taking OCs and dentists should inform patients of possible drug interactions.  OC overdose has been associated with hypertrophic gingivitis, marked gingival erythema, bleeding and pregnancy-type epulis.  In normal doses, they may cause gingivitis with an increase in gingival exudate and in the number of inflamed papillae.  In general, clinical manifestations of OC use are nonexistent or minimal.  An increased incidence of postoperative localized osteitis following the removal of mandibular 3rd molars in patients taking OCs is reported and could be avoided if surgery was done prior to the use of OCs or possibly was conducted during a period of abstinence.  Menstrually related oral ulceration has been successfully treated with OCs, however, this treatment is suggested only following definitive diagnosis.","3006":"","3007":"","3008":"","3009":"","3010":"","3011":"","3012":"","3013":"","3014":"","3015":"","3016":"","3017":"","3018":"","3019":"","3020":"","3021":"","3022":"","3023":"","3024":"","3025":"","3026":"","3027":"","3028":"","3029":"","3030":"","3031":"","3032":"","3033":"","3034":"","3035":"","3036":"","3037":"","3038":"","3039":"","3040":"","3041":"","3042":"","3043":"","3044":"","3045":"","3046":"","3047":"","3048":"","3049":"","3050":"","3051":"","3052":"","3053":"","3054":"","3055":"","3056":"","3057":"","3058":"","3059":"","3060":"","3061":"","3062":"","3063":"","3064":"","3065":"","3066":"","3067":"","3068":"","3069":"","3070":"","3071":"","3072":"","3073":"","3074":"","3075":"","3076":"","3077":"","3078":"","3079":"","3080":"","3081":"","3082":"","3083":"","3084":"","3085":"","3086":"","3087":"","3088":"","3089":"","3090":"","3091":"","3092":"","3093":"","3094":"","3095":"","3096":"","3097":"","3098":"","3099":"","3100":"","3101":"","3102":"","3103":"","3104":"","3105":"","3106":"","3107":"","3108":"","3109":"","3110":"","3111":"","3112":"","3113":"","3114":"","3115":"","3116":"","3117":"","3118":"","3119":"","3120":"","3121":"","3122":"","3123":"","3124":"","3125":"","3126":"","3127":"","3128":"","3129":"","3130":"","3131":"","3132":"","3133":"","3134":"","3135":"","3136":"","3137":"","3138":"","3139":"","3140":"","3141":"","3142":"","3143":"","3144":"","3145":"","3146":"","3147":"","3148":"","3149":"","3150":"","3151":"","3152":"","3153":"","3154":"","3155":"","3156":"","3157":"","3158":"","3159":"","3160":"","3161":"","3162":"","3163":"","3164":"","3165":"","3166":"","3167":"","3168":"","3169":"","3170":"","3171":"","3172":"","3173":"","3174":"","3175":"","3176":"","3177":"","3178":"","3179":"","3180":"","3181":"","3182":"","3183":"","3184":"","3185":"","3186":"","3187":"","3188":"","3189":"","3190":"","3191":"","3192":"","3193":"","3194":"","3195":"","3196":"","3197":"","3198":"","3199":"","3200":"","3201":"","3202":"","3203":"","3204":"","3205":"","3206":"","3207":"","3208":"","3209":"","3210":"","3211":"","3212":"","3213":"","3214":"","3215":"","3216":"","3217":"","3218":"","3219":"","3220":"","3221":"","3222":"","3223":"","3224":"","3225":"","3226":"","3227":"","3228":"","3229":"","3230":"","3231":"","3232":"","3233":"","3234":"","3235":"","3236":"","3237":"","3238":"","3239":"","3240":"","3241":"","3242":"","3243":"","3244":"","3245":"","3246":"","3247":"","3248":""},"articletitle":{"0":null,"1":"Clinical Challenges Q&amp;A 31.
