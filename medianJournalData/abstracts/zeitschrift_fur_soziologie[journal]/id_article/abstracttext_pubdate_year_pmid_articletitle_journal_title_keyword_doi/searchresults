These explanations do not allow for the fact that migration decisions are frequently made by whole families. In this context, the increasing labor force participation of married women is assumed to be one important reason for declining migration rates in Germany. In this paper, the relative effect of different job characteristics of men and women on the labor migration of double income households is examined using German household panel data (GSOEP). We find a sex related bias in family decision-making, which cannot be accounted for by classical microeconomic models of family migration. Sociological approaches to household decision-making emphasizing the importance of sex role ideologies held by family members can therefore be considered useful complements to purely economic models.\" (EXCERPT)","1":"\"In an empirical analysis the article investigates the intergenerational transmission of divorce risk with multivariate event-history techniques using data on the 10,000 respondents of the German Family Survey. In both younger and older cohorts the transmission effect is confirmed. Surprisingly, however, there are huge sex differences in the impact of parents' divorces on their children.  Sons of divorced parents have a much higher risk of divorce than girls.... The transmission effect cannot be explained by the decreased standard of living typically observed in all types of single-parent families. The data suggest, however, that differences in intervening variables may partially explain the transmission effect.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","2":"\"The development of internal migration in the Federal Republic of Germany during the last few decades shows that commuting is becoming more and more a substitute for moves over long distances.... This paper tries to explain this 'mobility transition' by means of a model of individual choice between commuting and moving.  The model is also able to account for changes in structural components.  The decision-model is empirically tested by using methods of event history analysis with the data of the Socio-Economic Panel.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","3":"\"This paper investigates how education influences marriage behavior in three countries: the United States, West Germany, and former East Germany. Following family economics we postulate that for women a longer education decreases marriage rates both during education (institutional effect) and after the degree has been obtained (human capital effect). For men family economics predicts the delaying institutional effect, too, but the human capital effect is expected to increase marriage rates. Further considerations lead to the additional hypothesis that for younger birth cohorts these sex differences should attenuate.... For the United States and West Germany the observed marriage patterns confirm our hypotheses for the most part. For East Germany, however, we observe different marriage patterns. This was expected because the institutional context in this former socialist country was a very different one.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","4":"The connection between the socioeconomic organization of village of origin and the process of assimilation of migrants in places which were targets of their ambition has been studied only recently,  In Peru, which is characterized by a strong internal migration to the capital Lima, this problem was conceptualized as 1) migrants arrive as individuals, and 2) migrants arrive within a process of collective immigration which is determined by the socioeconomic setup of their villages of origin.  The example of two mountain villages is presented to analyze these theories.  Santiago de Quinches had 1810 inhabitants as a regional center in 1940, but the number declined to 1454 in 1961 and to 850 in 1987 as a result of migration to Lima where in the 1980s more than 2000 of the former villagers lived.  The main reasons for migration was education, work, and family as well as population pressure, shortage of resources, and tense social relations.  More than 50% were active in trade, selling meat in the main market in Lima, owing to close ties with their original village.  The other village was San Miguel de Vichaycocha where the principal livelihood was animal husbandry.  In 1940, the population numbered 576 an in 1988 slightly less 496.  Since the 1950s, villagers had moved to Lima, and in the 1960s, some of them established themselves in the central market of Lima as textile merchants, a few even becoming rich in the early 1970s.  In the late 1980s, 35% of 238 migrants were in the textile trade, 15% in other commerce, and 11% in professions.  The presumption that migrants from the mountains arrived in Lima as poor individuals without contacts is accurate.  On the other hand, the thesis of collective migration, based by its proponents on the social organization of the Andes, the community, is also erroneous.  It seems to be correct, though, that migration was an action taken by individuals affected by the socioeconomic and political makeup of the villages of origin.","5":"\"Though changes in values have been analysed [for] two decades, their impact on actual behaviour has almost been neglected.  This especially is the case with values concerning marriage and the family which [have been] responsible for behavioural changes.  Here, the impact of emerging postmaterialistic values on fertility are analysed, deriving from the assumption that the effect of children on the general life-style is large enough to let fertility behaviour be influenced by general value orientations. The main result is that the emergence of postmaterialism has led to postponement of parenthood whereas the number of children is left untouched.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","6":"\"In this article, factors affecting the probability of the birth of a second child are investigated.  In particular, changes in the structure of the individual decision process of family formation in the FRG [Federal Republic of Germany] during the last decades are discussed.  We contest the thesis of a trend towards the predominance of the one-child family and instead argue that with increased individual autonomy in the decision of family formation and fertility behavior couples either decide against having children or, more frequently, choose to have more than one child.  While the former phenomenon is already well known, in this article the latter is shown to be empirically valid as well.  There are hints that this pattern of 'polarization' in the process of family formation will increasingly be established in the future.\" (SUMMARY IN ENG)","7":"A cohort analysis of the factors affecting age at first birth in the Federal Republic of Germany is presented.  The impact of educational status and social class is examined for cohorts born in 1929-1931, 1939-1941, and 1949-1951.  The results indicate that the decline in fertility since the 1960s is related to a significant increase in female participation in vocational training programs.  A sharp increase in voluntary childlessness among women with higher education is also noted. (SUMMARY IN ENG)","8":"This article is a review of research on mass migration from the Soviet Occupied Zone and the German Democratic Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany during the 1950s.  The various official sources of migration statistics are first described, and the extent of politically motivated migration is assessed.  The sociological consequences of this migration are then examined, and individual migration motives are briefly considered.","9":"\"This study tests the feasibility of describing household and family structure by means of survey data.  Rather than presenting new results, it focuses on alternative ways of obtaining information on the social structure.  A typology of households and families is formulated and empirically reconstructed using data from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) of 1982; the results are compared with official data from the 1981 'microcensus'.  There is a remarkable correspondence between the ALLBUS data and those from the 'microcensus'.  This result--along with a range of more general advantages--demonstrates the potential of survey data for social structural analysis, especially for the analysis of household and family structure.\"  (summary in ENG)","10":"This statement concerning population censuses has been prepared at the request of the board of directors of the German Sociological Society in light of the controversy surrounding the 1983 census in the Federal Republic of Germany.  It is suggested that sample surveys cannot replace a census, a census is indispensable as a data source for regional analyses and studies of small population groups, a census must be carried out in a way that preserves the confidentiality of data, and census data must be accessible to scientific research.","11":"The author attempts to show that the extended family was characteristic of Hungary in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Major types and variants of family forms are first described, and their distribution is examined.  Factors contributing to the development and dissolution of the extended family are then discussed, including economic and geographic relationships, the inheritance system, religion, colonization, tradition, and marriage customs. The inner hierarchy, distribution of power, and division of labor within the extended family are also described","12":"The author investigates the significance of the variable \"length of stay\" as a factor in the integration of migrants, particularly labor migrants.  Various aspects of integration are examined, including status attainment, language knowledge, housing quality, desegregation, inter-ethnic contact, and ethnic identification.  Causal models of integration are tested"},"articletitle":{"0":"[Vocationally motivated migration behavior in double-income households.
