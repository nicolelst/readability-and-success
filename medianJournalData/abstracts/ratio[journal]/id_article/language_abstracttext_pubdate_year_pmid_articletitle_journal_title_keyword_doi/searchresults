{"articleID":{"0":0,"1":1},"abstracttext":{"0":"This paper aims at resolving a puzzle about the persuasiveness of bootstrapping. On the one hand, bootstrapping is not a persuasive method of settling questions about the reliability of a source. On the other hand, our beliefs that our sense apparatus is reliable is based on other empirically formed beliefs, that is, they are acquired via a presumably complex bootstrapping process. I will argue that when we doubt the reliability of a source, bootstrapping is not a persuasive method for coming to believe that the source is reliable. However, when being initially unaware of a source and its reliability, as in the case of forming beliefs about our sense apparatus, bootstrapping can be eventually persuasive.","1":"We begin by describing recent developments in the burgeoning discipline of applied ontology, focusing especially on the ways ontologies are providing a means for the consistent representation of scientific data. We then introduce Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), a top-level ontology that is serving as domain-neutral framework for the development of lower level ontologies in many specialist disciplines, above all in biology and medicine. BFO is a bicategorial ontology, embracing both three-dimensionalist (continuant) and four-dimensionalist (occurrent) perspectives within a single framework. We examine how BFO-conformant domain ontologies can deal with the consistent representation of scientific data deriving from the measurement of processes of different types, and we outline on this basis the first steps of an approach to the classification of such processes within the BFO framework.1."},"articletitle":{"0":"The persuasiveness puzzle about bootstrapping.","1":"CLASSIFYING PROCESSES: AN ESSAY IN APPLIED ONTOLOGY."},"doi":{"0":"","1":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Ratio","1":"Ratio"},"keyword":{"0":"Mooreanismbootstrappingdoubtingpersuasivenessreasoning","1":""},"language":{"0":"eng","1":"eng"},"pmid":{"0":32103840,"1":23888086},"pubdate_year":{"0":2020,"1":2012}}
